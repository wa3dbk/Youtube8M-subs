00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.090 

there's<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.280> lake<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:01.540> we're<00:03:02.080> there<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630

here<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.050> gotta<00:03:14.320> figure<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.710> which<00:03:14.920> way

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
here we just gotta figure out which way

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.680 
here we just gotta figure out which way
they're<00:03:15.400> going<00:03:17.370> anytime<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> fork<00:03:19.150> we<00:03:19.360> find

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
they're going anytime at a fork we find

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.280 
they're going anytime at a fork we find
a<00:03:19.810> very<00:03:20.110> good<00:03:20.340> three<00:03:21.340> or<00:03:21.370> four<00:03:21.959> prints<00:03:22.959> going

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
a very good three or four prints going

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.040 
a very good three or four prints going
in<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:23.470> certain<00:03:23.680> direction<00:03:24.330> quite<00:03:25.330> often<00:03:25.510> it's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
in a certain direction quite often it's

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.080 
in a certain direction quite often it's
it's<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.560> ruse<00:03:26.770> to<00:03:26.800> try<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.820> go

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
it's a ruse to try and get you to go

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.840 
it's a ruse to try and get you to go
that<00:03:28.300> way<00:03:28.450> really<00:03:28.690> fast<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.350> lose<00:03:30.220> time<00:03:30.610> and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
that way really fast and lose time and

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.000 
that way really fast and lose time and
that's<00:03:31.480> when<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:31.780> want<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.110> go<00:03:32.260> double<00:03:32.530> slow

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
that's when you want to go double slow

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.699 
that's when you want to go double slow
and<00:03:33.340> make<00:03:33.850> sure<00:03:34.090> because<00:03:34.530> sometimes<00:03:35.530> they're

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
and make sure because sometimes they're

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.510 
and make sure because sometimes they're
trying<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:35.980> trick<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.340> he's<00:03:37.120> onto<00:03:37.360> them

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
trying to trick you he's onto them

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.070 
trying to trick you he's onto them
and<00:03:38.640> there's<00:03:38.820> something<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.270> got<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> look<00:03:39.750> at<00:03:39.960> it

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
and there's something I got a look at it

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.670 
and there's something I got a look at it
right<00:03:40.200> there

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
right there

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.410 
right there
and<00:03:42.680> we've<00:03:42.890> got<00:03:43.129> a<00:03:43.159> spot<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.579> mud<00:03:43.939> missing

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
and we've got a spot of mud missing

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.050 
and we've got a spot of mud missing
right<00:03:44.599> here<00:03:44.959> so<00:03:45.560> they<00:03:45.739> come<00:03:46.129> off<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.489> side<00:03:46.760> hit

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
right here so they come off the side hit

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.530 
right here so they come off the side hit
those<00:03:47.269> dicks<00:03:48.189> jump<00:03:49.189> their<00:03:50.140> feet<00:03:51.140> thick<00:03:52.540> right

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
those dicks jump their feet thick right

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.179 
those dicks jump their feet thick right
here<00:03:53.569> they've<00:03:53.959> tried<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.200> hit<00:03:54.469> that<00:03:54.680> rock<00:03:54.950> and

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
here they've tried to hit that rock and

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.020 
here they've tried to hit that rock and
myth<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.799> then<00:03:57.950> they<00:03:58.099> probably<00:03:58.370> jump<00:03:58.819> back

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
myth and then they probably jump back

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.679 
myth and then they probably jump back
onto<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.510> side<00:04:00.400> they're<00:04:01.400> doing<00:04:01.670> well<00:04:01.909> they're

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
them I was gonna get worried I wasn't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.730 
them I was gonna get worried I wasn't
sure<00:04:23.270> you<00:04:23.810> know<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.169> we<00:04:24.320> were<00:04:24.380> gonna<00:04:24.530> have<00:04:24.590> to

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
sure you know if we were gonna have to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.900 
sure you know if we were gonna have to
pack<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:24.949> in<00:04:27.190> at<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.310> point<00:04:28.580> also<00:04:28.759> we

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
pack it in at that point also we

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.370 
pack it in at that point also we
realized<00:04:29.330> if<00:04:29.509> we<00:04:29.630> have<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.810> hide<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.169> bush

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
realized if we have to hide in the bush

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.210 
realized if we have to hide in the bush
we're<00:04:30.830> doomed

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
we're doomed

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.680 
we're doomed
because<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:31.639> can't<00:04:31.880> sit<00:04:32.120> still<00:04:32.330> in<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.449> bush

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
because we can't sit still in the bush

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.870 
because we can't sit still in the bush
to<00:04:33.500> wait<00:04:33.650> for<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:33.889> horse<00:04:34.099> to<00:04:34.160> go<00:04:34.370> by<00:04:34.520> anymore

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
to wait for a horse to go by anymore

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.089 
to wait for a horse to go by anymore
we're<00:04:35.030> too<00:04:35.210> cold<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.900> just<00:04:36.080> sit<00:04:36.259> still<00:04:36.349> so

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
we're too cold to just sit still so

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.409 
we're too cold to just sit still so
early<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:39.020> they're<00:04:39.979> cold<00:04:40.340> but<00:04:40.970> their<00:04:41.120> drive
