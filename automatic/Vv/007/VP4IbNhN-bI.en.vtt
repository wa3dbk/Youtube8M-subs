the power cord from the computer and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.740 
the power cord from the computer and
ground<00:00:23.400> yourself<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.090> prevent<00:00:24.480> static

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
ground yourself to prevent static

ground yourself to prevent static
electricity<00:00:26.000> remove<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.180> side<00:00:27.359> panel<00:00:28.699> in

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
electricity remove the side panel in

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
electricity remove the side panel in
this<00:00:31.170> case<00:00:31.500> both<00:00:32.070> side<00:00:32.550> panels<00:00:33.000> need<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.360> be

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
this case both side panels need to be

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
this case both side panels need to be
removed<00:00:36.140> remove<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> power<00:00:37.530> cable<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
removed remove the power cable from the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
removed remove the power cable from the
drive<00:00:38.579> by<00:00:39.570> pulling<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> backward<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.920> an

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
drive by pulling it backward with an

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
drive by pulling it backward with an
up-and-down<00:00:41.430> motion<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> same<00:00:43.170> applies<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
up-and-down motion the same applies to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.139 
up-and-down motion the same applies to
the<00:00:43.860> IDE<00:00:44.280> cable<00:00:45.230> pull<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> backward<00:00:47.000> with<00:00:48.000> an

the IDE cable pull it backward with an

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
the IDE cable pull it backward with an
up-and-down<00:00:48.539> motion<00:00:49.070> not<00:00:50.070> too<00:00:50.280> hard<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
up-and-down motion not too hard so you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.020 
up-and-down motion not too hard so you
won't<00:00:51.090> damage<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.629> pins<00:00:52.699> remember<00:00:53.699> for<00:00:53.879> this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
won't damage the pins remember for this

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.200 
won't damage the pins remember for this
tutorial<00:00:54.180> both<00:00:54.960> panels<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> removed

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.299 

go<00:01:00.210> ahead<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.660> unscrew<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.350> drive<00:01:01.680> from<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
go ahead and unscrew the drive from the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
go ahead and unscrew the drive from the
way<00:01:03.739> not<00:01:04.739> all<00:01:04.920> computer<00:01:05.400> system<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.450> same

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
way not all computer system are the same

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.030 
way not all computer system are the same
some<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.710> bring<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.720> rail<00:01:09.720> type<00:01:10.140> Bay<00:01:10.500> some

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
some of them bring a rail type Bay some

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
some of them bring a rail type Bay some
of<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.520> clip<00:01:12.060> type<00:01:12.659> Bay<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> it's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
of them are clip type Bay but it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.719 
of them are clip type Bay but it's
basically<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> same<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.610> removing<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
basically the same for removing and

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.469 
basically the same for removing and
reinstalling<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> hard<00:01:19.920> once<00:01:23.479> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
reinstalling it's not that hard once you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.359 
reinstalling it's not that hard once you
finish<00:01:24.840> unscrewing<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.860> drive<00:01:26.850> from<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.150> bay

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.870 
configured and this one I had it on
slave<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.380> put<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> new<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.430> slave<00:02:45.090> also

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
slave so I put the new one on slave also
