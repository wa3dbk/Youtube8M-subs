00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
clay and grass for you and the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.189 
clay and grass for you and the
adjustment<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> make<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.470> game<00:00:38.000> well

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
adjustment you make in your game well

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.990 
adjustment you make in your game well
overall<00:00:40.199> I<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:40.979> the<00:00:41.670> matter

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
overall I think it's just the matter

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.939 
overall I think it's just the matter
that<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.390> clay<00:00:42.659> you<00:00:42.870> have<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:43.199> fight<00:00:43.470> much

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
that you clay you have to fight much

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.880 
that you clay you have to fight much
more<00:00:44.190> harder<00:00:44.549> to<00:00:44.879> get<00:00:45.030> one<00:00:45.239> point<00:00:45.890> actually

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
more harder to get one point actually

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.350 
more harder to get one point actually
it's<00:00:47.220> yeah<00:00:47.989> very<00:00:48.989> slow<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.589> clay<00:00:49.799> and<00:00:50.239> yeah<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's yeah very slow on clay and yeah the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.880 
it's yeah very slow on clay and yeah the
ball<00:00:51.540> is<00:00:51.659> bouncing<00:00:52.049> much<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.470> higher<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
ball is bouncing much more higher so you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.360 
ball is bouncing much more higher so you
play<00:00:53.190> maybe<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.839> different<00:00:54.839> kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.290> spin<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
play maybe a different kind of spin so

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.570 
play maybe a different kind of spin so
you<00:00:56.430> lose<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.150> use<00:00:57.330> more<00:00:57.720> spin<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.580> actually

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
you lose you use more spin and actually

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.630 
you lose you use more spin and actually
you<00:00:59.729> the<00:01:00.299> opposite<00:01:00.720> on<00:01:00.869> grass<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.920> try<00:01:02.580> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640

you the opposite on grass you try to
head<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> flat<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.049> ball<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.260> sliding

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
