00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello if laura sánchez remember 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.660
 this or the sanchez achievement and it was against 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.580
 of the bullying that is to make them a video 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.950
 showing them how to make this makeup 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 since they asked me a lot and I wanted 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 show it as in more detail so if 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.279
 They want to learn how to make this look. Follow 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 watching this video the first thing we're going to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.150
 do is apply a very light base 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.580
 just like so that the tone of the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.310
 skin looks more uniform we blur it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.470
 in the whole face now with a brochita 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 big I'm going to apply a shade in tone 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.759
 candy around my eye or in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.829
 the basin of my eye that is part of the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.170
 eyelid that sinks as between the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.390
 granny of the eye and bone of cea not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 let's put little by little let's go 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.860
 blurring and intensifying the color 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.989
 until it is quite strong and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 pretty marked now with a pencil 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.570
 jumbo this is nix in a black color 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.129
 let's mark the mobile eyelid this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.199
 color is going to serve as a base for 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.539
 shadow then let's blur it with 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.090
 a synthetic brush and just 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 we want the size of that black pencil 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 that we did not look so strong and that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 it looks more like a transition between 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.830
 black and coffee 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.530
 now with black shadow we are going to seal 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.409
 that jumbo pencil tapping on 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.860
 her and after blurring let's say 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.090
 that little by little the edge of the pencil 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.340
 we come back with the big brush with which 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.380
 we apply in the shade clear coffee and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 let's blur that edge again 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 so that it does not look so strong now 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.880
 let's apply some black shadow 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.110
 to the tabs below and we blur 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.820
 we come back again from the face I'm going to 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.909
 use the banana concealer that I used 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.920
 lately of l clear and let's put it 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.780
 in the high parts of my face like 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 under the eyes on the cheekbones the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.649
 center of the nose around my mouth 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 the center of my forehead and the arch of 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.300
 cupid these two lines I make them below 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.830
 where will I do the outline this is 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.360
 optional you can do it if you 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.060
 like but I like how 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 illuminate this area of ​​my jaw let's 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 now little by little to blur with the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.300
 synthetic brush you have given 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 account that if you watch my videos followed by 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.810
 Sometimes he took out the light first 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
 to see if I take out the shade afterwards 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.429
 I do first all the time then the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.989
 there's really no specific order for 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.310
 this the idea is that everything is fine 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.099
 blurred 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.020
 and you try various ways to which 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.630
 they look better because they are easier 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.430
 now with the little tail of my sponge I'm going to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.800
 apply the outline color that is a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.080
 dark tone under my cheekbones under 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.849
 from the tip of the nose around the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.800
 line of hair so that the forehead looks 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.500
 as a little thinner you can also 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.819
 put you down the jaw bone 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.590
 for those of us who have a bit of 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.440
 double chin or just so that in 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 photography looks different the face of 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.440
 neck 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 now with the synthetic brush we are going to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 blur everything little by little 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 little touches as I tell you the science of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.319
 these marcio has no science but the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.790
 idea of this is that you blur in 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.440
 a single point 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.030
 we want to blur that outline but not 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.670
 we want the dark color to go to 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.260
 the whole face then blur but not 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 moving from the point where they are 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.519
 until it looks more or less decent 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.470
 do that on the rest of the face up 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.720
 everything is completely blurred 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.940
 Now let's seal everything with powders 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 loose translucent as they realize 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 this dust flies everywhere and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.480
 it seems like flour that's the idea of ​​these 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.700
 bodies are super light, that's why they fly 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.530
 everywhere they are loose then 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.700
 despite not at all on the skin or going to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.430
 Make the makeup look more 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.260
 heavy and also have no color for their 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 they look super white but the truth is not 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.160
 it remains with no color that simply 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930
 helps us eliminate the brightness of 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.420
 products that we put and as they remain 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.970
 fixed I'm going to apply now a bit of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.470
 blush this is from mac cosmetics and what 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.840
 I put like in the grandmother of my cheekbones 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.880
 blurring it out of my face 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.430
 that is for us to see ourselves as more 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.860
 beautiful and healthy with the robot now 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.930
 let's move on to the illuminator that is my 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.360
 favorites of mac in soft tone 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.430
 widening and I'll put it in the points 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.080
 higher of my cheekbones because as I 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.519
 they realize it gives like a super shine 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.130
 cute to the skin as it looks more 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.260
 healthy I also like to put it in the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 Cupid's bow that is over the lips 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.670
 so that they look like more short cuts and 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.349
 attract more lights at this point and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 also on the tip of the nose so that 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.730
 look a little more uptight now 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.069
 come on with a black pencil can be in 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.079
 gel or a normalite pencil and we're going to 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.209
 apply it on the water line above 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.609
 and the water line below our 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.410
 eyes, let's say it's going to be like a 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.760
 frame around our eyes to 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.120
 make them look stronger 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.400
 and more beautiful and sexy now I will use 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.580
 this eyebrow gel that is basically 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.050
 like a very light brown eyelash 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.570
 so if you do not have this 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.590
 because I know it's hard to get 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.600
 you can simply use one of those 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.160
 coffee tabs that were from our moms 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.320
 it's these grandmothers who are 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.830
 stored in a drawer and they are super 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.650
 dry 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.200
 Put him only for a droplet botox 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.390
 eyes stir it well inside and 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.340
 this can be used as a little brush 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.460
 for eyebrows so that it gives them a little more 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.930
 of pigment let's now apply lashes 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.670
 fake because you know that I 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.250
 love that your eyes look like super 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.870
 big and dramatic and lashes to in 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.540
 this effect just be careful 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.250
 to cut them to fit your eyes and 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.290
 do not stick them so close the unheval to 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.090
 that no incomoden we are going to apply 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.770
 lash to the lashes below to 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.650
 that the eyes look a little bigger 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.510
 equally and expressive and now we are going to 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.870
 finish with the lips I'm using 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.360
 this color that is the 714 crystal with 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.160
 I like Manex very much because despite 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.500
 that is a striking tone is a tone 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.090
 Coral is a pastel tone as soft 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.630
 then let's say that I do not have to 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.300
 it looks 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.700
 clown with eyes so strong these 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.220
 lipsticks are liquid and dry to matte 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.380
 that means that they do not have 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.020
 brightness and also they will not transfer if 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.490
 you give a kiss or if you take something from 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.050
 a glass or they are eating like 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.600
 container that remains the stain of the 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.280
 life then I really like these 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.560
 lipsticks and have too many with 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.120
 cute to choose this was then 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.190
 all the makeup I hope you have them 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.260
