because I don't throw out anything every
time<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.480> use<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.810> line<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.500> keep<00:03:15.860> all<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.190> zest

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
time I use a line I keep all the zest

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.700 
time I use a line I keep all the zest
and<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.790> put<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.330> freezer<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.500> I

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
and I put it in the freezer just so I

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.630 
and I put it in the freezer just so I
can<00:03:18.830> go<00:03:19.130> like<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:21.130> maybe<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.250> little<00:03:22.370> bit<00:03:22.520> more

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
can go like that maybe a little bit more

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.060 
can go like that maybe a little bit more
it's<00:03:25.640> ingenious<00:03:26.030> don't<00:03:26.930> waste<00:03:27.080> anything<00:03:27.440> just
