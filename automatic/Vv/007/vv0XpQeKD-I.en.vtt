00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.690 

so<00:00:04.590> during<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:04.950> next<00:00:05.250> section<00:00:05.400> we're<00:00:05.640> gonna

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
so during this next section we're gonna

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.280 
so during this next section we're gonna
look<00:00:05.880> at<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> hand<00:00:06.330> position<00:00:06.840> and<00:00:06.900> how<00:00:07.080> that

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
look at the hand position and how that

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.350 
look at the hand position and how that
can<00:00:07.470> relate<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:07.979> hook<00:00:08.280> what<00:00:08.790> causes<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
can relate to this hook what causes the

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.910 
can relate to this hook what causes the
fault<00:00:09.600> and<00:00:09.810> how<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.140> use<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.350> better<00:00:10.590> hand

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
fault and how we can use a better hand

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.370 
fault and how we can use a better hand
position<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.490> correct<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:12.030> we're<00:00:12.990> often<00:00:13.260> than

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
position to correct it we're often than

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.410 
position to correct it we're often than
not<00:00:13.410> one<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.100> both<00:00:14.310> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.700> hands<00:00:15.090> is<00:00:15.180> going<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
not one or both of the hands is going to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.929 
not one or both of the hands is going to
be<00:00:15.510> in<00:00:15.600> a<00:00:15.660> strong<00:00:16.109> position<00:00:16.550> now<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.789> look

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
be in a strong position now if we look

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.720 
be in a strong position now if we look
at<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.119> top<00:00:18.420> hand<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.020> strong<00:00:19.619> position<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.429> too

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
at the top hand a strong position is too

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.970 
at the top hand a strong position is too
far<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:20.999> top<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> golf<00:00:21.810> club<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.829> easy

check point here is how many knuckles

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
check point here is how many knuckles
can<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.259> you<00:00:26.070> should<00:00:26.339> be<00:00:26.519> able<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.820> see

been moved away from the neutral
position<00:00:37.800> which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.730> hand

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
position which is how your hand

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
position which is how your hand
naturally<00:00:39.180> hangs<00:00:39.690> downwards<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.859> has<00:00:41.100> been

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
naturally hangs downwards for has been

endeavour to get back to neutral during

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.939 
endeavour to get back to neutral during
the<00:00:44.910> swing<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:46.019> if<00:00:46.109> we<00:00:46.230> take<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:46.859> is

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
the swing so if we take it from what is

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.160 
the swing so if we take it from what is
naturally<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.609> and<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> half<00:00:47.910> knuckles<00:00:48.359> move

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
naturally two and a half knuckles move

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.160 
naturally two and a half knuckles move
it<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> four<00:00:49.649> knuckles<00:00:50.120> swing<00:00:51.120> generally<00:00:52.079> it's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it to four knuckles swing generally it's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.419 
it to four knuckles swing generally it's
going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> come<00:00:52.559> back<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.949> two<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> half

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
going to come back to two and a half

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.919 
going to come back to two and a half
knuckles<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.269> see<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> close

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
knuckles which you can see now to close

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.079 
knuckles which you can see now to close
the<00:00:55.140> club<00:00:55.289> face<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.609> can<00:00:56.760> make<00:00:56.910> sure

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
half knuckles that's going to help us

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
half knuckles that's going to help us
bring<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> back<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.440> position<00:01:01.649> and

hand neutrally hangs in this position

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
hand neutrally hangs in this position
but<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.829> move<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> into<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.579> strong<00:01:08.970> position<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
but I move it into a strong position and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.330 
but I move it into a strong position and
wedge<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.960> underneath<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> golf<00:01:11.009> club

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
wedge it underneath the golf club

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.950 
wedge it underneath the golf club
whether<00:01:11.490> knuckles<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.180> round<00:01:12.420> together<00:01:12.659> at

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
whether knuckles are round together at

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
whether knuckles are round together at
the<00:01:13.049> back<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> club<00:01:13.799> sits<00:01:14.009> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> palm

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the back and the club sits in the palm

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
the back and the club sits in the palm
of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> hand<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.079> strong

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
of the hand this is a very strong

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190 
of the hand this is a very strong
position<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.299> normal<00:01:18.299> swinging<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.869> club

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
position a normal swinging of the club

in<00:02:11.340> what's<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:11.970> neutral<00:02:12.569> maybe<00:02:12.870> even<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
in what's more neutral maybe even a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.920 
in what's more neutral maybe even a
slightly<00:02:13.620> weak<00:02:14.040> position<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.629> shouldn't

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
slightly weak position but it shouldn't

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.059 
slightly weak position but it shouldn't
mean<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.230> right<00:02:16.470> hand<00:02:16.709> doesn't

mean that the right hand doesn't

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.040 
mean that the right hand doesn't
dominate<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.640> downswing<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.330> much<00:02:18.480> doesn't

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
dominate the downswing so much doesn't

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.900 
dominate the downswing so much doesn't
shut<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.470> clubface<00:02:19.830> over<00:02:20.220> too<00:02:20.370> aggressively

shut the clubface over too aggressively

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.650 
shut the clubface over too aggressively
