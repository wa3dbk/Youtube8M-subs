00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.750
 or the best until all is subtracted checks 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.060
 wheat as well you have seen the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.759
 beginning of the video a nuclear in the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.240
 root map a pretty weird map that 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.430
 touch little and well I'm wearing is a 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.379
 domain contribution that is helping here 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.690
 the enee silenced with healing is 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.720
 getting questions and good the truth 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.280
 that this weapon is here the closing before 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.199
 everything before anything that is before the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.839
 patch they put on him but be nothing 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.309
 I prefer with created and fast no but the 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.589
 case of wearing the muffler here was 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.539
 because he was playing alone and 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.370
 feature this nuclear that so 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.550
 that I like so much is because I'm 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.379
 playing only watching with a team of 6 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 because for me personally I like 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 more or nuclear playing watching play 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 player playing alone than in a team 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.220
 and those we will try today theme 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 this one of not having places in team or in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.219
 lonely 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.530
 but good before talking about this topic 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.329
 I wanted to tell you how good I wanted to give you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
 thanks for the 500 friends that 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.549
 we do in the channel the truth I am very 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.130
 happy with the growth of the channel not 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.740
 I hope that we will soon reach 1,000 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.189
 subs are missing another 500 but good 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.850
 you have to think about something is thinking about what 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.100
 high is the most 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.420
 because if you do not you do not have that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.150
 that motivation but good first of all 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.229
 well first of all going to the topic this 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.110
 of player and taking away games in group 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.000
 or alone I wanted to tell you how good 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.090
 I've been waiting for some 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.340
 promotions that 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.380
 what I wanted to do for my channel in other 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.740
 channels not four thousand three thousand 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.509
 even five thousand subs and he was good 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.080
 asking if they can promote me 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.000
 is nuclear that good the truth 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.650
 seen promotions on these channels that 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.700
 have been nuclear times have been 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.069
 watts of a single person but is that I 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.349
 I do not see those games you call me crazy 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.540
 but I do not see that they have promotion or 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.049
 that mixes new promotion I do not say 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.470
 because good to me sincerely a double 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.780
 June nuclear would only be the host is not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.120
 is the host is this heading a 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.480
 wig when it only has more merit than 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.599
 a coadyuvancia one as up playing a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.569
 6 Annual team of enemies and raspall 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.799
 that reappear in a flag just do not 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.379
 capable that to a flag and that uncle 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.090
 just have to point towards scratch and 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.050
 shoot and kill and kill yourself 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.460
 we find 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.100
 I the truth that seems to me until bad that 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.380
 ask for it first and accept it 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.970
 as a promotion because because that's not 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.610
 shows no skill as a player 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.680
 that is touching you sitting still good more 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.970
 well pointing towards a scratch not 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.560
 show everything in player that you are 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.600
 because apart from this city or six 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.330
 most good players for five players 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.910
 more than they are nullifying and responding 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.180
 enemy not and that seems very easy to me 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.460
 truth seems to me very easy and do not think 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.950
 be a reason for promotion not a promotion 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.110
 it's supposed to be a pretty game 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 difficult or quite spectacular 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.730
 when possible combining these two 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.730
 facets 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.540
 make it difficult that it's spectacular that 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.689
 it is difficult to be worthy to see not me 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.459
 it is not spectacular to me not to see 4 mod 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:52.060
 speak of a single person because today 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.349
 you think we like to see it, but it's not 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.740
 What I do not like to see is that it's 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.900
 helped by 61 by five classmates who 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.690
 who answer from mykonos and do not cancel 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.820
 well it can still happen but it's that 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.710
 walking the response and co does not seem 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.510
 until badly finished on the part of the 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.510
 promoted and on the part of the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.040
 promote not uploading that I do not know 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.050
 the fact is that I asked in a channel 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.690
 who does not tell me the name if they can 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.209
 promote a nuclear playing alone 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.910
 and he told me that he did not raise games 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.470
 gauges of this caliber not of quad mo 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 birds in sections as soon as and others 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.160
 the fact is that after having told me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.910
 this good I did not say anything 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.030
 In fact, I have to answer, because not in 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.830
 your channel your rules are not your rules and 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.920
 his rules and once I can not do 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.570
 nothing 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.000
 but then more people came 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.480
 commenting that he prefers to have a nuclear 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.140
 when alone 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.710
 that 14 helped by the non-nuclear team 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.940
 one of place getting universal in all 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.190
 the party someone I was freaking 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.440
 because I saw your channel and they promised a 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.200
 kid that took out a nuclear 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.050
 drive only a cloud sad I do not know if any 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.030
 Once the entire game is in the unclouded 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.210
 in the air those things normally a 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.039
 cloud sad nothing else then I do not know 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.870
 it made me think because then I saw the 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.790
 comments and I stayed and never thought 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.520
 that was going to have this repercussion 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.770
 is the comment that I put, let alone 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.840
 his response and it gave me to think 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.840
 you right now what do you think 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:31.959
 what do you think is better a nuclear playing 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:35.619
 just as is the case of this that I do not say 

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:38.349
 that is crack because it gives me sack if 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:41.049
 I did not think about it much before or because 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.449
 example a nuclear team or a 

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:45.789
 double nuclear team sincerely 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.820
 I already said it seems a lot better 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:51.270
 departure 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.760
 playing only the player when only that 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.300
 it was for the team and apart I think 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.009
 best player someone who knows how to fend 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.289
 by itself in 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.999
 in the game is not a player who 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.400
 he only knows how to play with equipment 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.919
 clouds that you have to take out before a 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.809
 I kiss someone so that something is taken out 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.469
 I think it's a good player, far from it 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:15.479
 a world you see not you if you never have to 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.309
 see not if you make a youtube channel 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:20.369
 mainly if you have a little bit of 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.349
 decency is that you know how to play is that you 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:25.550
 you know how to take things out by yourself alone 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.550
 to play with someone 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.900
 and then not, I think it's worth more 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.289
 worth seeing a nuclear of this type that 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.729
 one of that kind that 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:39.710
 in company and apart good there is much 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:43.129
 much affection for these lares that is believed 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.899
 that for not taking out that I because I do not 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.499
 I got so many nuclear here you have 

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:47.499
 nuclear goalkeeper 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.410
 which is better than me but not later 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.570
 we got to one of those one and that has been 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.190
 so well there I leave it here you are 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.560
 seeing the culprits that he should take in 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.360
 nothing and a lot of good we leave you comments 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.970
 your opinion on this subject what 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.960
 I would really appreciate it and nothing I hope you 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.740
 have liked that nuclear 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.680
 I hope you want him removed if it's like that and 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.680
 nothing current until the next video 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 goodbye
