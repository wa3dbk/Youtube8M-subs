 optimize her pc under windows then she 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 will be cut into nine episodes 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.229
 I looked a little violent 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820
 calendar is really rotten when 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.180
 even though my calendar but good so 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.979
 I watched anyway and so low in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.479
 nine episodes it goes back hair cell 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.810
 in all holidays if I do two 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.299
 episodes this week and so eh ben 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.290
 the first episode will consist of cleaning 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.479
 his hard drive 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.090
 so here is a software that I'm going to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.060
 present the second episode will consist 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 to clean his registry the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.450
 third episode will consist of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.500
 defragment the registry after 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 cleaning so episode iv 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.420
 will consist of removing the 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.610
 windows features 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.430
 completely useless the fifth 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.509
 episode will consist of updating 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.600
 his pilots 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.759
 the sixth episode so what is it 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.310
 who will do that will be the cleaning of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.500
 rotten sky but to the internet browser 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.060
 so the pages the tools 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.530
 toolbars rather than they are 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.120
 grafted to the browser and that will 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.790
 slow down the internet pages the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.530
 adware finally who have commercials 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.280
 finally all that kind of stuff that makes 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.770
 Shit the world 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.870
 then in seventh episode we find 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.370
 reducing programs at startup 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.290
 if you do not know how to do it yet 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.030
 you will learn it so will boost a 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.010
 little bit the start time the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.650
 eighth episode in France realize 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.840
 malware beats so the analysis hurt to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.150
 referees will allow deleted if you 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.530
 have malware it's a little bit 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.380
 like viruses and it could slow down 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.200
 your pc is in the ninth episode after 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.560
 have done all this will be the episode 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.930
 final so we will fragment of pc 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280
 so a little advice before you follow 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.470
 all these episodes I advise you 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.570
 to go see an old video a 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.030
 little annotation device that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.610
 used to calculate the time of 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.750
 booting his pc so I'll you 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.220
 advise to raise therefore this 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.220
 statistic is at the end of these notes 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.930
 the episode of remaking ball this balance sheet 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.250
 here are some statistics and compare 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.690
 two values ​​is your pc so 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.860
 start faster I'll you 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.799
 also advise to make small 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.380
 tests as launched its chrome browser 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.540
 and timed icons and after 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.880
 to appear is therefore before senaf 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.739
 episode and after his 9 episode power 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.910
 really it was a performance gain 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.620
 so now we will start 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.019
 directly by the first episode that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.970
 will consist of cleaning up his hard drive 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.739
 so to declare his hard drive if 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.709
 you do not know yet do I 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.500
 advise you the ccleaner utility 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.060
 this is very well known ccleaner I think 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.980
 that this logo is telling you something when 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.959
 even if you do not know it's not 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.120
 serious then to download the software 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.160
 there will be a link in the description and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.410
 so I would even link a link 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.010
 for the version with installation and a 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.340
 link for the portable version that I 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.260
 own here we'll get to it so much 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.430
 that the hard drive deaf so that's a 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.829
 software it will allow you to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.690
 clean your hard drive 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.530
 stupidly by removing software 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.269
 very special so I'm going to launch 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.150
 ccleaner in portable version of the coup 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 so without 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:25.550
 asked I accepted as 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.320
 lyciens at I will see accepted and software 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.580
 will launch 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.740
 so that's once you come on 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.440
 this software that looks pretty much like 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.550
 it icons can change by following 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.139
 versions on the version 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.060
 facilities I did not have the same rating 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.380
 but it does not matter 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.479
 so here you will arrive especially this 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.180
 that you will be able to clean 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.860
 so I ticked all of you tick 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.940
 really what you want there is 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.729
 maybe things you do not want 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.020
 delete example for example the words 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.080
 saved on the internet 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.039
 explore me i will coach them hockey 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.020
 automatic typing history i'm going 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.810
 also checked on the internet explore what 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.550
 I do not use the roof of an exploit 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.650
 after you sort a little bit what 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.760
 you want group ccleaner to delete 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.729
 for example error reports 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.389
 windows I do not want the cache dns I 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.470
 will keep him 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.419
 here you do you really like 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.320
 you want it here anyway 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.729
 what is checked by default you do not have 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.160
 no fear one already there will not be 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.539
 two pictures of personal folders here 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.820
 that particularly removes us that what 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.050
 is useless to your pc 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.880
 then you can also go 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.800
 in applications and there you are going to have 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.560
 of you will be able to clean others 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.120
 applications so I do not clean by 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.039
 example on google chrome that I use 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.669
 constantly same passwords 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.900
 saved but my database at 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.400
 compact by the way if I'm going 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.430
 contact the database cox talent 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.750
 after a little less space 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.250
 then here you have the applications 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.460
 that you can clean so I 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.199
 leave everything by default here and then 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.580
 once you have really chosen 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:01.449
 all your settings makes you analyze 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.650
 so the analysis he will not start 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.590
 you just have to wait 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.479
 and then I'm going to cut and at 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.630
 resume video declan ali will be 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:15.520
 finished go to right now I'm back 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.790
 so after exactly sixty-one 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.740
 766 seconds 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.980
 of analysts see there the ccleaner to 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.730
 find anyway 7 141 moa deleted 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.890
 1 it's already not bad and so down a 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.590
 once he found that you do not have anymore 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:35.470
 to do clean 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:38.200
 so that's ok and so ccleaner to you 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.160
 release about balam and 721 and words 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.690
 we are not bad 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.890
 so if you have never done 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.140
 of analysts like that, I make you 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.630
 still regularly that can you 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:49.480
 still free a gig or more 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.250
 I think my record was two 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.680
 giegold the first time i did it 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.490
 on an old pc that still had 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.760
 many hours to his credit 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.760
 will say 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.650
 and so there it goes to clean up 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.210
 unnecessary files that are on your 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.220
 hard drive and so that's always it 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.500
 still to gain in performance 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.220
 because it's still free of the 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:15.070
 here we have who we serve 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.440
 finally to nothing here is the lan ali 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.600
 the label the cleaning is done after 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.820
 have done the analysis 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.790
 so that's okay it's pretty fast you 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.770
 can live accompanied database 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.320
 here and have fifty-one seconds there 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.850
 is still remove the 741 and me 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.020
 So here it is already not bad 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.690
 we can see that still internet 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.850
 explore but took up a lot of space and 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.000
 then also and especially google chrome 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.980
 I use very often here and so and 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.140
 balla you can close ccleaner lo 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.780
 and that you have finning the first 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.470
 episode of the series optimize his pc 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.730
 under windows 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.430
 So here I tell you to ben

 will consist in cleaning up its base of 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.710
 register and so I say thank you to 

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.870
