00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
as intelligent as men well it's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
as intelligent as men well it's
interesting<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.420> an<00:01:06.750> associate<00:01:07.260> of

reasonable doubt that women have the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.749 
reasonable doubt that women have the
same<00:01:12.479> parts<00:01:13.109> in<00:01:13.259> their<00:01:13.409> brain<00:01:13.679> as<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> man<00:01:14.280> they

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
same parts in their brain as a man they

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.429 
same parts in their brain as a man they
just<00:01:14.969> chew<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.840> use<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.259> differently

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
just chew they just use them differently

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.169 
just chew they just use them differently
so<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.039> sound<00:01:17.219> of<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.429> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.609> lobes<00:01:17.820> all

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
so at the sound of one of the lobes all

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.090 
so at the sound of one of the lobes all
the<00:01:18.270> different<00:01:18.509> lobes<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.109> in<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.590> brain<00:01:19.829> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the different lobes and in the brain but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
the different lobes and in the brain but
it's<00:01:20.399> all<00:01:20.880> arranged<00:01:21.149> differently<00:01:21.359> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.719> way

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's all arranged differently in a way

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.510 
it's all arranged differently in a way
it's<00:01:21.960> bit<00:01:22.079> like<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> house

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it's bit like it's like a house

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.050 
everyone's got the same furniture or
appliances<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.280> they've<00:01:26.460> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.789> arranged

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
appliances but they've kind of arranged

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.489 
appliances but they've kind of arranged
from<00:01:27.149> definitely<00:01:27.509> within<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.810> house<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.259> man

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
ibly I mean that's it's fun but it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.609 
ibly I mean that's it's fun but it's
just<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.999> functional<00:01:42.079> yeah<00:01:43.079> well<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
just not as functional yeah well you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.380 
just not as functional yeah well you
know<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.340> but<00:01:44.549> having<00:01:44.789> said<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.999> I<00:01:45.210> mean

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
know but but but having said that I mean

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
know but but but having said that I mean
woman's<00:01:45.749> brains<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.499> have<00:01:46.829> added<00:01:47.249> features

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
woman's brains do have added features

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
woman's brains do have added features
which<00:01:48.030> allow<00:01:48.240> them<00:01:48.569> for<00:01:49.079> example<00:01:49.319> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
which allow them for example to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.279 
which allow them for example to
communicate<00:01:50.310> better<00:01:50.429> with<00:01:50.549> babies<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> know

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
communicate better with babies you know

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.440 
communicate better with babies you know
I<00:01:52.319> know<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.889> and<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.490> mean<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I know that and and mean don't have that

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.419 
I know that and and mean don't have that
capacity<00:01:54.630> within<00:01:55.319> their<00:01:55.499> brains<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.069> do<00:01:56.189> that

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
capacity within their brains to do that

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.459 
capacity within their brains to do that
and<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.119> therefore<00:01:57.389> they've<00:01:57.749> got<00:01:57.929> more<00:01:58.109> space

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and so therefore they've got more space

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.789 
and so therefore they've got more space
then<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> brain<00:01:59.579> area<00:01:59.999> mm<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.990> upgrade<00:02:01.499> you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
then the brain area mm to upgrade you

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.679 
then the brain area mm to upgrade you
and<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.189> use<00:02:02.429> it<00:02:02.609> and<00:02:02.759> more<00:02:02.909> practical<00:02:03.299> singer

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
and to use it and more practical singer

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
and to use it and more practical singer
they<00:02:03.929> sound<00:02:04.319> like<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.469> man's<00:02:04.950> brain<00:02:05.249> is<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> bit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
they sound like a man's brain is a bit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
they sound like a man's brain is a bit
like<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.689> computer<00:02:07.109> with<00:02:07.380> some<00:02:07.530> space<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
like a computer with some space in it

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.590 
like a computer with some space in it
that<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.490> can<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.149> upgrade

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
that you can actually get upgrade

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.980 
that you can actually get upgrade
programs<00:02:10.380> files<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.190> boost<00:02:11.790> boost<00:02:12.720> them

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
programs files and and boost boost them

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.300 
programs files and and boost boost them
talent<00:02:13.410> they<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> build<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.100> where<00:02:14.280> a

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
talent they can build on that where a

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.820 
talent they can build on that where a
woman's<00:02:14.580> brain<00:02:14.990> from<00:02:15.990> an<00:02:16.140> early<00:02:16.410> age<00:02:16.440> it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
woman's brain from an early age it's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.760 
woman's brain from an early age it's
pretty<00:02:16.980> much<00:02:17.070> set

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
pretty much set

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.320 
pretty much set
yeah<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.430> concrete<00:02:18.820> excuse<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.270> expression

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
yeah and concrete excuse the expression

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.510 
yeah and concrete excuse the expression
but<00:02:19.720> pretty<00:02:20.080> much<00:02:20.230> what<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.740> is<00:02:20.800> is<00:02:21.070> what

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
but pretty much what you see is is what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.140 
but pretty much what you see is is what
you<00:02:21.640> get

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
you get

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.470 
you get
well<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.590> could<00:02:23.650> be<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.010> bold<00:02:24.040> into<00:02:24.520> liking<00:02:24.730> a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
well if I could be so bold into liking a

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.590 
well if I could be so bold into liking a
woman's<00:02:26.140> brain<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> car<00:02:28.030> dashboard

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
woman's brain to like a car dashboard

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.890 
woman's brain to like a car dashboard
okay<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.580> know<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.970> they've<00:02:31.420> got<00:02:31.570> all<00:02:31.750> the

okay you know and they've got all the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.750 
okay you know and they've got all the
features<00:02:32.260> they've<00:02:32.380> got<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> stereos<00:02:33.340> you

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
features they've got the stereos you

features they've got the stereos you
know<00:02:33.880> they've<00:02:34.060> got<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.240> impact<00:02:34.750> warning

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
know they've got the impact warning

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.870 
know they've got the impact warning
alarms<00:02:35.710> they've<00:02:35.890> got<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.190> hazard<00:02:36.550> lights<00:02:36.580> so

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
alarms they've got the hazard lights so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.210 
alarms they've got the hazard lights so
I've<00:02:36.940> got<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.210> nav<00:02:37.420> men<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.740> they<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.070> can't

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
I've got the nav men but they just can't

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.360 
I've got the nav men but they just can't
drive<00:02:39.520> or<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.590> could<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.770> get<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> puppy<00:02:42.190> or<00:02:42.250> too

drive or you could I get a puppy or too

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.740 
drive or you could I get a puppy or too
many<00:02:42.520> features<00:02:42.700> they've<00:02:43.270> got<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.540> stuff

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
many features they've got to that stuff

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.670 
many features they've got to that stuff
but<00:02:43.870> they<00:02:43.990> still<00:02:44.170> don't<00:02:44.260> member<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> put

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
but they still don't member to put

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.940 
but they still don't member to put
petrol<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.010> well<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:45.970> right<00:02:46.240> yeah<00:02:46.950> yeah

okay<00:02:48.280> men<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.640> man's<00:02:48.970> brain<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.210> like<00:02:49.690> a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
okay men and a man's brain is like a

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.910 
okay men and a man's brain is like a
stripped-down<00:02:50.050> dashboard<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:50.710> it<00:02:50.830> really

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
stripped-down dashboard all it really

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.700 
stripped-down dashboard all it really
needs<00:02:51.040> yeah<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.910> is<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.450> rev<00:02:53.050> counter<00:02:53.290> perhaps

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
needs yeah it is the rev counter perhaps

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.240 
needs yeah it is the rev counter perhaps
and<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.540> schedule<00:02:55.540> gauge<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.740> have<00:02:57.130> an

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
and the schedule gauge and we have an

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.590 
and the schedule gauge and we have an
innate<00:02:57.490> sense<00:02:57.700> of<00:02:57.820> direction<00:02:57.970> so<00:02:58.390> it's<00:02:58.510> not

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
innate sense of direction so it's not

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.690 
innate sense of direction so it's not
such<00:02:58.870> an<00:02:59.050> issue<00:02:59.200> having<00:02:59.950> all<00:03:00.220> those<00:03:00.370> things

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
such an issue having all those things

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.510 
such an issue having all those things
and<00:03:01.030> our<00:03:01.150> research<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.750> actually<00:03:02.050> proven<00:03:02.410> to

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and our research is actually proven to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.490 
and our research is actually proven to
that<00:03:03.520> woman<00:03:04.120> don't<00:03:04.300> actually<00:03:04.540> lack<00:03:05.020> in

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that woman don't actually lack in

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.040 
that woman don't actually lack in
intelligence<00:03:06.280> per<00:03:06.520> se<00:03:06.790> what<00:03:07.390> what<00:03:07.720> they<00:03:07.870> are

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
intelligence per se what what they are

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.160 
intelligence per se what what they are
lacking<00:03:08.260> in<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.770> in<00:03:09.250> work<00:03:09.610> focus<00:03:10.240> intelligence

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
lacking in is in work focus intelligence

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.540 
lacking in is in work focus intelligence
we<00:03:11.770> could<00:03:11.950> be<00:03:12.040> getting<00:03:12.130> slightly<00:03:12.460> off<00:03:12.520> the

we could be getting slightly off the

we could be getting slightly off the
topic<00:03:12.910> here<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.660> might<00:03:14.110> be<00:03:14.530> why<00:03:14.890> most<00:03:15.190> of

research conducted with this two sexes
were<00:04:04.300> put<00:04:04.480> into<00:04:04.600> separate<00:04:04.930> rooms<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.410> work

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
were put into separate rooms to work

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.140 
were put into separate rooms to work
through<00:04:05.770> some<00:04:05.980> Krypton<00:04:06.490> factor<00:04:06.820> type

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
through some Krypton factor type

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.060 
through some Krypton factor type
problems<00:04:07.630> is<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.530> research<00:04:08.830> done<00:04:09.040> in

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
problems is that research done in

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.250 
problems is that research done in
Denmark<00:04:09.490> was<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:09.790> no<00:04:10.120> no<00:04:10.240> no<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.600> victor<00:04:10.870> arena

okay

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.979 
okay
and<00:04:12.100> interestingly<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:13.090> first<00:04:13.300> time<00:04:13.570> through

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
and interestingly the first time through

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.530 
and interestingly the first time through
the<00:04:14.620> groups<00:04:14.920> completed<00:04:15.520> the<00:04:15.610> tasks<00:04:16.150> in<00:04:16.299> about

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
the groups completed the tasks in about

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.570 
the groups completed the tasks in about
the<00:04:16.630> same<00:04:16.810> time<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.590> second<00:04:18.040> time<00:04:18.070> there<00:04:18.489> was

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
the same time the second time there was

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.789 
the same time the second time there was
a<00:04:18.609> telephone<00:04:19.390> in<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.690> corner<00:04:20.109> of<00:04:20.230> each<00:04:20.410> room

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
a telephone in the corner of each room

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.740 
a telephone in the corner of each room
right<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.340> as<00:04:21.700> you<00:04:21.820> can<00:04:21.910> imagine<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.360> results

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
right and as you can imagine the results

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.110 
right and as you can imagine the results
were<00:04:22.900> was<00:04:23.560> significantly<00:04:24.220> different<00:04:24.760> okay

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
were was significantly different okay

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.060 
were was significantly different okay
and<00:04:25.480> what<00:04:25.630> they<00:04:25.750> found<00:04:25.960> was<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:26.229> with<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and what they found was that with the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.890 
and what they found was that with the
telephone<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.550> each<00:04:27.669> room<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.240> men<00:04:28.450> completed

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
telephone in each room the men completed

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.050 
telephone in each room the men completed
their<00:04:29.050> task<00:04:29.229> in<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.680> far

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
their task in a far

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.000 
their task in a far
time<00:04:30.360> than<00:04:30.990> before<00:04:31.590> what<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:31.889> interesting

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
time than before what is interesting

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.220 
time than before what is interesting
yeah<00:04:32.850> whereas<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.480> woman<00:04:33.750> failed<00:04:34.020> to

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
yeah whereas the woman failed to

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.680 
yeah whereas the woman failed to
complete<00:04:34.530> their<00:04:34.770> tasks<00:04:35.220> at<00:04:35.370> all<00:04:35.669> and<00:04:36.030> by<00:04:36.630> the

complete their tasks at all and by the

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.290 
complete their tasks at all and by the
end<00:04:36.960> of<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.230> experiment<00:04:37.770> many<00:04:38.700> of<00:04:38.970> them<00:04:39.120> have

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
end of the experiment many of them have

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.750 
end of the experiment many of them have
fallen<00:04:39.450> out<00:04:39.750> with<00:04:39.870> each<00:04:40.050> other

that<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.810> telephone<00:04:43.169> was<00:04:43.290> too<00:04:43.410> much<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.650> a

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
that the telephone was too much of a

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.020 
that the telephone was too much of a
distraction<00:04:43.830> obviously<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.820> that's<00:04:44.940> what

communicated<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.970> extent<00:04:51.660> of<00:04:51.750> backstabbing

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
communicated the extent of backstabbing
