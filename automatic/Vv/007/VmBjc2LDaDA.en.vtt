to<00:02:00.259> run<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:02.060> motor<00:02:02.390> is<00:02:02.810> only<00:02:02.989> you<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.349> about

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
to run this motor is only you can about

that's nothing

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.120 
that's nothing
we<00:02:10.970> are<00:02:11.120> only<00:02:11.269> using<00:02:11.540> one<00:02:11.900> pole<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.260> pull<00:02:12.829> and

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
we are only using one pole to pull and
