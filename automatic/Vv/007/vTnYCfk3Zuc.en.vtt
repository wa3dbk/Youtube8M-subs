00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.699
 very good guys here we are in a 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.140
 new video and here we are in fifa 14 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:06.819
 ultimate team that good I would dare to 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.070
 say that today is the game that 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.420
 more I'm playing apart from gta 5 and 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.769
 good but true is that the mode 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.820
 ultimate team I'm in love with this 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.200
 gameplay because the truth is that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.090
 I like all this you catch the ones 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.070
 signings in football and such and this as no 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.080
 it's come to hair with my taste the truth 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.789
 it is like that in plan chips to three players 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.439
 looking for your equipment little by little and what 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.660
 You'll see that it's pretty cool, really, guys 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.279
 tell you what you wanted to upload this 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.810
 video to the secondary channel that is upload 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.949
 videos that are not gta 5 channel 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.290
 secondary to center the channel 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.579
 main to massa fd 5 and well then 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.989
 say a second you have it in the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.450
 description but after thought and 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.399
 said oysters really upload this guy 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.320
 videos videos different to gta 5 in 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.629
 the main channel is fine because that's how 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.670
 like what 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.050
 so he hit us so much with gta 5 all 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.760
 you can not see another type of 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.079
 content on the channel and I think it's better 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.300
 because that's not always always 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.760
 always gta 5 as well as tivo as we are going to 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.199
 play a tournament in which there are four 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.879
 rounds is worth the semifinal quarterfinal 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.890
 do not forgive eighth-finals to fourth 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.480
 final and final end so as 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.910
 Well, if we win this game, it's the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.920
 day that is tomorrow or past I will bring you the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 Next round is worth and there is a bonus 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.870
 if we win the tournament then 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.640
 and well as well as guys we can find 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.550
 let's take out I have a team 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 Spanish vale let's play with a team 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.710
 pretty bad and I 've seen it before 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.360
 to start the match of the team that has 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.550
 out before starting the game no 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.490
 was my team worth was the team of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.040
 opponent so it's a very team 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.610
 good so it's ok ok let's go now 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 that many of us are going 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.010
 this I think to see 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.780
 hit him look for site I have Morata the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.540
 front and if you notice that this guy is not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.830
 that knows very well how to play the number 14 is 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.300
 more I would dare to say until he has 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.580
 been absent at a time or has 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.680
 released the command or something so now what 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:57.770
 we'll see that sack is pere pp 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.659
 the uncle is absent or is not absent 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.549
 you're giving a lot of valero I do not know 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.990
 It feels it is there but yes it is there 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.660
 we're 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.390
 bojan I'll have to bad 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.310
 voucher voucher voucher voucher voucher 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 ok we play here is a little bit 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.830
 here juanfran is very good we are going 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.790
 here we cut through here we go normal 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.790
 vale vale 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 we go 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.599

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.540
 10 kid 1 guys well as I say the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's true that I find something quite 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.650
 well it's kind of a championship in the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.209
 which, as I say, there are four rounds 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.560
 so then I'm winning two 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.060
 there was the next round if I lose then 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 back then to go up is another screw 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.959
 powder later but good this 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.120
 party will be that it paints well uncle 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.280
 note that he is not a professional and has 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.480
 pass 36 want bikes sometimes pulls out times 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.940

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.760

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.260
 at the same time we're going to see reality thing 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.600
 Okay guys, it's already that the lord 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.310

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.420
 You do not see that every day with guys 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.010
 Well, this is really a loss of 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.840

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.390

 you are seeing is that this struggle I will have 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.739
 won the game if you are not seeing it 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.150
 Surely he has traced me 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.160
 at the last moment it is impossible to go 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.810
 to 40 and above is absent then then 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.580
 as I say nothing if we know 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.230
 making the air 200 light then in the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.670
 next days you will have the following 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.140
 part that will be the next round and it will be 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.340
 well the next round I do not know no 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.690
 will be absent from the game will be a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.709
 person who plays well while 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.360
 put to play that you can play 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.440
 sometimes yes sometimes not so good 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.120
 well, next that party will be 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.190
 much more interesting and possibly 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:14.680
 lose what good it is 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:16.870
