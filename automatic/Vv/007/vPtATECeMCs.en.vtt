00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Now today I show you how you do that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.299
 make correct sheikh with quark 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.280
 and fruits 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.630
 that's the basis but there you can 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.010
 of course a lot myself 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.660
 to try changing 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.100
 These are roughly the ingredients of lean quark 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.779
 then some berries here 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 can you somehow refer brawngp 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 or in bern as we are on it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.980
 Then you can roast almonds 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.320
 can still egg white powder cut me 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.369
 In any case, together you can then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.590
 you can make oatmeal 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
 You can also put Jesus' fruit in there 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 brew that is up to you 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.469
 here again the oatmeal so it 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 is shit which is tempting 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.430
 main thing oatmeal as you can 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.559
 I have before Kaufland but you can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.649
 also what revenge of aldi or what 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.559
 I know what to take a very cool 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.010
 thing if you have the market aldi at 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.690
 the animal just like that and then it falls 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.430
 thing completely outside you see 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.059
 already completely empty here 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.409
 and then it's so wonderful in there 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.510
 then let's take the fruits now 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.090
 somehow here I avenge also from 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.659
 Kaufland is a bmx that tastes good 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.520
 I do not just make you feel 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.189
 knew so that she makes in here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.409
 the sooner the whole story becomes 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.409
 and then we take another handful 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 a little more so here we have one more 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.360
 his car feels a bit slow 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.479
 we can make the milk over it too 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.830
 a bit that is completely covered 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.540
 then you have to look like you do that 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.800
 has the consistency prefer 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.270
 some like that a bit 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.729
 thicker and a bit 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.330
 I leave superfluous users to me 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.509
 actually a bit 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.509
 thicker but she says then you can 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.740
 her own was this is now the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.710
 So I believe such a rumor 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.550
 is molli here but there go now too 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.520
 once again a little bit of pure fits 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.209
 everything on top and off the post 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 so the whole story is done 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.810
 and the part has just 60 grams 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.370
 protein even more with the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.320
 oatmeal depending on what's in here 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.600
 makes it only from the quartier are there 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.950
 already 60 grams 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.080
 but now probably they know 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.550
 people who can say then again here 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.590
 you do not even record everything 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.410
 The body can only record 30 grams 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.700
 because it is not true that it is clear that 80% 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.920
 Casein in it 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.750
 and maybe some of you already 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 know casein goes slowly into the blood 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.950
 that is a recording over the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.750
 go or keep it all day if you can 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.090
 in the evening it carries over the whole night 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.360
 means you can optimally this 60 gram 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.130
 use and I'll just do it now 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.329
 spontaneously taste test that you look 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.450
 Could you shit? 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:55.340
 drink that is now almost too 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.549
 thick if I have a little bit now 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.100
 milk even kick it yet few fruits 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.870
 but it is not bad so it 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.209
 were times as much in between if any 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.280
 now in hectic side or so then skin 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.780
 your character at short bears over it 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.519
 so you can quite have the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.260
 just do it on berries and make clear who you are 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.600
 You can also theoretically take me 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 Just take a good water for says 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.049
 in between, but in the morning before 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.950
 school for breakfast or so or from 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.260
 to leave the work to 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.950
 So you have here how to do it 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.950
 make something of it 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.079
 but that would say again 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.909
 The foundation is quasi simple 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.069
 500 grams quark you can also 250 grams 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.379
 That's no shit like her 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.650
 just like to have or how much 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.359
 want to eat easier or how much 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.430
 carbohydrates was left over for caps 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.840
 and you can do it with almonds 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.769
 could he need and what that mandl 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.000
 more because sometimes not quite 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.680
 dismembered and then you always have there 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.730
 still so small brocken and lie that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.220
 sometimes not so cool flaxseed in itself 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.919
 in super thing you can to all 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.239
 actually eat 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.039
 You can also stop at the bear 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.440
 could also vary an apple here 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.949
 have rhine or something so bananas 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.360
 are also very cool with protein powder 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.690
 can you then see if you do that 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.949
 reinhold the cash now but that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.580
 I have an example here 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.639
 put down 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.160
 as I said milk or water here 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.900
 again the fruits oatmeal 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.729
 You can really do that with one 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.900
 vary that you can yes 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.820
 a few recipes you to 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.150
 example has just times and the video
