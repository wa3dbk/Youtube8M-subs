00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:29.290

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.920

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.430

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:06.519
 let's pour lemon well now leave for 2 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:10.120
 hours to have a word inside us 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.829
 two hours and now it's our turn to stuff 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.139
 gander 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:17.169
 look in advance I have already turned on the oven 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.560
 she's warming me that is now I 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:24.400
 I will put in the hot oven 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:31.360
 turn on and insert in advance 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:33.430
 ovens temperature is 180 degrees but axis 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.590
 addition mixture but because i have a husband 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.990
 prompts but talking about the oven 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.990
 how much should the temperature be and 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:50.320
 laugh it 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:53.919
 and we canâ€™t even put in time 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.479
 say an hour and a half here we are now 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.860
 shoot a video and we will note the time 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.650
 how much to prepare because all 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.630
 depends on whether a young gander either 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.270
 old old can generally be two days 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.650
 fry until his hatches remain 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.229
 magic is what magnitude there are two three 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.520
 kilogram 10 that is, it all depends on 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:27.990
 what size is her bird or his 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:32.260
 I know because I do not know it is starting 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:37.409
 now spread on sheet and send 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.409
 spirit and composition and you almost feel on 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:49.949
 who has a form let's say you can 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:55.199
 put the good old good quality 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:06:03.340
 some such beads are all now 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:06.159
 I reflect ready our festive goose and 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.020
 our guests are already resting and pieces 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:11.590
 our tasty dish 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.380
 me during that time just 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.590
 guessed the courses I watered him with some water 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:21.099
 and fat fat, it is, that is, not water and 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.860
 I poured a fat tito on a date to 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:26.050
 she turned out to be flying and watering porridge 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.620
 forests and now we will lay out beautifully on 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:32.229
 dish and pour and turn our guests 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.759
 I just many people ask where you are from 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:37.120
 there we go you live 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:39.400
