basically they are correct in their

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.750 
basically they are correct in their

ie

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
ie

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.590 
ie
our<00:04:53.540> culture<00:04:54.380> corporation<00:04:55.370> because<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:56.120> sure

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
our culture corporation because it sure

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.130 

so<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.120> equate<00:05:01.980> culture<00:05:02.980> with<00:05:03.160> corporation

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
so you equate culture with corporation

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.290 
so you equate culture with corporation
