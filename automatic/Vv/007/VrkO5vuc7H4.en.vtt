00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
light that appears on your dash from

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
light that appears on your dash from
time<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.840> time<00:00:13.130> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.549> be

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
time to time this is going to be

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.210 
time to time this is going to be
obviously<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.020> 2005<00:00:16.020> Chevy<00:00:16.049> Monte<00:00:16.619> Carlo<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
obviously a 2005 Chevy Monte Carlo but I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.460 
obviously a 2005 Chevy Monte Carlo but I
suspect<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> lot<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> GM<00:00:18.600> products<00:00:18.930> or<00:00:19.140> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
suspect a lot of GM products or the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.230 
suspect a lot of GM products or the
procedures<00:00:19.859> should<00:00:19.980> be<00:00:20.039> very<00:00:20.279> similar<00:00:20.670> or

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
procedures should be very similar or

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
procedures should be very similar or
pretty<00:00:21.449> much<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> same<00:00:21.980> something<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.160> be

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
pretty much the same something to be

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
pretty much the same something to be
said<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.789> check<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.240> change<00:00:24.689> your

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
before you with the as usually remember

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
before you with the as usually remember
you<00:02:16.700> get<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.030> change<00:02:17.450> engine<00:02:17.840> oil<00:02:18.020> light

you get the change engine oil light

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.949 
you get the change engine oil light
would<00:02:19.550> pop<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:19.940> right<00:02:20.239> after<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.630> battery

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
would pop on right after the battery

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.440 
would pop on right after the battery
light<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:22.400> yeah<00:02:22.550> that's<00:02:22.760> all<00:02:22.880> there<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.330> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
light so yeah that's all there is to it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990 
light so yeah that's all there is to it
pretty<00:02:24.080> simple<00:02:24.650> straightforward<00:02:25.000> there

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
pretty simple straightforward there

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.180 
pretty simple straightforward there
might<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.180> slight<00:02:26.510> variations<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.380> you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
might be slight variations in this you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.590 
might be slight variations in this you
know<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.310> read<00:02:28.459> online<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.790> sometimes<00:02:29.450> you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
know I read online that sometimes you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.890 
know I read online that sometimes you
might<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.140> step<00:02:30.680> on<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.160> gas<00:02:32.060> pedal<00:02:32.269> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
might have to step on the gas pedal the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.180 
might have to step on the gas pedal the
first<00:02:33.140> two<00:02:33.260> time<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:33.800> step<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.160> it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
first two time you just step on it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.310 
first two time you just step on it
quickly<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.730> last<00:02:34.760> time<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.750> step<00:02:35.989> on<00:02:36.080> it<00:02:36.230> and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
quickly the last time you step on it and

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.140 
quickly the last time you step on it and
you<00:02:36.380> hold<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.739> for<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.920> couple<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.190> seconds<00:02:37.519> then

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
you hold it for a couple of seconds then

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.080 
you hold it for a couple of seconds then
you<00:02:38.360> do<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.630> key<00:02:38.840> off<00:02:39.019> then<00:02:39.470> there's<00:02:39.739> anything

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you do the key off then there's anything

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.690 
you do the key off then there's anything
then<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.780> turn<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.110> engine<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.800> keep<00:02:43.550> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
then you turn the engine on so keep that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.100 
then you turn the engine on so keep that
in<00:02:43.760> mind<00:02:43.880> I'm<00:02:44.150> sure<00:02:44.300> there<00:02:44.450> might<00:02:44.630> be<00:02:44.660> other

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
in mind I'm sure there might be other

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.680 
in mind I'm sure there might be other
slight<00:02:45.440> variations<00:02:45.920> of<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.190> but<00:02:46.400> always<00:02:47.209> try

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
slight variations of this but always try

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.970 
slight variations of this but always try
this<00:02:47.750> first<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> know<00:02:48.350> pump<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.650> three<00:02:48.769> times

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
this first you know pump it three times

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.330 
this first you know pump it three times
and<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:49.459> you'll<00:02:49.940> get<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.680> change<00:02:51.680> engine<00:02:52.190> or

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and then you'll get a change engine or

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.059 
and then you'll get a change engine or
light<00:02:52.640> hopefully<00:02:53.090> all<00:02:53.510> right<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.560> yeah<00:02:54.800> this

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
light hopefully all right so yeah this
