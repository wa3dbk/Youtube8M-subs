was<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.120> was<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.300> hard<00:02:19.510> shot<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.870> really<00:02:20.080> hard

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
was it was a hard shot be really hard

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.260 
was it was a hard shot be really hard
for<00:02:20.260> me<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> do<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.560> but<00:02:21.370> on<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.580> soft<00:02:21.910> looper

for me to do that but on a soft looper

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
for me to do that but on a soft looper
pretty<00:02:22.630> easy<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:22.989> this

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.800 

the<00:02:27.220> last<00:02:27.430> scenario<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:28.150> when<00:02:28.300> they<00:02:28.420> force<00:02:28.660> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the last scenario is when they force you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.960 
the last scenario is when they force you
back<00:02:29.020> with<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.320> overhead<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:30.550> is<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> pretty
