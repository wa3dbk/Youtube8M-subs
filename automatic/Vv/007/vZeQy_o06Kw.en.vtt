bricks and I just want to say that I've
got<00:00:12.580> some<00:00:12.910> of<00:00:13.030> the<00:00:13.179> lego<00:00:13.900> movie<00:00:15.360> minifigures

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360 
got some of the lego movie minifigures

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.450 
got some of the lego movie minifigures
they<00:00:16.570> came<00:00:16.779> into<00:00:16.990> our<00:00:17.200> local<00:00:17.560> Walmart<00:00:18.220> there

they came into our local Walmart there
today<00:00:18.700> and<00:00:19.349> I<00:00:20.349> was<00:00:20.680> going<00:00:20.830> through<00:00:20.920> some<00:00:21.340> of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
today and I was going through some of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.790 
today and I was going through some of
the<00:00:21.580> codes<00:00:21.850> on<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.269> bottom<00:00:22.630> back<00:00:23.260> here<00:00:23.500> to<00:00:23.590> dot

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
the codes on the bottom back here to dot

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.769 
the codes on the bottom back here to dot
codes<00:00:24.099> i<00:00:24.340> got<00:00:24.640> them<00:00:24.789> offline<00:00:25.150> from<00:00:25.480> another

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
codes i got them offline from another

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
codes i got them offline from another
youtuber<00:00:26.410> and<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.779> was<00:00:29.050> mentioned<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:29.529> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
youtuber and it was mentioned that the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.439 
youtuber and it was mentioned that the
embossed<00:00:30.820> code<00:00:31.210> right<00:00:31.539> here<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:32.619> 3<00:00:33.190> for<00:00:33.220> 3<00:00:33.879> b3

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
embossed code right here was 3 for 3 b3

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.500 
embossed code right here was 3 for 3 b3
which<00:00:35.290> was<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.650> USA<00:00:36.309> code<00:00:36.580> now<00:00:37.270> there<00:00:37.420> were

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
which was in a USA code now there were

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
which was in a USA code now there were
talking<00:00:37.750> about<00:00:37.840> regional<00:00:38.559> codes<00:00:39.480> however

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
talking about regional codes however

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.630 
talking about regional codes however
this<00:00:41.530> one<00:00:41.800> here<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.309> 3<00:00:43.000> 4<00:00:43.270> 5<00:00:43.629> b<00:00:44.260> 3<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.250> all<00:00:45.489> the

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
this one here is 3 4 5 b 3 so all the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.389 
this one here is 3 4 5 b 3 so all the
dot<00:00:45.850> codes<00:00:46.210> that<00:00:46.480> that<00:00:46.660> person<00:00:47.110> had<00:00:47.469> shown<00:00:47.950> are

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
dot codes that that person had shown are

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.250 
dot codes that that person had shown are
completely<00:00:49.149> different<00:00:49.600> than<00:00:49.750> this<00:00:49.899> these

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
completely different than this these

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.189 
completely different than this these
ones<00:00:50.879> these<00:00:51.879> ones<00:00:52.149> here<00:00:52.420> some<00:00:52.780> of<00:00:52.809> them<00:00:52.960> don't

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
ones these ones here some of them don't

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.979 
ones these ones here some of them don't
even<00:00:53.969> come<00:00:54.969> near<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.510> codes<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:56.500> was<00:00:56.949> posted

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
even come near the codes that was posted

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.080 
even come near the codes that was posted
also<00:00:58.989> found<00:00:59.320> another<00:01:00.190> box<00:01:00.520> because<00:01:00.940> these

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
also found another box because these

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.320 
also found another box because these
were<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.739> found<00:01:02.920> three<00:01:03.399> full

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
were to actually I found three full

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.950 
were to actually I found three full
boxes<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.680> were<00:01:05.770> not<00:01:05.920> opened<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.840> was

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
boxes that were not opened and there was

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.160 
boxes that were not opened and there was
another<00:01:08.440> code<00:01:08.860> it<00:01:09.190> was<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:10.110> 445<00:01:11.190> b3<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:13.080> kind<00:01:14.080> of

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
another code it was a 445 b3 so kind of

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.699 
another code it was a 445 b3 so kind of
throws<00:01:14.410> out<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:15.220> theory<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:15.970> its<00:01:16.450> by<00:01:16.869> region

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
throws out the theory of its by region

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:23.040 
throws out the theory of its by region
where<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:18.819> live<00:01:19.030> type<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.479> thing<00:01:19.690> or<00:01:22.050> country

where you live type of thing or country

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.469 
where you live type of thing or country
or<00:01:23.080> whatever<00:01:23.880> because<00:01:24.880> there's<00:01:25.300> two

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
or whatever because there's two

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.469 
or whatever because there's two
different<00:01:25.720> code<00:01:25.959> boxes<00:01:26.590> right<00:01:26.740> there<00:01:26.800> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
different code boxes right there and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.270 
different code boxes right there and
they<00:01:28.479> had<00:01:28.810> I<00:01:29.080> could<00:01:29.259> feel<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.649> Parts<00:01:29.979> I<00:01:30.130> knew

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
they had I could feel the Parts I knew

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.580 
they had I could feel the Parts I knew
that<00:01:30.550> there<00:01:30.789> was<00:01:30.910> two<00:01:31.149> bags<00:01:31.360> identical<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
that there was two bags identical the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.180 
that there was two bags identical the
bump<00:01:32.830> codes<00:01:33.069> were<00:01:33.429> different<00:01:33.849> so<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.929> am<00:01:35.890> just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
bump codes were different so I am just

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.580 
bump codes were different so I am just
wondering<00:01:36.429> now<00:01:36.819> and<00:01:37.149> Legos<00:01:37.539> catching<00:01:38.080> on<00:01:38.259> to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
wondering now and Legos catching on to

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.859 
wondering now and Legos catching on to
everyone<00:01:39.489> with<00:01:39.759> their<00:01:39.880> bump<00:01:40.090> codes<00:01:40.330> because

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
everyone with their bump codes because

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.760 
everyone with their bump codes because
they<00:01:41.140> do<00:01:41.259> they<00:01:41.500> did<00:01:41.739> catch<00:01:41.979> on<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:43.770> UPC

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
they do they did catch on with the UPC

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.229 
they do they did catch on with the UPC
code<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.160> they<00:01:45.280> had<00:01:45.459> up<00:01:45.610> there<00:01:45.789> on<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.239 
code that they had up there on the

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:51.620 
code that they had up there on the
series<00:01:47.110> one<00:01:47.849> and<00:01:48.849> now<00:01:49.060> they're<00:01:49.780> mixing<00:01:50.319> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
series one and now they're mixing the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.419 
series one and now they're mixing the
the<00:01:52.630> codes<00:01:52.929> on<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.259> bottom<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.770> their<00:01:54.009> boxes

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
the codes on the bottom and their boxes

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.100 
the codes on the bottom and their boxes
when<00:01:54.580> they<00:01:54.729> ship<00:01:54.910> them<00:01:55.060> out<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.239> to<00:01:55.959> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
when they ship them out to to the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.160 
when they ship them out to to the
different<00:01:56.530> stores<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:58.390> not<00:01:58.630> wondering<00:01:58.840> if

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
different stores I'm not wondering if

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.199 
different stores I'm not wondering if
this<00:01:59.319> is<00:01:59.530> more<00:01:59.800> of<00:01:59.830> a<00:02:01.530> processing<00:02:02.530> batch<00:02:02.739> code

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
this is more of a processing batch code

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.779 
this is more of a processing batch code
like<00:02:04.209> when<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.509> product<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.989> made<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:06.340> or

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
like when the product is made as or

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.600 
like when the product is made as or
factory<00:02:07.599> code<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.770> factory<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.429> their

factory code of the factory that their
median<00:02:09.970> as<00:02:10.140> compared<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.680> regional<00:02:12.310> code

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
median as compared to a regional code

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.100 
median as compared to a regional code
seeing<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.380> today<00:02:14.920> having<00:02:15.460> two<00:02:15.640> boxes<00:02:16.420> brand

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
seeing that today having two boxes brand

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.059 
seeing that today having two boxes brand
new<00:02:17.290> boxes

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
new boxes

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.369 
new boxes
with<00:02:18.400> two<00:02:18.579> different<00:02:18.760> codes<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.359> them<00:02:19.540> tends

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
with two different codes on them tends

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.229 
with two different codes on them tends
to<00:02:20.560> make<00:02:20.680> me<00:02:20.739> think<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.280> either<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.609> factory

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
to make me think it's either a factory

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.489 
to make me think it's either a factory
code<00:02:22.510> or<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.900> batch<00:02:23.349> code<00:02:24.629> so<00:02:25.629> now<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.230> kind<00:02:26.469> of

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:26.499 
code or a batch code so now it kind of

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.050 
code or a batch code so now it kind of
throws<00:02:26.739> out<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:27.040> theory<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.519> dot<00:02:27.730> codes

throws out the theory of the dot codes

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.319 
throws out the theory of the dot codes
so<00:02:28.749> you<00:02:28.840> really<00:02:29.109> have<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.560> go<00:02:29.920> feel<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
so you really have to go feel for the

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.809 
so you really have to go feel for the
figure<00:02:31.629> parts<00:02:31.989> it's<00:02:32.829> about<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.249> only<00:02:33.310> true

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
figure parts it's about the only true

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.059 
figure parts it's about the only true
way<00:02:33.999> except<00:02:34.719> if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.019> can<00:02:35.200> buy<00:02:35.349> a<00:02:35.590> complete

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
way except if you can buy a complete

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.140 
way except if you can buy a complete
full<00:02:36.459> box<00:02:36.760> complete<00:02:37.719> full<00:02:38.170> box<00:02:38.439> today<00:02:39.120> where<00:02:40.120> I

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
full box complete full box today where I

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.339 
full box complete full box today where I
live<00:02:40.480> would<00:02:40.989> have<00:02:41.139> set<00:02:41.379> me<00:02:41.560> back<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:42.069> tax<00:02:43.349> 241

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
live would have set me back with tax 241

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.720 
live would have set me back with tax 241
dollars<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.639> 60<00:02:46.060> minifigs<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:47.319> I<00:02:47.950> wasn't

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
dollars for the 60 minifigs so I wasn't

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.789 
dollars for the 60 minifigs so I wasn't
really<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.019> show<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.319> out<00:02:50.469> for<00:02:50.709> these

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
really going to show it out for these

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.500 
really going to show it out for these
ones<00:02:51.099> here<00:02:51.370> they're<00:02:52.739> okay<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:54.269> two<00:02:55.269> great<00:02:55.480> the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.360 
ones here they're okay and two great the
great<00:02:55.750> figures<00:02:56.139> don't<00:02:56.620> don't<00:02:56.949> get<00:02:57.069> me<00:02:57.189> wrong

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
great figures don't don't get me wrong

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.659 
great figures don't don't get me wrong
there<00:02:57.609> I<00:02:57.790> didn't<00:02:58.209> want<00:02:58.359> them<00:02:58.540> all<00:02:58.689> so<00:02:59.639> yeah<00:03:00.639> I

could sell them but I I just didn't feel

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.729 
could sell them but I I just didn't feel
like<00:03:04.239> spending<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:04.900> money<00:03:05.079> today<00:03:05.290> maybe

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
kind of disturbed me about the code

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.229 
kind of disturbed me about the code
thing<00:03:11.199> so<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.739> just<00:03:11.919> thought<00:03:12.159> I'd<00:03:12.219> mention<00:03:12.849> it
