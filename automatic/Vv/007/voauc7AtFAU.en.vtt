00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.859
 People what's up I 'm not meego 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 today the character creation 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.199
 and you can start online 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
 go and then also character selection and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.240
 then you can have your own character 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 create or if you your character 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.250
 transmits then has the unique 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.170
 chance the look of yours 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 main character to change again 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.960
 if you behaved like me 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 then the character can begin 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.590
 unfortunately not change anymore 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.200
 and I have in the case now 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.050
 just re- created this one for you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 show mode here so you see that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 it is completely new 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 the whole character selection and the whole 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.079
 Character creation favorite is now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.420
 my main character and her right in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.290
 the case now, a new character to the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.140
 I now just picked off and 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.100
 then he just walks on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.960
 and then comes a menu where idea helped 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 So it can not modify anything 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.049
 more in comparison to the playstation 3 so 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.840
 you can really change everything 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.140
 male female you know that it can 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.780
 just so blatant people you can 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.729
 nose adjust the cheekbones ob 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.479
 skin is pure or impure so there is 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.259
 there are no limits to that with the parents 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.939
 You already knew that a bit 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.579
 So you really could not do so much 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.740
 but you can do that there 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.740
 just infinitely crass many 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.920
 We all have options to adjust 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.070
 can make really fine guy or 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.460
 a really pretty far or her 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.810
 can imitate gollum or none 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.320
 know the witch reason helga of andrew 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.910
 kasoulis still know it existed so 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.820
 to 65 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.400
 was superhot give it but he has since 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.370
 really so many possibilities 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.480
 So if I want to show it all 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.090
 that would just take forever 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.070
 because you have so many infinite 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.980
 compatibility options 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.590
 you can either do predetermined things 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.710
 you can choose that or you can then 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.340
 still individually on son so synonymous one 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.390
 you almost all do it yourself 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.240
 to adjust 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.910
 as I said from the blemishes of 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.020
 the hairstyle from the eyes of the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.300
 eyebrows from her lips all her 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.660
 can really just adjust everything 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.240
 partly as things were called that way 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.370
 properly paper and then the old one 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.430
 looks real mess victims of the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.980
 Madness so definitely uses that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.230
 if you transfer your character and 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.390
 are not satisfied with your character 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.400
 or generally just look through 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.830
 whatever you can do or so 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.680
 what you do to your character fine 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.540
 you can then you do not have to like me you 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.300
 new character poses I was the same 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.490
 save quickly and gamble quickly 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.410
 continue and then have one 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.940
 main character did not do that anymore 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.459
 of course I regret a bit now 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.100
 but well, that's what I'm good for 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.440
 to tell you that now yes it was 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.090
 far as with this video here I hope 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.000
 Of course that received a bit 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.200
 helpful you liked and than that 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.750
 The case, of course, would be me 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.910
 always happy about a thumb rom and 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.770
 then I would say we'll see each other 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.770
 next video people all the way to
