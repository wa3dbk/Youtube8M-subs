you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.140> that's<00:01:55.380> unfair<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.189> you

shouldn't be able to die off respond but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.969 
shouldn't be able to die off respond but
I<00:01:57.630> think<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> should<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.320> someone<00:01:58.590> earns<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
