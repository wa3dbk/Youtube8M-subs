00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.199 
this bike it's so hard to get into
trouble<00:04:16.420> with<00:04:16.660> this<00:04:17.250> because<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.670> just<00:04:18.940> so

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
trouble with this because it is just so

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.810 
trouble with this because it is just so
slow<00:04:21.450> it's<00:04:22.450> comparable<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.230> most<00:04:23.590> cars<00:04:24.010> in

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
slow it's comparable to most cars in

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.950 
slow it's comparable to most cars in
terms<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.210> power<00:04:26.400> like<00:04:27.400> not<00:04:27.640> an<00:04:27.790> SRT<00:04:28.390> Jeep<00:04:28.720> or

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
terms of power like not an SRT Jeep or

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.350 
terms of power like not an SRT Jeep or
anything<00:04:29.140> like<00:04:29.380> that<00:04:29.440> but<00:04:29.860> still<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.940> can<00:04:31.000> hold

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
anything like that but still it can hold

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.610 
anything like that but still it can hold
its<00:04:31.570> own

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.410 

there<00:04:35.160> is<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> nice<00:04:35.639> cheap<00:04:36.030> though

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
there is a nice cheap though

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.320 
there is a nice cheap though
so<00:04:38.350> again<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> can't<00:04:39.190> stress<00:04:39.520> the<00:04:39.670> gas<00:04:39.850> mileage

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
so again I can't stress the gas mileage

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.570 
so again I can't stress the gas mileage
understand<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:40.840> thing<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.200> amazing<00:04:41.580> I'm
