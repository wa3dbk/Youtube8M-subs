 video also back to school has been a while 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 my fault because I wanted to upload given 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.930
 which unfortunately the day after tomorrow also for me 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 school mills and I would say to start 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 immediately that I leave as usual 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.439

 and immediately win the first favorite of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 this month is absolute is definitely 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.050
 this little stick here that you have already seen 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.460
 if you follow me on instagram they did 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 see also the video let's get ready 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 together this is the east card of tool 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 festive I got to New York it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.390
 I paid $ 36 for it here in 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 Italy costs 36 euros as agreed 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 because precisely with the change there is a 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.449
 saving these are the colors they are 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 stupendous I am especially in love 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.850
 of this brown this black and all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.189
 these colors since I'm sure 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.770
 you will not be able to appreciate to the fullest 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.630
 from the video camera the only color that is me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 came a little in this bluish here that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.580
 it looks amazing but actually once 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
 applied does not make it look like a 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.229
 bianchino is not really writing 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 very nice to see it though this one though 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 really road pallets from the paging ie 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.650
 you can deduce that I love it is wonderful 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 the whole looked then is also beautiful 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.670
 because it's magnetic and doesn't even open 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.100
 so if you toss it also from 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 taking me on a journey is a summit in my opinion 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.049
 scoop another absolute favorite is 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.140
 It was this little stick here that we have 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.729
 always shown in the other video 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.090
 as I said precisely I use 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.490
 especially these two colors for the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.420
 eyebrows but I have to say that in New York 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.820
 I only brought this one from Rome 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.440
 therefore I go every day to him 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.700
 all make up purchases 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.110
 the last day more or less and this e 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.400
 the one used for both 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.300
 weeks is the make up revolution a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 locke is load it costs bullshit and everyone 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.900
 brown colors are the top 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 I used these here that these here 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.830
 all week that blacks to give a 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.060
 bit of intensity here to burgundy for 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.220
 fade her liner 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.560
 but the brown of this second palette 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.540
 me I'm strawberry es travagli 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.150
 not to mention eye shadows for 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.850
 eyebrows that also used 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.000
 today another definitely prefer 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.860
 this figure here from ue the wild 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 I bought this in New York but 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.930
 I had already tried it in Italy it's done 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.329
 so 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.230
 here is the powder and here a sponge the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:04.170
 true the fair coloring and the cover 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.900
 all is a wonderful part that asks for all 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.910
 day keeps the skin dull and me 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.820
 to the skin seen tending to fat 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.489
 therefore for me it is a salvation they can not 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.410
 use an opaque figure e 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.260
 this specifically lasts all of me 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.110
 day I launch combined with one of those 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.560
 brushes what I had shown from 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.769
 tv cosmetics with the violet handle that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.100
 at the flat tip and it's amazing why 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.510
 with which brush also gives a slight 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.640
 additional opacity to the foundation mi 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.800
 like a lot other favorite product 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.860
 is always of the volts and healers 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.080
 I was pleasantly surprised by 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.640
 from coastal from this brand with already 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.280
 discovery that in Rome because there is a 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.200
 concept in libya avenue but in america i 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.450
 prices are very low indeed calculated 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.820
 that this is one of the lipsticks 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.940
 lipsticks that I wanted to promote I have 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.130
 paid only 199 in the 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.400
 specific is the mood that is on the lips 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.650
 today and I have slightly buffered it 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.280
 coalitioned with the figure because the fact 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.890
 that I have to go out to eat today 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.300
 I wanted to find it again on all sides but 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.280
 it's great he paid for it 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.230
 I don't know if I've already told you a dollar e 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.630
 99 and of these here are at least four 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.240
 always taken in new york and they are all 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.060
 worn in the video let us prepare together 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.680
 I think I said it oils and I don't know 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.230
 hadrons at the moment there is also a fuxa 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.740
 too good if you find these 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.080
 lipsticks 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.230

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.400
 last favorite in terms of make-up is 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.710
 always a lipstick and it is this one of the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.220
 revlon of the color bar line 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:56.160

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.900
 crazy is really amazing smells of 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.840
 mental and by the way I was thinking about 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.290
 this among other things the coloring 225 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.669
 essays on florence I hope mine 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:14.430

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:16.890
 to the threat very very beautiful and yes 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.919
 easily spreads even if just a 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.960
 pencils I did not think and perfume of 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.990
 mint but not that strong mint of 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.680
 tivoli gloss those plumping effect 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.650

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.020
 for sure I'll get the whole line 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.419
 because these are fantastic wounded 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.690
 this time, however, we are talking about accessories 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.800
 it is this bracelet you see it here 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.470

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.479
 put in a video of favorites and is a 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.560
 very simple fabric bracelet 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:05.970
 done so with we continue to these 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.550

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.910
 maybe scope was the only bracelet 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.660
 yogurt from new york and I used it 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.460
