00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.870
 being the first solution is utrecht have watched the final of rock 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.870
 something worse 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.399
 we hope the plan in this case wakes up 3 istanbul turkish republic in the game 

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.359
 in which two lives compete against each other 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.769
 every player starts with a main boss a few males 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.380
 But then nothing built and road building every army gets that gives one 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.590
 supply and that supplier called the hero with this kind of strong as the 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.670
 game occurred it is very important that the captain of the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 Counterparty apparently not strong with its own very quickly too 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.740
 develop 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.740
 and below it is a huge tactical joust 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.390
 Spider place namely the different varieties of silver and the Serbian 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.760
 variation possible 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.430
 Been called Trainer Axis, for example, is very strong in building that up quickly 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.570
 Other varieties is quite strong in just the hackett that the hand is against 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.320
 hand fights 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.940
 there are all kinds of different tactics between the different units 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.090
 of different varieties therefore it became a kind of ultra de luxe 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.570
 chess game but today two toppers in the house have the best bakery 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.640
 players from the Netherlands and who are also very internationally known that 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.880
 firstly chain rotterdam from the corporate then I say no 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.580
 and he plays with the trotting sport 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.790
 Some famous player has several top 10 international 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.180
 plays are also under contract at the moment 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.150
 MT plays around the world is known to Dennis Manuel and Grubby Pitch Houses 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.460
 maybe that is one of the most popular game currently available 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.700
 world maybe you have a sport of telling tie or other 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 another famous coriana on manuel is just they big in korea and he has it 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.869
 has already won championships before and that he is here now that is good 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.420
 he is up against Kevin yes that is actually an international poster 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.110
 I was freshening up very close 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.270
 stood behind that alone 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 second quarter of course I 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.249
 today talks with good luck 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:11.549
 her but still 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.549
 yes i am very happy that i can run it that sam 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.809
 they do walk 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:18.980
 arrived on the spot 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.389
 I've lost 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:22.920
 if the best had been an attack 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.189
 am glad i won 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.749
 I thought that 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.419
 That this is a eavesdropping device of surprises or something 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.959
 but whether that is the embossing team play or that he 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.349
 a specially prepared ad 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.399
 but went to pee like a bull 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.059
 next 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:43.689
 after the war of the 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.300
 equal at the same time 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.199
 of course it is fire 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.090
 it was surprising to know that he just wanted to turn the suspect on 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.350
 because you don't want the early game there so early 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.660
 I was there a bit 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.919
 placed 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.369
 after the second match she had to be strengthened 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.369
 but i was patient to go out there in it 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.959
 and to the weakness of these defenses actually getting down 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.469
 nowadays it is also undermining 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.430
 where usually reliable language is built up with which the competition directly 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.259
 working on off 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.319
 going to defend 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.949
 but at a certain point you cannot buy back 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:26.279
 when i'm dead i'm without damn oant 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.590
 maarten lafeber even delete jobs afterwards 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.529
 Bah 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.849
 after this case it is about there that it becomes for sale at that time 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.170
 it had to sell it all out this year 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.969
 to buy the language bortot 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.650
 then actually too late 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.399
 to defend 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.399
 Rutte did have three times that had lost euros 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:50.719
 yes it is 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.399
 but that was just what I needed to make contact 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.659
 I have varna online almost every day during a competition 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.129
 where is very busy residential area always the summer there is worse crazier 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:06.349
 He wants the rest of Monday and the Netherlands and at the table of the month 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.930
 is it per person
