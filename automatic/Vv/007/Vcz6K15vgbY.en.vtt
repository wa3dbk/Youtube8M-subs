her braids in the place and I actually

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.780 
her braids in the place and I actually
want<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.699> little<00:04:08.970> wider<00:04:09.329> down<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.290> past<00:04:10.790> where

diagonal<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.579> across<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:15.449> make<00:04:15.599> it<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:15.930> that

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
diagonal it across to make it so that

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.589 
diagonal it across to make it so that
she<00:04:16.109> has<00:04:16.289> a<00:04:16.320> thicker<00:04:16.620> braid<00:04:16.889> down<00:04:17.070> below
