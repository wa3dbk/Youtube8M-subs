00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and now what is a break point a lot of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
and now what is a break point a lot of
people<00:00:22.560> ask<00:00:22.830> us<00:00:23.010> why<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> replace

people ask us why do we want to replace
our<00:00:24.600> stock<00:00:25.020> rubber<00:00:25.290> hoses<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> stainless

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
our stock rubber hoses with a stainless

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.120 
our stock rubber hoses with a stainless
braided<00:00:26.700> line<00:00:27.000> reason<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.200> one<00:00:28.800> over

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
braided line reason for that is one over

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
braided line reason for that is one over
time<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.700> through<00:00:29.939> different<00:00:30.270> heat<00:00:30.660> cycles

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
time and through different heat cycles

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
time and through different heat cycles
the<00:00:31.320> rubber<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.650> those<00:00:31.800> stock<00:00:32.070> brake<00:00:32.279> lines

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the rubber and those stock brake lines

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.130 
the rubber and those stock brake lines
is<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> break<00:00:32.940> down<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.720> what<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.989> want

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
is going to break down so what we want

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.930 
is going to break down so what we want
you<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.470> is<00:00:34.710> replace<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> stainless

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you to do is replace it with a stainless

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
you to do is replace it with a stainless
braided<00:00:36.059> hose<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:37.770> gonna<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.190> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
braided hose and what that's gonna do is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.830 
braided hose and what that's gonna do is
gonna<00:00:38.430> reduce<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.210> amount<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.449> expansion

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
gonna reduce the amount of expansion

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
gonna reduce the amount of expansion
that<00:00:40.080> you<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.650> brake<00:00:40.830> line<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that you have in a brake line so you

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.570 
that you have in a brake line so you
won't<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.180> mushy<00:00:42.540> lever<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:44.489> know

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
won't have that mushy lever or you know

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.150 
won't have that mushy lever or you know
just<00:00:44.790> just<00:00:45.000> bad<00:00:45.900> brake<00:00:46.199> response<00:00:46.650> over<00:00:46.949> time

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
just just bad brake response over time

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580 
just just bad brake response over time
what<00:00:47.879> galfore<00:00:48.059> does<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.540> we<00:00:48.660> start<00:00:48.900> out<00:00:48.989> with<00:00:49.199> a

process in order to make brake lines we

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.390 
process in order to make brake lines we
bring<00:03:06.569> all<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.079> motorcycles<00:03:07.769> needed<00:03:08.129> in

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
bring all of the motorcycles needed in

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.800 
bring all of the motorcycles needed in
order<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.669> be<00:03:08.790> able<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> break<00:03:09.239> lines<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.659> we

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
order to be able to break lines so we

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.509 
order to be able to break lines so we
bring<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.439> bags<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.859> here<00:03:11.099> we<00:03:11.280> measure

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
bring the bags in here we measure

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.000 
bring the bags in here we measure
everything<00:03:11.939> we<00:03:12.840> have<00:03:12.989> pictures<00:03:13.439> of<00:03:13.469> the<00:03:13.769> stock

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.599 
bike we have instructions for all of the
brake<00:03:18.930> line<00:03:19.109> kits<00:03:19.379> for<00:03:19.889> every<00:03:20.129> single<00:03:20.430> one<00:03:20.579> of

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
brake line kits for every single one of

brake line kits for every single one of
the<00:03:20.909> models<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.810> we<00:03:21.989> sell

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the models that we sell

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.220 
the models that we sell
so<00:03:23.280> basically<00:03:23.669> when<00:03:23.969> we<00:03:24.120> design<00:03:24.569> a<00:03:24.599> brake<00:03:25.019> line

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so basically when we design a brake line

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.839 
so basically when we design a brake line
we're<00:03:25.469> truly<00:03:25.709> designing<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.430> that

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
we're truly designing it for that

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.839 
we're truly designing it for that
specific<00:03:27.569> bike<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.109> on<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.889> application<00:03:29.669> we

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
specific bike and on that application we

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.640 
specific bike and on that application we
will<00:03:30.000> know<00:03:30.199> everything<00:03:31.199> that<00:03:31.230> there<00:03:31.409> is<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
will know everything that there is to

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.890 
will know everything that there is to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
know about it every brake line is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.780 
know about it every brake line is
labeled<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.319> that<00:03:34.439> you<00:03:34.590> know<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:35.129> know<00:03:35.250> master

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.420 
and you you have some questions on you
know<00:05:35.539> installation<00:05:36.259> or<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:37.099> think<00:05:37.310> that

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
know installation or you think that

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.580 
know installation or you think that
