00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.210
 there have been technical problems is the 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.670
 previous video when everyone 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.330
 ingredients has been deleted anyway here 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.810
 has been boiling for some time waiting for the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.919
 liquorice melt 1 kg of sugar 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.279
 a liter of water and 160 grams of 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.599
 very pure licorice stumps 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.599
 very pure liquorice logs 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.500
 very small trunk Gorizia very small logs 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.129
 of fat police logs 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.679
 pure that has been boiling for a while now 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.109
 this is always in this syrup 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.730
 more spreading and becoming soft 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.510
 until soy we have to wait for that 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.949
 save everything 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.850
 and of course I have already prepared 600 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.230
 grams of pure alcohol that when it will be 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.629
 cooled we will not add 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.879
 this is a dose for 12 people then 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.809
 a very digestive liqueur comes out 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.740
 good for 12 people to hold after the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.670
 one week in the fridge 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.790
 after which you can consume it 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 quietly and nothing we just have to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.890
 wait for the police to disband 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.259
 continuing to turn and now finally 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.850
 dissolved all the licorice there are only 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.969
 a few pieces I am going to crush 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 against the wall of the pot so as to 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.070
 to do before and after you semec a 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.700
 cool when it's cold joins the 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.700
 of this that the 600 grams of alcohol 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.560
 and after it is bottled wait for one 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.840
 week in the fridge before being consumed 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.840
 today and the heart is over 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 I had already prepared this 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.990
 last week is ready to come 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 consistency 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.450
 also great to put on ice cream but 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:15.550
 however good as a digestive health 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:15.550
 senses how strong he is and does not laugh
