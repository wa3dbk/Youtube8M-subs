image and your sentiment you want to do

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
image and your sentiment you want to do
this<00:00:15.509> so<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.020> can<00:00:16.260> line<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:16.980> up<00:00:17.190> easily

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
this so that you can line it up easily

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.000 
this so that you can line it up easily
this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> easiest<00:00:18.900> way<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:19.859> in

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
this is the easiest way to do it now in

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.620 
this is the easiest way to do it now in
the<00:00:20.100> center<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> die-cut<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.210> notice<00:00:21.480> i

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the center of the die-cut you notice i

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.390 
the center of the die-cut you notice i
have<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.020> embossed<00:00:22.439> piece<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> comes

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
have this embossed piece and it comes

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.390 
have this embossed piece and it comes
from<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:23.789> physics<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.840> boss<00:00:24.990> slit<00:00:25.400> actually

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
from this physics and boss slit actually

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
from this physics and boss slit actually
i<00:00:26.430> don't<00:00:26.490> think<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:26.789> an<00:00:26.880> emboss<00:00:27.090> 'let<00:00:27.359> i'll

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
i don't think it's an emboss 'let i'll

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.870 
i don't think it's an emboss 'let i'll
get<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> name<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.590> ya<00:00:28.880> but<00:00:29.880> i<00:00:30.109> wanted<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> then

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
get the name for ya but i wanted to then

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
get the name for ya but i wanted to then
cut<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.350> framelits<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
cut it out with one of my framelits and

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
cut it out with one of my framelits and
really<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> could<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.480> lots<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> different

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
really you could do lots of different

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.680 
really you could do lots of different
shapes<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:38.430> take<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.760> framelits<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
shapes just take your framelits out and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.619 
shapes just take your framelits out and
see<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.140> ones<00:00:40.440> are<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.430> be<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
see which ones are going to be just a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
see which ones are going to be just a
little<00:00:42.899> bigger<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.430> cut<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.579> around<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
little bigger and cut out around the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.470 
little bigger and cut out around the
embossed<00:00:46.079> piece<00:00:46.320> does<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.980> make<00:00:47.160> sense<00:00:47.480> so

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
embossed piece does that make sense so

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900 
embossed piece does that make sense so
you're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:50.160> cut<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.730> with<00:00:50.879> your

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
you're going to to cut it out with your

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
you're going to to cut it out with your
framelit<00:00:51.390> first<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.989> what<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> make

how to add a little more interest you
want<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> line<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> embossed

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
want to line it up so that the embossed

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
want to line it up so that the embossed
oval<00:01:19.259> frame<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.130> center<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
oval frame is in the center of the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.399 
oval frame is in the center of the
framelit<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.420> best<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.229> you're

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
framelit as best you can and now you're

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
framelit as best you can and now you're
going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> notice<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.640> writing<00:01:27.240> on

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
going to notice I have the writing on

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
going to notice I have the writing on
this<00:01:27.540> side<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> that's<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.979> recess<00:01:29.400> side

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
this side and that's the recess side

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.960 
this side and that's the recess side
this<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:31.070> popping<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
this is popping out so it's going to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.429 
this is popping out so it's going to
push<00:01:33.329> into<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> cardstock<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:36.409> make<00:01:37.409> it

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
push into the cardstock and make make it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.770 
push into the cardstock and make make it
come<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.310> instead<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.450> know

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
come out this way instead of in I know

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.359 
come out this way instead of in I know
there's<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.110> technical<00:01:40.590> term<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
there's a technical term for that and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.330 
there's a technical term for that and
it's<00:01:41.520> escaping<00:01:41.970> me<00:01:42.270> right<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.040> we'll

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
it's escaping me right now so then we'll

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's escaping me right now so then we'll
take<00:01:44.610> our<00:01:44.729> cutting<00:01:45.149> pads<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.439> one

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
take our cutting pads one on top and one

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.580 
take our cutting pads one on top and one
on<00:01:46.649> bottom<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:48.630> multi-purpose<00:01:49.079> platform

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
on bottom on your multi-purpose platform

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.750 
on bottom on your multi-purpose platform
you're<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> flip<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.700> tab<00:01:51.060> one

this<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.400> ended<00:02:06.300> up<00:02:06.360> coloring<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.260> the

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
this I ended up coloring this with the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.870 
this I ended up coloring this with the
crisp<00:02:07.860> cantaloupe<00:02:08.390> ink<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.979> doily

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
crisp cantaloupe ink because the doily

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970 
crisp cantaloupe ink because the doily
is<00:02:11.970> white<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:13.050> cardstock<00:02:13.290> i'm<00:02:13.560> using<00:02:13.860> is

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
is white and the cardstock i'm using is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.240 
is white and the cardstock i'm using is
vanilla<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:15.330> doesn't<00:02:15.630> jive<00:02:15.810> with<00:02:15.840> me

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
vanilla so that doesn't jive with me

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.410 
vanilla so that doesn't jive with me
sometimes<00:02:17.250> i<00:02:17.400> forget<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.880> I<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> card

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
sometimes i forget and I make a card

sometimes i forget and I make a card
with<00:02:18.660> white<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> vanilla<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
with white and vanilla on it and then I

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.280 
with white and vanilla on it and then I
go<00:02:20.490> back<00:02:20.520> later<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.390> half<00:02:21.690> but

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
this together to cut it and it would

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050 
this together to cut it and it would

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
it on the other end and then I'm just

think<00:03:04.320> this<00:03:04.680> element<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.370> here<00:03:05.670> works<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.209> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
think this element right here works on a

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
think this element right here works on a
card<00:03:06.780> like<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:06.989> or<00:03:07.739> maybe<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> card

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
front all by itself and that would

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.440 
front all by itself and that would
qualify<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> kiss<00:03:11.489> card<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.239> want
