boiler and running a steam engine well
the<00:00:13.950> basic<00:00:14.340> parts<00:00:14.759> I'll<00:00:15.509> just<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:16.379> around

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
the basic parts I'll just go around

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.900 
the basic parts I'll just go around
there's<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.100> whistle<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.020> gauge<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
there's some whistle and gauge and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.109 
there's some whistle and gauge and
Oilers<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.150> things<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> first

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
Oilers and things like that the first

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.700 
Oilers and things like that the first
thing<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> got<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.019> make<00:00:25.320> sure<00:00:25.350> there's

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
thing you got to do is make sure there's

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
thing you got to do is make sure there's
enough<00:00:25.769> water<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> boiler<00:00:26.789> right<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
enough water in the boiler right now I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.019 
enough water in the boiler right now I
have<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.439> much<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> boiler<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.849> now

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
have that much and the boiler right now

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.740 
have that much and the boiler right now
which<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.359> fine<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> run<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.340> but<00:00:32.340> it's<00:00:32.750> best

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
which is fine to run it on but it's best

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900 
which is fine to run it on but it's best
to<00:00:33.840> add<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:35.219> made<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.670> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
to add a little bit so I've made up this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.979 
to add a little bit so I've made up this
gadget<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:38.210> can<00:00:39.210> hook<00:00:39.420> up<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.750> hose

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
gadget here that can hook up to a hose

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.100 
gadget here that can hook up to a hose
and<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.739> quick<00:00:41.129> disconnect<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.660> is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and a quick disconnect and it just is

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.619 
and a quick disconnect and it just is
easy<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.680> do<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.789> take<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> off<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
easy to do I can take it off in here and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.850 
easy to do I can take it off in here and
show<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.809> made<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.559> number

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
show you it's just made up of a number

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:04.150 
show you it's just made up of a number
of<00:00:50.039> parts<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> quick<00:00:55.469> disconnect

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.390 

then<00:01:05.160> all<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> have<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.840> hose<00:01:06.990> and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
then all you do is have the hose and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.430 
then all you do is have the hose and
connect<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.550> onto<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.030> pull<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
connect it onto there and pull the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.120 
connect it onto there and pull the
boiler<00:01:11.120> and<00:01:12.140> as<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.410> see<00:01:13.620> it's<00:01:13.740> filling

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
boiler and as you can see it's filling

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
boiler and as you can see it's filling
up<00:01:14.250> quite<00:01:14.610> quickly<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.810> there's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.050> valve

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up quite quickly and there's a valve

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.110 
up quite quickly and there's a valve
here<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.800> turn<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.610> nice<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> have

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
here to turn it off it's nice to have

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:25.580 
here to turn it off it's nice to have
that<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.870> you<00:01:22.790> then<00:01:24.350> once<00:01:25.350> you've<00:01:25.470> got

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
that going for you then once you've got

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.890 
that going for you then once you've got
enough<00:01:25.800> water<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> boiler<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.180> you've

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
enough water in the boiler and you've

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.120 
enough water in the boiler and you've
got<00:01:28.140> oil<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> oiler<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> everything

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
got oil and the oiler and everything

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.040 
got oil and the oiler and everything
this<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.760> a<00:01:32.910> top<00:01:33.150> blowdown<00:01:33.750> valve

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
this part this is a top blowdown valve

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.070 
this part this is a top blowdown valve
on<00:01:34.260> my<00:01:34.440> boilers<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.190> usually<00:01:35.520> remove<00:01:36.080> just

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
on my boilers that I usually remove just

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:51.170 
on my boilers that I usually remove just
eighth<00:01:37.290> inch<00:01:37.560> pipe<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.820> other<00:01:50.940> thing

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
eighth inch pipe and the other thing

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.139 
eighth inch pipe and the other thing
that<00:01:51.210> check<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.050> oiler<00:01:52.500> itself<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.940> see<00:01:54.119> if

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that check is the oiler itself to see if

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.290 
that check is the oiler itself to see if
there's<00:01:54.390> enough<00:01:54.630> oil<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.460> run<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
there's enough oil in it to run it for a

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.000 
there's enough oil in it to run it for a
while

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.300 

and<00:02:02.610> I've<00:02:02.850> already<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.470> wood<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.650> paper<00:02:04.890> in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
and I've already got wood and paper in

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.020 
and I've already got wood and paper in
the<00:02:07.880> boiler<00:02:09.080> firebox<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.700> ready<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> go

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the boiler firebox so it's ready to go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.730 
the boiler firebox so it's ready to go
this<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:15.600> type<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.870> oiler<00:02:16.380> there<00:02:16.560> can

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
this is just one type of oiler there can

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.810 
this is just one type of oiler there can
be<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.370> other<00:02:17.550> types<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.180> well<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.640> I've

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
be there other types as well and I've

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.570 
be there other types as well and I've
got<00:02:21.000> water<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.780> water<00:02:21.990> pump<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
got water for the water pump just a

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.700 
got water for the water pump just a
small<00:02:23.880> amount<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.270> temporarily<00:02:25.200> gonna<00:02:25.500> run

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
small amount just temporarily gonna run

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.410 
small amount just temporarily gonna run
it<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.790> water<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:29.420> injector

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it and I have water for the injector

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.340 
it and I have water for the injector
right<00:02:31.350> there<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.240> use<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> plastic<00:02:33.780> clear

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
right there and I use the plastic clear

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.230 
right there and I use the plastic clear
plastic<00:02:34.380> hoses<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> water

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
plastic hoses so I can see the water

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.100 
plastic hoses so I can see the water
flow<00:02:36.770> because<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.980> valve<00:02:38.310> here<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:39.660> makes<00:02:39.990> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
flow because this valve here it makes a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
flow because this valve here it makes a
difference<00:02:40.500> where<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.130> adjusted<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
difference where it's adjusted to to

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.360 
difference where it's adjusted to to
make<00:02:42.240> get<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> water<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.440> into<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.890> injector

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
make get the water up into the injector

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.090 
make get the water up into the injector
go<00:02:44.640> into<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:46.140> then<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:46.650> thing<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
go into the and then the same thing with

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.050 
go into the and then the same thing with
the<00:02:47.700> water<00:02:47.880> pump<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.250> water<00:02:50.400> pumped<00:02:50.910> down

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the water pump the water pumped down

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.020 
the water pump the water pumped down
here<00:02:51.450> there<00:02:51.600> are<00:02:51.660> several<00:02:51.810> valves<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:53.160> look

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
here there are several valves and look

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.880 
here there are several valves and look
this<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.170> block<00:02:56.060> valve<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.360> helps

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
this is a like a block valve that helps

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.270 
this is a like a block valve that helps
relieve<00:02:58.890> water<00:02:59.700> blockages<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.070> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
relieve water blockages and so that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
relieve water blockages and so that
needs<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.700> be<00:03:02.790> open<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.300> closed<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:03.690> I'll<00:03:03.810> do

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
needs to be open and closed but I'll do

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.280 
needs to be open and closed but I'll do
that<00:03:04.080> later<00:03:05.570> then<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.840> just<00:03:07.080> basically<00:03:07.320> use

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
that later then I just basically use

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670 
that later then I just basically use
kindling<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:11.840> paper<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.110> start<00:03:13.290> out<00:03:13.500> with

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
kindling and paper to start out with

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.560 
kindling and paper to start out with
also<00:03:14.490> one<00:03:14.670> thing<00:03:14.760> that's<00:03:14.940> really<00:03:15.120> important

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
also one thing that's really important

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.250 
also one thing that's really important
is<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.720> get<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> good<00:03:16.140> draft<00:03:16.489> and<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.550> use<00:03:17.790> this

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
is to get a good draft and I use this

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.060 
is to get a good draft and I use this
blower<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.620> Dayton<00:03:20.010> blower

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.680 

just<00:03:25.070> come<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.880> can<00:03:26.000> buy<00:03:26.180> them<00:03:26.270> on<00:03:26.390> eBay

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
just come and you can buy them on eBay

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.630 
just come and you can buy them on eBay
or<00:03:26.960> buy<00:03:27.140> them<00:03:27.350> right<00:03:27.410> from<00:03:27.770> some<00:03:28.460> other

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
or buy them right from some other

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.760 
or buy them right from some other
suppliers<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.870> they<00:03:29.990> just<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> simple

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
suppliers and they just have a simple

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.250 
suppliers and they just have a simple
switch<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.460> cord<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:35.750> it's<00:03:35.900> running

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
switch on the cord and so it's running

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.970 
switch on the cord and so it's running
now<00:03:38.230> they're<00:03:39.230> just<00:03:39.380> gonna<00:03:39.530> light<00:03:39.770> off<00:03:39.800> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
now they're just gonna light off the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:49.210 
now they're just gonna light off the
boiler<00:03:43.720> maybe<00:03:44.720> turn<00:03:45.050> off<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.380> switch<00:03:48.220> blows

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
boiler maybe turn off the switch blows

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.650 
boiler maybe turn off the switch blows
out<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.460> flame<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:52.760> gets<00:03:52.910> going<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:53.450> turn

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
out the flame it gets going just turn

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.530 
out the flame it gets going just turn
the<00:03:53.750> switch<00:03:53.780> on<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.670> we'll<00:03:55.670> start<00:03:55.940> pulling<00:03:56.300> a

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
the switch on and we'll start pulling a

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:21.560 
the switch on and we'll start pulling a
really<00:03:56.810> good<00:03:56.960> draft<00:03:57.290> up<00:03:57.590> through<00:03:57.830> there

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.910 

the<00:04:21.900> fan<00:04:22.170> is<00:04:22.380> on<00:04:22.530> now

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.880 

these<00:04:30.520> would<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.570> used<00:04:31.780> coal<00:04:32.110> as<00:04:32.380> well<00:04:32.620> but

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
these would and I used coal as well but

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.850 
these would and I used coal as well but
fur<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.610> really<00:04:34.030> good<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.360> use<00:04:34.710> seems<00:04:35.710> like

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
fur is really good to use seems like

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.920 
fur is really good to use seems like
alder<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.310> woods<00:04:36.670> like<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:37.120> smell<00:04:37.720> pretty

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
alder and woods like that smell pretty

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.110 
alder and woods like that smell pretty
bad<00:04:38.080> let's<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.830> get<00:04:38.980> burning<00:04:41.760> just<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:42.910> matter

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
bad let's to get burning just a matter

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:51.630 
bad let's to get burning just a matter
of<00:04:43.800> pulling<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:45.130> off<00:04:47.430> gauge<00:04:48.430> here<00:04:50.640> whistles

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
of pulling that off gauge here whistles

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.690 
of pulling that off gauge here whistles
and<00:04:51.850> antique<00:04:52.180> whistle<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:53.250> didn't<00:04:54.250> make<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.580> but

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
and antique whistle I didn't make it but

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.340 
and antique whistle I didn't make it but
I<00:04:54.760> made<00:04:54.970> almost<00:04:55.210> every<00:04:55.540> part<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.080> except

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
I made almost every part on it except

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.400 
I made almost every part on it except
for<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.590> gauge

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.030 

so<00:05:03.950> it's<00:05:04.250> gonna<00:05:04.970> take<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.180> while<00:05:05.420> now<00:05:05.690> to<00:05:06.040> get

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
so it's gonna take a while now to get

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.210 
so it's gonna take a while now to get
the<00:05:07.160> boiler<00:05:07.520> up<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.790> steam<00:05:08.620> so<00:05:09.620> I'll<00:05:09.950> probably

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
the boiler up the steam so I'll probably

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.130 
the boiler up the steam so I'll probably
just<00:05:10.550> do<00:05:10.940> a<00:05:11.800> another<00:05:12.800> video<00:05:13.190> of<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:14.140> there's

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
just do a another video of that there's

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:23.650 
just do a another video of that there's
a<00:05:15.230> drain<00:05:15.740> valve<00:05:16.580> here<00:05:21.910> in<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.030> winter<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.570> you

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
a drain valve here in the winter and you

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.840 
a drain valve here in the winter and you
don't<00:05:23.840> use<00:05:24.230> it<00:05:24.440> just<00:05:24.470> or<00:05:24.920> any<00:05:25.190> time<00:05:25.580> you're<00:05:25.760> not

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
don't use it just or any time you're not

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.030 
don't use it just or any time you're not
using<00:05:26.060> that<00:05:26.300> just<00:05:26.480> drain<00:05:27.170> all<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.530> water<00:05:27.740> out

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
using that just drain all the water out

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.460 
using that just drain all the water out
of<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.280> boiler<00:05:28.900> another<00:05:29.900> interesting<00:05:30.440> thing

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
of the boiler another interesting thing

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.470 
of the boiler another interesting thing
as<00:05:30.950> these<00:05:31.160> pipes<00:05:31.580> all<00:05:32.300> contain<00:05:32.960> water<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:35.240> the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
as these pipes all contain water in the

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.200 
as these pipes all contain water in the
cold<00:05:35.810> situation<00:05:36.080> that's<00:05:36.980> outside<00:05:37.670> it's<00:05:38.150> going

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
cold situation that's outside it's going

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.460 
cold situation that's outside it's going
to<00:05:38.420> freeze<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.930> break<00:05:39.020> those<00:05:39.260> pipes<00:05:41.470> so

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
to freeze and break those pipes so

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
to freeze and break those pipes so
that's<00:05:42.740> kind<00:05:43.010> of<00:05:43.100> important

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.339 

I<00:05:48.550> didn't<00:05:49.270> see<00:05:49.419> them

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
I didn't see them

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.119 
I didn't see them
the<00:05:51.860> blower<00:05:52.129> up<00:05:52.339> here<00:05:52.550> working<00:05:53.800> you<00:05:54.800> really

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
the blower up here working you really

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.070 
the blower up here working you really
need<00:05:55.309> that<00:05:55.520> to<00:05:56.149> first<00:05:56.449> fire<00:05:56.839> it<00:05:57.020> up<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.469> get<00:05:57.589> it

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
need that to first fire it up to get it

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:09.489 
need that to first fire it up to get it
really<00:06:04.419> steamed<00:06:05.419> up<00:06:07.749> so<00:06:08.749> if<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.050> have<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.199> cold

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499 
really steamed up so if you have a cold

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:15.429 
really steamed up so if you have a cold
boiler<00:06:09.919> it's<00:06:10.039> best<00:06:10.279> to<00:06:10.369> use<00:06:10.460> it<00:06:13.839> you<00:06:14.839> can<00:06:14.869> fire

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:15.439 
boiler it's best to use it you can fire

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.279 
boiler it's best to use it you can fire
it<00:06:15.619> with<00:06:15.830> out<00:06:16.099> that<00:06:16.639> it<00:06:17.569> just<00:06:17.779> takes<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.110> lot

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
it with out that it just takes a lot

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.529 
it with out that it just takes a lot
longer
