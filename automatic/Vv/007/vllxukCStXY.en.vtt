00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.180
 hi youtube how are you talking about 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.210
 ghostly and this is a new tutorial 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.380
 so they can learn to record with 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 qantas study 7 since I have to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.140
 I'm going to record your screen and then the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 sound of your pc and they are talking to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.580
 weather 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.140
 ok let's do it first so what 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.010
 I recommend you update your 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.089
 drivers 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 and I have maybe real text audio 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.320
 see here 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.900
 some say to use this method which is 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:52.090
 options properties and so look for 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.090
 here and chule la latte 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.199
 the mixer yes ok is mixed but 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.409
 because we will not leave even if you 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:05.920
 we see in audio playback impugned 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:08.020
 simple 3 no matter this is not going to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.390
 serve if not then to lower the volume 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.030
 of the speaker even for that the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.570
 microphone if it's down then because what 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.250
 goes up and down goes up and down goes up and down ok 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 from here they will only control the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.480
 ok ok microphone now yes we are going to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.490
 to learn 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.780
 many of us have trips of 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 audiotec 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.549
 those who do not have should download it 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.299
 audio viatge of trying to leave the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.890
 re altec page and I will do a tutorial 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.700
 later on how to download the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 codecs ok 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.430
 Well let's 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.800
 to reason 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 with this program especially appears 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.840
 closed you arrive in a tab of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.570
 they here configure their micro 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.020
 all the sound back again that pere 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.689
 puig in six and effect was erased 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.390
 want in that then the truth is not much 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.300
 it's not very good that very valuable but 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.490
 Well, let's go to what we're going 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.750
 this is going to be this way by default it's going to 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.880
 be without this popcorn 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.600
 I used to be lomitas so they can talk a 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.210
 little softer and you'll hear them more 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.060
 strong 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.640
 when you study and you can see how it changes 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 my sound and good we will continue 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.490
 the cockiness and I would put it is because 30 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 it sounds a lot I'm going to show you sounds very 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.080
 hard and it sounds very ugly sounds too 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.870
 horrible let's go to too many to 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.810
 as if you were singing for 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.350
 sing or something like this web I'm going to again 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.550
 reinforce sound and I put it in 10 ok 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.959
 we continue again normal we see that in 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.880
 recording they give here because it's always going to 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 be here or I do not know how you want 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.510
 in recording they are going to change this tab 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.820
 this popcorn that is here I do not know if the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.730
 reach to see to see I give click to 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.880
 see if it cools down good here is and you 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.130
 they gave to give to change by mixture this one already 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 I'm going to tell you that if you want to put it 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:24.380
 by default and it goes from this one is yes and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.530
 we already have our microphone active and 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.120
 to close our music and enjoy 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.430
