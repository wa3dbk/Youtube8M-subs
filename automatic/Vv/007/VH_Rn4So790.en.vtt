00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.439 

and<00:01:00.829> other<00:01:01.829> than<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.339> texture<00:01:02.789> softener<00:01:03.300> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
and other than the texture softener I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
and other than the texture softener I
just<00:01:03.719> based<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.229> cell<00:01:04.439> line<00:01:04.619> Vaseline<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
just based my cell line Vaseline a

just based my cell line Vaseline a
hundred<00:01:05.970> percent<00:01:06.270> sure<00:01:06.360> petroleum<00:01:07.229> jelly<00:01:08.509> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
hundred percent sure petroleum jelly the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.719 
hundred percent sure petroleum jelly the
most<00:01:09.720> important<00:01:10.170> thing<00:01:10.350> about<00:01:10.500> using<00:01:11.009> this<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
most important thing about using this is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.560 
most important thing about using this is
that<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.450> thoroughly<00:01:13.110> wash<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:14.130> hair<00:01:14.570> with

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that you thoroughly wash your hair with

that you thoroughly wash your hair with
the<00:01:16.020> shampoo<00:01:16.130> provided<00:01:17.130> three<00:01:18.000> times<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the shampoo provided three times and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.940 
the shampoo provided three times and
I've<00:01:19.409> sped<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.130> times<00:01:20.490> 20<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.149> think<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
I've sped this up times 20 I think it is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.289 
I've sped this up times 20 I think it is
cuz<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.130> took<00:01:23.369> me<00:01:23.490> half<00:01:23.700> an<00:01:23.880> hour<00:01:23.970> all

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
cuz this took me half an hour all

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.450 
cuz this took me half an hour all
together<00:01:24.659> including<00:01:25.140> putting<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.039> the<00:01:26.189> hair

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
together including putting in the hair

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.929 
together including putting in the hair
softener<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.509> texture<00:01:27.960> softener<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.850> put<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
softener the texture softener I put it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.760 
softener the texture softener I put it
in<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> literally<00:01:30.509> took<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> out<00:01:31.080> five

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in and literally took it out five

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
in and literally took it out five
minutes<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.119> had<00:01:33.509> actually<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
minutes because I had actually just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
minutes because I had actually just
washed<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.530> hair<00:01:34.800> two<00:01:35.190> days<00:01:35.369> before<00:01:35.610> he

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
washed my hair two days before he

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.800 
washed my hair two days before he
actually<00:01:36.179> supposedly

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
actually supposedly

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.309 
actually supposedly
I<00:01:36.960> believe<00:01:37.319> it<00:01:37.440> it's<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.649> week<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:39.080> two<00:01:40.080> weeks

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
I believe it it's a week or two weeks

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.410 
I believe it it's a week or two weeks
long<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.649> people<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.159> wait<00:01:41.420> but

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
long as people like to wait but

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
long as people like to wait but
technically<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.140> only<00:01:43.259> 24<00:01:43.770> hours<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.159> I

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
technically it was only 24 hours but I

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.990
