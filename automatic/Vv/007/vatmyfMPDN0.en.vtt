00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.130
 Good morning, we'll see you one more day. 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.470
 in 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.050
 the other side I will show you here the 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.400
 camaro celebrating the goal is to make a 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.330
 video more or less just to show 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.260
 Something I could show today. 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.189
 I'm going to accelerate 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 just in this sense 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 ae 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.920
 It's more or less the force. 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:57.830
 strength is about 450 horsepower no 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:00.550
 It's something you do not have in Brazil. Mega 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.810
 people with parents and cars 1.0 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.810
 show a little inside the car 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 and if his panel he has a 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.360
 very interesting device I do not know 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:24.399
 It's going to be for you to see in the front. 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.940
 a glass panel appears on the glass. 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.259
 reflects on the back of the front car 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.630
 We here in the United States are 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.380
 very important because the control of 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.820
 Speed here is very hard and we 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.210
 can pay attention and know the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.780
 speed without looking at the panel on the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.369
 glass we can know that the car 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.369
 it's very cool 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.409
 the floor panel tells gilson 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:08.680
 Another cool thing is the rear camera. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:11.250
 is original of the car and when people 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.250
 engage in reverse 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.680
 to turn on the camera in the rearview mirror 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.680
 internal 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:33.050
 this television camera is behind everything 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.050
 to operate by engaging another gear 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 the display turns off 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.680
 here are the markers have marker 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.690
 battery back battery 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.690
 oil pressure oil temperature 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.650
 temperature of the water 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.650
 eye temperature 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.620
 show that are the controls for 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:19.630
 beyond the steering wheel that is 11 speed cross 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.930
 that constant anxiety control of the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.930
 radio 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.489
 It's more or less so.
