you<00:01:17.789> guys<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.240> feel<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:18.990> heat<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you guys can feel it they do heat up

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.969 
you guys can feel it they do heat up
also<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.640> push<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.060> button<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.479> here

also if I push this button right here

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.330 
also if I push this button right here
the<00:01:22.979> mirrors<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.520> heat<00:01:23.729> up<00:01:23.759> both<00:01:24.119> sides<00:01:25.340> also

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the mirrors will heat up both sides also

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.910 
the mirrors will heat up both sides also
the<00:01:26.610> dimming<00:01:26.970> feature<00:01:27.289> also<00:01:28.289> works<00:01:28.679> also<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
the dimming feature also works also and

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
to answer the questions from 2000 to

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.449 
to answer the questions from 2000 to
2002<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.259> couldn't<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:40.709> power<00:01:41.100> folding

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
2002 you couldn't put power folding

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.609 
2002 you couldn't put power folding
mirrors<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.720> Tahoe's<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.289> didn't<00:01:43.470> come

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mirrors in the Tahoe's they didn't come

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.100 
mirrors in the Tahoe's they didn't come
with<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.890> function<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with that function so what you have to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
with that function so what you have to
do<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.679> the<00:01:46.920> mirrors<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.990> be

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
do is get the mirrors from it can be

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
do is get the mirrors from it can be
either<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:50.780> 2002<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.649> prefer<00:01:53.039> 2003<00:01:53.969> because

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
either a 2002 or I prefer 2003 because

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.550 
either a 2002 or I prefer 2003 because
it<00:01:54.240> had<00:01:54.390> everything<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.109> it<00:01:55.380> add<00:01:55.530> more

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it had everything in it add more

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.410 
it had everything in it add more
features<00:01:56.359> to<00:01:57.359> the<00:01:57.509> mirrors<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.909> if

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
features to the mirrors if you have if

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.940 
features to the mirrors if you have if
you<00:02:03.539> have<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> part<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you have the part that you see the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.800 
you have the part that you see the
window<00:02:05.219> switches<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.789> all<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.299> same<00:02:08.810> there

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
window switches are all the same there

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.130 
window switches are all the same there
are<00:02:09.989> no<00:02:10.170> power<00:02:10.859> folding<00:02:11.340> switch<00:02:11.690> here<00:02:12.690> none<00:02:13.019> of

quite a pretty penny originally my truck
had<00:02:52.470> traction<00:02:52.769> control<00:02:53.310> right<00:02:53.489> here<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
had traction control right here as you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.780 
had traction control right here as you
can<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.290> had<00:02:55.410> traction<00:02:55.829> control<00:02:56.160> when<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can see it had traction control when I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.759 
can see it had traction control when I
did<00:02:57.030> took<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.359> bezel<00:02:57.630> out<00:02:57.780> unhook<00:02:58.650> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
control I plugged it back in and I stuck

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.180 
control I plugged it back in and I stuck
it<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.290> dash<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.800> tucked<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.100> away

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190

because I'm not using it so I'm able to
put<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> power<00:03:19.620> folding<00:03:20.040> mirror<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.520> now<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
put the power folding mirror in now the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.680 
put the power folding mirror in now the
controls<00:03:22.710> now<00:03:23.370> um<00:03:25.460> yeah<00:03:26.490> how<00:03:27.060> hard<00:03:27.300> was<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
controls now um yeah how hard was it to

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.510 
controls now um yeah how hard was it to
wire<00:03:27.960> up<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.440> was<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> piece<00:03:28.860> of<00:03:29.010> cake<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.310> only

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
wire up it was a piece of cake is only

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.880 
wire up it was a piece of cake is only
five<00:03:29.790> wires<00:03:30.060> behind<00:03:30.600> here<00:03:30.890> illumination

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
five wires behind here illumination

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.220 
five wires behind here illumination
ground<00:03:32.690> power<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.310> mirror<00:03:36.890> piece<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:38.040> cake

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
ground power and mirror piece of cake

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.220 
ground power and mirror piece of cake
illumination<00:03:41.210> power<00:03:42.350> crown<00:03:44.360> mirrors<00:03:45.360> two

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
illumination power crown mirrors two

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.810 
illumination power crown mirrors two
wires<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.770> mirrors<00:03:48.260> and<00:03:49.490> you<00:03:50.490> get<00:03:50.670> this

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
wires for the mirrors and you get this

00:03:50.820 --> 00:04:03.149 
wires for the mirrors and you get this
function

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.199 

as<00:04:04.159> you<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.790> see<00:04:05.060> I<00:04:05.439> have<00:04:06.439> also<00:04:06.709> updated<00:04:07.209> my

as you can see I have also updated my

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:16.569 
as you can see I have also updated my
interior<00:04:12.189> 203<00:04:13.689> the<00:04:14.689> seats<00:04:14.989> only<00:04:15.980> thing<00:04:16.340> I

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
interior 203 the seats only thing I

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.379 
interior 203 the seats only thing I
don't<00:04:16.639> have<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.030> not<00:04:17.329> all<00:04:17.509> three<00:04:18.100> is<00:04:19.180> the<00:04:20.180> gates

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
don't have is not all three is the gates

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:30.100 
don't have is not all three is the gates
cluster<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.079> steering<00:04:21.410> wheel<00:04:24.280> no<00:04:25.280> ribs<00:04:29.110> and

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.749 
cluster and a steering wheel no ribs and
that's<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:30.949> for<00:04:31.130> my<00:04:31.220> video

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
that's it for my video

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.080 
that's it for my video
