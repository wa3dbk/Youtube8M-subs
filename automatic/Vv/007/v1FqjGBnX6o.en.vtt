00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.150 
cable to the either the sound system or
you<00:00:14.219> can<00:00:14.280> hook<00:00:14.519> up<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.820> camcorder<00:00:15.859> okay<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
you can hook up to a camcorder okay we

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.210 
you can hook up to a camcorder okay we
also<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.970> power<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.260> unit<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.779 
also have the power for the unit the
unit<00:00:20.520> itself<00:00:20.850> including<00:00:21.689> these<00:00:22.020> off<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.039> those

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
unit itself including these off so those

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.890 
unit itself including these off so those
aren't<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.090> there<00:00:24.269> there's<00:00:24.449> something<00:00:24.750> wrong

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
aren't on there there's something wrong

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.670 
aren't on there there's something wrong
and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.039> we<00:00:26.189> got<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.640> microphone<00:00:26.970> itself

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
and then we got a microphone itself

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.320 
and then we got a microphone itself
first<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.460> you're<00:00:29.699> using<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
first thing up when you're using this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.690 
first thing up when you're using this
particular<00:00:30.750> mic<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:32.009> if<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> batteries

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
particular mic to know if the batteries

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
particular mic to know if the batteries
are<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.210> running<00:00:33.329> their<00:00:33.630> things<00:00:33.780> okay<00:00:33.989> at

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
are up and running their things okay at

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.990 
are up and running their things okay at
the<00:00:34.140> batteries<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> back<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.940> can

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the batteries on the back here you can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
the batteries on the back here you can
throw<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.390> switch<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.530> light

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
throw that switch you know if that light

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240 
throw that switch you know if that light
stays<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.750> doesn't<00:00:39.750> blink<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.260> completely

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
stays on and doesn't blink or completely

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.160 
stays on and doesn't blink or completely
it<00:00:41.760> doesn't<00:00:41.790> come<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.989> means

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
it doesn't come out at all that means

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.560 
it doesn't come out at all that means
the<00:00:43.290> batteries<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:44.010> dead<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> stays

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the batteries are dead but if it stays

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.170 
the batteries are dead but if it stays
solid<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.410> battery<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> okay<00:00:47.190> let's<00:00:47.940> pretend

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
solid the battery is okay let's pretend

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
solid the battery is okay let's pretend
that<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.570> light<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.760> off

see that the microphone whoopsie the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
see that the microphone whoopsie the
microphone<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.490> set<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.240> channel<00:01:12.390> 1<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:13.170> they

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
microphone is set to channel 1 if they

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.780 
microphone is set to channel 1 if they
had<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> small<00:01:13.530> screwdriver<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.189> could<00:01:14.430> twist

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
had a small screwdriver you could twist

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.870 
had a small screwdriver you could twist
that<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:16.320> 10<00:01:16.560> channels<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that and go through 10 channels that is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
that and go through 10 channels that is
going<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> make<00:01:18.270> sense<00:01:18.540> later<00:01:18.750> talk<00:01:19.409> about

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
going to make sense later talk about

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
going to make sense later talk about
them<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> bit<00:01:19.890> then<00:01:20.430> slide<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.240> close

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
them a bit then slide that I can close

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
them a bit then slide that I can close
that<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.040> we'll<00:01:23.159> go<00:01:23.250> ahead<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> we'll

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
that up so we'll go ahead and we'll

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300 
that up so we'll go ahead and we'll
power<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.420> device<00:01:24.860> first<00:01:25.860> overhead<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
power up this device first overhead and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
power up this device first overhead and
lift<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> antennas<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.290> plug<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
lift up the antennas and we can plug in

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.679 
lift up the antennas and we can plug in
the<00:01:28.740> power<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.729> power<00:01:30.240> port<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.659> here

source we'll go ahead and we'll turn it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.499 
source we'll go ahead and we'll turn it
on

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
on

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.929 
on
and<00:01:39.990> you'll<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> comes<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and you'll see that it comes up on

did you like him on and you'll see here
that<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.079> RF<00:01:49.350> signal<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> way<00:01:51.180> up<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that the RF signal is all the way up to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.499 
that the RF signal is all the way up to
5<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> comes<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.329> see

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
5 the a comes on and then you can see

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.510 
5 the a comes on and then you can see
that<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.259> getting<00:01:55.619> bouncing<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that we are getting bouncing on the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
that we are getting bouncing on the
microphone<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.469> running<00:01:58.770> at

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
microphone this is up and running at

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.880 
microphone this is up and running at
this<00:01:59.009> point<00:01:59.540> let's<00:02:00.540> say<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this point let's say that when you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
this point let's say that when you
turned<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.200> channel<00:02:04.200> 2

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
turned it on it was on channel 2

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.490 
turned it on it was on channel 2
you're<00:02:04.710> getting<00:02:05.009> no<00:02:05.310> settings<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you're getting no settings on that so

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.619 
you're getting no settings on that so
what<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.670> open<00:02:09.479> up

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
what you would do is you would open up

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.570 
what you would do is you would open up
the<00:02:09.959> microphone<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> look<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.459> what

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the microphone and look and see what

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.979 
the microphone and look and see what
channel<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.569> know<00:02:12.690> what's<00:02:12.840> on

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
channel it's on so you know what's on

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.500 
channel it's on so you know what's on
Channel

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
Channel

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.140 
Channel
you<00:02:14.470> go<00:02:14.620> back<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.860> one<00:02:15.310> we're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:15.970> see

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you go back to one we're going to see

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.479 
you go back to one we're going to see
that<00:02:16.299> it's<00:02:16.629> gonna<00:02:16.720> kind<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.680> blink<00:02:18.099> out<00:02:18.280> yeah

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
that it's gonna kind of blink out yeah

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.610 
that it's gonna kind of blink out yeah
at<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:18.879> point<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.239> need<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.480> set<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.170> you

channel one you've got it on you hadn't
hold<00:02:27.099> down<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.700> it's<00:02:28.180> scanned<00:02:28.540> right<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
hold down and it's scanned right to

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.080 
hold down and it's scanned right to
knowing<00:02:29.379> that<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.310> device<00:02:30.610> that's

going to make the connection you'll see

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.259 
going to make the connection you'll see
now<00:02:32.530> it's<00:02:32.739> working<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.760> we'll<00:02:33.909> go<00:02:34.030> ahead<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
now it's working now we'll go ahead and

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.630 
now it's working now we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:02:34.780> plug<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.230> mic<00:02:35.379> up<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.829> sound<00:02:36.459> source

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
we'll plug the mic up to a sound source

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210 
we'll plug the mic up to a sound source
so<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> take<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.420> 1/4<00:02:38.079> cable<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.739> plug<00:02:39.010> it

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
so you take the 1/4 cable and plug it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.110 
so you take the 1/4 cable and plug it
into<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.579> back<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.409> receiver<00:02:41.409> and<00:02:41.709> then
