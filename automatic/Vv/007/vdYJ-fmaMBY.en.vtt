I did it two times I did it two times
you<00:05:51.070> listening<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.580> me<00:05:51.730> that's<00:05:52.120> not<00:05:52.240> stupid<00:05:52.570> i

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
you listening to me that's not stupid i

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.360 
you listening to me that's not stupid i
would<00:05:52.840> now<00:05:53.260> like<00:05:53.290> it's<00:05:53.680> just<00:05:53.920> hair<00:05:54.130> to<00:05:54.310> grow

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
would now like it's just hair to grow

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.180 
would now like it's just hair to grow
back<00:05:54.640> I<00:05:54.880> cut<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.420> same<00:05:55.660> spot<00:05:56.080> twice<00:05:56.320> that's

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
back I cut the same spot twice that's

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.740 
back I cut the same spot twice that's
why<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.400> didn't<00:05:57.670> grow<00:05:57.790> it<00:05:58.030> because<00:05:58.300> when<00:05:58.480> it<00:05:58.600> did

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
why I didn't grow it because when it did

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.870 
why I didn't grow it because when it did
start<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.170> grow<00:05:59.410> I<00:05:59.590> chopped<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.160> off<00:06:00.280> again<00:06:00.610> I

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880

start to grow I chopped it off again I
chopped<00:06:01.480> off<00:06:01.660> again<00:06:01.990> I'm<00:06:02.440> thinking<00:06:03.340> it's<00:06:03.820> just

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
chopped off again I'm thinking it's just

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.970 
chopped off again I'm thinking it's just
how<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.270> grow<00:06:04.480> back<00:06:04.660> but<00:06:04.900> not<00:06:05.410> thinking<00:06:05.800> that
