00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.170
 Brighten your hair 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.269
 we are going to use aloe as you know is 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.970
 good for both the face and the 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.670
 hair through your teeth and we're going to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.730
 find in different presentations 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.949
 either in cream in good gel shampoo 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.949
 girls this this recipe I hope that you 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.500
 like it so do not cable him well let's 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.829
 prepare the mixture we need ten 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.519
 centimeters of aloe 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.719
 this pure glycerin is I bought it in the 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:46.250
 Paris pharmacy costs you 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.250
 17 pesos I do not know if you can see there 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.980
 let's do the following we're going to open 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.450
 the aloe 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.450
 to take out their faults 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.250
 this will help us prevent the fall 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.160
 and recover it as it rejuvenates 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.290
 by providing the typical properties 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.100
 of gelatin 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 what is the essential hair protein 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.950
 there are those who prefer to add this pulp 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.140
 in your hair conditioner for 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.850
 increase a better benefit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.850
 and it is that we have opened it 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620
 the knife 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.220
 and so we're going to do with all the aloe 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.220
 extract all this aloe pulp 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.420
 since we finished extracting all the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.090
 aloe vera pulp and let's add a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.580
 little water as well was very little what 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.920
 that I extracted from pulp then to 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.430
 liquefy it can be I'll take a little 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.230
 Water 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.379
 you can add this recipe glycerin 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.180
 or extra virgin olive oil but as 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.770
 I have hair a little arms or 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.080
 I use flour 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.080
 you are going to add a spoonful 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.450
 and let's liquefy this 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.720
 and I'm going to do it with this device or 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.330
 you can do it in the blender 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.430
 but I think this does not help us 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.160
 Oh sorry I had to change the fret 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.020
 because in the other one you could not 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.020
 then we are going to liquefy it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.150
 Let's liquefy for a few seconds 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 i 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.220
 and ready and stay 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.670
 yes 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.790
 well this is ready to apply 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.060
 those of our hair 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.140
 now we are going to empty it in one take the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.540
 atomizer 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.960
 I'm going to use this one of a lotion that 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.960
 I had 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.860
 with this will help us to disperse what 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.860
 all the hair easier 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.319
 and now our aloe is ready 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.590
 good since we have ready the mixture the 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:26.970
 let's apply on all the hair 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.970
 giving some massages 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.360
 If you do not have the policyholder, you can 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.310
 apply fabric with your hand 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.310
 so for all my hair 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.400
 aloe due to its properties 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.840
 nutritious and strengthening is that it has 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.139
 will help us to stimulate 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.200
 the 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:05.290
 it was the follicles and the eyes 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.290
 figures invigorate the hair 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.070
 we perceive by all 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.510
 that atomized the no 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.510
 It costs a little time 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:42.050
 Well, I've finished applying it to everything 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:44.409
 the hair and now we are going to put a 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.409
 Cap 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.430
 but first we 're going to give you a massage 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.430
 the whole head 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.840
 this you are going to do twice a week 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.440
 before you bathe 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.620
 and you're going to let him act between 10 and 15 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.620
 minutes 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.910
 we put on the cap 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.459
 situations 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:33.699
 a ball can be with a bag of 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.699
 plastic 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.660
 I let him act and you'll see that your hair 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.310
 it has more shine and they are malnourished 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.800
