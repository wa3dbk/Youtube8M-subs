he's a video game store clerk now what
that<00:01:48.619> tells<00:01:48.860> me<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.100> he's<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:49.940> big<00:01:50.210> fan<00:01:50.509> of

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
that tells me is he's a big fan of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.540 
that tells me is he's a big fan of
assassins<00:01:51.229> creed<00:01:51.440> 4<00:01:51.500> where<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.399> main

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
assassins creed 4 where the main

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.810 
assassins creed 4 where the main
character<00:01:52.580> is<00:01:53.210> Edward<00:01:54.140> Kenway<00:01:54.679> so<00:01:55.549> I<00:01:55.579> think

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
character is Edward Kenway so I think

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850 
character is Edward Kenway so I think
that<00:01:56.060> definitely<00:01:56.509> shows<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.930> direct<00:01:57.350> link

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
that definitely shows a direct link

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.459 
that definitely shows a direct link
between<00:01:57.950> both<00:01:58.579> universes<00:01:59.329> to<00:01:59.540> each<00:01:59.689> other<00:01:59.960> I'd

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
between both universes to each other I'd

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.260
