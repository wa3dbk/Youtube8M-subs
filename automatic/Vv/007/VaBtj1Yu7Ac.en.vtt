large<00:01:56.320> cities<00:01:56.740> as<00:01:56.890> well<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.850> what<00:01:58.090> really<00:01:58.360> is

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
large cities as well but what really is

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.780 
large cities as well but what really is
the<00:01:58.899> point<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.290> all<00:01:59.439> this<00:01:59.649> like<00:01:59.979> what<00:02:00.579> do<00:02:00.640> they

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the point of all this like what do they

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.969 
the point of all this like what do they
what<00:02:01.270> do<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:01.570> really<00:02:01.869> driving<00:02:02.110> at<00:02:02.350> this

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
what do they like really driving at this

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.010 
what do they like really driving at this
is<00:02:03.159> one<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.369> those<00:02:03.549> like<00:02:03.969> really<00:02:04.390> liberal

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
is one of those like really liberal

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.830 
is one of those like really liberal
ideas<00:02:05.649> if<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.310> just<00:02:06.490> break<00:02:06.909> up<00:02:06.969> poverty<00:02:07.659> and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
ideas if we just break up poverty and

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.889 
ideas if we just break up poverty and
just<00:02:08.019> mix<00:02:08.619> people<00:02:09.190> then<00:02:09.970> poverty<00:02:10.539> will<00:02:10.720> go

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
just mix people then poverty will go

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.619 
just mix people then poverty will go
away<00:02:11.020> or<00:02:11.530> poverty<00:02:12.250> won't<00:02:12.580> have<00:02:12.910> as<00:02:13.150> much<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.540> an

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
away or poverty won't have as much of an

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.570 
away or poverty won't have as much of an
effect<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.370> mean

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
effect I mean

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.740 
effect I mean
only<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.850> could<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.180> turn<00:02:16.300> around<00:02:16.450> and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
only you could just turn around and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
only you could just turn around and
don'ts<00:02:16.990> end<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.440> system<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.890> keeps<00:02:18.130> causing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
don'ts end the system that keeps causing

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.070 
don'ts end the system that keeps causing
poverty<00:02:19.030> but<00:02:19.210> they<00:02:19.360> are<00:02:19.480> liberals<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:19.960> they

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
poverty but they are liberals and they

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.570 
poverty but they are liberals and they
don't<00:02:20.260> want<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.530> do<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.650> they<00:02:21.220> want<00:02:21.490> this

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
don't want to do that they want this

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.440 
don't want to do that they want this

a long history of this kind of idea
being<00:02:35.200> pushed<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.740> what<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.100> really<00:02:36.220> means

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
being pushed and what it really means

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.730 
being pushed and what it really means
one<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.690> things<00:02:37.990> about<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.560> that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
one of the things about it is that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.040 
one of the things about it is that
they're<00:02:39.430> trying<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:40.000> give<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:41.580> kind<00:02:42.580> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
they're trying to give it this kind of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.000 
they're trying to give it this kind of
anti<00:02:44.050> class<00:02:44.410> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:46.080> kind<00:02:47.080> of<00:02:47.200> program<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.890> it

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
anti class kind of kind of program to it

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.800 
anti class kind of kind of program to it
like<00:02:48.220> they're<00:02:48.760> trying<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.090> show<00:02:49.270> okay<00:02:49.570> look

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
like they're trying to show okay look

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.510 
like they're trying to show okay look
here's<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.230> upper<00:02:50.530> class<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> lower

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
here's the upper class in the lower

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.580 
here's the upper class in the lower
class<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.450> know<00:02:52.570> we<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.110> both<00:02:53.290> live

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
class and you know we can both live

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.500 
class and you know we can both live
together<00:02:53.800> in<00:02:54.100> peace<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.730> know<00:02:54.820> it's<00:02:55.270> not<00:02:55.450> a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
together in peace you know it's not a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.300 
together in peace you know it's not a
big<00:02:55.810> deal<00:02:55.840> we're<00:02:56.590> both<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.280> same

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
big deal we're both in the same

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.660 
big deal we're both in the same
neighborhood<00:02:58.440> therefore<00:02:59.440> your<00:02:59.709> ideas<00:03:00.400> of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
neighborhood therefore your ideas of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.630 
neighborhood therefore your ideas of
class<00:03:01.360> conflict<00:03:01.840> really<00:03:02.800> aren't<00:03:03.250> true

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
class conflict really aren't true

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310 
class conflict really aren't true
because<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.240> know<00:03:04.360> we're<00:03:04.600> both<00:03:04.720> living<00:03:05.050> in

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
because you know we're both living in

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.520 
because you know we're both living in
the<00:03:05.440> same<00:03:05.650> area<00:03:05.950> right<00:03:06.930> so<00:03:07.930> therefore<00:03:08.350> your

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the same area right so therefore your

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
the same area right so therefore your
hostilities<00:03:09.220> or<00:03:09.280> your<00:03:09.459> antagonism<00:03:10.000> between

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
hostilities or your antagonism between

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.850 
hostilities or your antagonism between
classes<00:03:10.900> aren't<00:03:11.080> something<00:03:11.470> that's<00:03:11.620> really

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
classes aren't something that's really

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.320 
classes aren't something that's really
real<00:03:12.250> it's<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:12.640> something<00:03:12.940> that's<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.209> your

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
real it's just something that's in your

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.850 
real it's just something that's in your
head<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:13.959> we<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:14.560> all<00:03:14.709> get

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
head because you see we can all get

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.460 
head because you see we can all get
along<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.280> can<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:16.090> can<00:03:16.270> all<00:03:16.390> live<00:03:16.750> together<00:03:16.990> so

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
along we can we can all live together so

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.380 
along we can we can all live together so
those<00:03:18.030> antagonisms<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.120> exist<00:03:19.330> between

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
those antagonisms that exist between

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.120 
those antagonisms that exist between
classes<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.230> know<00:03:20.350> don't<00:03:20.680> really<00:03:20.980> exist

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
classes you know don't really exist

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.610 
classes you know don't really exist
which<00:03:21.940> is<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.150> course<00:03:22.180> absolutely<00:03:22.690> untrue<00:03:23.320> and

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
which is of course absolutely untrue and

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.650 
which is of course absolutely untrue and
this<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.190> one<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.459> those<00:03:24.610> things<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.030> is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
this is one of those things that is

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960 
this is one of those things that is
designed<00:03:26.170> by<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.920> upper<00:03:27.190> classes<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.670> try<00:03:27.910> to

designed by the upper classes to try to

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.920 
designed by the upper classes to try to

differences<00:03:37.000> don't<00:03:37.209> really<00:03:37.450> mean<00:03:37.630> anything

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
differences don't really mean anything

a<00:03:40.930> great<00:03:41.260> example<00:03:41.650> of<00:03:42.130> contradictions<00:03:43.000> among

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
a great example of contradictions among

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.540 
a great example of contradictions among
the<00:03:43.360> capitalist<00:03:43.870> class<00:03:43.900> with<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.860> program<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
the capitalist class with this program I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.430 
the capitalist class with this program I
mean<00:03:46.030> clearly<00:03:46.300> when<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.690> take<00:03:46.900> poor<00:03:47.170> people

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
mean clearly when you take poor people

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.420 
mean clearly when you take poor people
and<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:47.590> move<00:03:47.769> them<00:03:47.920> into<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.190> same

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
and you move them into the same

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.490 
and you move them into the same

middle class people they're not going to
like<00:03:57.130> it<00:03:57.269> because<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.600> existence<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410

it<00:04:04.570> which<00:04:04.690> means<00:04:04.870> there's<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.200> lot<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.680> know

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
it which means there's a lot of you know

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.860 
it which means there's a lot of you know
upper-middle<00:04:06.489> class<00:04:06.670> or<00:04:06.880> wealthy<00:04:07.269> people<00:04:07.450> who

are going to complain about this because

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.280 
are going to complain about this because
their<00:04:10.030> property<00:04:10.510> dollars<00:04:10.750> are<00:04:10.840> going<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:11.050> go

their property dollars are going to go

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.410 
their property dollars are going to go
down<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:12.190> they're<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:12.640> going<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.970> want<00:04:13.030> these

in<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.370> end<00:05:10.669> I<00:05:10.910> don't<00:05:11.270> think<00:05:11.479> this<00:05:11.570> is

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
in the end I don't think this is

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.180 
in the end I don't think this is
actually<00:05:11.900> going<00:05:12.289> to<00:05:12.380> do<00:05:12.620> anything<00:05:12.830> and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
actually going to do anything and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.450 
actually going to do anything and
historically<00:05:14.060> it<00:05:14.780> hasn't<00:05:15.229> achieved<00:05:15.320> what<00:05:16.310> it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
historically it hasn't achieved what it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.640 
historically it hasn't achieved what it
is<00:05:16.669> at<00:05:16.849> at<00:05:16.940> once<00:05:17.180> because<00:05:17.720> what<00:05:18.410> ends<00:05:18.560> up

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
is at at once because what ends up

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.790 
is at at once because what ends up

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
happening is that with the the housing

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.159 
happening is that with the the housing
divide<00:05:22.099> between<00:05:22.550> rich<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.389> poor<00:05:23.479> which<00:05:24.020> is

divide between rich and poor which is

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.290 
divide between rich and poor which is
created<00:05:24.800> by<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.039> market<00:05:25.490> and<00:05:25.699> the<00:05:25.880> poverty

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
created by the market and the poverty

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.050 
created by the market and the poverty
and<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:27.110> wealth<00:05:27.830> divide<00:05:28.190> also<00:05:28.639> created<00:05:28.970> by

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
and the wealth divide also created by

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.909 
and the wealth divide also created by
the<00:05:29.120> market<00:05:29.479> and<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:30.139> continually<00:05:30.560> the<00:05:30.710> same

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
the market and to continually the same

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.640 
the market and to continually the same
thing<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:31.970> people<00:05:32.000> with<00:05:32.630> money<00:05:33.050> are<00:05:33.320> going<00:05:33.530> to

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
thing so people with money are going to

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.830 
thing so people with money are going to
move<00:05:33.860> away<00:05:34.099> from<00:05:34.639> these<00:05:34.940> decreased<00:05:35.539> home

move away from these decreased home
values<00:05:36.349> which<00:05:37.099> are<00:05:37.250> caused<00:05:37.520> by<00:05:37.820> the<00:05:37.880> market

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
values which are caused by the market

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.570 
values which are caused by the market
and<00:05:38.570> then<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.500> property<00:05:39.800> values<00:05:39.979> go<00:05:40.009> down<00:05:40.340> and

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
and then the property values go down and

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.189 
and then the property values go down and
poor<00:05:40.880> people<00:05:40.909> are<00:05:41.539> going<00:05:41.659> to<00:05:41.750> build<00:05:41.900> a<00:05:41.960> forward

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
poor people are going to build a forward

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.499 
poor people are going to build a forward
those<00:05:42.320> places<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:42.979> move<00:05:43.340> in<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.240> also

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
those places and move in so it also

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.700 
those places and move in so it also
becomes<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:45.199> low-income<00:05:46.130> area<00:05:46.610> all<00:05:47.240> of<00:05:48.139> this<00:05:48.380> is

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
becomes a low-income area all of this is

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.740 
becomes a low-income area all of this is
clearly<00:05:49.159> being<00:05:49.430> created<00:05:49.909> by<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.090> market<00:05:50.539> and

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750
