00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
and development of the brain let's just

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
and development of the brain let's just
say<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.409> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> linear

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
say that it's kind of going on a linear

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
say that it's kind of going on a linear
trajectory<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> moving<00:01:40.290> up

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
trajectory and it's kind of moving up

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.910 
trajectory and it's kind of moving up
like<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.159> every<00:01:41.909> time<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.450> brain

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
like that for every time that brain

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
like that for every time that brain
receives<00:01:43.920> an<00:01:44.159> injury<00:01:44.490> or<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.909> kind<00:01:45.119> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
receives an injury or some kind of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
receives an injury or some kind of
insult<00:01:45.479> well<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.710> processing<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
insult well that that processing that

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
insult well that that processing that
development<00:01:48.299> does<00:01:48.479> drop<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.170> becomes

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
development does drop and becomes

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
development does drop and becomes
impaired<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.579> bit<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.390> even<00:01:51.689> if

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
impaired just a little bit and even if

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
impaired just a little bit and even if
it<00:01:51.869> gets<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.110> chance<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.439> recover<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.189> never
