00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.080
 peace permeates the mysterious origin of the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.080
 lifetime 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.220
 this is peace permian is a term that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.520
 comes already from the anaxÃ¡goras Greeks 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.960
 joys faure or that already spoke of the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.290
 possibility of life on earth 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.710
 came from space and in general this 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.720
 term what it means is that life 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 not only is it the land but the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.949
 life is in the universe in general I 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.400
 I know that for many of you this sounds 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.460
 ridiculous and they are totally sure that 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.830
 in life is let's say plagued come in and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.100
 you go but there are still scientists and there are 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:11.590
 people who believe that life only 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.140
 is given on earth and 1903 a scientist 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.310
 that was called arrhenius enamel prize 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.920
 nobel and already defended this in with thesis and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.860
 I already had in fact some 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.200
 ways that he saw with proofs not of 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.150
 done and there is currently a meteor 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 called alh 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:36.190
 84 001 a meteor that knows 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.740
 it's from Mars and inside the structure 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.970
 from the same meteor have been found 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.550
 let's say indications that there was life in 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.010
 that meteor does not know if when it arrived 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.200
 life in guayas the extinct in that 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.810
 meteor or if when work came from 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.580
 somehow bacteria actually part 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.590
 of this hypothesis speaks of the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.680
 superbacteria a bacterium that achieves 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 live a nucleus in the conditions of 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.950
 space and know that they can even 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.649
 resist very low temperatures 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.840
 temperatures or a lack of oxygen by 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.810
 a good enough time to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.750
 reach different planets and carry 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.020
 life and ponchito 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 but maybe the most important thing about this 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.670
 hypothesis is that permia peace does not 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.820
 solves the great mystery of the human being 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.570
 not where or rather as it originates in 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.870
 life what was the real principle of what 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.390
 of what existed as the first living being 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.780
 not as the first best microbe 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.120
 first bacterium that has survived 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.390
 that started what we know today 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.550
 like life, peace, but anyway 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.500
 being a term that draws attention 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.470
 and that science still fails 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.800
 let's say check not for sure if 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.640
 the universe is plagued with life or the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.600
 let's say earth is a coincidence 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.410
 let's say unique fact obviously every time 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.660
 more science is open and let's say 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.630
 by the conditions of other planets 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.220
 They are still being discovered realize 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.170
 that the conditions they have are very 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.890
 similar to the earth and that surely 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.440
 not very likely have in life inside in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.840
 the personal I think the universe is 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.810
 full of life and not only life 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.060
 simple biological but intelligent life 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.430
 but good is another topic and we will be 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.800
 chatting soon for now we leave you 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.950
 this term of peace permia up 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.950
 then
