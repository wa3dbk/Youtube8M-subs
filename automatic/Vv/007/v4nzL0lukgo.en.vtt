00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.050
 after so many years working in the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.820
 sheds give the maximum for the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.190
 putignano carnival is always for me 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.900
 here is an honor the boy and therefore 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.790
 he was intrigued and a world that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.860
 fascinated the first day I am 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 found here to peek so arrive i 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 rats nino what was being realized on 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.200
 second maybe they try to give one 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.410
 hand to move something the third 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.540
 that he had an overall work around three 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.370
 months in the year let's say we could tell 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.820
 free time word passion so strong 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.560
 that many times they put themselves aside 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.619
 all commitments are fighting by 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.720
 of families , girlfriends or at least 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.640
 families girlfriends if they want 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.640
 find us come here to give us a hand 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.830
 It is a beautiful commitment, it is also a burden 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.260
 honor because then see that finished 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.170
 that the construction itself has begun 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.340
 no of the whole event that goes from 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.700
 from the construction of the wagons to see 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.849
 raise all these people who put themselves 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.400
 available to then do the 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.920
 manifestation that can also be in the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.569
 masked groups or in masks of 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 character that are carts a little more 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.720
 small enough to think that they move 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.989
 at least 2,000 2,500 people for the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.989
 carnival 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.440
 there are moments of tension from the beginning 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 because here we need to understand how 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.900
 to give the maximum 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.480
 close to the subject than the words when 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.790
 then to the finished work instead there 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.920
 we unload doing it called it 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.560
 our eve the day before 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.670
 first show we unload with also 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.329
 with other colleagues 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.970
 there is a bit of bad luck and after the first one 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.389
 parade the first thing you are looking for 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.260
 understand if the cabbage liked that 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.260
 wanted was a fire 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.700
 remarkable sacrifice to leave him alone 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.629
 the economic aspect thinks affects 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.579
 a lot but if everything goes outside the 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.510
 work and carnival all my life 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.549
 social life of family couple comes 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.230
 almost all canceled because unfortunately 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.200
 I was free time so it's not a 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.450
 activity and every time clipping that the 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.719
 work lets us dedicate it to the 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.719
 carnival 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:09.139
 finding ourselves in such a context 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.469
 nice and so you can promote the 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.230
 territory in a period in which it is the 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.030
 tourism how to say is a little dormant not 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.130
 because all our states come from us 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.070
 because then there is the sea, that is the hill 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.990
 the campaign is the most needed 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 rediscover all who are the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.289
 tourism also linked to the grohl e 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.389
 mental so much so that the mask of 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.690
 farinella really represents our own 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.409
 peculiarity as farinella and a is 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 a poor meal that the peasants used 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:43.039
 when they ended up in the fields to work 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.259
 they had this ground chickpea and that 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.780
 then then this chickpea flour that 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.409
 then they mixed the oil with oil 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.619
 olive or 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:59.909
 the sauce that was advancing and therefore ne 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:05:01.860
 they made a meal on the cleaning itself 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.749
 from the drawing then you get to the glue 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.469
 the glue we pee the glue 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:10.259
 of flour is spoken of since i 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.999
 bosses since I started working e 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.409
 there is nothing that holds that is 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:17.039
 we have practically never been able to 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.769
 change nothing then the cast is done 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:28.259
 it is filled with various layers of paper 

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:30.239
 crush and in the evening before expiring, lift it 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.039
 live look at so free I did 

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.050
 there is also personal satisfaction but 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.319
 to have achieved something from nothing 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:41.179
 is not money the contribution that 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:44.639
 foundation passes non-tanker who makes the 

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:47.550
 competition but it is also a simple one 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.009
 trophy conceals the desire to win the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.719
 first prize that gives us that office ee 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.719
 try to do better if in the next 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.800
 This year we did a project 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.210
 elementary school so i went 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.420
 I personally with a teacher 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.940
 papier-mache to explain what it is from 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.060
 where the carnival originates 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.790
 so I spoke from the offshoots 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.580
 because we start the carnival on the 26th 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.260
 December with this rite from 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.000
 offshoots I explained to them what 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.450
 They are an offshoot of what is a strain 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.760
 so much so that the slogan was diuno shop pro 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:33.630
 to have this bridge not between 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.850
 generations between the old generations e 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:49.290
 the new generations open a window 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:52.230
 a bin the feeling and the passion to us 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.840
 it binds us to the carnival to the passion that is 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:58.169
 we don't have a day where to say that 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.900
 day I go invention does not exist like 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:03.900
 once a colleague of mine once said yes 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.889
 it arrives that only the day it will not be able to 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.249
 more walking 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.249
 but no
