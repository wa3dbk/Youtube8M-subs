00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.199
 good morning from home everything in today 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.770
 we will provide an excellent jam of 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:22.330
 apricots one of what just cooked 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.939
 that the first wash should be chosen for 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.859
 remove the dust then choose well 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.699
 well to avoid that there are 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.770
 inside some gear or so 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.079
 they must be beautiful fresh boiled without 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.960
 of bruises someone like this 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.879
 we will eliminate it with a knife to avoid 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.879
 that our mother and the other can 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.250
 go bad then we'll smash like 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.370
 he is also doing the norm in this 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.960
 so this is over because it is not 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:57.789
 good and then we will put them to cook in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 a pot of sun then we will add it 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:04.330
 Sugar moved before we choose the 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:10.600
 police see all hazelnut then them 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:13.230
 weight and based on the net weight pull 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.940
 of the stones we will add the sugar 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.950
 generally in equal quantities however 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.840
 because he loves less sweet jam 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.170
 we could also add a few ounces 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.500
 missing compared to the dose of 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.290
 clean apricots we will clean it first 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.570
 all very well and then we'll show how 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.860
 proceed again after selling a show 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.460
 side the apricot books we put on 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.340
 balance and and we think are two pounds and 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.970
 we will then put them in a pot of 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 steel 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:56.670
 and we will cook over moderate heat 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.509
 on the fire alone and we mix every 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.509
 so much every now and then 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:19.180
 of apricots are software 7 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:23.560
 add a little water each 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.570
 late we mix apricots to avoid 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 which therefore hides that 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:34.750
 can burn hard of apricots 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:42.700
 the great in this consistency 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:50.590
 we will add a lemon juice juice 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:58.750
 a lemon also half depending on the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:03:03.370
 size of the lemon and then if you don't like it 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.380
 plenty of shower 66 kg of sugar for each 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.260
 kilo of apricots in this case that 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.860
 how were two pounds we will add a 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.860
 kilo and 200 kg 3 of sugar 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.060
 we must add another 200 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.959
 grams 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:32.800
 we mix we let you resume in 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:35.440
 dust and now we must have 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.280
 particular attention because the junta 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.280
 and the sugar will tend to suck 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.810
 more or less time elapsed 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.900
 for the cooking 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.170
 we will do the cold saucer test 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.349
 we will make strong but denied we will put it 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.080
 on the plate we make it polar itself 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:07.060
 consistency and this is the jam and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.810
 ready hard challenge in the fire and the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.690
 let it cool for a few minutes 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.100

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:30.360
 graduated cylinder the transcript I hear 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.970
 cylinder in a very practical way 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.090
 without getting dirty they can fill up 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.080
 these gazettes affection better and 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.080
 sterilized 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:56.259
 we know pretty well e 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.199
 let's turn one upside down for a few minutes 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:03.009
 maximum access to the reverse 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.639
 motion forming burn 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:11.139
 perfect brody that paths ten 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:17.729
 minutes and we're going to type report it 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:22.120
