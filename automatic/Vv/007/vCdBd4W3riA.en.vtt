00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:08.890
 alice good today I come with this 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:12.910
 hairstyle that is as typical typical 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.679
 of these hair instagram accounts 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.930
 for which I follow that by the way 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.420
 I always leave it down in the info box 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.850
 my Twitter instagram account and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.570
 facebook then if you want to follow me and 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.310
 well, I like many, I think 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.580
 we also continue because those accounts are 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:34.210
 they put super cool pictures that if 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.060
 some super nice hairstyles and such and such 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.900
 excellence what always wins is a 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:44.470
 Super chubby root braid 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.510
 and as you can see, it is not impossible to do it 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.199
 with a hair 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.079
 short half mane so to speak is 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.760
 possible yes it is true that with a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.609
 Meter of hair is much prettier 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.410
 but hey this is the cabin left 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.910
 I hope you like the video very much and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.449
 let's see what the event is like 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.449
 Y 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.240
 what we are going to do is comb all the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.240
 hair 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.260
 and we are going to take 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.430
 what is all this part as I have 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.280
 done this I do it because I do not 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.580
 I like the line on the other side 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.130
 that is pretty ugly then eye 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.530
 part between slave is the end of a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.830
 side I pass it to the center below the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 another to the center below, the other to 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.190
 center down and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.420
 get hair put anywhere 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.220
 and just add 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.520
 from center to center below and add 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520
 per 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.470
 to the center per eye 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.180
 when you 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.209
 in your work and we add perfect 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.209
 center down and 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.209
 we add 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.769
 inside work and we add but 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 red center 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.560
 morning 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.320
 is that I'm not going to do this faster 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.840
 that is in fast camera because it is 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.840
 foolishness because it does not take anything 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.510
 already when there is never more hair than 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.210
 add simply then we continue 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.190
 making the braid as far as you 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.090
 your hair if you have a long hair 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.860
 it will be very much 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:17.200
 and most beautiful on the road 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.190
 and we are missing and leaving a ponytail 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.570
 little 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.570
 and you put a rubber band 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.970
 and we just have to make it pretty 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 to make the beanie the only thing we're going 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.880
 to do is pinch only in the part of 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.470
 outside 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.470
 we preach the outside part 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.390
 and you can do it orbital that 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.850
 you like it 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.850
 and from always working upwards 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.430
 that's why it's important to leave enough 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.879
 hair down there because if I'm not more than 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.879
 touch 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.550
 do not 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.819
 what 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.370
 you see that what I hope 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.169
 I do not have elements 6 if you see it in front 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:21.690
 and face because there is not much hair either 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.580
 all these girls then in install 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.250
 scope those things are made the strawberry 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.590
 Well, in the beautiful part of the press, 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.000
 then the only thing you can do is 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.230
 its brightness 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.520
 hold it with a fork 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.520
 and the station 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.060
 basically how it looks like on that side 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.460
 which it is like a very gordita chalk 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.460
 here it seems that you have a lot of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.789
 hair and really it's also not true 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:02.439
 So extension needs those things 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:05.080
 they help a lot but what I do 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:07.150
 I leave a picture like that on the other hand 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.199
 lives a lot of hair and for what methods or 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.699
 hairs that is I would be without story 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.129
 I hope you liked the tuto 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:19.810
