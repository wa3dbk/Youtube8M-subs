an opportunity to see these tools and

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:40.880 
an opportunity to see these tools and
how<00:00:37.410> they're<00:00:37.649> used<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.809> start<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.530> have

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
how they're used so to start with I have

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.899 
how they're used so to start with I have
a<00:00:40.920> side<00:00:41.159> mold<00:00:41.429> this<00:00:41.609> is<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.909> 17<00:00:42.329> inch<00:00:42.510> body

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
a side mold this is for 17 inch body

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.040 
a side mold this is for 17 inch body
three<00:00:44.909> layers<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.269> veneer<00:00:45.719> would<00:00:45.929> get

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
three layers of veneer would get

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.930 
three layers of veneer would get
sandwiched<00:00:46.499> in<00:00:46.679> here<00:00:46.949> with<00:00:47.219> blue<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.609> between

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
sandwiched in here with blue in between

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.809 
sandwiched in here with blue in between
when<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> glue<00:00:48.960> dries<00:00:49.339> it<00:00:50.339> will<00:00:50.370> hold<00:00:50.640> its

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
when the glue dries it will hold its

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.130 
when the glue dries it will hold its
shape<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.569> this<00:00:51.659> is<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> base<00:00:52.050> side<00:00:54.140> here's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
shape so this is the base side here's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
shape so this is the base side here's
the<00:00:55.289> treble<00:00:55.620> side<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.010> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the treble side you can see that this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.419 
the treble side you can see that this
will<00:00:59.870> force<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> veneer<00:01:01.409> into<00:01:01.649> shape<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
will force the veneer into shape now the

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.549 
will force the veneer into shape now the
video<00:01:02.670> itself<00:01:02.999> is<00:01:03.210> very<00:01:03.359> thin<00:01:03.659> it's<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
video itself is very thin it's about a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.149 
video itself is very thin it's about a
40<00:01:04.949> second<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> an<00:01:05.670> inch<00:01:05.760> thick<00:01:06.120> that's<00:01:06.450> 20<00:01:07.290> mm

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

maple<00:01:15.810> veneer<00:01:16.760> see<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.940> looks<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.690> little

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
maple veneer see this looks a little

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
maple veneer see this looks a little
better<00:01:18.990> maybe<00:01:19.230> and<00:01:20.330> for<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> outer<00:01:21.570> layer

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
better maybe and for the outer layer

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
better maybe and for the outer layer
that<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:24.740> claim<00:01:25.740> maple<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that you see claim maple right the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
that you see claim maple right the
outside<00:01:27.540> layer<00:01:27.750> needs<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.080> be<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.500> more

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
outside layer needs to be a little more

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.290 
outside layer needs to be a little more
attractive

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.720 

I've<00:01:34.300> now<00:01:34.510> cut<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.930> linear<00:01:35.500> downsize<00:01:36.100> both

I've now cut the linear downsize both

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.720 
I've now cut the linear downsize both
sides<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.200> longer<00:01:38.650> open<00:01:39.160> time<00:01:39.370> blue

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
sides and I have a longer open time blue

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.610 
sides and I have a longer open time blue
to<00:01:40.000> be<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.210> little<00:01:40.450> more<00:01:40.570> opportunity<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.470> give

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
got the tail block and neck block in

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.950 
got the tail block and neck block in
place<00:04:00.350> to<00:04:00.620> link<00:04:00.860> everything<00:04:00.980> together<00:04:01.960> this

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
place to link everything together this

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.020 
place to link everything together this
seems<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.440> have<00:04:03.530> its<00:04:03.740> kerfing<00:04:04.100> install<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
seems to have its kerfing install and

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.470 
seems to have its kerfing install and
it'll<00:04:05.750> be<00:04:05.900> ready<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.740> accept<00:04:07.520> on<00:04:07.970> top<00:04:08.210> of<00:04:08.420> the

it'll be ready to accept on top of the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.870 
it'll be ready to accept on top of the

plates<00:04:14.300> I<00:04:14.630> have<00:04:15.050> more<00:04:16.040> veneer<00:04:16.340> all<00:04:17.049> maple

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
plates I have more veneer all maple

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.780 
plates I have more veneer all maple
again<00:04:18.320> that's<00:04:18.530> what<00:04:18.620> RC<00:04:18.920> did<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.340> lot<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.640> times

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
again that's what RC did a lot of times

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.850 
again that's what RC did a lot of times
you'll<00:04:20.030> see<00:04:20.209> in<00:04:20.299> production<00:04:20.720> guitars<00:04:20.989> maple

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:21.860 
you'll see in production guitars maple

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.350 
you'll see in production guitars maple
on<00:04:21.920> the<00:04:22.040> outer<00:04:22.160> layers<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.550> popular<00:04:23.090> on<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
on the outer layers and popular on the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.430 
on the outer layers and popular on the
inner<00:04:23.480> layers<00:04:23.720> but<00:04:23.960> are<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.200> you<00:04:24.290> did<00:04:24.410> all

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
inner layers but are so you did all

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.950 
inner layers but are so you did all
maple<00:04:26.620> when<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.740> lay<00:04:27.920> up<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.310> veneers

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
maple when we lay up the veneers

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.030 
maple when we lay up the veneers
traditionally<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.200> cross<00:04:30.440> lamination

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
traditionally it's a cross lamination

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.340 
traditionally it's a cross lamination
process<00:04:31.190> right<00:04:31.640> so<00:04:31.760> every<00:04:32.030> layer<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.870> glued<00:04:33.170> up

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
process right so every layer is glued up

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.890 
process right so every layer is glued up
with<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.800> grain<00:04:34.280> oriented<00:04:34.850> opposite<00:04:35.810> each

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
with the grain oriented opposite each

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.210 
with the grain oriented opposite each
other<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.350> that's<00:04:36.470> what<00:04:36.650> I'll<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:36.890> for<00:04:37.130> the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
other and that's what I'll do for the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.650 
other and that's what I'll do for the
back<00:04:37.400> plate<00:04:37.670> I<00:04:38.770> have<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:40.040> make<00:04:42.310> four<00:04:43.450> sets<00:04:44.450> of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
back plate I have to make four sets of

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.380 
back plate I have to make four sets of
these<00:04:44.930> two<00:04:45.290> ply<00:04:46.100> laminations<00:04:49.000> RC<00:04:50.000> did<00:04:50.210> not

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
these two ply laminations RC did not

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.280 
these two ply laminations RC did not
take<00:04:51.140> five<00:04:51.560> plies<00:04:52.750> which<00:04:53.750> together<00:04:54.110> will

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
take five plies which together will

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.950 
take five plies which together will
still<00:04:54.470> be<00:04:54.560> less<00:04:54.740> than<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.630> need<00:04:56.630> them<00:04:56.780> an<00:04:56.840> inch

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
still be less than I need them an inch

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960 
still be less than I need them an inch
thick<00:04:57.230> these<00:04:57.440> are<00:04:57.560> implies<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:58.700> he<00:04:58.790> didn't

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
thick these are implies but he didn't

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.159 
thick these are implies but he didn't
take<00:04:59.060> five<00:04:59.360> plies<00:04:59.660> and<00:04:59.690> put<00:04:59.960> them<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.110> the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
take five plies and put them in the

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.600 
take five plies and put them in the
press<00:05:00.380> all<00:05:00.560> at<00:05:00.650> once<00:05:00.830> that's<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.130> lot<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.430> deal

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
press all at once that's a lot to deal

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.520 
press all at once that's a lot to deal
with<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:02.030> because<00:05:02.780> he<00:05:02.870> used<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.140> water-based

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
with and because he used a water-based

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.960 
with and because he used a water-based
blue<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:03.950> I'll<00:05:04.040> do<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.280> same<00:05:04.490> that's<00:05:04.730> also<00:05:04.940> a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
blue and I'll do the same that's also a

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.370 
blue and I'll do the same that's also a
lot<00:05:05.120> of<00:05:05.180> moisture<00:05:05.600> that's<00:05:05.780> trapped<00:05:06.080> inside

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
lot of moisture that's trapped inside

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.640 
lot of moisture that's trapped inside
those<00:05:06.860> plies<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:07.490> by<00:05:07.610> doing<00:05:07.870> pairs<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.350> time

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
those plies so by doing pairs and time

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.500 
those plies so by doing pairs and time
it's<00:05:10.100> much<00:05:10.310> easy<00:05:10.490> much<00:05:10.669> more<00:05:10.820> manageable<00:05:11.000> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
it's much easy much more manageable the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.960 
it's much easy much more manageable the
glue<00:05:11.660> cures<00:05:11.930> old<00:05:12.260> better<00:05:12.530> so<00:05:13.220> I'll<00:05:13.340> end<00:05:13.700> up

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
glue cures old better so I'll end up

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.840 
glue cures old better so I'll end up
with

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
with

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
flats all blue these two up and put them

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.920 
flats all blue these two up and put them
in<00:05:19.980> here<00:05:20.280> as<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.640> simple<00:05:21.030> presence<00:05:21.450> of<00:05:21.540> clamps

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
in here as a simple presence of clamps

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.650 
in here as a simple presence of clamps
you<00:05:22.860> should<00:05:23.070> let<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.280> cure<00:05:23.550> overnight<00:05:23.850> so

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
you should let that cure overnight so

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.250 
you should let that cure overnight so
I'll<00:05:24.780> have<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.490> somewhat<00:05:26.490> rigid<00:05:26.790> flat<00:05:27.420> plate

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
I'll have a somewhat rigid flat plate

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.430 
I'll have a somewhat rigid flat plate
I'll<00:05:29.040> take<00:05:29.280> two<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:29.490> those<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.840> new<00:05:31.050> piece

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
I'll take two of those and a new piece

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.130 
I'll take two of those and a new piece
of<00:05:31.470> veneer<00:05:32.040> in<00:05:32.370> between<00:05:32.670> for<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.600> total<00:05:33.870> of<00:05:33.930> five

sheets<00:05:34.440> put<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:35.280> into<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.640> real<00:05:35.790> press

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
sheets put that into the real press

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.600
