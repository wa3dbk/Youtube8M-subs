00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
water I heard Stacy sale for a little

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.809 
water I heard Stacy sale for a little
bit<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.750> water<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.500> I'm<00:02:07.619> gonna<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.369> exact

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
bit of water so I'm gonna do the exact

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.530 
bit of water so I'm gonna do the exact
opposite<00:02:09.630> thing<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.430> other<00:02:11.670> words<00:02:12.000> make

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
opposite thing so in other words make

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
opposite thing so in other words make
that<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:13.110> cups<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.590> water<00:02:13.830> into<00:02:14.400> for<00:02:16.700> Stacy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that two cups of water into for Stacy

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.809 
that two cups of water into for Stacy
said<00:02:18.209> mix<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:18.900> until<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.370> liquid<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.790> I

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
said mix it until it's all liquid so I

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.059 
said mix it until it's all liquid so I
think<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.480> needs<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.140> bit<00:02:25.380> more<00:02:25.680> water

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
think this needs a little bit more water

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.650 
think this needs a little bit more water
I<00:02:29.540> personally<00:02:30.540> believe<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.299> better

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
I personally believe that this is better

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.750 
I personally believe that this is better
than<00:02:33.780> before<00:02:34.110> setting<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.099> monkey<00:02:35.760> flip<00:02:37.760> since

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
than before setting a monkey flip since

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.699 
than before setting a monkey flip since
we<00:02:38.940> don't<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.209> one<00:02:39.750> we're<00:02:40.049> using<00:02:40.079> a<00:02:40.470> piece<00:02:40.680> of

we don't have one we're using a piece of

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.569 
we don't have one we're using a piece of
