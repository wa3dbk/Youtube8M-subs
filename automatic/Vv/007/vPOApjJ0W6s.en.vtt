00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
every time that we look out this window

every time that we look out this window
or<00:00:31.140> we<00:00:31.410> look<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.860> windows<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.160> the

or we look out the windows and the
cupola<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:33.180> absolutely<00:00:33.510> amazed<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.320> and

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
cupola we're absolutely amazed and and
the<00:00:35.580> same<00:00:35.760> thing<00:00:35.910> goes<00:00:36.060> for<00:00:36.090> being<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.480> board<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the same thing goes for being on board a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
the same thing goes for being on board a
space<00:00:36.960> shuttle<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.500> i<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:39.090> say<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.510> two

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
space shuttle and i would say that two

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.390 
space shuttle and i would say that two
nights<00:00:39.870> ago<00:00:40.080> I<00:00:40.260> probably<00:00:40.680> saw<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> most

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
nights ago I probably saw the most

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.130 
nights ago I probably saw the most
amazing<00:00:41.550> thing<00:00:42.060> I<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.210> ever<00:00:42.420> seen<00:00:42.720> in<00:00:42.780> space

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
amazing thing I have ever seen in space
and<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.980> saying<00:00:44.190> an<00:00:44.280> awful<00:00:44.520> lot<00:00:44.610> because

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and that's saying an awful lot because

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
and that's saying an awful lot because
every<00:00:45.210> day<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.390> filled<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.870> amazing<00:00:46.170> things

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
every day is filled with amazing things

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229 
every day is filled with amazing things
and<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.340> was<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.700> were<00:00:47.790> flying<00:00:48.030> over

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and that was we were flying over

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
and that was we were flying over
Tasmania<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.260> had<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.739> seen<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
Tasmania we had actually just seen the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
Tasmania we had actually just seen the
storms<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.150> South<00:00:51.360> Pacific<00:00:51.540> over<00:00:52.140> the

storms in the South Pacific over the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
storms in the South Pacific over the
Philippines<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.040> it<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.180> nighttime

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
Philippines and it was nighttime

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.570 
Philippines and it was nighttime
thunderstorms<00:00:55.530> lighting<00:00:55.830> up<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.040> entire<00:00:56.250> sky

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.939 
thunderstorms lighting up the entire sky
and<00:00:56.850> then<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.809> before<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.170> Sun<00:00:58.379> came<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and then just before the Sun came up the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.560 
and then just before the Sun came up the
earth<00:00:59.070> slim<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.610> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.970> lit<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.360> as<00:01:00.540> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
earth slim was you know lit up as a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.010 
earth slim was you know lit up as a
sliver<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.290> blue<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.310> in<00:01:02.700> purple<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:03.570> then

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
sliver of blue and in purple and then

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.510 
sliver of blue and in purple and then
there<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.410> long<00:01:04.710> green<00:01:05.130> arc<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
there was this long green arc that

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.580 
there was this long green arc that
extended<00:01:06.060> probably<00:01:06.570> 10<00:01:06.810> degrees<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.259> so<00:01:07.410> from

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
extended probably 10 degrees or so from
the<00:01:07.740> horizon<00:01:08.390> actually<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.899> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the horizon actually from the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.840 
the horizon actually from the
perspective<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.649> cupola<00:01:11.160> which<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.790> which

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
perspective of the cupola which in which

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.389 
perspective of the cupola which in which
case<00:01:12.149> were<00:01:12.330> upside<00:01:12.690> down<00:01:12.899> up<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
case were upside down up up you know in

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:15.950 
case were upside down up up you know in
my<00:01:14.520> field<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.910> view<00:01:15.030> upwards<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> fact<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
my field of view upwards in fact it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
my field of view upwards in fact it
disappeared<00:01:16.440> behind<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.890> gym<00:01:17.130> at<00:01:17.640> least<00:01:17.970> 10

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.440 
disappeared behind the gym at least 10
degrees<00:01:18.509> i<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.990> twenty<00:01:19.590> earth<00:01:19.979> 20<00:01:20.729> moon

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.150 
degrees i think twenty earth 20 moon
diameters<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.470> think<00:01:22.740> about<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.130> those

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
diameters if you think about it in those

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.460 
diameters if you think about it in those
terms<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.820> i<00:01:24.180> had<00:01:24.300> no<00:01:24.330> idea<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.170> was

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
terms and i had no idea what it was was

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
terms and i had no idea what it was was
a<00:01:25.500> long<00:01:25.740> green<00:01:26.160> glowing<00:01:26.520> arc<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.050> turns<00:01:28.050> out

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
a long green glowing arc and turns out

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109 
a long green glowing arc and turns out
it<00:01:28.440> end<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.740> being<00:01:28.950> ended<00:01:29.190> up<00:01:29.340> being<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> comet

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
it end up being ended up being a comet

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120 
it end up being ended up being a comet
that<00:01:30.330> somebody<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.080> Tasmania<00:01:31.619> had<00:01:31.710> seen<00:01:31.920> about

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that somebody in Tasmania had seen about

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.430 
that somebody in Tasmania had seen about
the<00:01:32.250> same<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:32.520> Comet<00:01:33.150> Lovejoy<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:34.290> had

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the same time Comet Lovejoy that had

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.859 
the same time Comet Lovejoy that had
passed<00:01:34.619> about<00:01:35.180> 140,000<00:01:36.180> kilometres<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
passed about 140,000 kilometres from the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.320 
passed about 140,000 kilometres from the
surface<00:01:37.260> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> Sun<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.729> disappeared

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
surface of the Sun when it disappeared

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.880 
surface of the Sun when it disappeared
behind<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.720> Sun<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.409> astronomers

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
behind the Sun I think astronomers

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
behind the Sun I think astronomers
thought<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.670> appear<00:01:42.030> again<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
thought it would not appear again it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.390 
thought it would not appear again it
probably<00:01:42.690> would<00:01:42.810> burn<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.920> probably

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
probably would burn up but it's probably

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.890 
probably would burn up but it's probably
the<00:01:44.520> most<00:01:44.670> spectacular<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
the most spectacular thing you can

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.270 
the most spectacular thing you can
imagine<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> vantage<00:01:46.890> point<00:01:47.010> of

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
imagine and from the vantage point of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.670 
imagine and from the vantage point of
space<00:01:47.580> it's<00:01:48.360> different<00:01:48.840> than<00:01:49.020> seeing<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.470> from

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
space it's different than seeing it from

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
space it's different than seeing it from
Planet<00:01:50.070> Earth<00:01:50.159> because<00:01:50.610> there's<00:01:50.820> no

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
Planet Earth because there's no

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.390 
Planet Earth because there's no
intervening<00:01:51.360> atmosphere<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.250> took

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.370 
intervening atmosphere to see so we took
some<00:01:53.610> really<00:01:54.119> neat<00:01:54.299> pictures<00:01:54.659> last<00:01:55.080> night<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
some really neat pictures last night a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.140 
some really neat pictures last night a
bit<00:01:55.590> about<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> hundred<00:01:56.010> or<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.790> hope

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
bit about a hundred or so that we hope

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.719 
bit about a hundred or so that we hope
to<00:01:57.270> make<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> movie<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.430> just<00:01:59.430> wanted

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
to make a movie out of but just wanted

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.830 
to make a movie out of but just wanted
to<00:01:59.820> toss<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.540> case<00:02:00.689> you're

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
to toss that out in case you're

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.040 
to toss that out in case you're
interested<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.650> quite<00:02:01.830> a<00:02:01.860> place
