if<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:01.199> need<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.500> perform<00:00:01.620> some<00:00:02.190> commands<00:00:02.669> in

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
if you need to perform some commands in

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.849 
if you need to perform some commands in
cemetry<00:00:03.330> you<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.629> do<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.020> by<00:00:04.230> using<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.680> same

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
cemetry you can do so by using the same

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.150 
cemetry you can do so by using the same
user<00:00:05.100> tool<00:00:05.400> in<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.180> mCP<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:07.589> if<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.830> need<00:00:08.010> to

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
user tool in the mCP so if you need to

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.509 
user tool in the mCP so if you need to
draw<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.730> curve<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.480> cemetry<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:10.920> pick

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
draw a curve in cemetry you can pick

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.280 
draw a curve in cemetry you can pick
your<00:00:11.639> access<00:00:12.120> by<00:00:12.330> right<00:00:12.599> mouse<00:00:12.780> button<00:00:13.110> click

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
your access by right mouse button click

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
your access by right mouse button click
the<00:00:13.440> button<00:00:13.710> let's<00:00:13.950> say<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.250> want<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.519> have

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
the button let's say we want to have

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.670 
the button let's say we want to have
symmetry<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.809> XZ<00:00:16.199> access<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.410> I<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.560> go

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
symmetry in the XZ access and I can go

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.140 
symmetry in the XZ access and I can go
ahead<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.859> draw<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> curve<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.939> see

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ahead and draw a curve and you can see

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.230 
ahead and draw a curve and you can see
that<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.080> exit<00:00:22.529> tool<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> I

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
that if I exit tool you can see that I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.390 
that if I exit tool you can see that I
have<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.779> curve<00:00:25.170> mirrored<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> access

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
have a curve mirrored in that access

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
have a curve mirrored in that access
this<00:00:27.000> works<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.939> this<00:00:29.939> works<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
this works as well this works just the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.810 
this works as well this works just the
same<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:31.679> joints<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.850> does<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.710> curves

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
same with joints as it does with curves

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.569 
same with joints as it does with curves
so<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.239> see<00:00:36.420> now<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.750> able<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> draw<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
so you can see now I'm able to draw a

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.360 
so you can see now I'm able to draw a
symmetrical<00:00:38.579> joint<00:00:38.910> chain<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:44.100> works

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
symmetrical joint chain and this works

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
symmetrical joint chain and this works
with<00:00:44.640> vertices<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.480> well<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.200> you're

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
with vertices as well when you're

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.160 
with vertices as well when you're
working<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.770> geometry<00:00:47.960> you're<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
working with geometry you're going to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.540 
working with geometry you're going to
want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> make<00:00:49.530> sure<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.550> set<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:52.550> that

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
want to make sure that you set a that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.750 
want to make sure that you set a that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you set a cemetery map to store your

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
you set a cemetery map to store your
unit<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.300> symmetry<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:01.140> for<00:01:01.590> your

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
we were to hit w you can see this is the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.609 
we were to hit w you can see this is the
access<00:01:38.340> where<00:01:39.210> you're<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:40.229> you're<00:01:40.320> playing

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
access where you're where you're playing

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.310 
access where you're where you're playing
or<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.280> cemetery<00:01:41.700> plane<00:01:41.939> will<00:01:42.320> will

or where your cemetery plane will will

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
or where your cemetery plane will will
take<00:01:43.560> effect<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:44.850> ahead<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
take effect and we can go ahead and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
take effect and we can go ahead and
change<00:01:45.360> those<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> change<00:01:49.770> our

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
change those and we can change our

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.060 
change those and we can change our
tolerance<00:01:50.159> as<00:01:50.579> well<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> point<00:01:52.590> tolerance

tolerance as well the point tolerance

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.270 
tolerance as well the point tolerance
will<00:01:53.880> help<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.829> don't<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:56.040> perfect

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
will help if you don't have perfect

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.130 
will help if you don't have perfect
symmetry<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:59.009> sure<00:01:59.040> that

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
symmetry and you want to make sure that

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.969 
symmetry and you want to make sure that
you<00:02:01.140> move<00:02:01.590> points<00:02:02.100> within<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.640> range<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.740> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you move points within the range so that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.110 
you move points within the range so that
