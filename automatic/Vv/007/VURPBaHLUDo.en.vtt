to be careful of the panels that we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.210 
to be careful of the panels that we
don't<00:01:15.930> jar<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> edges<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.890> you've<00:01:17.040> done

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
here with the panel it looks like you've

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
here with the panel it looks like you've
rubbed<00:01:19.500> wood<00:01:19.740> ash<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.220> something<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> well

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150

it looks that way

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.450

after we painted the two coats of
terracotta<00:01:24.000> color<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.570> very<00:01:24.840> important<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
terracotta color it's very important to

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
terracotta color it's very important to
get<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.799> background<00:01:26.159> pores<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.150> wood

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
get the background pores of the wood

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.929 
get the background pores of the wood
with<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> technique<00:01:28.680> called<00:01:28.740> flogging<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.729> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with a technique called flogging we just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.030 
with a technique called flogging we just
use<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> long<00:01:30.390> hair<00:01:30.659> brush<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.860> use

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
use a long hair brush and we use

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
use a long hair brush and we use
straight<00:01:32.369> pigment<00:01:32.970> with<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> little<00:01:33.450> bit<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
straight pigment with a little bit of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.140 
straight pigment with a little bit of
beer<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.140> some<00:01:34.200> binder<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.150> ancient

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
beer and some binder and ancient

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.319 
beer and some binder and ancient
traditional<00:01:36.630> finish<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.119> brush<00:01:39.119> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
traditional finish you just brush that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.980 
traditional finish you just brush that
out<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.590> run<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.040> long<00:01:41.340> bristle<00:01:42.030> flogger

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
out and you run a long bristle flogger

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.539 
out and you run a long bristle flogger
through<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> get<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.159> technique

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
through there and you get that technique

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
through there and you get that technique
let<00:01:44.939> me<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.659> understand<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.560> saying

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
let me see if I understand you're saying

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.130 
let me see if I understand you're saying
that<00:01:47.159> by<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> flogging<00:01:48.930> you're

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that by doing the flogging you're

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.109 
that by doing the flogging you're
filling<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.100> grain<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> bringing<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.000> out

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
filling in the grain and bringing it out

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
filling in the grain and bringing it out
of<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> original<00:01:52.710> wood<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.369> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
of what the original wood is in this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
of what the original wood is in this
case<00:01:53.729> we're<00:01:54.270> dealing<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.600> Spanish<00:01:55.110> cedar

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
case we're dealing with Spanish cedar

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.670 
case we're dealing with Spanish cedar
and<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.250> will<00:01:56.430> help<00:01:56.759> give<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.680> Cuban

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and that will help give the Cuban

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.859 
and that will help give the Cuban
mahogany<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.520> more<00:02:00.149> authentic<00:02:00.659> look

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
mahogany a more authentic look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.810 
mahogany a more authentic look
you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.950> Spanish<00:02:02.280> cedar<00:02:02.490> has<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you know this the Spanish cedar has a

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.450 
you know this the Spanish cedar has a
similar<00:02:03.360> grain<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.229> mahogany<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> it's

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
similar grain to mahogany so it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.429 
similar grain to mahogany so it's
actually<00:02:05.670> been<00:02:05.969> beneficial<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.020> us<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.290> put

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
actually been beneficial for us to put

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.839 
actually been beneficial for us to put
the<00:02:07.560> flogging<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.670> gone

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
the flogging on it it's actually gone

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.660 
the flogging on it it's actually gone
down<00:02:08.910> into<00:02:09.390> those

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
down into those

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.360 
down into those
pores<00:02:10.030> yeah<00:02:10.479> very<00:02:10.899> good<00:02:11.050> tell<00:02:11.770> me<00:02:11.890> some<00:02:12.099> of<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
pores yeah very good tell me some of the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.580 
pores yeah very good tell me some of the
I<00:02:12.970> guess<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.510> other<00:02:13.630> techniques<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.349> you'll

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I guess the other techniques that you'll

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.070 
I guess the other techniques that you'll
apply<00:02:15.010> as<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.520> as<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:16.180> work<00:02:16.390> you're<00:02:16.720> finished

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
apply as you as you work you're finished

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.570 
apply as you as you work you're finished
with<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.500> flogging<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:18.099> that<00:02:18.250> particular

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
with the flogging of that particular

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.570 
with the flogging of that particular
panel<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.450> you'll<00:02:20.050> flog<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.890> other<00:02:21.040> panels

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
panel so you'll flog the other panels

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.339 
panel so you'll flog the other panels
and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:22.000> happens<00:02:22.300> after<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.569> after

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
and then what happens after that after

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.229 
and then what happens after that after
that<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.920> will<00:02:24.099> take<00:02:24.310> some<00:02:24.640> translucent

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
that we will take some translucent

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.600 
that we will take some translucent
oil-based<00:02:25.959> glazes<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:27.160> add<00:02:27.310> different

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
oil-based glazes so we add different

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880 
oil-based glazes so we add different
colors<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.750> give<00:02:28.870> us<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.110> translucent

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
colors to that to give us a translucent

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.830 
colors to that to give us a translucent
layer<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:30.430> top<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.600> how<00:02:31.810> we

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
layer on top of this just like how we

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
layer on top of this just like how we
polished<00:02:32.350> wood<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.160> really<00:02:33.459> fine

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
polished wood you see in really fine

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.199 
polished wood you see in really fine
woods

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
woods

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.030 
woods
that's<00:02:34.390> exactly<00:02:34.780> right<00:02:34.870> now<00:02:35.110> we'll<00:02:35.680> take<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
that's exactly right now we'll take and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.590 
that's exactly right now we'll take and
put<00:02:36.220> two<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.519> three<00:02:36.700> different<00:02:36.850> layers<00:02:37.180> on

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
put two to three different layers on

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.120 
put two to three different layers on
here<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.019> we'll<00:02:38.170> manipulate<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.920> with

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
here and we'll manipulate that with

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.729 
here and we'll manipulate that with
little<00:02:39.430> brushes<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.090> tools<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:41.170> David<00:02:41.410> since

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
little brushes and tools so David since

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.860 
little brushes and tools so David since
this<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:41.980> gonna<00:02:42.100> be<00:02:42.400> facing<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.239> elements<00:02:43.750> on

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
this is gonna be facing the elements on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.600 
this is gonna be facing the elements on
one<00:02:44.110> side<00:02:44.410> what<00:02:44.800> what<00:02:45.040> do<00:02:45.100> we<00:02:45.190> do<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.430> protect

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
one side what what do we do to protect

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.970 
one side what what do we do to protect
the<00:02:45.910> door<00:02:46.060> now<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.810> door<00:02:47.110> must<00:02:47.590> be<00:02:47.739> protected

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
the door now the door must be protected

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
the door now the door must be protected
from<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.580> elements<00:02:48.730> especially<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
from the elements especially in the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.479 
from the elements especially in the
situation<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.560> direction<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:51.100> which<00:02:51.220> this

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
situation the direction in which this

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.910 
situation the direction in which this
doors<00:02:51.730> facing<00:02:52.000> which<00:02:52.420> would<00:02:52.600> be<00:02:52.720> west<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.799> we

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
doors facing which would be west so we

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
doors facing which would be west so we
have<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.280> protect<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.910> nice<00:02:55.180> varnishes

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
have to protect it with nice varnishes

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.199 
have to protect it with nice varnishes
with<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> lot<00:02:56.410> of<00:02:56.680> ultraviolet<00:02:57.370> absorbers<00:02:58.060> in

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
with a lot of ultraviolet absorbers in

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.820 
with a lot of ultraviolet absorbers in
there<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.840> must<00:02:59.019> be<00:02:59.110> maintained<00:02:59.680> on<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
there and it must be maintained on a

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.830 
there and it must be maintained on a
yearly<00:03:00.069> basis<00:03:00.549> okay<00:03:00.970> well<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.269> gonna<00:03:01.420> have<00:03:01.720> to
