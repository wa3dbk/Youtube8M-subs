age-old question which 13-inch MacBook
should<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.469> buy<00:00:10.679> now<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> question

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
should I buy now this is a question

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.089 
should I buy now this is a question
because<00:00:12.509> there<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:13.049> 13-inch<00:00:13.620> MacBook<00:00:13.769> s'

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
because there are two 13-inch MacBook s'

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.490 
because there are two 13-inch MacBook s'
on<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.549> market<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.360> 13-inch<00:00:15.839> MacBook<00:00:16.049> Air

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
on the market the 13-inch MacBook Air

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.279 
on the market the 13-inch MacBook Air
and<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.920> 13-inch<00:00:17.369> MacBook<00:00:17.609> Pro<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and the 13-inch MacBook Pro and it's a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.269 
and the 13-inch MacBook Pro and it's a
little<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.650> an<00:00:19.770> important<00:00:20.070> decision

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
little more of an important decision

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.670 
little more of an important decision
than<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:21.119> 15-inch<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.869> buy<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.289> think

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
than what 15-inch do I buy I think

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.740 
than what 15-inch do I buy I think
because<00:00:23.039> these<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.670> more<00:00:23.850> affordable<00:00:24.359> these

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
because these are more affordable these

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.060 
because these are more affordable these
are<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> max<00:00:25.289> looks<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> people<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.949> going

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
are the max looks that people are going

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980 
are the max looks that people are going
to<00:00:26.130> gravitate<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.910> when<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.240> pay<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.960> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to gravitate to when they pay for a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.810 
to gravitate to when they pay for a
back-to-school<00:00:28.320> laptop<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.490> they're<00:00:29.640> more

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
back-to-school laptop and they're more

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490 
back-to-school laptop and they're more
likely<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.269> fit<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> whatever<00:00:30.720> bag<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.289> have

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
likely to fit to whatever bag you have

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
likely to fit to whatever bag you have
now<00:00:32.189> let's<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.460> into<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> nitty-gritty<00:00:32.969> of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
now let's get into the nitty-gritty of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.110 
now let's get into the nitty-gritty of
both<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:34.079> both<00:00:34.320> start<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.890> 1199<00:00:35.790> that's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
both they both start at 1199 that's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
both they both start at 1199 that's
different<00:00:36.510> than<00:00:36.809> last<00:00:37.020> year<00:00:37.350> because<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
different than last year because the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.500 
different than last year because the
MacBook<00:00:38.190> Air<00:00:38.309> used<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.730> $100<00:00:39.300> more

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
MacBook Air used to be $100 more

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
MacBook Air used to be $100 more
expensive<00:00:40.050> now<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.250> price

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
expensive now they're at the same price

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.069 
expensive now they're at the same price
so<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> differences<00:00:42.780> well

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
so what are the differences well

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
so what are the differences well
obviously<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:44.129> 13-inch<00:00:44.579> air<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.210> lot

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
obviously the 13-inch air is a lot

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
obviously the 13-inch air is a lot
thinner<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:46.800> lighter<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.370> little

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
thinner and it's a lot lighter a little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.090 
thinner and it's a lot lighter a little
under<00:00:48.210> three<00:00:48.450> pounds<00:00:48.930> whereas<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
under three pounds whereas this one is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
under three pounds whereas this one is
4.5<00:00:50.850> pounds<00:00:51.090> that's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.930> bad<00:00:52.230> but<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.980> going

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
4.5 pounds that's not bad but it's going

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.830 
4.5 pounds that's not bad but it's going
to<00:00:53.129> feel<00:00:53.219> heavier<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:54.000> hand<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.539> even<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
to feel heavier in your hand it's even a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.270 
to feel heavier in your hand it's even a
little<00:00:54.899> hard<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.680> me<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> hold<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.250> hand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little hard for me to hold in one hand

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.020 
little hard for me to hold in one hand
like<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
like this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
like this
now<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.109> differences<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.890> terms

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
now the other differences are in terms

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.189 
now the other differences are in terms
of<00:00:59.160> processor<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.879> has<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.120> lower<00:01:00.750> speed

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
last year I would have picked the pro

last year I would have picked the pro
but<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.360> year<00:02:39.630> I'm<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> air<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
but this year I'm going with the air the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.949 
but this year I'm going with the air the
reason<00:02:41.640> is<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.000> air<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.299> more<00:02:42.480> portable

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
reason is that the air is more portable

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.930 
reason is that the air is more portable
it's<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.769> forward-looking<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.730> sense

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
it's more forward-looking in the sense

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.430 
it's more forward-looking in the sense
that<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> laptop<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.170> think<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that this is the laptop that I think is

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.750 
that this is the laptop that I think is
going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> be<00:02:46.739> around<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.250> couple<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.549> years

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
going to be around in a couple of years

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.509 
going to be around in a couple of years
and<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.840> laptop<00:02:49.110> really<00:02:49.650> represents<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.340> lot

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
and this laptop really represents a lot

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.580 
and this laptop really represents a lot
