have the correct profile for your

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.030 
have the correct profile for your

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
printer so the rendering intent is

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.490 
printer so the rendering intent is
perceptual<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.780> you're<00:03:26.900> going<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.109> click<00:03:27.199> on

photoshop 7 ought to flip the image if

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.729 
photoshop 7 ought to flip the image if
you're<00:03:40.790> using<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.209> Rico<00:03:41.659> you'll<00:03:42.379> want<00:03:42.650> to

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
you're using a Rico you'll want to

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.559 
you're using a Rico you'll want to
