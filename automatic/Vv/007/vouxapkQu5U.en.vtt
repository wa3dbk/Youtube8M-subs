00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it just looks a little bit too overdone

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
it just looks a little bit too overdone
for<00:01:36.119> me<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.479> use<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> highlighter<00:01:37.020> instead

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
for me so i use a highlighter instead

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.319 
for me so i use a highlighter instead
because<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.400> gives<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.759> natural<00:01:39.150> finish

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
because it gives a more natural finish

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.600 
because it gives a more natural finish
so<00:01:39.990> i<00:01:40.020> apply<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.740> tip<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.100> nose<00:01:41.159> my

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
so i apply it to the tip of my nose my

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
so i apply it to the tip of my nose my
chin<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.360> above<00:01:42.930> my<00:01:43.079> eyebrows<00:01:43.500> underneath

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
chin just above my eyebrows underneath

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
chin just above my eyebrows underneath
my<00:01:44.520> eyebrows<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.030> well<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> accentuate

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
my eyebrows as well just to accentuate

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
my eyebrows as well just to accentuate
them<00:01:46.350> further<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.399> cheekbones

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
them further and then on my cheekbones

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.490 
them further and then on my cheekbones
so<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> parts<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.960> i<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.350> want

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
so all of the parts that i really want

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.859 
so all of the parts that i really want
to<00:01:49.619> draw<00:01:49.829> attention<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.340> i<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.360> rub<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to draw attention to i will just rub the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.280 
to draw attention to i will just rub the
highlighter<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.250> see

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.590 

once<00:01:57.290> i'm<00:01:57.470> done<00:01:57.500> i<00:01:57.920> take<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:58.400> darker<00:01:58.910> powder<00:01:59.120> and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
once i'm done i take a darker powder and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.370 
once i'm done i take a darker powder and
i<00:02:00.230> use<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:01.220> contour<00:02:01.850> my<00:02:01.880> face<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.900> do<00:02:03.140> it

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
i use that to contour my face so I do it

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.810 
i use that to contour my face so I do it
around<00:02:03.650> my<00:02:03.920> chin<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:04.280> again<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.640> drawing

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
around my chin so again it's drawing

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.060 
around my chin so again it's drawing
attention<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.540> chin<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.070> contour

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
attention to the chin and the contour

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.940 
attention to the chin and the contour
works<00:02:07.370> as<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> way<00:02:07.730> of<00:02:07.760> pushing<00:02:08.119> back<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.050> areas

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
works as a way of pushing back the areas

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.170 
works as a way of pushing back the areas
that<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.280> want<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.520> push<00:02:10.729> back<00:02:10.910> so

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
that you want to push back so

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.940 
that you want to push back so
highlighter<00:02:11.900> brings<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.410> forward<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
highlighter brings it forward the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.010 
highlighter brings it forward the
contour<00:02:13.340> pushes<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.790> back<00:02:13.820> so<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.510> use<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.900> on<00:02:14.960> my

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
contour pushes it back so I use it on my

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.020 
contour pushes it back so I use it on my
cheekbones<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.740> really<00:02:16.100> define<00:02:16.430> them<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.880> also

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
cheekbones to really define them I also

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.910 
cheekbones to really define them I also
use<00:02:17.270> on<00:02:17.390> my<00:02:17.510> forehead<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:18.140> no<00:02:18.470> one<00:02:18.620> wants

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
use on my forehead because no one wants

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.310 
use on my forehead because no one wants
a<00:02:19.040> massive<00:02:19.400> forehead<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.960> I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
a massive forehead like I have and I

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.380 
a massive forehead like I have and I
then<00:02:21.860> apply<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> sides<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.180> my<00:02:23.240> nose

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
then apply it to the sides of my nose

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.440 
then apply it to the sides of my nose
just<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.290> really<00:02:24.530> define<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.950> nose<00:02:25.310> area<00:02:25.580> then

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
just to really define the nose area then

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
just to really define the nose area then
after<00:02:26.930> I<00:02:26.959> have<00:02:27.140> drawn<00:02:27.590> out<00:02:27.800> for<00:02:28.010> lions<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.490> just

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
after I have drawn out for lions I just

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.850 
after I have drawn out for lions I just
blend<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.180> out<00:02:29.300> slightly<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> also<00:02:30.500> put<00:02:30.740> it

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
blend it out slightly so I also put it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.370 
blend it out slightly so I also put it
into<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.040> sockets<00:02:31.490> of<00:02:31.610> my<00:02:31.790> eyes<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.360> well<00:02:33.080> and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
my face now the only part that I really

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.390 
my face now the only part that I really
dislike<00:04:13.760> being<00:04:13.970> shiny<00:04:14.299> is<00:04:14.599> my<00:04:14.750> eyes<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.829> like

dislike being shiny is my eyes so I like

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.370 
dislike being shiny is my eyes so I like
Pat<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:17.030> down<00:04:17.060> and<00:04:17.510> as<00:04:17.659> you<00:04:17.780> can<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:17.959> that

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
Pat that down and as you can see that

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.920 
Pat that down and as you can see that
the<00:04:19.039> puffing<00:04:19.609> creme<00:04:19.880> works<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.570> well<00:04:20.659> it

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
the puffing creme works really well it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.510 
the puffing creme works really well it
actually<00:04:21.109> helps<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.709> lock<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.070> makeup<00:04:22.370> in

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
actually helps to lock the makeup in

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.969 
actually helps to lock the makeup in
place<00:04:22.699> so<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:22.909> really<00:04:23.210> recommend<00:04:23.240> it<00:04:26.800> now<00:04:27.800> once

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
i finish doing that i move on to my

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.529 
i finish doing that i move on to my
eyebrows<00:04:30.080> now<00:04:30.440> i<00:04:30.740> am<00:04:31.250> pretty<00:04:31.909> obsessive<00:04:32.300> with

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539

my<00:04:32.659> eyebrows<00:04:33.110> i<00:04:33.349> always<00:04:33.590> get<00:04:33.889> them<00:04:34.039> waxed<00:04:34.250> or

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
my eyebrows i always get them waxed or

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.420 
my eyebrows i always get them waxed or
threaded<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.630> shape<00:04:35.900> means<00:04:36.289> a<00:04:36.560> lot<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.159> me

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430

threaded so the shape means a lot to me
now<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.180> can<00:04:38.630> see<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.810> my<00:04:39.020> eyebrows<00:04:39.349> need

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
now you can see that my eyebrows need

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.100 
now you can see that my eyebrows need
threading<00:04:40.520> at<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.789> moment<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.539> this<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.080> a

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
threading at the moment but this is a

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.870 
threading at the moment but this is a
way<00:04:42.349> of<00:04:42.380> making<00:04:42.889> sure<00:04:43.039> that<00:04:43.250> they<00:04:43.340> remain<00:04:43.669> in

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
way of making sure that they remain in

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.790 
way of making sure that they remain in
shape<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.360> they<00:04:44.479> still<00:04:44.750> look<00:04:44.900> flawless<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.590> i

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
shape and they still look flawless so i

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.100 
shape and they still look flawless so i
