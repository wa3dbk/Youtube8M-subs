00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.210
 everything completely 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:02:02.400
 trainer who of course I'm good at so 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:05.280
 I thought I was abnormal 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.900
 simply cool if it were such a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.880
 separation also gives a new one 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.190
 play mode, so to speak, give it where it is 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:22.920
 There are really no teams where you can not 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:25.410
 may do and in kind a bit too 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.630
 I do it because I think it 's easy 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.670
 really cool if you for example the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.459
 last 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 I now have that db ag in one 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:03:02.480
 week yes it looks like again groups 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:03:02.480
 but he does not stop what 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.660
 therefore 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:31.130
 so I do not give you as a msg is 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.890
 but is called time forgotten where you are so 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.410
 So what you think can be cool what you think 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.060
 could do it and it was cool 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.360
 so if any of you put that in there 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:04:19.790
 that could not be written 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:04:21.380
 I know what that one of you is doing 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.940
 would write if if I am me 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.850
 then I'll just write it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.010
 there or or just ask at all 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.550
 one of the skype i can do that too 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.120
 Just do it because they really are 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.560
 celebrate over exaggerated because so maybe 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.560
 that it is smaller then or so 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:46.160
 twelve players or 16 players just so 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.660
 no idea something new and new times 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.190
 the hottest I find it even if it 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.910
 for example, a new m 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.350
 a ranking list gives where to go 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.850
 Again, the chances are first 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.460
 I will not become first because 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.040
 then I think I would not bock 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.560
 on it but yes I think it's cool if 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.540
 if there is a new ranking list as well 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.860
 would give and so and that was it 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.200
 actually you can from the video times 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.370
 write to the comments it what it 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.770
 So he keeps the finds something 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.070
 would give such a new game mode too 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.870
 just like a kind of sg teams new ranking 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.890
 and everyone has the chance again 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.470
 to become first 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.740
 when you went jonas you just can not 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.740
 chance 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:38.430
 18 years old is just not working 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.430
 more 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:50.259
 I do not want to know again 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:54.819
 matter so people I now almost 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:57.099
 forgot because that's what I saw 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.629
 that the video is a vision too and 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.629
 That's why I'll be short again 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:06.569
 something cool from csu at it 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:10.360
 where I think I cut four people 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.889
 was missing and so is nothing 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.569
 special but then the video will be on 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.909
 a bit longer and it's not just 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.479
 I can not do five minutes of video 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.120
 really bring 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.819
 Here you can see how good I am 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.460
 I'm still in gold around cisco 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.759
 number one but then round with marcel 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.229
 so played with 30 and then I would 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.819
 there are so cordial again 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:40.889
 Congratulations to you, heart, happiness trump 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:40.889
 thanks again to you marcel people
