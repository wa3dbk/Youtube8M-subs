00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.610 
out at release but um they didn't and I
don't<00:03:04.989> know<00:03:05.109> I<00:03:05.439> think<00:03:05.769> it's<00:03:06.040> stupid<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:07.620> they

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
don't know I think it's stupid that they

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.229 
don't know I think it's stupid that they
did<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:08.859> and<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.799> they<00:03:12.010> should<00:03:12.040> like<00:03:12.730> make

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
did that and that they should like make

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.210 
did that and that they should like make
really<00:03:13.719> good<00:03:13.840> games<00:03:14.139> again<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:17.040> it's<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
really good games again like it's the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.270 
really good games again like it's the
first<00:03:19.049> system<00:03:20.909> to<00:03:21.909> have<00:03:22.329> 3d<00:03:22.919> like<00:03:23.919> with<00:03:24.129> no

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
first system to have 3d like with no

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.610 
first system to have 3d like with no
glasses<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.870> think<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.349> they<00:03:26.530> should

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
glasses and I think that they should

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.999 
glasses and I think that they should
really<00:03:29.620> take<00:03:30.099> advantage<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:31.090> that<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:35.009> they

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
really take advantage of that and they

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.729 
really take advantage of that and they
shouldn't<00:03:36.370> do<00:03:36.819> what<00:03:37.000> they're<00:03:37.180> doing<00:03:37.769> um

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
shouldn't do what they're doing um

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.189 
shouldn't do what they're doing um
that's<00:03:41.739> about<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.069> that's<00:03:42.639> all<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.819> like<00:03:43.199> really

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
that's about it that's all I like really

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:50.280 
that's about it that's all I like really
want<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.470> say<00:03:45.239> about<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.979> um<00:03:47.979> I<00:03:48.959> think<00:03:49.959> it's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
want to say about that um I think it's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.559 
want to say about that um I think it's
just<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:50.919> ridiculous<00:03:52.229> like<00:03:54.150> they<00:03:55.150> should<00:03:55.389> put

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
just the ridiculous like they should put

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.289 
just the ridiculous like they should put
more<00:03:55.750> colors<00:03:56.609> like<00:03:57.609> more<00:03:57.819> choices<00:03:58.239> of<00:03:59.069> the

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
more colors like more choices of the

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.110 
more colors like more choices of the
system<00:04:01.469> like<00:04:02.469> I<00:04:02.709> want<00:04:02.979> a<00:04:03.189> different<00:04:03.430> color<00:04:03.790> I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
system like I want a different color I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.689 
system like I want a different color I
think<00:04:04.389> I<00:04:04.540> don't<00:04:04.780> want<00:04:04.959> black<00:04:05.229> like<00:04:05.650> it's<00:04:06.609> the

think I don't want black like it's the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.300 
think I don't want black like it's the
only<00:04:06.879> one<00:04:07.000> they<00:04:07.030> really<00:04:07.150> had<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:08.919> I<00:04:09.039> want
