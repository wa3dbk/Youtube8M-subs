00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
it is 7 excellent and if it is 8 the sky

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.670 
it is 7 excellent and if it is 8 the sky
is<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.200> limit

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
is the limit

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.030 
is the limit
do<00:05:49.920> not<00:05:50.070> worry<00:05:50.310> if<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.640> score<00:05:50.910> is<00:05:50.940> less<00:05:52.040> than

do not worry if the score is less than
or<00:05:53.100> equal<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.580> 4<00:05:53.790> it<00:05:54.030> still<00:05:54.270> helps<00:05:54.770> mainly

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
or equal to 4 it still helps mainly

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.170 
or equal to 4 it still helps mainly
because<00:05:55.920> Jupiter<00:05:56.430> in<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.520> ninth<00:05:56.730> is<00:05:56.880> always

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180
