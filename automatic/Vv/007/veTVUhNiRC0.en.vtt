introduction<00:00:30.740> of<00:00:31.220> one<00:00:32.210> problem<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:33.050> I

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
introduction of one problem that I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.980 
introduction of one problem that I
discovered<00:00:34.540> let's<00:00:35.540> say<00:00:35.900> by<00:00:36.200> accident<00:00:37.990> the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990 
discovered let's say by accident the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.700 
discovered let's say by accident the
accident<00:00:39.020> was<00:00:39.740> this<00:00:40.010> new<00:00:40.520> Sheila<00:00:40.940> scope<00:00:41.710> this

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
accident was this new Sheila scope this

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.330 
accident was this new Sheila scope this
new<00:00:42.980> oscilloscope<00:00:43.670> which<00:00:44.830> when<00:00:45.830> I've<00:00:46.010> tried

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
new oscilloscope which when I've tried

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.170 
new oscilloscope which when I've tried
to<00:00:47.180> make<00:00:47.739> measurements<00:00:48.739> by<00:00:48.950> using<00:00:49.460> my<00:00:49.670> current

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
to make measurements by using my current

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.710 
to make measurements by using my current
clamp<00:00:50.450> and<00:00:51.110> I<00:00:51.260> connected<00:00:51.800> to<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:52.300> in<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.480> way<00:00:53.660> to

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
clamp and I connected to it in a way to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.520 
clamp and I connected to it in a way to
work<00:00:54.080> it<00:00:54.290> as<00:00:54.470> antenna<00:00:54.950> and<00:00:55.330> it<00:00:56.330> point<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.200> me

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
work it as antenna and it point to me

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.060 
work it as antenna and it point to me
one<00:00:57.860> problem<00:00:58.400> that<00:00:58.880> I<00:00:58.910> have<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.840> I<00:01:00.380> was<00:01:00.829> not

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
one problem that I have and I was not

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.680 
one problem that I have and I was not
aware<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:03.400> what<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:04.550> see<00:01:04.790> here<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.390> the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
aware of it what you see here is the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.960 
aware of it what you see here is the
Scylla<00:01:05.960> scope<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.770> clamp<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.400> not<00:01:07.670> even

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
Scylla scope the clamp is not even

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.570 
Scylla scope the clamp is not even

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
powered up one lobe and radio and you

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.650 
powered up one lobe and radio and you
will<00:01:13.759> see<00:01:14.030> why<00:01:14.330> it<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.440> here<00:01:15.740> too<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.450> we<00:01:17.450> have

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
will see why it is here too and we have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.499 
will see why it is here too and we have
one<00:01:17.930> healthy<00:01:18.350> power<00:01:18.920> supply<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:20.210> power

studio here let's go to the story this
power<00:01:55.729> supply<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.590> healthy<00:01:57.700> it<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:58.760> almost<00:01:59.299> new

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
power supply is healthy it is almost new

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.340 
power supply is healthy it is almost new
about<00:02:01.000> 2<00:02:02.000> years<00:02:02.240> old<00:02:02.659> it's<00:02:03.700> 700<00:02:04.700> watts<00:02:05.350> almost

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
about 2 years old it's 700 watts almost

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.890 
about 2 years old it's 700 watts almost
700<00:02:07.070> watts<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:08.739> still<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:10.009> has<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> problem

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
700 watts and still it has a problem

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.890 
700 watts and still it has a problem
let's<00:02:11.900> see<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.170> problem<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.239> power<00:02:14.510> supply

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
let's see the problem the power supply

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.160 
let's see the problem the power supply
is<00:02:14.959> connected<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.739> mains<00:02:15.980> but<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.930> not

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
is connected to mains but it is not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.120 
is connected to mains but it is not
actually<00:02:18.709> powered<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.480> let's<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:21.470> turn<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
actually powered up let's just turn the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:42.089 
actually powered up let's just turn the
switch<00:02:22.160> on

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.759 

okay<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.799> have<00:02:46.010> see<00:02:46.280> here<00:02:46.609> is<00:02:46.879> that

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
okay what we have see here is that

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.970 
okay what we have see here is that
potentially<00:02:48.769> this<00:02:49.579> power<00:02:49.849> supply<00:02:50.980> cause

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
potentially this power supply cause

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.679 
potentially this power supply cause
pollution<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:54.140> mains<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:58.129> pulse<00:02:58.689> which

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
pollution to mains and the pulse which

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.339 
pollution to mains and the pulse which
is<00:03:00.469> inside<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:02.180> spreads<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:04.489> even

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
is inside it spreads and is even

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:13.089 
is inside it spreads and is even
receptacle<00:03:06.349> by<00:03:06.939> radio<00:03:11.079> as<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.409> said<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
receptacle by radio as I said in the

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.640 
receptacle by radio as I said in the
beginning<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.639> this<00:03:13.790> video<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.659> clamp<00:03:15.500> is

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
beginning of this video this clamp is

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.030 
beginning of this video this clamp is
not<00:03:15.889> even<00:03:16.189> powered<00:03:16.549> up<00:03:17.200> even<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.439> it<00:03:18.530> works<00:03:18.739> as

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
not even powered up even so it works as

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.039 
not even powered up even so it works as
something<00:03:21.760> because<00:03:22.760> in<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.239> place<00:03:23.510> I'm
