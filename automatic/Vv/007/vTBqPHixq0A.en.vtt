 hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.180
 opportunity I bring you the pokemon of 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.650
 event gene ect that only serves for the 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.410
 fifth generation version is to say 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.110
 black and white pokemon 1 and 2 for both 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.270
 versions and all the previous videos 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.900
 also that says in black and white 1 and 2 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.949
 is for all versions ok 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.410
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.660
 address this page because gts point s 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.029
 and in the description of the video I am 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.849
 leaving a file at that point now what 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.490
 download and decompress them up 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.860
 downloaded the compressed we were left 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.530
 files at that point pk m what 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.700
 we have to do is go back to the page 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.800
 select where pokemon clicked and 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.630
 select fifth generation post 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 that this works for black and white 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.500
 united black and white together so 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.500
 we select here 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 we can examine and select the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.510
 file that we have decompressed and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.230
 downloaded that is genesis point pk m and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.230
 we put 1 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.119
 next what we have to do 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.950
 is 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:13.640
 enter this number dns in our 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.400
 nintendo ds and 3ds design by cellay 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.170
 it works for all that below 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.869
 the explanation 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.400
 the configuration is in videos 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.430
 separated so that you can 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.229
 guide once everything is set in the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.520
 page what we have is to configure the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.570
 index number that I showed in the game 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.570
 to do that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.720
 do not have to do here in the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 configuration but yes some that 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.420
 they enter they do not leave 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.600
 they do not have to do 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.009
 from the same console and in the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.439
 description of the video I am leaving you 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.140
 the two videos depending if you have a 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.880
 ds or a 3ds to make that 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.649
 configuration in this case and elton 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.049
 configured so that front should 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.979
 continue but if they do not have it they have 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.260
 to see these two videos 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.120
 necessarily ok 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.500
 well in this case it works by how 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.509
 I said for all versions 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.850
 what you have to do first is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.580
 simply 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.100
 we burn it in such full reminded 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.960
 of that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.620
 will also establish with our team 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.620
 why not 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.719
 and yes yes I have it full 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.770
 if the buoy in the box 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.090
 so they can see where the 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.090
 our genetics 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.660
 in this case it will be downloaded in the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.069
 box 1 which is what I have empty as 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.030
 can see 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.030
 but from there 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.690
 we go to people who are 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.700
 in any center little more 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.030
 on the second floor of any site 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.030
 eat 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.060
 the case 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.680
 we see what is said 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.240
 and we save the game and enter 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.880
 yes 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.530
 good and here we will get the pokemon 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.530
 Event genesis 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.540
 and there he takes us as a pledge 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.090
 and we put home 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.460
 we go out and go to the boxes 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.630

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.630
