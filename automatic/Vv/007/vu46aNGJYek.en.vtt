00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello to all today I find myself 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.069
 for my new route int 1 so that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.960
 must do about two months I use 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 really all of its products 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.740
 together and for once I like a lot 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.960
 the rendering I find it's some 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.190
 hyper natural thing you know me 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.990
 this is really something that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.850
 match me it's pretty light for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.410
 for spring and that's something 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.730
 that I really like it is not very 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.590
 very complex at the level of techniques 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.699
 even of products you will see it's 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.350
 really stupid it takes four 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 others also tend the video you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.500
 interest I invite you to stay there 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 so first of all I have obviously 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
 previously applied my outline of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 eyes and my matte cream before 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.890
 everything then to start I 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.800
 will apply a base to extend 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 the duration of his make-up simply 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.660
 so I apply on all of my 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.660
 face 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.829
 then I come involved a little 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.660
 correctors so there is the full that you 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.100
 considerations of checchi kocjan levies a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.379
 little bit and involved on small 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.030
 areas of redness on small pimples 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.259
 I can have and that's right now 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.259
 my skin is doing pretty well 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.610
 then obviously necessary step 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.990
 for me this is the application of a 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 concealer 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.060
 so I have this one from mac and 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.590
 that I will come and take a minute 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 since I told you the pump of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.820
 books a lot of products so I'm doing 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.490
 two little drops under my eyes and 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.690
 then I just tap audois I 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.540
 take no brush because I 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.010
 find the application audois more 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.260
 effective on me simply and I 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.660
 tobacco is a titian is really 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.340
 great since it does not run in 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.010
 price there a natural rendering he can 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.120
 look clear like that but once 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.920
 that everything is applied really it is 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.450
 superb and he has a confidence anyway 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 quite important so what me me 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:12.420
 how much to squeeze me who are really 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:14.670

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.030

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.150
 flexible if you want a coverage 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.800
 stronger you can and I find 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.450
