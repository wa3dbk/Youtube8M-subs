that we're using rather the challenge is
to<00:02:12.560> really<00:02:12.890> make<00:02:13.010> those<00:02:13.640> single<00:02:14.090> ingredients

here<00:02:22.400> certainly<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.540> them<00:02:23.690> which<00:02:23.959> is

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
here certainly one of them which is

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.480 
here certainly one of them which is
quite<00:02:24.650> recognized<00:02:25.040> as<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.340> law<00:02:25.400> of

diminishing return in other words the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.050 
diminishing return in other words the
more<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.160> something<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.730> less<00:02:28.910> you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
more you have of something the less you

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.360 
more you have of something the less you
like<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.600> what<00:02:30.200> we<00:02:30.260> like<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.620> do<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.130> give

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
like it so what we like to do is give

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.210 
like it so what we like to do is give
give<00:02:31.910> our<00:02:32.150> guests<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:33.140> enough<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.070> where
