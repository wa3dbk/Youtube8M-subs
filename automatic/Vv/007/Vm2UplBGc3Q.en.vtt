00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
wow factor at the same time I can see

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.500 
wow factor at the same time I can see
here<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.950> Abuna<00:02:38.370> angles<00:02:38.730> are<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.300> pretty

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
here the the Abuna angles are is pretty

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.870 
here the the Abuna angles are is pretty
spot-on<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.739> doesn't<00:02:41.040> distort<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.459> whole<00:02:41.640> lot

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
spot-on it doesn't distort a whole lot

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.199 
spot-on it doesn't distort a whole lot
so<00:02:42.420> fantastic<00:02:43.050> looking<00:02:43.380> display<00:02:43.820> very<00:02:44.820> shiny

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
so fantastic looking display very shiny

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
so fantastic looking display very shiny
you're<00:02:45.390> looking<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.770> back<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
you're looking to the back you have a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640 
you're looking to the back you have a
higher<00:02:47.820> count<00:02:48.180> camera<00:02:48.750> believe<00:02:49.260> they<00:02:49.440> said

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
higher count camera believe they said

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.070 
higher count camera believe they said
the<00:02:49.739> 13<00:02:50.190> megapixel<00:02:50.760> camera<00:02:50.790> let's<00:02:51.420> find<00:02:51.870> out

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
the 13 megapixel camera let's find out

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.140 
the 13 megapixel camera let's find out
for<00:02:52.320> sure

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.280 

okay<00:02:55.840> for<00:02:56.049> ya

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
okay for ya

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.500 
okay for ya
so<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.590> 13<00:02:58.890> megapixel<00:02:59.040> camera<00:02:59.510> from

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
so you have a 13 megapixel camera from

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.870 
so you have a 13 megapixel camera from
looks<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.900> when<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:01.560> cropped<00:03:01.950> yeah

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
looks of it when it's not cropped yeah

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.430 
looks of it when it's not cropped yeah
the<00:03:03.000> front-facing<00:03:03.240> camera<00:03:03.959> now

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
the front-facing camera now

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.410 
the front-facing camera now
interestingly<00:03:04.890> enough<00:03:05.400> if<00:03:05.670> we<00:03:05.700> kind<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.360> zoom

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
interestingly enough if we kind of zoom

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.230 
interestingly enough if we kind of zoom
in<00:03:06.870> here<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.620> focus<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.670> correctly

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
in here I can just focus this correctly

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.600 
in here I can just focus this correctly
you<00:03:09.959> could<00:03:10.140> see<00:03:10.470> around<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> front<00:03:11.310> here<00:03:11.400> you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
you could see around the front here you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.880 
you could see around the front here you
have<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.110> ear<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.709> the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
have you know the ear you have the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.800 
have you know the ear you have the
speaker<00:03:14.489> right<00:03:14.640> here<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.970> top<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.300> earpiece

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
speaker right here on top the earpiece

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.840 
speaker right here on top the earpiece
and<00:03:16.140> whatnot<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.890> your<00:03:17.130> light<00:03:17.459> sensor

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
and whatnot you have your light sensor

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.880 
and whatnot you have your light sensor
proximity<00:03:18.030> sensors<00:03:18.660> but<00:03:18.870> there<00:03:19.260> are<00:03:19.410> four

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
proximity sensors but there are four

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.160 
proximity sensors but there are four
additional<00:03:19.980> IR<00:03:20.760> sensors<00:03:21.360> around<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.900> device

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
additional IR sensors around the device

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.800 
additional IR sensors around the device
one<00:03:22.500> here<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:23.040> one<00:03:23.970> on<00:03:24.090> top<00:03:24.270> there

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
one here one here one on top there

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.090 
one here one here one on top there
should<00:03:25.020> be<00:03:25.110> another<00:03:25.319> one<00:03:25.440> somewhere<00:03:25.770> but

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
should be another one somewhere but

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.220 
should be another one somewhere but
basically<00:03:26.819> they<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.060> they<00:03:27.540> allow<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.080> use

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
basically they do they allow you to use

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.229 
basically they do they allow you to use
the<00:03:28.440> new<00:03:28.739> one<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.459> know<00:03:29.550> like<00:03:29.580> last<00:03:29.880> year<00:03:30.120> they

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
the new one you know like last year they

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.900 
the new one you know like last year they
had<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.680> active<00:03:31.680> display<00:03:32.100> where<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.610> take

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
had the active display where you take

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.910 
had the active display where you take
out<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.150> pockets<00:03:33.600> or<00:03:33.840> makkal<00:03:34.260> will<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.830> know

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920

Google now service so that's pretty much
packed<00:04:35.780> in<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.169> just<00:04:36.650> like<00:04:36.770> last<00:04:36.979> year<00:04:37.160> you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
packed in and just like last year you

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.249 
packed in and just like last year you
could<00:04:37.639> use<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.090> to<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:38.780> know<00:04:38.810> launch

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
could use it to you know launch

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.800
