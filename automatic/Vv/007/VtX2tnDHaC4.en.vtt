upfield<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.370> second<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:18.819> to<00:02:18.970> consider<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
upfield the second thing to consider is

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.640 
upfield the second thing to consider is
whether<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.840> want<00:02:19.989> to<00:02:20.050> run<00:02:20.170> an<00:02:20.260> otter<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
whether you want to run an otter and

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.890 
whether you want to run an otter and
even<00:02:20.980> front<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.459> again<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> comes<00:02:22.630> back<00:02:22.720> to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
even front and again this comes back to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
defensive lineman perhaps an even front

would<00:02:39.849> be<00:02:39.970> better<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.660> our

particular situation we prefer the odd
front<00:02:43.980> also<00:02:45.180> especially<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.510> run<00:02:46.720> situation

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
front also especially in a run situation

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
snap exchange can be a very important

factor in your defensive pressure and a

34<00:02:56.800> obviously<00:02:57.489> we're<00:02:57.610> going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> nose

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
34 obviously we're going to have a nose

34 obviously we're going to have a nose
