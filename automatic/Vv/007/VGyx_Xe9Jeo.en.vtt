00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
ones in the entire meta whenever I did

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.910 
ones in the entire meta whenever I did
this<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.479> beta<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> never<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.710> spent<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
this on beta but I never really spent a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
this on beta but I never really spent a
whole<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.400> thinking<00:01:23.670> about<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.090> but

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
whole lot of time thinking about it but

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.820 
whole lot of time thinking about it but
whenever<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.020> realized<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.530> could<00:01:25.680> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
whenever I realized that you could just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
whenever I realized that you could just
do<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.210> it<00:01:27.210> was<00:01:27.360> not<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> big<00:01:28.080> deal<00:01:28.140> at

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
do this it was not really a big deal at

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:28.670 
do this it was not really a big deal at
all

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
all

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
all
and<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.040> again<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.000> second<00:01:30.390> pole<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and so again the second pole you want to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
and so again the second pole you want to
make<00:01:30.930> sure<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.170> don't<00:01:31.409> pull<00:01:31.680> seed<00:01:31.860> master<00:01:32.250> at

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
make sure you don't pull seed master at

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.550 
make sure you don't pull seed master at
the<00:01:32.520> same<00:01:32.700> time<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:34.170> buff<00:01:34.380> each

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the same time because they buff each

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.260 
the same time because they buff each
other's<00:01:34.860> damage<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.210> least

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
other's damage I think they do at least

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
other's damage I think they do at least
either<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.619> cause<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.369> they

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
either way they cause more think they

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.010 
either way they cause more think they
make<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> take<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:39.000> damage<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
make you take more damage and so you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
make you take more damage and so you
just<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> kill<00:01:40.619> again<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> ads

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
just want to kill again all of the ads

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
just want to kill again all of the ads
and<00:01:42.060> uh<00:01:42.299> don't<00:01:42.960> worry<00:01:43.140> about<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.710> not

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
said before the true

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.850 
said before the true
really<00:02:14.310> simple<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.870> again<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.590> zone

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
really simple and so again you just zone

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.320 
really simple and so again you just zone
back<00:02:17.070> out<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:17.730> gonna<00:02:17.850> clear<00:02:18.180> all

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
back out and so that's gonna clear all

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.760 
back out and so that's gonna clear all
the<00:02:18.450> trash<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> we're<00:02:19.080> going<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> need<00:02:19.440> and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
the trash that we're going to need and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.560 
the trash that we're going to need and
honestly<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.550> didn't<00:02:20.730> even<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.090> need<00:02:21.330> to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
honestly we didn't even really need to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.150 
honestly we didn't even really need to
pull<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.990> we<00:02:22.590> could<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.860> done<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> without

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
pull that we could have done it without

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.980 
pull that we could have done it without
it<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> thought<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.030> would<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.480> lot

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
it but I thought that would be a lot

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.870 
it but I thought that would be a lot
easier<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.770> with<00:02:25.800> that<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.550> we<00:02:26.610> could

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
easier to do it with that now we could

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180 
easier to do it with that now we could
even<00:02:27.030> clear<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.480> rest<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> trash<00:02:28.190> like

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
even clear the rest of the trash like

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.980 
even clear the rest of the trash like
near<00:02:29.460> pit<00:02:29.760> warden<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.240> all<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> other<00:02:30.570> stuff

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
near pit warden and all the other stuff

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.080 
near pit warden and all the other stuff
and<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:32.370> know<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> make<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.850> little<00:02:32.940> bit

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and you know to make it a little bit

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.250 
and you know to make it a little bit
easier<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:33.480> honestly<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.840> didn't<00:02:34.080> really

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
easier but honestly I didn't really

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
easier but honestly I didn't really
think<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.500> would<00:02:34.590> be<00:02:34.710> necessary<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.120> what

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
think it would be necessary and so what

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.910 
think it would be necessary and so what

cool but either way it was I was like
really<00:04:53.630> ridiculous<00:04:54.110> like<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.410> fact<00:04:54.590> did<00:04:54.710> that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
really ridiculous like the fact did that

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.710 
really ridiculous like the fact did that
even<00:04:54.979> happened<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:55.520> as<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.699> can<00:04:55.789> see<00:04:55.849> he's

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
even happened and so as you can see he's

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.330 
even happened and so as you can see he's
pretty<00:04:56.870> low<00:04:57.139> health<00:04:57.349> like<00:04:57.500> I<00:04:57.650> pulled<00:04:58.220> him

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
pretty low health like I pulled him

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.740 
pretty low health like I pulled him
pretty<00:04:58.550> early<00:04:58.759> I<00:04:58.940> pulled<00:04:59.240> everything<00:04:59.449> pretty

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
pretty early I pulled everything pretty

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.120 
pretty early I pulled everything pretty
early<00:04:59.900> but<00:05:00.139> we<00:05:00.259> had<00:05:00.380> like<00:05:00.500> a<00:05:00.530> really<00:05:00.889> really

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
early but we had like a really really

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.980 
early but we had like a really really
good<00:05:01.280> group<00:05:01.639> here<00:05:01.669> and<00:05:02.030> so<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:02.630> thought<00:05:02.930> it

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
good group here and so I thought it

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.540 
good group here and so I thought it
would<00:05:03.080> really<00:05:03.139> be<00:05:03.410> no<00:05:03.530> problem<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:04.520> I

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
would really be no problem and so I

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.370 
would really be no problem and so I
pulled<00:05:04.849> all<00:05:05.000> those<00:05:05.180> extra<00:05:05.479> mobs<00:05:05.720> like<00:05:06.020> just<00:05:06.259> to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
pulled all those extra mobs like just to

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.170 
pulled all those extra mobs like just to
show<00:05:06.620> guys<00:05:06.919> that<00:05:07.250> it's<00:05:07.400> not<00:05:07.639> really<00:05:07.970> super

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
show guys that it's not really super

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.230 
show guys that it's not really super
hard<00:05:08.539> I<00:05:08.690> feared<00:05:09.349> him<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.860> kind<00:05:10.340> of<00:05:10.400> CC<00:05:10.759> them<00:05:10.940> and

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
hard I feared him to kind of CC them and

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.150 
hard I feared him to kind of CC them and
we<00:05:12.080> could<00:05:12.199> be<00:05:12.289> doing<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.530> lot<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.710> everything's

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
we could be doing a lot of everything's

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.890 
we could be doing a lot of everything's
like<00:05:13.370> earth<00:05:13.610> elemental<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.419> just<00:05:14.539> like<00:05:14.690> tons

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
of our stuff too but we didn't even do

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.730 
of our stuff too but we didn't even do
any<00:05:16.340> of<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:17.210> also<00:05:17.449> like<00:05:17.960> as<00:05:18.169> a<00:05:18.229> small

like little tip that doesn't really make
that<00:05:20.720> big<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.020> difference<00:05:21.169> but<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:22.009> might

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
that big of a difference but you might

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.129 
that big of a difference but you might
want<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.490> do<00:05:22.669> it

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
want to do it

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.589 
want to do it
pull<00:05:24.139> pull<00:05:24.440> all<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.130> different<00:05:25.430> ads<00:05:25.759> right

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
after or during a reckless provocation

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.870 
after or during a reckless provocation
so<00:05:29.659> again<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.590> can<00:05:30.710> just<00:05:30.830> DPS<00:05:31.250> them<00:05:31.400> down<00:05:31.550> and

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
so again you can just DPS them down and

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.310 
so again you can just DPS them down and
your<00:05:32.000> DPS<00:05:32.330> won't<00:05:32.539> have<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.750> wait<00:05:32.930> for<00:05:33.199> the

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
your DPS won't have to wait for the

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.960 
your DPS won't have to wait for the
thing<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.620> run<00:05:33.740> away<00:05:33.979> because<00:05:34.460> all<00:05:34.789> that<00:05:34.909> is

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
thing to run away because all that is

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.430 
thing to run away because all that is
time<00:05:35.270> when<00:05:35.479> you<00:05:35.509> have<00:05:35.690> all<00:05:35.840> these<00:05:35.960> other<00:05:36.139> mobs

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
time when you have all these other mobs

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.800 
time when you have all these other mobs
attacking<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:37.039> and<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.430> mzh<00:05:37.759> BAM<00:05:37.970> yes<00:05:38.210> do

attacking you and of the mzh BAM yes do

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.899 
attacking you and of the mzh BAM yes do
see<00:05:39.050> achievement<00:05:39.560> totally<00:05:40.250> not<00:05:40.400> even<00:05:40.639> hard<00:05:40.820> at

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
see achievement totally not even hard at

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.969 
see achievement totally not even hard at
all<00:05:41.000> what<00:05:41.659> is<00:05:41.840> kind<00:05:42.110> of<00:05:42.199> shitty<00:05:42.409> though<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.860> you

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
all what is kind of shitty though is you

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.469 
all what is kind of shitty though is you
have<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.250> kill<00:05:43.460> all<00:05:43.490> these<00:05:43.759> ads<00:05:43.969> again<00:05:44.300> and

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
have to kill all these ads again and

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.980 
have to kill all these ads again and
usually<00:05:45.340> we<00:05:46.340> probably<00:05:46.610> could<00:05:46.909> have<00:05:47.030> like<00:05:47.270> just

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
usually we probably could have like just
