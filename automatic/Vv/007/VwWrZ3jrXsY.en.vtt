well<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.350> was<00:01:31.500> just<00:01:31.530> standing<00:01:31.860> here

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
well actually I was just standing here

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
well actually I was just standing here
thinking<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.549> how<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.090> done<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.450> Las

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
thinking about how it's done in Las

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.990 
thinking about how it's done in Las
Vegas<00:01:33.780> now<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.530> Phoenix<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.729> thinking

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
Vegas now and in Phoenix I was thinking

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
Vegas now and in Phoenix I was thinking
all<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.329> buses<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.869> create<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.710> traffic

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
all these buses just create more traffic

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
all these buses just create more traffic
so<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> was<00:01:38.700> thinking<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.420> much<00:01:39.540> room

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
so I was thinking they have so much room

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.090 
so I was thinking they have so much room
out<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.380> probably<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.920> better

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
out there they probably would be better

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
out there they probably would be better
off<00:01:41.340> doing<00:01:42.060> what<00:01:42.210> they're<00:01:42.329> doing<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.600> Vegas

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
off doing what they're doing in Vegas

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
off doing what they're doing in Vegas
and<00:01:43.170> Phoenix<00:01:43.500> which<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> having<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.579> spot

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and Phoenix which is having one spot

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.969 
and Phoenix which is having one spot
where<00:01:45.119> all<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.360> rental<00:01:45.600> cars<00:01:45.840> are<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> one

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
where all the rental cars are and one

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.700 
where all the rental cars are and one
rental<00:01:47.250> car<00:01:47.460> bus<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.939> around<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.990> was

rental car bus going around so I was

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.200 
rental car bus going around so I was
just<00:01:49.740> thinking<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.729> miss<00:01:51.060> my

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
just thinking that because I miss my

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.359 
just thinking that because I miss my
rental<00:01:51.899> car<00:01:52.049> bus<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> applied<00:01:53.070> waiting

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
rental car bus and now I applied waiting

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.480 
rental car bus and now I applied waiting
10<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:53.970> 15<00:01:54.329> minutes<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.100> they<00:01:56.250> were<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
10 or 15 minutes I think if they were to

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.069 
10 or 15 minutes I think if they were to
consolidate<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.299> put<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> under<00:01:57.899> one

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
consolidate it and put it under one

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
consolidate it and put it under one
system<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.860> cut<00:01:59.040> down<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> lot<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
system it would cut down on a lot of the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.920 
system it would cut down on a lot of the
congestion<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> lot<00:02:01.530> of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
congestion and also a lot of

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.290 
congestion and also a lot of
waiting<00:02:02.410> out<00:02:02.560> here<00:02:02.590> for<00:02:02.830> different<00:02:03.400> buses<00:02:03.640> it

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
waiting out here for different buses it

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.850 
waiting out here for different buses it
would<00:02:04.420> be<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> lot<00:02:04.750> more<00:02:04.900> efficient<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.710> they

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
would be a lot more efficient and they

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.190 
would be a lot more efficient and they
really<00:02:06.130> should<00:02:06.400> focus<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:07.570> they<00:02:08.170> need

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
really should focus on that they need

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.260 
really should focus on that they need
more<00:02:08.560> efficiency<00:02:09.160> that's<00:02:09.940> my<00:02:10.210> bus<00:02:11.040> ok<00:02:12.240> wait<00:02:13.240> a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
more efficiency that's my bus ok wait a

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.330 
more efficiency that's my bus ok wait a
long<00:02:13.480> time<00:02:13.990> for<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.350> bus<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.160> couldn't

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
long time for this bus and we couldn't

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.920 
long time for this bus and we couldn't
even<00:02:15.430> see<00:02:15.580> because<00:02:16.030> there's<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.510> 12

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
even see because there's like 12

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.360 
even see because there's like 12

all the different buses this space gets

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470 
all the different buses this space gets
kind<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> crowded<00:02:27.030> while<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.209> were<00:02:28.330> at<00:02:28.450> the
