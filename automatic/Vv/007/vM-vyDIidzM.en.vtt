so we've always been told or at least
for<00:00:25.800> decades<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.670> meat<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.359> butter<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
for decades that meat and butter and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.009 
for decades that meat and butter and
cheese<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.650> bad<00:00:29.369> for<00:00:29.640> us<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.029> raise<00:00:30.779> our

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
cheese is bad for us it's raise our

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.830 
cheese is bad for us it's raise our
cholesterol<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.309> gives<00:00:33.300> us<00:00:33.420> heart<00:00:33.600> disease

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
cholesterol and gives us heart disease

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.340 
cholesterol and gives us heart disease
right<00:00:34.610> right<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.390> idea<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> butter

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
right right so that idea that butter

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
right right so that idea that butter
meat<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> cheese<00:00:37.980> are<00:00:38.280> bad<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.300> heart

goes<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> 1950s<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> idea

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
goes back to the 1950s when the idea

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
goes back to the 1950s when the idea
arose<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.239> saturated<00:00:45.870> fat<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.260> those

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
arose that the saturated fat that those

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.549 
arose that the saturated fat that those
foods<00:00:47.129> contain<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.660> contain<00:00:49.110> partly

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
foods contain they all contain partly

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
foods contain they all contain partly
saturated<00:00:49.739> fat<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> raises<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.120> total

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
saturated fat that it raises your total

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
saturated fat that it raises your total
cholesterol<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.350> clogs<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.770> arteries<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
cholesterol and clogs your arteries and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.740 
cholesterol and clogs your arteries and
gives<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> heart<00:00:53.910> attack<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.420> what<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
gives you a heart attack that's what the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.049 
gives you a heart attack that's what the
whole<00:00:54.989> idea<00:00:55.379> comes<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.860> starting<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> 1950s

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
whole idea comes from starting the 1950s

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.860 
whole idea comes from starting the 1950s
and<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.289> book<00:00:59.219> does<00:00:59.609> is<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.660> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and what my book does is it really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
and what my book does is it really
explores<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.160> idea<00:01:02.399> took<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
explores how that idea took off and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.750 
explores how that idea took off and
became<00:01:04.040> dogma

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
became dogma

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.969 
became dogma
before<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.840> ever<00:01:07.110> any<00:01:07.350> good<00:01:07.439> science

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
before there was ever any good science

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.300 
before there was ever any good science
to<00:01:08.100> show<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.640> true<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.979> was

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
to show that it's true and it really was

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
to show that it's true and it really was
just<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.880> never<00:01:12.180> had<00:01:12.390> good<00:01:12.540> science<00:01:12.869> behind<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
just it never had good science behind it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
just it never had good science behind it
and<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.530> science<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.100> since<00:01:14.400> been

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and that science has since been

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.630 
and that science has since been
reconsidered<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.840> several<00:01:16.710> groups<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
authorities are still often very

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
authorities are still often very
convincingly<00:01:30.780> telling<00:01:31.380> people<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.970> it's

convincingly telling people that it's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
convincingly telling people that it's
definitely<00:01:33.119> bad<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> eat<00:01:34.110> pattern

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
definitely bad for you to eat pattern

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.219 
definitely bad for you to eat pattern
right<00:01:35.640> well<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.810> an<00:01:36.930> idea

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
right well it's you know it's an idea

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.960 
right well it's you know it's an idea
that's<00:01:37.470> been<00:01:37.590> entrenched<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.310> half<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's been entrenched for half a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
that's been entrenched for half a
century<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:39.930> hard<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
century so it's very hard to back out of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.190 
century so it's very hard to back out of
advice<00:01:41.189> once<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> enter<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> but<00:01:42.960> it

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
advice once you enter into it but it

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.249 
advice once you enter into it but it
really<00:01:43.380> began<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.130> 1961<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.810> first

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
with his study I'll just tell you a

with his study I'll just tell you a
couple<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.599> them<00:02:15.720> one<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> he<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:17.280> it's

couple of them one is that he can it's
you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:17.849> say<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.150> he<00:02:18.239> cherry<00:02:18.510> picked<00:02:18.780> his

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
you can say that he cherry picked his

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.649 
you can say that he cherry picked his
countries<00:02:19.260> he<00:02:19.790> chose<00:02:20.790> countries<00:02:21.299> were<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
countries he chose countries were that

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.390

he<00:02:21.780> knew<00:02:22.019> would<00:02:22.170> prove<00:02:22.379> his<00:02:22.560> hypothesis<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
he knew would prove his hypothesis and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
he knew would prove his hypothesis and
he<00:02:23.519> avoided<00:02:24.030> those<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.420> he<00:02:24.540> knew<00:02:24.750> would<00:02:24.989> not

he avoided those that he knew would not

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.220

five hundred and he did things like when

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.369 
five hundred and he did things like when
he<00:02:44.010> went<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.370> Crete<00:02:44.940> where<00:02:45.599> he<00:02:45.720> had<00:02:45.930> his<00:02:46.140> kind

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
he went to Crete where he had his kind

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.460 
he went to Crete where he had his kind

one of the subject periods that he went
to<00:02:51.299> look<00:02:51.450> at<00:02:51.569> them<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.840> during<00:02:52.049> Lent<00:02:52.290> when
