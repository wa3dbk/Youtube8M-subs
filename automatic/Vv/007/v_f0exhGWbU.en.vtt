a way to minimize my tomato space in the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.029 
a way to minimize my tomato space in the
greenhouse<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.500> still<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> decent

some dude doing a single stem tomato
growing<00:00:24.630> method<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.890> decided<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.970> ahead

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
growing method and I decided to go ahead

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.500 
growing method and I decided to go ahead
and<00:00:27.420> give<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.689> shot<00:00:28.460> so<00:00:29.460> basically<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.330> you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and give it a shot so basically as you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.319 
and give it a shot so basically as you
can<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.189> tomatoes<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.149> took

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
can see on the tomatoes as I just took

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.080 
can see on the tomatoes as I just took
out<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.309> side<00:00:35.309> branch<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:36.890> and<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.850> left

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
out the side branch here and just left

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.959 
out the side branch here and just left
the<00:00:39.210> main<00:00:39.480> stem<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.800> main<00:00:41.160> flower<00:00:41.579> group

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the main stem with the main flower group

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.220 
the main stem with the main flower group
on<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> main<00:00:45.629> later<00:00:45.840> branch

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
on it and the just the main later branch

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.420 
on it and the just the main later branch
and<00:00:46.700> just<00:00:47.700> pinched<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> side<00:00:48.629> stuff

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
and just pinched out all the side stuff

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.700 
and just pinched out all the side stuff
and<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:51.030> focuses<00:00:51.690> all<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> attention<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and that focuses all the attention on

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
and that focuses all the attention on
main<00:00:53.070> shoot<00:00:53.730> growth<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.510> fruit<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
main shoot growth and fruit the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.930 
main shoot growth and fruit the
production<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.670> apparently<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.750> faster

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
production and apparently you get faster

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.470 
production and apparently you get faster
ripening<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.210> bigger<00:01:00.420> fruit<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:02.359> inside<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
ripening and bigger fruit so inside the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.000 
ripening and bigger fruit so inside the
greenhouse<00:01:03.629> anyways<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.860> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
greenhouse anyways this is how it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450 
greenhouse anyways this is how it's
going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.430> because<00:01:07.010> these<00:01:08.010> bitches

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to go down because these bitches

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.190 
going to go down because these bitches
were<00:01:08.580> getting<00:01:08.880> big<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.960> getting

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
were getting big and I was getting

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.160 
were getting big and I was getting
worried<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.490> so

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
worried about what I was going to do so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.100 
worried about what I was going to do so
let<00:01:13.170> me<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.540> went<00:01:15.540> ahead<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.930> did

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
let me show you how I went ahead and did

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
let me show you how I went ahead and did
this<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.860> use<00:01:22.890> scissors<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
this you can use scissors if you want to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.620 
this you can use scissors if you want to
but<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:25.439> take<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:26.159> side<00:01:26.909> shoot<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> just

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
but you just take a side shoot and just

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.230 
but you just take a side shoot and just
kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> bend<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.229> over<00:01:29.119> bend<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:32.240> break

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
kind of bend it over bend it back break

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
kind of bend it over bend it back break
it<00:01:33.390> off<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.790> smaller<00:01:36.180> ones<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it off and that's it smaller ones you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.810 
it off and that's it smaller ones you
can<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.079> pinch<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:38.009> nails

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can kind of pinch off with your nails

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
can kind of pinch off with your nails
but<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> get

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
but you know you are going to get

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.999 
but you know you are going to get
tomatoey<00:01:45.079> that's<00:01:46.079> pretty<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> do

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
look at this one has already done its

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590 
look at this one has already done its
why<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.500> lot<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.310> guys<00:01:59.700> see<00:02:00.030> tomatoes<00:02:00.479> they

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
why a lot of you guys see tomatoes they

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.950 
why a lot of you guys see tomatoes they
do<00:02:00.659> their<00:02:00.869> main<00:02:01.049> split<00:02:01.939> at<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.570> point<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
do their main split at that point you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.350 
do their main split at that point you
can<00:02:04.200> either<00:02:04.350> take<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.369> whole<00:02:05.700> branch<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
can either take the whole branch if you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.690 
can either take the whole branch if you
want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.920> which<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> probably<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.580> going

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
want to which is probably what I'm going

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
want to which is probably what I'm going
to<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> next<00:02:09.899> flower<00:02:10.110> group

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
to do because the the next flower group

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.210 
to do because the the next flower group
is<00:02:10.530> way<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.860> here

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
is way up here

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.760 
is way up here
and<00:02:12.840> let's<00:02:13.840> say<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.260> flower<00:02:14.500> group

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
and let's say you get a flower group

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.800 
and let's say you get a flower group
down<00:02:14.950> low<00:02:15.190> or<00:02:15.400> something<00:02:15.850> that's<00:02:16.120> looking

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
down low or something that's looking

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.840 
down low or something that's looking
really<00:02:16.840> nice<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.650> top<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.280> just

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
really nice you can top it and just

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.190 
really nice you can top it and just
pinch<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.390> sides<00:02:19.600> as<00:02:19.780> they<00:02:19.900> come<00:02:20.110> out

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
pinch out the sides as they come out

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.890 
pinch out the sides as they come out
along<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.040> branch<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:22.180> let<00:02:22.420> that<00:02:22.570> sack

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
along this branch and let that sack

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.230 
along this branch and let that sack
fruit<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.760> cut<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.090> branch

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
fruit and then you can cut that branch

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.350 
fruit and then you can cut that branch
off<00:02:25.540> once<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:25.960> done<00:02:26.170> fruiting<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:28.180> yeah
