any problems with this server here it's

any problems with this server here it's

also my storage server serving my I
scuzzy<00:00:47.699> when<00:00:48.699> it<00:00:48.819> comes<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:51.749> the<00:00:54.420> cluster

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
scuzzy when it comes to the cluster

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:04.590 
scuzzy when it comes to the cluster
servers<00:00:55.929> I<00:01:00.030> am<00:01:01.030> using<00:01:01.359> an<00:01:02.049> older<00:01:03.269> version<00:01:04.269> of

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
servers I am using an older version of

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.399 
servers I am using an older version of
Windows<00:01:04.740> Server<00:01:05.740> 2012<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.840> seems<00:01:08.110> very

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
Windows Server 2012 and it seems very

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
Windows Server 2012 and it seems very
stable<00:01:08.910> when<00:01:09.910> 8<00:01:11.460> rc1<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.670> 0-5<00:01:13.240> won<00:01:13.450> 8-1<00:01:13.960> 4<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.800> 3

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
stable when 8 rc1 to 0-5 won 8-1 4 to 3

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.560 
stable when 8 rc1 to 0-5 won 8-1 4 to 3
so<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:19.230> did<00:01:20.230> stumble<00:01:20.530> upon<00:01:20.770> one<00:01:21.570> interesting

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
so I did stumble upon one interesting

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.230 
so I did stumble upon one interesting
thing<00:01:22.980> though<00:01:23.980> I<00:01:24.480> had<00:01:25.480> to<00:01:25.630> basically<00:01:27.240> convert

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
thing though I had to basically convert

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.950 
thing though I had to basically convert
my<00:01:28.450> clusters<00:01:29.610> from<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:31.000> newer<00:01:31.450> version<00:01:31.720> of

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
my clusters from a newer version of

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
my clusters from a newer version of
Windows<00:01:33.330> because<00:01:34.330> they<00:01:34.480> were<00:01:34.540> crashing<00:01:35.140> and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
Windows because they were crashing and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.050 
Windows because they were crashing and
since<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.120> VMS<00:01:37.900> Ron<00:01:38.580> cleared<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.760> shared

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
since the VMS Ron cleared a shared

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.880 
since the VMS Ron cleared a shared
cluster<00:01:40.450> volume<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:41.440> know<00:01:41.530> they<00:01:41.650> stayed

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
cluster volume you know they stayed

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.490 
cluster volume you know they stayed
intact<00:01:42.510> so<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.460> funny<00:01:45.700> thing<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:47.200> running

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
intact so the funny thing is I'm running

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.260 
intact so the funny thing is I'm running
newer<00:01:47.890> versions<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:50.020> VMS<00:01:50.680> here<00:01:51.190> then<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
newer versions of the VMS here then the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.670 
newer versions of the VMS here then the
actual<00:01:52.980> cluster<00:01:54.240> server<00:01:55.240> so<00:01:55.930> it's<00:01:56.230> running

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
actual cluster server so it's running

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.300 
actual cluster server so it's running
you<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.930> higher<00:01:59.200> build<00:01:59.530> basically<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:00.280> I

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
you know higher build basically so I

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
you know higher build basically so I
thought<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.640> was<00:02:00.700> kind<00:02:00.880> of<00:02:00.909> interesting

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.940 

this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> unsupported<00:02:05.759> by<00:02:05.909> vmware<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.649> course

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this is unsupported by vmware of course

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.240 
this is unsupported by vmware of course
but<00:02:08.399> i<00:02:09.259> intend<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.679> play<00:02:10.860> around<00:02:11.069> with

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
but i intend to play around with

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
but i intend to play around with
replication<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.360> I've<00:02:12.810> done<00:02:13.080> some

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
replication a little more I've done some

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.020 
replication a little more I've done some
scale<00:02:13.560> out<00:02:13.709> file<00:02:13.890> servers<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.849> live

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
scale out file servers and live

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.070 
scale out file servers and live
migration<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.810> things<00:02:15.959> like<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:18.080> seems

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
migration and things like that and seems

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.750 
migration and things like that and seems
like<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.290> very<00:02:19.500> valuable<00:02:19.950> tool<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.610> play

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
like a very valuable tool just to play

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.160 
like a very valuable tool just to play
around<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.739> recap<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.870> want<00:02:24.900> to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
around in and just to recap you want to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
around in and just to recap you want to
choose<00:02:25.380> hyper-v<00:02:26.220> unsupported<00:02:26.970> as<00:02:27.209> your<00:02:27.360> OS

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
choose hyper-v unsupported as your OS

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.550 
choose hyper-v unsupported as your OS
and<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.310> want<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.580> set<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.000> your<00:02:30.750> processors

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and you want to set up your processors

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.800 
and you want to set up your processors
to<00:02:31.980> enable<00:02:32.340> VT<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.599> enable

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
to enable VT and then you can enable

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.809 
to enable VT and then you can enable
your<00:02:34.140> nested<00:02:34.650> hypervisor<00:02:35.099> there's<00:02:35.459> no<00:02:35.610> longer

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
your nested hypervisor there's no longer

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.820 
your nested hypervisor there's no longer
a<00:02:35.970> need<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.290> hack<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:39.019> vmx<00:02:40.019> file<00:02:40.319> or<00:02:40.560> whatever

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
a need to hack the vmx file or whatever

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.500 
a need to hack the vmx file or whatever
it<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.040> called<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.670> anyways<00:02:43.849> hopefully<00:02:44.849> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it was called so anyways hopefully you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.819 
it was called so anyways hopefully you
found<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.930> demonstration<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.739> be

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
found this demonstration to be

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.190 
found this demonstration to be
entertaining
