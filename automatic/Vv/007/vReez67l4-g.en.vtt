much guessing that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.480 
much guessing that
what<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:32.979> is<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.570> it's<00:01:35.500> just<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.950> really

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
what it is and so it's just a really

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.459 
what it is and so it's just a really
convenient<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.719> you<00:01:37.810> don't<00:01:37.960> have<00:01:38.109> a<00:01:38.170> whole

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
convenient so you don't have a whole

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.499
