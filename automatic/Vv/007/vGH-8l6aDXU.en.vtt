00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
two years I did some testing found out

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.550 
two years I did some testing found out
that<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.150> had<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> genetic<00:01:24.810> issue<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> don't

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that I had a genetic issue where I don't

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.679 
that I had a genetic issue where I don't
produce<00:01:25.680> enough<00:01:26.040> intrinsic<00:01:26.400> factor<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.420> even

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
produce enough intrinsic factor so even

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.460 
produce enough intrinsic factor so even
though<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.869> trained<00:01:28.080> at<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> higher<00:01:28.439> level

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
though I was trained at a higher level

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.010 
though I was trained at a higher level
all<00:01:29.369> levels<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.000> low<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.659> hmm

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
all levels are a bit low I was like hmm

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.539 
all levels are a bit low I was like hmm
and<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.409> doctor<00:01:31.710> friend<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.979> mine<00:01:32.159> said<00:01:32.369> Holly

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
and a doctor friend of mine said Holly

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.660 
and a doctor friend of mine said Holly
you<00:01:33.090> doing<00:01:33.390> great<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.350> how<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:35.400> you

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.130 
you doing great now but how about do you
know<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> costed<00:01:36.360> b12<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.900> say<00:01:37.049> your

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140

performance<00:01:37.560> goes<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.000> did<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
performance goes so I did and the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.710 
performance goes so I did and the
running<00:01:40.500> times<00:01:40.799> went<00:01:41.070> down<00:01:41.390> considerably<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
running times went down considerably so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.830 
running times went down considerably so
I'm<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> fan<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.740> b12<00:01:44.189> injections<00:01:44.720> people<00:01:45.720> said

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm a fan of b12 injections people said

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
I'm a fan of b12 injections people said

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
but that's because you diet but they

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
but that's because you diet but they
don't<00:01:47.670> listen<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.939> what<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> say<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.720> what<00:01:48.840> the
