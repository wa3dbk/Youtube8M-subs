00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
processor because they all work a little

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.399 
processor because they all work a little

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
ingredients together for about two

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.690 
ingredients together for about two
minutes<00:01:23.540> I'm<00:01:23.900> going<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.440> go<00:01:25.190> back<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.520> forth

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
minutes I'm going to go back and forth

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
minutes I'm going to go back and forth
between<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.090> pulse

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
between a pulse

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.630 
between a pulse
and<00:01:26.840> then<00:01:27.050> turning<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.560> on<00:01:27.710> for<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.159> total<00:01:28.550> of

and then turning it on for a total of
about<00:01:28.700> two<00:01:29.120> minutes

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.050 

now<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.740> like<00:01:48.009> to<00:01:48.159> go<00:01:48.280> back<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.640> forth<00:01:48.820> between

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
now I like to go back and forth between

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.990 
now I like to go back and forth between
the<00:01:49.390> pulps<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.110> steady<00:01:50.409> on<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:51.220> help<00:01:51.460> get

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
the pulps and the steady on to help get

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.490 
the pulps and the steady on to help get
the<00:01:52.119> ingredients<00:01:52.659> off<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.990> bottom<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.409> the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
the ingredients off the bottom of the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.410 
the ingredients off the bottom of the
food<00:01:53.680> processor<00:01:54.280> or<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.789> could<00:01:54.939> take<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.240> lid

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
food processor or you could take the lid

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.090 
food processor or you could take the lid
off<00:01:55.450> if<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.840> wanted<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.439> scrape<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.830> down

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
off if you wanted to and scrape it down

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.149 
off if you wanted to and scrape it down
I<00:01:57.340> find<00:01:58.179> pulsing<00:01:58.659> up<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.380> little<00:01:59.710> bit<00:01:59.799> easier

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
I find pulsing up is a little bit easier

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:10.520 
I find pulsing up is a little bit easier
for<00:02:00.220> me

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.980 

okay<00:02:11.310> when<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.610> ingredients<00:02:11.880> no<00:02:12.360> longer<00:02:12.690> mix

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
okay when the ingredients no longer mix

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.110 
okay when the ingredients no longer mix
or<00:02:13.440> they're<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.160> doing<00:02:14.460> anything<00:02:14.700> they're

beyond<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.660> blade<00:02:16.160> it's<00:02:17.160> time<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> scrape

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
beyond the blade it's time to scrape

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.330 
beyond the blade it's time to scrape
down<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.970> sides<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:24.650> try<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.680> move<00:02:26.100> the

down the sides and just try to move the
butter<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.910> sugar<00:02:27.380> closer<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
butter and the sugar closer to the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.920 
butter and the sugar closer to the
center<00:02:29.100> but<00:02:29.430> look<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:29.760> creamy<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.660> is

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
center but look how creamy that is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.330 
center but look how creamy that is
so<00:02:31.080> you've<00:02:31.230> creamed<00:02:31.530> together<00:02:31.680> your<00:02:32.130> butter

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
so you've creamed together your butter

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.760 
so you've creamed together your butter
and<00:02:32.520> sugar<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.320> easy

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and sugar it's that easy

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.500 
and sugar it's that easy
and<00:02:36.710> now<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.770> lid<00:02:38.070> goes<00:02:38.100> back<00:02:38.610> on<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.240> before

and now the lid goes back on but before
you<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.900> lid<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:40.950> either<00:02:41.190> add

opening if I wanted to do that and this

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.850 
opening if I wanted to do that and this
won't<00:02:56.820> take<00:02:57.090> much<00:02:57.300> just<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.720> few<00:02:57.750> pulses<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.709> get

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
won't take much just a few pulses to get

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:13.040 
won't take much just a few pulses to get
the<00:02:58.980> egg<00:02:59.130> blended
