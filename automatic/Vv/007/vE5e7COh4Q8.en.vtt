00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
well certainly it does bring its own

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.950 
well certainly it does bring its own
little<00:04:53.190> little<00:04:53.820> pressures<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.450> so<00:04:54.570> far<00:04:54.810> as

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
little little pressures and so far as

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.470 
little little pressures and so far as
you've<00:04:55.110> got<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.470> keep<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.890> rhythm<00:04:56.070> where<00:04:56.970> you're

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
you've got to keep a rhythm where you're

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.300 
you've got to keep a rhythm where you're
grounded<00:04:58.170> in<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> midst<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.920> all<00:04:59.130> this

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
grounded in the midst of all this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.250

happening around you and I suppose and
the<00:05:02.130> sense<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.490> prayer<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.090> important<00:05:03.630> for<00:05:03.840> all

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
the sense of prayer is important for all

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.750 
the sense of prayer is important for all
three<00:05:04.230> of<00:05:04.260> us<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:04.770> sometimes<00:05:05.190> life<00:05:05.340> can<00:05:05.400> be

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
three of us but sometimes life can be

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.200 
three of us but sometimes life can be
quite<00:05:06.000> frenetic<00:05:07.130> what<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.250> were<00:05:09.000> very

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
quite frenetic what we were very

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.260 
quite frenetic what we were very
impressed<00:05:09.360> with<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.800> will<00:05:11.070> always<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.640> is<00:05:12.000> the
