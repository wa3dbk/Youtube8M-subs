his muta list out so I'm gonna get some
good<00:01:04.500> obviously<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.489> glides<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> defending

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
good obviously one glides to defending
its<00:01:06.299> mulus<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.930> glides<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.619> better<00:01:07.890> than

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
its mulus and glides are better than

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.679

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Marines and medics against me a list I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.170 
Marines and medics against me a list I
think<00:01:10.100> just<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.250> they're<00:01:11.549> bigger<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
think just because they're bigger and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
think just because they're bigger and
they<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.659> dies<00:01:12.960> easily<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.250> know

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they don't dies easily and you know

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.530 
they don't dies easily and you know
there's<00:01:14.640> they<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.850> more<00:01:15.060> arrangement<00:01:15.450> okay

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
there's they have more arrangement okay

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
there's they have more arrangement okay

am getting my plus-one attack so i'm
probably<00:02:20.930> going<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.260> attack<00:02:21.620> right<00:02:21.830> after<00:02:21.860> i

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
probably going to attack right after i

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
right yeah I'm getting more supply

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.280 
right yeah I'm getting more supply
depots<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.570> don't<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:29.959> supply

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
depots you know I don't to be supply

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.770 
depots you know I don't to be supply
bucked<00:02:31.209> because<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.330> know<00:02:32.420> that's<00:02:32.570> probably

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
bucked because you know that's probably

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.840 
bucked because you know that's probably
a<00:02:32.840> really<00:02:32.870> bad<00:02:33.170> thing<00:02:33.489> another<00:02:34.489> thing<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.730> like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
a really bad thing another thing I like

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.640 
a really bad thing another thing I like
to<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.630> programmer<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:36.440> if<00:02:36.560> they

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
to think a programmer is like if they

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.710 
to think a programmer is like if they
had<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.830> choose<00:02:36.980> between<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.550> supply<00:02:38.209> block<00:02:38.480> or

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
had to choose between a supply block or

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.540 
had to choose between a supply block or
a<00:02:39.319> block<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.890> think<00:02:40.160> they'd<00:02:40.220> rather<00:02:40.370> be

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
a block I think they'd rather be

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.580 
a block I think they'd rather be
 block<00:02:40.970> then<00:02:41.300> be<00:02:41.420> supply<00:02:41.720> blocks<00:02:41.989> because

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
 block then be supply blocks because

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.190 
 block then be supply blocks because
you<00:02:42.739> know<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.190> supplier<00:02:43.700> block<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.120> like<00:02:44.300> it's

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
you know a supplier block is like it's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.890 
you know a supplier block is like it's
painful<00:02:45.739> for<00:02:45.769> a<00:02:46.010> programmer<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.489> witness<00:02:47.150> like

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
painful for a programmer to witness like

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.270 
painful for a programmer to witness like
honestly<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.530> blocks<00:02:48.769> probably<00:02:49.040> not<00:02:49.160> that

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
honestly a blocks probably not that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.190 
honestly a blocks probably not that
bad<00:02:49.400> for<00:02:49.580> them<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:49.730> all<00:02:50.630> their<00:02:50.900> frickin

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
bad for them because all their frickin

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320 
bad for them because all their frickin
pro<00:02:51.440> gamers<00:02:51.769> they<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.070> get<00:02:52.910> laid<00:02:53.120> like

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
pro gamers they probably get laid like

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.110 
pro gamers they probably get laid like
every<00:02:53.570> day<00:02:53.980> again<00:02:54.980> I'm<00:02:55.070> not<00:02:55.190> gonna<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.700> have<00:02:56.030> no

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
proof to back that up I'm just pulling

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.430 
proof to back that up I'm just pulling
stuff<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.519> my<00:02:58.700> ass<00:02:58.880> and<00:02:58.910> saying<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.480> as<00:03:00.110> it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
stuff on my ass and saying it as it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.100 
stuff on my ass and saying it as it
comes<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.680> my<00:03:00.739> mind<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:02.000> whatever<00:03:02.540> as<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.019> can

why<00:03:11.180> would<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.420> engage<00:03:11.840> at<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> translators

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
why would you engage at the translators

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.770 
why would you engage at the translators
base<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.120> know<00:03:14.360> where<00:03:14.570> they're<00:03:14.690> going

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
base like you know where they're going

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.460 
base like you know where they're going
to<00:03:14.870> go<00:03:14.959> what<00:03:15.049> they're<00:03:15.170> going<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.320> come

directly<00:03:15.829> to<00:03:16.040> your<00:03:16.130> base<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:16.730> might<00:03:16.910> as<00:03:16.940> well

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
directly to your base so might as well

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.000 
directly to your base so might as well
gather<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.660> extra<00:03:17.989> two<00:03:18.170> three<00:03:18.410> four<00:03:18.620> hydras

that<00:03:19.190> you're<00:03:19.310> going<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.489> get<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.959> get<00:03:20.959> those

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
that you're going to get and get those

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.289 
that you're going to get and get those
inside<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.530> army<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:21.980> kick<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.489> he's

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
inside the army that kick that he's

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.610 
inside the army that kick that he's
gonna<00:03:23.450> push<00:03:23.690> with<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.500> also

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
gonna push with and so you and you also

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.170 
gonna push with and so you and you also
have<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.860> better<00:03:25.040> flank<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:25.970> know

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
have a better flank and you like know

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.640 
have a better flank and you like know
exactly<00:03:26.690> where<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> Army<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.200> going<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.410> be<00:03:27.500> so

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
exactly where the Army is going to be so

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.680 
exactly where the Army is going to be so
you<00:03:27.739> can<00:03:27.860> position<00:03:28.070> your<00:03:28.340> me<00:03:28.519> like<00:03:29.420> in<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
you can position your me like in the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.690 
you can position your me like in the
perfect<00:03:30.110> counter<00:03:30.530> position<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:31.190> flank<00:03:31.519> them

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
perfect counter position to flank them

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490 
perfect counter position to flank them
properly<00:03:32.420> so<00:03:32.690> if<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.900> are<00:03:33.079> as<00:03:33.170> are<00:03:33.290> clear

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
properly so if you are as are clear

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.560 
properly so if you are as are clear
determine<00:03:33.860> players<00:03:34.010> meking<00:03:34.400> don't<00:03:35.120> attack

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
determine players meking don't attack

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.850 
determine players meking don't attack
them<00:03:35.750> right<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.110> they're<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.350> right<00:03:36.680> when

but<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.120> know<00:06:01.240> it's<00:06:01.419> not<00:06:01.540> the<00:06:01.600> best<00:06:01.930> counter

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
but you know it's not the best counter

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.240 
but you know it's not the best counter
so<00:06:02.560> I<00:06:02.860> don't<00:06:03.490> really<00:06:03.990> recommend<00:06:04.990> I<00:06:05.470> don't<00:06:06.190> know

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
so I don't really recommend I don't know

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.500 
so I don't really recommend I don't know
that's<00:06:06.430> really<00:06:06.640> gasps<00:06:06.910> Eddie<00:06:07.150> honestly

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
that's really gasps Eddie honestly

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.490 
that's really gasps Eddie honestly

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
know where he's getting all the gas for

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.800 
know where he's getting all the gas for
this<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.550> we<00:06:15.669> has<00:06:15.790> to<00:06:15.940> guess<00:06:16.150> as<00:06:16.419> far<00:06:16.450> as<00:06:16.720> i

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
this and we has to guess as far as i

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.320 
this and we has to guess as far as i
know<00:06:17.130> again<00:06:18.130> there's<00:06:18.310> there's<00:06:18.640> a<00:06:18.700> expansion

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
know again there's there's a expansion

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.750 
know again there's there's a expansion
on<00:06:19.419> this<00:06:19.540> map<00:06:19.690> which<00:06:19.870> has<00:06:20.050> two<00:06:20.260> gas<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:20.860> I<00:06:21.070> like

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
on this map which has two gas but I like

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.920 
on this map which has two gas but I like
honestly<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.210> don't<00:06:22.270> even<00:06:22.390> know<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.660> exact

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
honestly I don't even know the exact

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.330 
honestly I don't even know the exact
positioning<00:06:23.350> of<00:06:23.440> it<00:06:23.590> it's<00:06:23.740> somewhere<00:06:24.070> at<00:06:24.190> like

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
positioning of it it's somewhere at like

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.790 
positioning of it it's somewhere at like
seven<00:06:24.640> o'clock<00:06:24.880> for<00:06:25.090> him<00:06:25.260> but<00:06:26.260> whatever<00:06:26.530> now

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
seven o'clock for him but whatever now

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.590 
seven o'clock for him but whatever now
as<00:06:27.070> you<00:06:27.190> can<00:06:27.280> see<00:06:27.340> my<00:06:27.610> final<00:06:27.940> push<00:06:28.120> and<00:06:28.419> he's

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
as you can see my final push and he's

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.110 
as you can see my final push and he's
wasted<00:06:28.960> way<00:06:29.080> too<00:06:29.110> many<00:06:29.320> hydras

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
wasted way too many hydras

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.600 
wasted way too many hydras
lists<00:06:30.570> trying<00:06:31.350> to<00:06:31.560> do<00:06:31.800> these<00:06:31.949> small<00:06:32.250> pushes

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
lists trying to do these small pushes

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.370 
lists trying to do these small pushes
and<00:06:32.790> so<00:06:33.090> he<00:06:33.419> has<00:06:33.510> nothing<00:06:33.660> defined<00:06:34.110> and<00:06:34.290> he

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
and so he has nothing defined and he

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.980 
and so he has nothing defined and he
calls<00:06:34.560> GG<00:06:34.860> so<00:06:35.100> you<00:06:35.699> know<00:06:35.790> that's<00:06:35.880> game<00:06:36.180> it<00:06:36.870> was

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
calls GG so you know that's game it was

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.600 
calls GG so you know that's game it was
kind<00:06:37.169> of<00:06:37.260> like<00:06:37.590> this<00:06:37.800> push<00:06:37.979> was<00:06:38.130> inevitable

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
kind of like this push was inevitable

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.159 
kind of like this push was inevitable
and<00:06:38.820> he<00:06:39.090> really<00:06:39.419> had<00:06:39.540> nothing<00:06:39.630> to<00:06:39.810> stop<00:06:39.990> but<00:06:40.110> I

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
and he really had nothing to stop but I

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.240 
and he really had nothing to stop but I
don't<00:06:40.320> know<00:06:40.380> why<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.770> only<00:06:40.979> thing<00:06:41.100> he<00:06:41.190> could

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
don't know why the only thing he could

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.700 
don't know why the only thing he could
have<00:06:41.310> really<00:06:41.550> done<00:06:41.729> was<00:06:41.910> engaged<00:06:42.389> later<00:06:43.320> as

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
have really done was engaged later as

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.379 
have really done was engaged later as
opposed<00:06:44.130> to<00:06:44.250> earlier<00:06:44.280> I<00:06:44.760> don't<00:06:44.910> know<00:06:45.000> why<00:06:45.120> kept

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:45.389 
opposed to earlier I don't know why kept

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.790 
opposed to earlier I don't know why kept
throwing<00:06:45.570> away<00:06:45.810> small<00:06:46.080> groups<00:06:46.350> of<00:06:46.440> hydrous

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
throwing away small groups of hydrous

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.710 
throwing away small groups of hydrous
probably<00:06:47.070> wasted<00:06:47.310> around<00:06:47.520> 1520<00:06:48.389> I'd<00:06:48.540> raised

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
probably wasted around 1520 I'd raised

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.990 
probably wasted around 1520 I'd raised
in<00:06:48.870> total<00:06:49.139> it's<00:06:49.860> like<00:06:50.010> with<00:06:50.280> me<00:06:50.460> only<00:06:50.639> losing

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
in total it's like with me only losing

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.480 
in total it's like with me only losing
like<00:06:51.120> 23<00:06:51.449> glides<00:06:51.690> and<00:06:51.960> like<00:06:52.350> 12<00:06:52.830> tanks<00:06:53.220> so<00:06:53.430> you

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
like 23 glides and like 12 tanks so you

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.920 
like 23 glides and like 12 tanks so you
know<00:06:53.729> if<00:06:53.880> he<00:06:53.970> kept<00:06:54.180> those<00:06:54.270> are<00:06:54.449> just<00:06:54.570> obviously

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
know if he kept those are just obviously

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.140 
know if he kept those are just obviously
who<00:06:55.080> had<00:06:55.169> astounded<00:06:55.470> a<00:06:55.530> better<00:06:55.710> chance<00:06:56.150> um

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
who had astounded a better chance um

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.420 
who had astounded a better chance um
besides<00:06:57.870> that<00:06:57.960> like<00:06:58.440> nothing<00:06:59.190> else<00:06:59.340> really

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
besides that like nothing else really

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.370 
besides that like nothing else really
went<00:06:59.699> wrong<00:06:59.760> for<00:07:00.000> him<00:07:00.090> obviously<00:07:00.630> having<00:07:01.320> a

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
went wrong for him obviously having a

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.870 
went wrong for him obviously having a
little<00:07:01.560> bit<00:07:01.680> circlings<00:07:02.070> in<00:07:02.190> his<00:07:02.280> army<00:07:02.580> maybe<00:07:02.789> a

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
little bit circlings in his army maybe a

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.520 
little bit circlings in his army maybe a
sunken<00:07:03.210> ER<00:07:03.270> too<00:07:03.449> so<00:07:03.630> when<00:07:03.750> my<00:07:03.870> siege<00:07:04.050> tanks<00:07:04.380> see

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
sunken ER too so when my siege tanks see

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.740 
sunken ER too so when my siege tanks see
they<00:07:05.160> attack<00:07:05.400> the<00:07:05.520> sunken<00:07:05.850> as<00:07:06.000> opposed<00:07:06.330> to<00:07:06.539> his

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
they attack the sunken as opposed to his

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.279 
they attack the sunken as opposed to his
units<00:07:07.289> and<00:07:08.100> he<00:07:09.060> needed<00:07:09.270> a<00:07:09.389> good<00:07:09.539> flank<00:07:09.840> also<00:07:10.169> he

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289 
units and he needed a good flank also he

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:11.689 
units and he needed a good flank also he
didn't<00:07:10.470> really<00:07:10.620> have<00:07:10.740> that<00:07:10.770> either<00:07:11.010> you<00:07:11.580> need

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 
didn't really have that either you need

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:12.620 
didn't really have that either you need
good<00:07:11.850> positioning<00:07:12.330> when<00:07:12.419> you're<00:07:12.539> gonna

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:12.630 
good positioning when you're gonna

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.290 
good positioning when you're gonna
engage<00:07:12.900> return<00:07:13.260> army<00:07:13.889> and<00:07:14.130> Travers<00:07:14.820> egg<00:07:15.000> when

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
engage return army and Travers egg when

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.909 
engage return army and Travers egg when
they're<00:07:15.419> going<00:07:15.539> back<00:07:15.810> and<00:07:16.530> besides<00:07:16.860> that

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
they're going back and besides that

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:18.290
