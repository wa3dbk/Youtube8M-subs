00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.810
 you imagine what it would be like to live outside 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.620
 of the capitalist system to this day 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.110
 everybody lives thinking about money 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.080
 overwhelmed by paying his debts and overwhelmed 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.199
 for paying an apartment even the wealthiest 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.480
 are overwhelmed with winning more and more money 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 to spend it on more things than not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.910
 need today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 man who decided to live outside the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 system live a whole year without money 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.899
 his name is mark boyle surely 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690
 sound of something because after all 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.770
 this name has been sounded by many 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 places let's say you had a company 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.989
 he earned a lot of money but did not 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.719
 I liked having to be tied to money 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.450
 to the traffic jams of the city to the bad 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.000
 people that lifestyle in 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.980
 reality is not as healthy as we think a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.980
 style full of stress and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.309
 concerns so that said I'll 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.399
 send everything to shit broke away from 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.490
 sumo from his girlfriend who did not want 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.100
 follow him on his adventure and left his 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 work left absolutely everything and 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.380
 he used the little money he had left 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.159
 to buy a second caravan 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 hand put a few small panels 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.630
 solar panels on top of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.630
 caravan with which he got 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.899
 electric power to power your 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.929
 laptop with which do not think that 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.480
 he lives incommunicado he also had a 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.310
 ground 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.920
 a land of four thousand meters 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.650
 squares of these baratitos where 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.260
 planted all kinds of fruits and vegetables 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.530
 and he fed and he also fed 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.800
 of the remains of the food that does not 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 they wanted food in supermarkets that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.390
 As you know, it 's fine, it's good 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.030
 been still but that the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.640
 supermarkets throw it away because it's coming 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.640
 to its expiration date and nobody 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.550
 buy there are even foods that expire 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 and still you can eat without risk of 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.100
 nothing happens to you as you can see is a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.250
 He is not a man who got up the courage and 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.340
 He said it is time to fight 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.800
 system this capitalist system that has 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.410
 created so many differences between rich and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.650
 poor and that so much evil has brought 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.660
 world because it is time to undo it and 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.910
 live on the sidelines 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.950
 a very difficult decision because 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.530
 when a person is used to 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 all the amenities offered by 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.390
 example a house or live in a place 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.370
 partner I know the comforts that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.010
 we take for granted ourselves and that in 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.680
 reality in many people do not have 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.440
 It is very difficult to get rid of all 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.110
 those luxuries are the so-called needs 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.790
 created is like if a person is like 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.880
 yes to all the people of the world now 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.060
 remove them as mobile and computer 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.950
 it would be difficult to adapt well because this 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.710
 man has done it except for 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.170
 who has not given up his laptop anymore 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.200
 today leads a life without spending 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.820
 no money 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.880
 this person will surely have a lot 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.220
 to contribute and much to teach all 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.380
 those people who are overwhelmed 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.420
 because they do not have money to get to 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.540
 end of the month because if this person has 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.080
 got to live without any money all 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.080
 it's possible
