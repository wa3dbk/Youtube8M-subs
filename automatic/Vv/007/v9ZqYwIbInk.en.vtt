00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
maybe Stuart Baxter is looking at that

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.280 
maybe Stuart Baxter is looking at that
and<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.909> know<00:01:16.030> what<00:01:16.210> my<00:01:16.720> time<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.170> done

and going you know what my time is done

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.499 
and going you know what my time is done
maybe<00:01:18.040> adding<00:01:18.460> to<00:01:18.580> this<00:01:18.700> theory<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.270> fact

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
maybe adding to this theory is the fact

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.929 
maybe adding to this theory is the fact
that<00:01:19.630> unlike<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.740> coach<00:01:21.040> who<00:01:21.220> would<00:01:21.400> be<00:01:21.549> staying

for<00:01:35.079> example<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.590> Alex<00:01:35.890> Ferguson<00:01:36.369> did<00:01:36.520> when

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
for example and Alex Ferguson did when

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.039 
for example and Alex Ferguson did when
Rooney<00:01:36.970> put<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.360> his<00:01:37.450> hand<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:37.780> there<00:01:37.930> was

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
Rooney put up his hand and there was

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
Rooney put up his hand and there was
talk<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.290> him<00:01:38.590> leaving<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.040> team<00:01:39.220> and

talk of him leaving the team and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.719 
talk of him leaving the team and
possibly<00:01:40.659> it's<00:01:41.590> not<00:01:41.799> his<00:01:41.979> problem<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.549> deal

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
possibly it's not his problem to deal

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.609 
possibly it's not his problem to deal
with<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:43.149> that's<00:01:43.930> why<00:01:44.110> we're<00:01:44.259> not<00:01:44.380> hearing

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
with and that's why we're not hearing

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.429 
with and that's why we're not hearing
too<00:01:44.860> much<00:01:45.210> noise<00:01:46.210> for<00:01:46.450> him<00:01:46.600> where<00:01:47.140> he's<00:01:47.290> the
