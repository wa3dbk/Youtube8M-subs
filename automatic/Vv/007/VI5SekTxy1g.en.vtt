you could do four of them at a time you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.759 
you could do four of them at a time you
know<00:00:41.870> if<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.019> have<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.170> 4<00:00:42.710> slice<00:00:43.010> toaster<00:00:43.120> and

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
know if you have a 4 slice toaster and

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.810 
know if you have a 4 slice toaster and
I've<00:00:45.769> been<00:00:45.890> eating<00:00:45.979> lots<00:00:46.159> of<00:00:46.309> rice<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.670> beans

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
so I get a little bit lazier a little

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.979 
so I get a little bit lazier a little
bit<00:00:48.650> quicker<00:00:48.920> here<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.369> just<00:00:49.570> toast<00:00:50.570> these<00:00:50.780> up

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
it's a lot easier than big enough chips

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.700 
it's a lot easier than big enough chips
it's<00:01:23.150> great<00:01:23.330> with<00:01:23.510> rice<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:23.960> beans<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.500> stuff

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
like that so I'm just putting them in

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.580 
like that so I'm just putting them in
and<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:30.470> toaster<00:01:30.950> has<00:01:31.900> settings<00:01:32.900> from<00:01:33.170> 1<00:01:33.380> to

9 so you can increase the the heat the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.520 
9 so you can increase the the heat the
level<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.000> you<00:01:38.120> want<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.630> cook<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.440> know

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
yourself or cook up to these you have

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.870 
yourself or cook up to these you have
two<00:01:56.420> people<00:01:57.880> so<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.440> super<00:02:00.440> convenient<00:02:03.880> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
two people so it's super convenient the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.190 
two people so it's super convenient the
other<00:02:05.060> thing<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.479> make<00:02:05.510> sure<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:06.020> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
other thing is to make sure that the

other thing is to make sure that the
toast<00:02:06.560> up<00:02:06.799> beyond<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.820> chewy<00:02:08.030> stage<00:02:09.019> so

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
toast up beyond the the chewy stage so

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.020 
toast up beyond the the chewy stage so
there's<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> stage<00:02:10.489> where<00:02:10.700> they'll<00:02:10.819> kind

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
there's like a stage where they'll kind

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.850 
there's like a stage where they'll kind
of<00:02:11.120> bend<00:02:11.299> a<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.599> beat<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.379> want<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.739> you
