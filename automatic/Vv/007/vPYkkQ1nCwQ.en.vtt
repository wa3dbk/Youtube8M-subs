00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
some some dark screening so that we can

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.280 
some some dark screening so that we can
cover<00:00:10.080> his<00:00:10.290> eyes<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.090> we're<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.420> then

cover his eyes and we're going to then
take<00:00:13.740> some<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.460> foam<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.269> called<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.599> wet

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
take some of this foam it's called a wet

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.620 
take some of this foam it's called a wet
foam<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.310> real<00:00:17.670> very<00:00:18.180> lightweight

foam it's just real very lightweight
foam<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.859> shaped<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.430> cut<00:00:20.640> very

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
foam that can be shaped and cut very

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.240 
foam that can be shaped and cut very
easy<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:22.070> we've<00:00:23.269> carved<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:25.019> top<00:00:25.289> part<00:00:25.650> we're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
easy and we've carved the top part we're

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.009 
easy and we've carved the top part we're
making<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.960> venom<00:00:27.960> style<00:00:28.740> mask<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.720> we've

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
making a venom style mask and so we've

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.700 
making a venom style mask and so we've
shaped<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> use

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
shaped this and then we're going to use

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.260 
shaped this and then we're going to use
latex<00:00:34.710> liquid<00:00:35.070> latex<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> glue<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
latex liquid latex and glue it to the

latex liquid latex and glue it to the
hood<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:38.250> we're<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.790> start

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
hood and then we're going to start

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.660 
hood and then we're going to start
working<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.600> adding<00:00:40.260> some<00:00:40.559> elements<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
working on adding some elements to it to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.420 
working on adding some elements to it to
start<00:00:42.059> creating<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> venom<00:00:42.750> mask<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.309> took<00:00:44.309> that

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
start creating a venom mask I took that

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
start creating a venom mask I took that
square<00:00:44.789> block<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.329> foam<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.960> carve<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
square block of foam and I carve that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.380

clay and we're gonna start building up

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
clay and we're gonna start building up
the<00:01:05.519> head<00:01:05.939> part<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> mask<00:01:08.659> alright<00:01:09.659> got<00:01:09.780> my

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
first coat of the modeling clay on top

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.480 
first coat of the modeling clay on top
of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> mask<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> start<00:01:14.430> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of the mask and it's going to start to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
of the mask and it's going to start to
give<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> shape<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.570> I'm<00:01:15.810> giving<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.229> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
give it the shape and I'm giving them a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.520 
give it the shape and I'm giving them a
couple<00:01:16.560> spots<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.409> it's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
couple spots to see and I think it's

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.630 
couple spots to see and I think it's
going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> turn<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:19.920> pretty<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.430> going

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to turn out pretty good I'm going

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.539 
going to turn out pretty good I'm going
to<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.150> cover<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> whole<00:01:22.259> thing<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:23.520> some

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to now cover the whole thing with some

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.730 
to now cover the whole thing with some
liquid<00:01:24.180> latex<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:24.960> gonna<00:01:25.110> kind<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> hold

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
liquid latex that's gonna kind of hold

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
liquid latex that's gonna kind of hold
it<00:01:25.830> together<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.520> give<00:01:27.150> us<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> nice<00:01:27.570> area<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it together and give us a nice area a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.149 
it together and give us a nice area a
nice<00:01:28.950> solid<00:01:29.520> surface<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.540> work<00:01:30.689> from<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.740> we'll

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
nice solid surface to work from so we'll

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.179 
nice solid surface to work from so we'll
let<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.430> dry<00:01:33.049> cover<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.590> latex

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
let this dry cover it with some latex

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.640 
let this dry cover it with some latex
and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.579> we'll<00:01:36.360> add<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:37.590> i

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and then we'll add to it all right i

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
and then we'll add to it all right i
spray-painted<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.310> modeling<00:01:38.759> clay<00:01:38.880> black

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
spray-painted the modeling clay black

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.710 
spray-painted the modeling clay black
and<00:01:39.869> now<00:01:40.290> we're<00:01:40.650> adding<00:01:41.340> liquid<00:01:41.880> latex<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and now we're adding liquid latex to it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.080 
and now we're adding liquid latex to it
to<00:01:42.840> smooth<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.229> all<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> edges<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.090> we'll

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to smooth out all the edges and we'll

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
to smooth out all the edges and we'll
let<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> dry<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.229> we'll<00:01:46.290> probably<00:01:46.470> add

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
let this dry and then we'll probably add

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
let this dry and then we'll probably add
some<00:01:46.770> veins<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> couple<00:01:47.790> other<00:01:47.970> things

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
some veins and a couple other things

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.080 
some veins and a couple other things
from<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.430> added<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.700> liquid

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
from here I added a little more liquid

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
from here I added a little more liquid
latex<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.659> build<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.049> areas<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
latex and build up some areas on the
