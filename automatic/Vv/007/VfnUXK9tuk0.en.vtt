memorial day monday which is the 27th so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.259 
memorial day monday which is the 27th so
I'm<00:03:02.560> going<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.920> wash<00:03:03.070> my<00:03:03.100> hair<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:03.610> Saturday

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
I'm going to wash my hair on Saturday

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.319 
I'm going to wash my hair on Saturday
Saturdays<00:03:05.170> typically<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.070> day<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.090> have

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
Saturdays typically the day that I have

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.270 
Saturdays typically the day that I have
the<00:03:07.510> most<00:03:07.690> time<00:03:08.140> per<00:03:08.590> se<00:03:09.870> someday<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.530> depends

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
the most time per se someday it depends

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.840 
the most time per se someday it depends
so<00:03:13.209> I<00:03:13.630> think<00:03:14.170> I'll<00:03:14.440> wash<00:03:14.620> my<00:03:14.799> hair<00:03:14.950> tomorrow<00:03:15.190> or

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
so I think I'll wash my hair tomorrow or

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.560 
so I think I'll wash my hair tomorrow or
at<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.870> latest<00:03:17.609> will<00:03:18.609> be<00:03:18.760> memorial<00:03:19.420> day<00:03:20.519> and

at the latest will be memorial day and

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.930 
at the latest will be memorial day and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
so I think my husband should be of take

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.289 
so I think my husband should be of take
care<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.299> both<00:03:25.920> babies<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.640> can<00:03:27.790> go<00:03:28.180> ahead

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
care of both babies so I can go ahead

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.030 
cut off that's heat damaged or damaged
ends<00:04:09.099> so<00:04:10.380> that's<00:04:11.380> what<00:04:11.590> I'm<00:04:11.680> working<00:04:11.890> with

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
ends so that's what I'm working with

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.309 
ends so that's what I'm working with
right<00:04:12.340> now<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.760> the<00:04:12.880> back<00:04:13.090> and<00:04:13.569> I'm<00:04:14.110> going<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
right now in the back and I'm going to

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.930 
right now in the back and I'm going to
go<00:04:14.470> ahead<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.709> try<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.040> turn<00:04:15.280> around<00:04:15.459> so<00:04:15.819> you

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
go ahead and try to turn around so you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.060 
go ahead and try to turn around so you
have<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.780> good<00:04:17.260> perspective<00:04:17.709> of<00:04:18.250> where<00:04:18.489> at<00:04:19.419> and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
have a good perspective of where at and

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.610 
have a good perspective of where at and
it<00:04:21.070> shows<00:04:21.970> about<00:04:22.180> brush<00:04:22.600> trap<00:04:23.050> because<00:04:23.320> that's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
it shows about brush trap because that's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.120 
it shows about brush trap because that's
where<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:23.919> bra<00:04:24.160> strap<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.960> again<00:04:26.830> I'm

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.460 
going to take off about it get two

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
inches or so so my hair would be a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.950 
inches or so so my hair would be a
little<00:04:33.010> bit<00:04:33.160> above<00:04:33.400> bra<00:04:34.030> strap<00:04:34.419> length<00:04:34.720> oh

my hair down a lot in the front so I do
clip<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.990> front<00:05:17.260> a<00:05:17.380> lot<00:05:17.560> more<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.160> that's<00:05:18.340> why

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
clip the front a lot more so that's why

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.800

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
couple of days once i edited ok tube I

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.770 
couple of days once i edited ok tube I
had<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.960> get<00:05:58.229> out<00:05:58.289> of<00:05:58.530> my<00:05:58.650> bathroom<00:05:58.830> because

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
had to get out of my bathroom because

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.839 
had to get out of my bathroom because
right<00:06:00.780> now<00:06:00.810> we<00:06:01.259> have<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.680> baby<00:06:01.860> in<00:06:02.220> our<00:06:02.490> room

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
so I can't really talk and wake her up

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.650 
so I can't really talk and wake her up
because<00:06:06.330> she<00:06:06.509> doesn't<00:06:07.470> tolerate<00:06:07.800> is<00:06:08.190> so

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
because she doesn't tolerate is so

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.059

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
braids that i undid unraveled it and

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.300 
braids that i undid unraveled it and
now<00:06:59.770> i'm<00:06:59.889> going<00:07:00.070> to<00:07:00.130> show<00:07:00.280> you<00:07:00.310> guys<00:07:00.430> don't<00:07:02.310> you

now i'm going to show you guys don't you
can<00:07:03.430> see<00:07:03.699> it's<00:07:03.910> thinner<00:07:04.570> on<00:07:04.930> the<00:07:05.590> ends<00:07:06.270> and

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
can see it's thinner on the ends and

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.150 
can see it's thinner on the ends and
pretty<00:07:09.550> much<00:07:09.810> this<00:07:10.810> is<00:07:10.990> where<00:07:11.199> i'm<00:07:11.350> at<00:07:11.650> length

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
pretty much this is where i'm at length

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.320 
pretty much this is where i'm at length
wise<00:07:13.830> I'm<00:07:14.830> gonna<00:07:14.979> have<00:07:15.160> to<00:07:15.250> pan<00:07:15.520> the<00:07:15.550> video<00:07:16.060> or

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
wise I'm gonna have to pan the video or

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.950 
wise I'm gonna have to pan the video or
the<00:07:16.360> camera<00:07:16.900> down<00:07:17.550> get<00:07:18.550> creative<00:07:19.330> with<00:07:19.750> this

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
the camera down get creative with this

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:26.219 
the camera down get creative with this
and<00:07:22.560> it's<00:07:23.560> possible<00:07:24.100> this<00:07:24.340> heat<00:07:24.930> gets<00:07:25.930> pretty

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229 
and it's possible this heat gets pretty

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:31.670 
and it's possible this heat gets pretty
interesting<00:07:26.830> trying<00:07:27.639> to<00:07:27.729> do<00:07:27.850> this

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.060 

so<00:07:32.220> you<00:07:32.340> can<00:07:32.520> kind<00:07:32.759> of<00:07:32.850> get<00:07:33.030> an<00:07:33.060> idea<00:07:33.270> of<00:07:34.070> the

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.070 
so you can kind of get an idea of the

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.770 
so you can kind of get an idea of the
length<00:07:35.340> and<00:07:37.610> I'm<00:07:38.610> going<00:07:38.789> to<00:07:38.850> turn<00:07:39.090> around<00:07:39.150> or

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 
length and I'm going to turn around or

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.930 
length and I'm going to turn around or
actually<00:07:40.320> younger<00:07:40.530> the<00:07:40.770> angle<00:07:41.340> wide<00:07:41.550> camera

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 
actually younger the angle wide camera

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.689 
actually younger the angle wide camera
that's<00:07:42.690> what<00:07:42.840> I<00:07:42.870> should<00:07:42.930> have<00:07:43.139> done<00:07:43.259> just<00:07:46.699> a

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 
that's what I should have done just a

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:52.260 
that's what I should have done just a
way<00:07:47.880> for<00:07:47.910> that

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.770 

and

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:56.780 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:04.000 

guys<00:07:57.410> at<00:07:58.310> from<00:07:59.180> the<00:07:59.330> back<00:08:00.490> fully<00:08:01.490> accessible
