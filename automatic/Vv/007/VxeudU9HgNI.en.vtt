00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
a wall he'll come he's not so much

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.180 
a wall he'll come he's not so much
offensive<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.060> he's<00:01:06.180> defensive<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:08.070> we

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
offensive but he's defensive and but we

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.859 
offensive but he's defensive and but we
all<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> Manny<00:01:08.910> comes<00:01:09.300> in<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.570> hundred

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
all know that Manny comes in a hundred

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
all know that Manny comes in a hundred
percent<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.350> he<00:01:10.410> never<00:01:10.530> gets<00:01:10.800> tired<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
percent and he never gets tired so you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.090 
percent and he never gets tired so you
know<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.720> hard<00:01:12.900> man<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.259> out<00:01:13.380> which

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
know but if it's hard man you out which

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.580 
know but if it's hard man you out which
I<00:01:14.250> doubt<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:15.030> we'll<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> problem<00:01:16.020> aside

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I doubt then we'll have a problem aside

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.780 
I doubt then we'll have a problem aside
from<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.280> only<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
from that that's the only thing I can

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
from that that's the only thing I can
see<00:01:18.060> body<00:01:18.780> doing<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.290> tiring<00:01:19.560> Manny<00:01:20.100> Pacquiao

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
see body doing is tiring Manny Pacquiao

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
see body doing is tiring Manny Pacquiao
but<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.300> see<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.450> happen<00:01:21.750> because

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
but I don't see it happen because

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.550 
but I don't see it happen because
Pacquiao<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.580> man<00:01:23.880> who<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.899> train<00:01:25.140> who

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
Pacquiao is a man who would train who

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.690 
Pacquiao is a man who would train who
inspired<00:01:25.890> me<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> straighten<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.550> he

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
inspired me to straighten the way he

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.370 
inspired me to straighten the way he
does<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.450> why<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> track<00:01:27.840> as<00:01:27.960> hard<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
does so that's why I track as hard as I

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.950 
does so that's why I track as hard as I
can<00:01:28.440> because<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.280> man<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> trade<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> hard<00:01:30.660> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
can because the man can trade so hard so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
can because the man can trade so hard so
I<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.649> with<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.580> speed<00:01:32.940> power<00:01:33.180> he

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
I think that with the speed power he

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.530 
I think that with the speed power he
couldn't<00:01:33.780> take<00:01:33.960> over<00:01:34.289> quatie
