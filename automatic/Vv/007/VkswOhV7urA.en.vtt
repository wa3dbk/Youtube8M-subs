00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello today we are with you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.920
 Consider Tunisian knitting facial 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:15.120
 paintings here and so looks like our model 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:22.619
 this front side looks like this from 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:25.769
 we start by typing a chain of 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.689
 air loops and we will knit 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 in the second loop from the hook first row 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:36.690
 The first row we have consists of two parts 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.660
 a and b first row we pray the hook 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 typesetting chain picks up a worker 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.510
 thread and stretch it all loops 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.510
 we stay hooked 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:10.910
 yes I am for the end of the row of a part of whom we 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:17.260
 We start a series of tying air 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.260
 the loop will continue to knit in pairs 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.830
 pick up the working thread and in pairs 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.830
 tying 2 loops from the hook 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.540
 knit part b of the first row now 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.650
 sent instructions of facial cloth for 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:07.840
 This we introduce the hook under the vertical 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.119
 column and under the pigtail here she enter 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.180
 hook 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:20.610
 pick up the working thread and pull out 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.610
 her loop remains on the hook and so on 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.680
 we enter the hook under the vertical column and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:47.860
 under the pigtail we catch the working thread and 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 we stretch it through the loop 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.750
 late do not forget to knit the last 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.750
 loop in this way 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:20.430
 part b we knit as usual 1 loop we 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:22.710
 we knit 1 air loop further 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.340
 pick up the working thread and knit 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.340
 pair it up to the end of the row 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:49.440
 then we will repeat the second row part a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:52.590
 and part b we enter the hook under the vertical 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:02.160
 a column and a pigtail I pick up the worker 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:04.940
 thread and pull so continue to knit 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.940
 to end of row 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:29.550
 Do not forget about the last loop and cheat 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:39.000
 the part was knitting the air loop and 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:39.000
 further we will knit 2 stitches and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:47.070
 we knit two loops to the pods 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.070
 way 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:03.369
 continuing to repeat the second row with us 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:05.559
 I will do it like this with you 

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:08.009
 say goodbye goodbye to the following 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:08.009
 of occupations
