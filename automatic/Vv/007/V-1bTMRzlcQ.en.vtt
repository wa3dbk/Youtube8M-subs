00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.090 
okay um we are going to play swing it's
a<00:00:10.790> thing<00:00:11.030> that's<00:00:11.210> been<00:00:11.390> quoted<00:00:12.110> on<00:00:12.320> here<00:00:12.800> quite

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
a thing that's been quoted on here quite

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.810 
a thing that's been quoted on here quite
a<00:00:13.130> bit<00:00:13.390> the<00:00:14.390> challenge<00:00:14.809> of<00:00:14.930> it<00:00:15.050> is<00:00:15.640> playing<00:00:16.640> at

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
a bit the challenge of it is playing at

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.700 
a bit the challenge of it is playing at
a<00:00:16.990> slower<00:00:17.990> speed<00:00:18.429> versus<00:00:19.429> a<00:00:19.749> very<00:00:20.749> very<00:00:21.409> very

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
a slower speed versus a very very very

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.329 
a slower speed versus a very very very
high<00:00:22.130> speed<00:00:23.380> because<00:00:24.380> when<00:00:24.739> you<00:00:24.829> play<00:00:25.009> at<00:00:25.220> a

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
high speed because when you play at a

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.390 
high speed because when you play at a
slower<00:00:25.970> speed<00:00:26.169> all<00:00:27.169> of<00:00:27.529> those<00:00:27.679> six<00:00:28.099> things

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
slower speed all of those six things

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.720 
slower speed all of those six things
know<00:00:29.089> patterns<00:00:29.630> on<00:00:29.960> your<00:00:29.989> fingers<00:00:30.730> those

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
know patterns on your fingers those

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.910 
know patterns on your fingers those
things<00:00:31.970> have<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.930> be<00:00:32.960> neat<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.130> steady

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
things have to be neat and steady

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.490 
things have to be neat and steady
sometimes<00:00:36.920> it's<00:00:37.129> easier<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:38.019> play<00:00:39.019> that<00:00:39.230> at<00:00:39.440> a

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
sometimes it's easier to play that at a

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.310 
sometimes it's easier to play that at a
higher<00:00:39.829> speed<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.489> when<00:00:40.670> it's<00:00:40.820> unsteady<00:00:41.390> at

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
higher speed and when it's unsteady at

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.830 
higher speed and when it's unsteady at
times<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:42.949> hard<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.460> notice<00:00:44.149> because<00:00:44.570> it's

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
times it's hard to notice because it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.319 
times it's hard to notice because it's
going<00:00:45.019> so<00:00:45.230> fast<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:48.010> yeah<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:49.339> when<00:00:50.179> you're

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
going so fast and yeah so when you're

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.819 
going so fast and yeah so when you're
playing<00:00:50.660> these<00:00:50.839> things<00:00:50.899> at<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.289> slower<00:00:51.710> speed

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
playing these things at a slower speed

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.310 
playing these things at a slower speed
you're<00:00:52.460> pretty<00:00:53.390> much<00:00:53.570> putting<00:00:53.899> yourself

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
you're pretty much putting yourself

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.880 
you're pretty much putting yourself
under<00:00:54.499> a<00:00:54.679> microscope<00:00:55.249> so<00:00:56.469> let's<00:00:57.469> give<00:00:57.739> this

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
under a microscope so let's give this

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:12.370 
under a microscope so let's give this
baby<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.460> world<00:00:59.089> stand<00:01:00.019> by<00:01:10.480> okay<00:01:11.480> let's<00:01:12.170> do<00:01:12.350> that

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
baby a world stand by okay let's do that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:02:52.809 
baby a world stand by okay let's do that
one<00:01:12.650> again<00:01:12.800> that's<00:01:13.370> better

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.100 

okay

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
okay

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.260 
okay
excuse<00:02:55.110> me<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:56.940> go

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
excuse me so there you go

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.160 
excuse me so there you go
at<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.160> slower<00:02:59.160> speed<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> wanted<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> just

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
at a slower speed now I wanted to just

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.199 
at a slower speed now I wanted to just
for<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.440> hell<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:02.430> wanted<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> test<00:03:03.030> my

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
for the hell of it you wanted to test my

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.140 
for the hell of it you wanted to test my
limit<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:04.830> how<00:03:04.950> fast<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.760> actually

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
limit and see how fast I can actually

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.050 
limit and see how fast I can actually
action<00:03:06.930> actually<00:03:07.290> play<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.800> at<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.850> same

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
action actually play this at the same

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.930 
action actually play this at the same
time<00:03:10.670> attempting<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.120> keep<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.200> notes

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
time attempting to keep these notes

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.520 
time attempting to keep these notes
steady<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:17.000> let's<00:03:18.000> speed<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:18.989> baby<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.680> to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
steady so let's speed this baby up to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:30.460 
steady so let's speed this baby up to
200<00:03:22.530> beats<00:03:23.069> per<00:03:23.970> minute<00:03:25.310> stand<00:03:26.310> by<00:03:27.530> okay<00:03:28.530> so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
200 beats per minute stand by okay so

00:03:30.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
200 beats per minute stand by okay so
here<00:03:31.470> goes

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.950 

okay<00:04:33.490> if<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.759> notice<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.389> tempo

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
okay if you notice that that tempo

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.159 
okay if you notice that that tempo
pretty<00:04:35.349> much<00:04:35.530> lost<00:04:35.830> its<00:04:36.250> swing<00:04:37.060> hence<00:04:37.539> the

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
pretty much lost its swing hence the

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.200 
pretty much lost its swing hence the
name<00:04:40.439> but<00:04:41.439> yeah<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:42.610> wanted<00:04:42.909> to<00:04:42.969> do<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.090> for
