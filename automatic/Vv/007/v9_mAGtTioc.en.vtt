key<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.820> been<00:00:48.059> really

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
key with it it's actually been really

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.090 
key with it it's actually been really
easy<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.110> made<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> choice<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
easy because I made the choice in the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.410 
easy because I made the choice in the
decision<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.300> was

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
decision that this is something I was

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.350 
decision that this is something I was
going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> stick<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> only

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
going to stick to and you know the only

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.860 
going to stick to and you know the only
times<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.649> been<00:00:55.949> hard<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.840> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
times that it's been hard is when I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.990 
times that it's been hard is when I
haven't<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.260> prepared<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.850> get

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
haven't been prepared so when you get

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.979 
haven't been prepared so when you get
hungry<00:01:00.510> yeah<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.949> story<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
hungry yeah that's pretty story so

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.560 
hungry yeah that's pretty story so
preparation<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.110> definitely<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> key<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
preparation is definitely the key and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
preparation is definitely the key and
having<00:01:06.570> having<00:01:07.380> foods<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.950> are<00:01:08.100> quick<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
having having foods that are quick and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
having having foods that are quick and
simple<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.330> easier<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> snack<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.380> like

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
simple and easier to snack on not like

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
simple and easier to snack on not like
you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> spend<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.520> lot<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> time

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
you have to spend a lot of time

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
you have to spend a lot of time
preparing<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.540> meals<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.650> key<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> think

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
preparing your meals is the key I think

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.920 
preparing your meals is the key I think
to<00:01:14.310> being<00:01:14.490> successful<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.299> especially

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
to being successful on this especially

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
to being successful on this especially
as<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> nursing<00:01:16.770> mom<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> guess<00:01:18.030> sometimes

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
as a nursing mom and I guess sometimes

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.780 
as a nursing mom and I guess sometimes
the<00:01:18.930> morning<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:19.860> away<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.280> me<00:01:20.430> you
