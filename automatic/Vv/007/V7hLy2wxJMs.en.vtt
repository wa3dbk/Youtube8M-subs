00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.930
 good the technique to paint the 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.900
 chocolates is very simple nothing else we are going 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.410
 to need two things that the first one is 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.830
 a little sugar does not matter what you 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.400
 have at home in a ziploc bag like 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.300
 this one and painting to paint our 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.460
 sugar I use mainly three 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.129
 different paint formats and one is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.809
 in pasta that is this winston brand 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:43.010
 which is the best known also there is 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.370
 gel or liquid format 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.190
 just make sure it's painting 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.340
 edible 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.590
 the procedure is the following I am going to 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.620
 open my little bag 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.620
 and I 'm going to use this gel paint 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.120
 and I'm going to put a few drops inside the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.250
 sachet 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 let's start little by little 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.610
 and we'll see the intensity it takes 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.450
 I'm going to close the bag and I'm going to take it out 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 all the air 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.530
 and what I'm going to do is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.600
 shake this sachet 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.600
 to incorporate all the high color 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.440
 and it bothers them right away 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.550
 how to paint chocolates 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.470
 good for painting the chocolates 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.290
 I need a bowl or a refractory with 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.780
 water of preference and I will 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.410
 need kitchen towels 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.140
 and if they take care enough paradito 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.770
 right now I'm going to use a little bit because only 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.640
 I'm going to paint a chocolate 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.740
 and I 'm going to use gloves what I'm going to 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.620
 to do is take this chocolate that is the 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.430
 giant chocolate and I'm going to put it 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.069
 directly to the water 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.020
 to remove all the cornstarch that they have 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.760
 the chocolates 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.810
 if they realize the water is being 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.810
 painting white 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.319
 and it's something very fast that is done is not 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.930
 necessary to submerge it or leave it 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.100
 time there and now the only thing I do is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.970
 take the kitchen towel and I'll 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.970
 approach very well 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.030
 Once the chocolate is dry, I'm going to 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.100
 introduce into the cycle sachet with the 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.240
 sugar already painted 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.240
 I'm going to seal it 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.360
 I'm going to move my bag 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.360
 until the chocolate is dyed 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.330
 since the chocolate was painted I'm going to remove 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.780
 the excess shaking a little bit of this 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.780
 way 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.990
 and that's how the painted chocolate looks 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.770
 look, I'm going to show you other colors 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.729
 of sugar that the variety can make 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.819
 it's infinite this is a yellow 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.110
 I also have purple camera 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.900
 Focus on another color but 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.500
 they are so this pink that you are cute 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.500
 for girls 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.340
 in blue 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.940
 in short they can make the colors that more 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.120
 you like it and I also have this color 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.240
 orange can make the colors that more 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.460
 you like it with sugar and what unique 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.840
 what they need is to have imagination for 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.840
 to form your pallets 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.300
 good for the glue of the pallets 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.569
 what I will need is water me here 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.899
 I have nothing else and a half cup of water 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:06:00.639
 and I'm going to use Grenetina, which is Latin 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:02.919
 without flavor 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.749
 I the one who uses this grenetina of the 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.230
 brand kroger and I find it in my 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:10.320
 supermarket food for less 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.360
 and I'm going to take a packet nothing else is 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.360
 everything I will need a package 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.430
 I'm going to take a packet 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.320
 I'm going to sprinkle it on the water in 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.600
 form of rain 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.460
 I'm going to moisturize this grenetina those that 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.210
 They know how to make natural Latinas know 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.430
 what am I talking about? 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.430
 I'm going to sprinkle it 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.660
 without mediating or anything I will leave 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.300
 hydrate for a few minutes until 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.360
 be seen 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.390
 as if it were a one when it changes 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.570
 texture that I know 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.970
 all this mixture will curdle I'm going to 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.000
 put in a water bath if you do not 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:01.000
 they get this kind of grenetin can 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.670
 use the one they prefer I know that in 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 other countries like mexico use the 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.560
 duche brand if you are going to use this one that 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.020
 be a teaspoon nothing more 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.330
 then I'll be right back when I 'm 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.160
 hydrated to show you how it looks and 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.200
 put it in a bain marie 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.130
 look here I am showing you the 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.840
 already hydrated gelatin if you can see this 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:27.960
 is to hydrate that there are those 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.449
 lumps as if you were 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:36.610
 curdling then what I'll do 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.610
 would respond to bain- marie 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:46.780
 for a few minutes until 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.910
 completely 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.070
 good as you can see here already 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.320
 completely melted our grenetina 

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:56.020
 this is the point where we wanted it 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:00.960
 have and this is the glue that is 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.960
 used to paste the chocolate palettes
