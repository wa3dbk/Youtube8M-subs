00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.810

 and does not exclude that will win a choice 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.580
 cyc must either allow in the signature among 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.290
 migrants or reduce the number of signatures 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.000
 to register candidates like this 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.620

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.040
 Earlier, the head of the cyc said it was impossible 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.560
 collection of signatures of Tajik labor 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.990
 migrants russia other countries because 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.700
 that it is legal to certify signatures 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.200
 local authorities in tajikistan for 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.850
 register as a candidate for 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.590
 Presidents need to collect at least 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.810
 two hundred ten thousand signatures 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.090
 voters this is 5 percent 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.100
 of the total number of the electorate where also 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.990
 labor migrants are included 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.910
 outside of tajikistan in this regard 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.800
 head of the union of reform forces 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.820
 should solve the problem of collecting signatures 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.910
 among migrants 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.080
 constitutes 45 percent of voters 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.970
 either reduce the required number 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.250
 signatures from two hundred ten to one hundred 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.900
 fifty thousand according to experts 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.450
 5% signature collection barrier 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.130
 quite convenient to the power party leaning 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.210
 on on the building apparatus and very 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.950
 makes it difficult 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.950
 opponent take part choice
