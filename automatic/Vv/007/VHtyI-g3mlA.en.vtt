00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.370
 cooking mum 11 the recipe kess 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.980
 Today I try to kiss 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.940
 caramelize and have this recipe 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 I got myself from the internet 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 100 grams of chopped walnuts 50 grams 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.660
 sugar white one can also take brown 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 around 40 milliliters of water so loud recipe 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.619
 I have to first the water with the sugar 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.619
 sweat slowly 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.239
 the sugar then dissolved and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.379
 I cooked it up a bit now 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.549
 not necessary at all 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.549
 that is a bit thicker 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.150
 too little liquid and for so many 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:29.030
 In any case it 's always like that 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:32.200
 she looks out and now they come 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.200
 key to it 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:55.190
 thick and c 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:57.310
 So now the musician is instant 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.310
 path 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.840
 enough of the sugar, that's what I call it 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.510
 Leave it now so that will happen 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 factor much to cool off 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.200
 that would like for my constituency 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.250
