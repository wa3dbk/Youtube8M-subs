rosamma<00:00:22.180> pay<00:00:23.550> bills<00:00:24.550> to<00:00:25.300> me<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:26.230> good<00:00:26.590> time

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
rosamma pay bills to me a good time

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.060 
rosamma pay bills to me a good time
basically<00:00:27.279> that<00:00:28.029> meant<00:00:28.320> another<00:00:29.320> opportunity

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
basically that meant another opportunity

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.270 
basically that meant another opportunity
to<00:00:30.099> try<00:00:30.610> and<00:00:31.180> win<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.390> major<00:00:31.900> event<00:00:32.230> because<00:00:33.160> the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
to try and win a major event because the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.510 
to try and win a major event because the
thing<00:00:33.460> about<00:00:33.670> 81<00:00:34.210> was<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.800> five<00:00:36.040> years<00:00:36.250> price

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
thing about 81 was the five years price

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.759 
thing about 81 was the five years price
that<00:00:36.910> they<00:00:37.329> hadn't<00:00:37.600> really<00:00:37.809> been<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:38.019> big<00:00:38.260> swell

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
that they hadn't really been a big swell

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.220 
that they hadn't really been a big swell
so<00:00:39.400> pretty<00:00:39.790> much<00:00:39.879> everyone<00:00:40.239> was<00:00:40.510> caught<00:00:40.780> short

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
so pretty much everyone was caught short

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.299 
so pretty much everyone was caught short
on<00:00:41.730> during<00:00:42.730> second<00:00:43.210> rounds<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.949> sudden

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
on during second rounds all of a sudden

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.640 
on during second rounds all of a sudden
as<00:00:45.430> we<00:00:45.580> set<00:00:45.820> up<00:00:45.850> beach<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:46.780> come<00:00:47.260> over<00:00:47.470> there

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
as we set up beach and come over there

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.140 
as we set up beach and come over there
hill<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:48.220> saw<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.430> ocean<00:00:48.580> for<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.910> first

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
hill and saw the ocean for the first

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.920 
hill and saw the ocean for the first
time<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:50.110> could<00:00:50.260> see<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.559> swell<00:00:50.890> on

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
time and you could see the swell on

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.570 
time and you could see the swell on
matching<00:00:52.930> in<00:00:53.410> from<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.799> horizon

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
matching in from the horizon

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.759 
matching in from the horizon
you<00:00:54.699> know<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.940> corduroy<00:00:55.269> effects<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:56.620> could

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
you know the corduroy effects you could

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.160 
you know the corduroy effects you could
tell<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.100> was<00:00:57.220> pretty<00:00:57.489> big<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.449> know<00:00:59.140> I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
tell it was pretty big so you know I

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.200 
tell it was pretty big so you know I
think<00:00:59.379> we<00:00:59.680> all<00:00:59.799> felt<00:01:00.100> we've<00:01:00.309> probably<00:01:00.580> in

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
think we all felt we've probably in

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.570 
think we all felt we've probably in
loved<00:01:01.510> a<00:01:01.659> stripe<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.350> probably<00:01:03.250> didn't<00:01:03.489> have

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
loved a stripe and probably didn't have

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.020 
loved a stripe and probably didn't have
the<00:01:03.640> right<00:01:03.879> equipment<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.530> I<00:01:05.740> was<00:01:05.920> hoping<00:01:06.820> to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
the right equipment but I was hoping to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.090 
the right equipment but I was hoping to
successfully<00:01:07.869> introduced<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.619> thrust

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
successfully introduced the thrust

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.340 
successfully introduced the thrust
design<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.030> world<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.600> got<00:01:11.049> through<00:01:11.229> the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
design to the world and got through the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.160 
design to the world and got through the
first<00:01:11.380> round<00:01:11.680> and<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:13.270> second<00:01:13.750> round<00:01:13.900> they

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
first round and that second round they

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.010 
first round and that second round they
loomed<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:15.070> it<00:01:15.430> was<00:01:15.520> just<00:01:15.700> amazing<00:01:15.820> big<00:01:16.750> bells

it's pretty hairy trying to get out
there<00:01:26.979> and<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:28.509> my<00:01:28.689> heat<00:01:28.990> I<00:01:29.229> got<00:01:29.679> to<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.909> part

bird but I got full inside and the best

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.969 
bird but I got full inside and the best
thing<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.960> was<00:01:35.109> to<00:01:35.289> actually<00:01:35.710> let<00:01:35.859> your

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
thing to do was to actually let your

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.859 
thing to do was to actually let your
board<00:01:36.189> go<00:01:36.369> not<00:01:36.609> to<00:01:36.759> be<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.030> man<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.270> duck<00:01:37.630> dive

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
board go not to be the man and duck dive

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.830 
board go not to be the man and duck dive
but<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:38.530> get<00:01:39.340> off<00:01:39.429> your<00:01:39.549> board<00:01:39.759> take<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.539> few<00:01:40.659> on

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
but to get off your board take a few on

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.380 
but to get off your board take a few on
the<00:01:40.960> head<00:01:41.140> like<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.850> course<00:01:42.880> my<00:01:43.210> leg

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
the head like that and of course my leg

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.359 
the head like that and of course my leg
rub<00:01:43.539> broken<00:01:43.929> atmosphere<00:01:44.350> yeah<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.189> was

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
rub broken atmosphere yeah it was

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.010 
rub broken atmosphere yeah it was
definitely<00:01:45.909> very<00:01:46.060> sketchy<00:01:46.479> getting<00:01:46.869> out

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
definitely very sketchy getting out

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.200 
definitely very sketchy getting out
there<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:48.249> think<00:01:48.640> pretty<00:01:48.759> much<00:01:48.880> everyone

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
there but I think pretty much everyone

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.690 
there but I think pretty much everyone
got<00:01:49.509> out<00:01:49.539> there's<00:01:50.049> no<00:01:50.319> real<00:01:50.619> casualties<00:01:51.429> maybe

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
got out there's no real casualties maybe

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.279 
got out there's no real casualties maybe
Peter<00:01:51.999> drew<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.420> got<00:01:52.630> swept<00:01:53.020> down

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
Peter drew and got swept down

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.469 
Peter drew and got swept down
straightened<00:01:53.979> out<00:01:54.009> after<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> wave<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:54.999> ended

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
straightened out after a wave and ended

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.260 
straightened out after a wave and ended
up<00:01:55.600> down<00:01:55.840> there<00:01:56.079> but<00:01:56.380> yeah<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.490> was<00:01:57.640> pretty

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
up down there but yeah it was pretty

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.120 
up down there but yeah it was pretty
serious<00:01:58.450> surf<00:01:58.840> well<00:01:59.289> everyone<00:01:59.649> remembers<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
serious surf well everyone remembers the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.340 
serious surf well everyone remembers the
big<00:02:00.429> day<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.999> it's<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.659> think<00:02:01.719> it's<00:02:01.990> assumed

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
big day and it's I think it's assumed

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.910 
big day and it's I think it's assumed
that<00:02:02.590> that<00:02:03.280> was<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.549> final<00:02:03.939> stage<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
that that was the final stage that that

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.749 
that that was the final stage that that
was<00:02:06.039> early<00:02:06.549> on<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.909> contest<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:09.280> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
was early on in the contest and as the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.270 
was early on in the contest and as the
hottest<00:02:10.390> war<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:10.929> swell<00:02:11.470> under<00:02:11.890> had<00:02:12.069> stuck

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
hottest war on swell under had stuck

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.040 
hottest war on swell under had stuck
around<00:02:12.310> but<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.880> slowly<00:02:13.150> got<00:02:13.390> smaller<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
around but it slowly got smaller and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.630 
around but it slowly got smaller and
from<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.530> big<00:02:14.740> day<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.040> next<00:02:15.160> day<00:02:15.310> was<00:02:15.520> like

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
from that big day the next day was like

around<00:02:22.540> which<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.990> not<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.770> good<00:02:23.980> drawer<00:02:24.819> under

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
around which is not a good drawer under

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.820 
around which is not a good drawer under
those<00:02:25.330> circumstances<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:26.319> ring<00:02:26.500> conquer

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
those circumstances that ring conquer

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070 
those circumstances that ring conquer
sea<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.520> apart<00:02:28.209> from<00:02:28.360> Emma<00:02:28.660> he<00:02:28.930> was

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
sea is one of the apart from Emma he was

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
sea is one of the apart from Emma he was
probably<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.710> best<00:02:29.740> rink<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.340> sir<00:02:30.610> yeah<00:02:31.120> well

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
probably the best rink on sir yeah well

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.280 
probably the best rink on sir yeah well
it<00:02:31.600> feels<00:02:31.630> good<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.080> be<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> champion<00:02:32.740> for<00:02:32.860> me

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it feels good to be a champion for me

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.280 
it feels good to be a champion for me
not<00:02:33.799> only<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:34.189> I<00:02:34.430> introduced<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.659> new

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
not only because I introduced a new

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.020 
not only because I introduced a new
design<00:02:36.370> turned<00:02:37.370> out<00:02:37.519> to<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:37.790> pretty

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
design turned out to be pretty

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.289 
design turned out to be pretty
significant<00:02:38.629> but<00:02:39.379> because<00:02:40.189> the<00:02:40.370> cert<00:02:40.879> was<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
significant but because the cert was so

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.880 
significant but because the cert was so
good<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.659> that's<00:02:41.750> remembered<00:02:42.319> for<00:02:42.500> being<00:02:42.530> so

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
good and that's remembered for being so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.890 
good and that's remembered for being so
good<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.909> always<00:02:44.180> good<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.420> win<00:02:44.629> an<00:02:44.780> event

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
good so it's always good to win an event

00:02:44.900 --> 00:03:00.720 
good so it's always good to win an event
it's<00:02:45.349> got<00:02:45.530> better

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.790
