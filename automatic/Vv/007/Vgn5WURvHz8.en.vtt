we<00:00:00.450> have<00:00:00.630> a<00:00:00.659> lot<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.170> healing<00:00:01.350> questions<00:00:01.979> here

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
we have a lot of healing questions here

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.400 
we have a lot of healing questions here
and<00:00:02.310> I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.669> combine<00:00:03.020> question<00:00:04.020> seven

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
and I'm going to combine question seven

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.230 
and I'm going to combine question seven
and<00:00:04.529> eight<00:00:04.680> because<00:00:05.279> it's<00:00:05.640> basically<00:00:06.060> about

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
and eight because it's basically about

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.390 
and eight because it's basically about
the<00:00:06.569> same<00:00:06.779> thing<00:00:07.109> they<00:00:07.799> want<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:08.189> about

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
the same thing they want to know about

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.879 
the same thing they want to know about
our<00:00:08.580> quantum<00:00:09.269> type<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.690> healing<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.679> we

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
our quantum type of healing that we

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.940 
our quantum type of healing that we
teach<00:00:11.250> versus<00:00:11.969> Reiki<00:00:12.480> or<00:00:12.509> Qigong<00:00:13.230> long

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
teach versus Reiki or Qigong long

teach versus Reiki or Qigong long
distance<00:00:14.460> healing<00:00:15.320> one<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.470> these

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
distance healing one of these

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.260 
distance healing one of these
differences<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.880> cool

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
differences that we use a cool

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.210 
differences that we use a cool
temperature<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.140> good<00:00:19.320> filling<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.039> use

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
temperature and a good filling we use

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.580 
temperature and a good filling we use
our<00:00:20.369> try<00:00:20.609> concept<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.960> say<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
our try concept is what we say it is a

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.330 
our try concept is what we say it is a
form<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.699> feels<00:00:24.480> good<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.890> cool

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
form that feels good and is on the cool

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
form that feels good and is on the cool
side<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.210> an<00:00:27.420> awful<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.470> different

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
side and an awful lot of different

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.669 
side and an awful lot of different
places<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:30.510> don't<00:00:30.660> take<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.380> to

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
places out there they don't take in to

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.030 
places out there they don't take in to
count<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> temperature<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.770> hotter

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
count the temperature and so the hotter

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.639 
count the temperature and so the hotter
the<00:00:35.340> better<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.910> their<00:00:36.090> minds<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.500> know

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the better in their minds and I know

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.200 
the better in their minds and I know
there's<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.160> awful<00:00:38.250> lot<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:39.030> that

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
there's an awful lot of people that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
there's an awful lot of people that
think<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> certainly<00:00:40.260> thought<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
think that way I certainly thought that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.280 
think that way I certainly thought that
way<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> longest<00:00:41.520> time<00:00:41.670> until<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.510> did<00:00:43.170> all

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
way for the longest time until I did all

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
way for the longest time until I did all
the<00:00:43.410> research<00:00:43.590> involved<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:44.820> hot<00:00:45.570> energy

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the research involved of how hot energy

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.380 
the research involved of how hot energy
affects<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.920> human<00:00:47.250> body<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> doesn't

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
affects the human body and it doesn't

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.690 
affects the human body and it doesn't
affect<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.780> well<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:49.950> causes<00:00:50.550> all

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
affect it well it actually causes all

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
affect it well it actually causes all
sorts<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.059> problems<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.110> you're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
sorts of problems for you if you're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
sorts of problems for you if you're
constantly<00:00:52.500> heating<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.370> energy<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
constantly heating up your energy and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.450 
constantly heating up your energy and
that's<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.840> teach<00:00:55.079> people<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.770> school<00:00:56.100> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's what we teach people in school is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.060 
that's what we teach people in school is
not<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.539> heat<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> energy<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.770> cool

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
not to heat up your energy but to cool

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 
not to heat up your energy but to cool
it<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.570> put<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it down so that you can put more and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.780 
it down so that you can put more and
more<00:01:01.980> energy<00:01:02.520> into<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:05.040> won't<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.670> on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
more energy into play and it won't be on

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450 
more energy into play and it won't be on
the<00:01:05.970> hot<00:01:06.119> destructive<00:01:06.900> side<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.770> awful

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the hot destructive side and an awful

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
the hot destructive side and an awful
lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.030> people<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.780> said<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.290> far

meditations or where you do energy work

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
meditations or where you do energy work
like<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:22.140> don't<00:01:22.350> bring<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.680> about

like this they don't bring up about
things<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> things<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
things like that things like how it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
things like that things like how it
would<00:01:24.750> affect<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.229> pheromones<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.070> heat<00:01:26.369> if

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
would affect your pheromones to heat if

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.580 
would affect your pheromones to heat if
you<00:01:27.060> put<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.540> too<00:01:27.689> much<00:01:27.840> heat<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.380> body

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
you put out too much heat on your body

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
you put out too much heat on your body
how<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.130> virtually<00:01:29.850> affects<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
how it virtually affects it so that it

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
how it virtually affects it so that it
actually<00:01:31.710> calls<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.060> fights<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
actually calls you to get in fights and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.179 
actually calls you to get in fights and
arguments<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.140> people<00:01:34.590> simply<00:01:34.890> because

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
shuts down your your natural killer

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
shuts down your your natural killer
cells<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.960> your<00:01:40.290> ability<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> fight<00:01:41.369> off

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
of something like a virus natural killer

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
of something like a virus natural killer
cells<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> only<00:01:45.360> thing<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> our<00:01:46.020> body

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
cells are the only thing in our body

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.429 
cells are the only thing in our body
that<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.860> capable<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.570> actually<00:01:48.570> getting<00:01:49.229> rid

that is capable of actually getting rid

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.100 
that is capable of actually getting rid
of<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.740> virus<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> doctor<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> they

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of a virus you go to a doctor and they

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.780 
of a virus you go to a doctor and they
give<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.350> an<00:01:52.470> antibiotic<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
give you an antibiotic but that really

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.209 
give you an antibiotic but that really
is<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.210> bacteria<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.799> rid<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
is for bacteria it's not get rid of a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.459 
is for bacteria it's not get rid of a
virus<00:01:57.180> out<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> your<00:01:57.600> system<00:01:58.020> because<00:01:58.290> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
virus out of your system because it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.679 
virus out of your system because it
doesn't<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:58.920> capability<00:01:59.540> your<00:02:00.540> own

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
doesn't have that capability your own

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.080 
doesn't have that capability your own
body<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> capability<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.490> when<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.939> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
body has that capability and when you do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.510 
body has that capability and when you do
certain<00:02:03.530> energy<00:02:04.530> modalities<00:02:05.100> out<00:02:05.310> there

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
certain energy modalities out there

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.920 
certain energy modalities out there
you're<00:02:05.670> actually<00:02:05.820> shutting<00:02:06.240> down<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> part

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you're actually shutting down that part

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
you're actually shutting down that part
of<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.250> show<00:02:08.489> people<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of you which we show people in the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.730 
of you which we show people in the
school<00:02:09.420> why<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.039> happens

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
school why that now that happens

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.410 
school why that now that happens
and<00:02:11.920> that's<00:02:12.070> what<00:02:12.220> I<00:02:12.250> enjoy<00:02:12.640> about<00:02:12.670> using<00:02:13.270> my

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and that's what I enjoy about using my

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.780 
and that's what I enjoy about using my
energy<00:02:13.630> form<00:02:14.110> for<00:02:14.320> healing<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:15.040> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
energy form for healing because you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.940 
energy form for healing because you
taught<00:02:16.090> us<00:02:16.360> how<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.720> specifically<00:02:17.530> put<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.830> in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
taught us how to specifically put it in

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.370 
taught us how to specifically put it in
certain<00:02:18.280> areas<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:19.450> help<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.810> release<00:02:20.110> of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
certain areas to help the release of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800 
certain areas to help the release of
natural<00:02:20.500> killer<00:02:20.920> cells<00:02:21.340> it's<00:02:22.030> very<00:02:22.330> precise

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
natural killer cells it's very precise

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.870 
natural killer cells it's very precise
in<00:02:23.080> how<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:23.530> use<00:02:23.770> our<00:02:23.920> energy<00:02:24.070> form<00:02:24.550> but<00:02:24.730> yet

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
in how we use our energy form but yet

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.870 
in how we use our energy form but yet
it's<00:02:25.030> guided<00:02:25.480> very<00:02:25.660> easily<00:02:26.280> yeah<00:02:27.280> there<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.610> so

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
it's guided very easily yeah there is so

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.630 
it's guided very easily yeah there is so
much<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:28.800> medical<00:02:29.800> research<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.610> done

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
much more medical research that was done

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.880 
much more medical research that was done
on<00:02:30.940> how<00:02:31.330> energy<00:02:31.840> affects<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.320> body<00:02:32.560> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
on how energy affects the body that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.500 
on how energy affects the body that
really<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.310> available<00:02:33.910> out<00:02:34.030> there<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.360> people

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
really is available out there to people

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.460 
really is available out there to people
and<00:02:34.870> for<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.800> most<00:02:36.010> part<00:02:36.340> these<00:02:36.610> other<00:02:37.060> energy

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
and for the most part these other energy

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.590 
and for the most part these other energy
modalities<00:02:38.470> haven't<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.640> know<00:02:39.790> adapted<00:02:40.420> to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
modalities haven't you know adapted to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.320 
modalities haven't you know adapted to
them<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.170> put<00:02:41.380> them<00:02:41.560> into<00:02:41.880> their<00:02:42.880> routines

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
them or put them into their routines

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.270 
them or put them into their routines
where<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.470> know<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.710> put<00:02:44.980> them<00:02:45.160> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
where is you know we put them and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.040 
where is you know we put them and
adapted<00:02:45.760> them<00:02:45.790> right<00:02:46.120> into<00:02:46.390> our<00:02:46.570> school

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
adapted them right into our school

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.740 
adapted them right into our school
routine<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:47.830> we<00:02:48.160> can<00:02:48.370> benefit<00:02:48.790> from<00:02:49.030> all

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
routine so that we can benefit from all

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.810 
routine so that we can benefit from all
this<00:02:49.900> extra<00:02:50.290> knowledge<00:02:50.440> well<00:02:51.400> we<00:02:51.640> have

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
this extra knowledge well we have

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.400 
this extra knowledge well we have
somebody<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.240> comes<00:02:52.600> right<00:02:52.840> out<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.200> asked

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
somebody that comes right out and asked

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.950 
somebody that comes right out and asked
how<00:02:53.830> long<00:02:54.190> does<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.520> take<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.060> build<00:02:55.210> an<00:02:55.450> energy

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
how long does it take to build an energy

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.590 
how long does it take to build an energy
form<00:02:56.790> well<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.940> is<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.300> million-dollar

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
form well that is the million-dollar

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.250 
form well that is the million-dollar
question

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
question

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.490 
question
because<00:02:59.590> it's<00:03:00.490> different<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.180> everybody<00:03:01.570> if

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
because it's different for everybody if

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.590 
because it's different for everybody if
you<00:03:02.860> visualize<00:03:03.100> well<00:03:03.640> well<00:03:04.090> you'll<00:03:04.330> be<00:03:04.480> able

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
you visualize well well you'll be able

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.690 
you visualize well well you'll be able
to<00:03:04.750> build<00:03:04.990> an<00:03:05.170> energy<00:03:05.560> form<00:03:05.860> really<00:03:06.220> quick<00:03:06.460> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to build an energy form really quick and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.390 
to build an energy form really quick and
if<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:07.660> visualize<00:03:07.930> well<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.980> takes<00:03:09.250> a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
if you don't visualize well it takes a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.270 
if you don't visualize well it takes a
little<00:03:09.550> bit<00:03:09.670> longer<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.330> most<00:03:11.020> people<00:03:11.470> within

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
little bit longer but most people within

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.120 
little bit longer but most people within
the<00:03:12.520> first<00:03:12.730> thirty<00:03:13.000> days<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.660> training<00:03:14.130> start

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the first thirty days of training start

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.330 
the first thirty days of training start
getting<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:16.060> pretty<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:16.840> knowledge<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.890> what

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
getting a pretty good knowledge of what

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.720 
getting a pretty good knowledge of what
she<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.240> about<00:03:19.660> what<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.290> feels<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.710> and<00:03:21.190> how

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
she is about what it feels like and how

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.820 
she is about what it feels like and how
it<00:03:21.910> can<00:03:22.060> help<00:03:22.240> them<00:03:22.390> and<00:03:22.900> our<00:03:23.320> last<00:03:23.560> question

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
it can help them and our last question

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.090 
it can help them and our last question
is<00:03:24.280> how<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.480> energy<00:03:26.080> form<00:03:26.350> be<00:03:26.560> used<00:03:26.800> for

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
is how can this energy form be used for

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.880 
is how can this energy form be used for
other<00:03:27.280> purposes<00:03:27.460> besides<00:03:28.210> healing<00:03:28.900> such<00:03:29.650> as

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
other purposes besides healing such as

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.580 
other purposes besides healing such as
changing<00:03:30.760> my<00:03:30.880> mental<00:03:31.240> state<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> mine<00:03:31.810> or<00:03:32.170> or

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
changing my mental state of mine or or

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.360 
changing my mental state of mine or or
in<00:03:32.710> my<00:03:32.860> business<00:03:34.290> well<00:03:35.290> that's<00:03:35.650> what<00:03:35.860> we<00:03:35.980> do<00:03:36.160> is

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
in my business well that's what we do is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.420 
in my business well that's what we do is
we<00:03:36.580> show<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.880> how<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.750> use<00:03:38.020> this<00:03:38.230> form<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.770> not

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
we show you how to use this form to not

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.880 
we show you how to use this form to not
only<00:03:39.670> change<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.300> temperature<00:03:41.110> in<00:03:41.500> your<00:03:41.530> body

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
only change the temperature in your body

only change the temperature in your body
so<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.300> more<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.810> way<00:03:44.050> or<00:03:44.380> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
so that it's more in the way or the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.770 
so that it's more in the way or the
range<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.160> want<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.550> be<00:03:45.730> we<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.510> teach<00:03:46.750> you

range you want it to be we can teach you

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.420 
range you want it to be we can teach you
how<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.110> raise<00:03:47.740> or<00:03:47.920> lower<00:03:47.950> your<00:03:48.220> blood

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
how to raise or lower your blood

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.480 
how to raise or lower your blood
pressure<00:03:48.900> your<00:03:49.900> heart<00:03:49.930> rate<00:03:50.470> or<00:03:50.830> those<00:03:51.100> of

the<00:03:54.730> temperature<00:03:55.180> in<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.630> air<00:03:55.810> around<00:03:56.410> you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
the temperature in the air around you

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.860 
the temperature in the air around you
outside<00:03:57.220> your<00:03:57.430> body<00:03:57.580> as<00:03:57.880> well<00:03:58.060> as<00:03:58.240> inside<00:03:58.630> your

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
body and so also in changing the state

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.620 
body and so also in changing the state
of<00:04:02.110> mind<00:04:02.350> we<00:04:02.710> show<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:02.980> how<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.310> tap<00:04:03.850> in<00:04:04.120> into

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
of mind we show you how you tap in into

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.710 
of mind we show you how you tap in into
your<00:04:04.870> own<00:04:05.380> second<00:04:06.010> brain<00:04:06.190> area<00:04:06.610> where<00:04:07.210> most

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
your own second brain area where most

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.060 
your own second brain area where most
people<00:04:07.810> don't<00:04:08.200> understand<00:04:08.710> what<00:04:08.890> that's

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
people don't understand what that's

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.250 
people don't understand what that's
about<00:04:09.400> or<00:04:09.580> anything<00:04:09.790> but<00:04:10.240> you<00:04:10.870> know<00:04:10.930> with<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
about or anything but you know with the

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260 
about or anything but you know with the
latest<00:04:11.590> research<00:04:11.800> out<00:04:12.520> there<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.820> mean<00:04:13.210> we

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
latest research out there I mean we

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.450 
latest research out there I mean we
found<00:04:13.660> out<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.410> put<00:04:14.770> a<00:04:14.800> particular<00:04:15.220> form

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
found out that you put a particular form

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.890 
found out that you put a particular form
through<00:04:15.730> particular<00:04:16.150> areas<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.600> your<00:04:16.720> body

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
through particular areas in your body

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.060 
through particular areas in your body
and<00:04:17.230> suddenly<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.520> can<00:04:18.700> change<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.270> hormonal

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and suddenly you can change the hormonal

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.070 
and suddenly you can change the hormonal
way<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.549> affects<00:04:21.669> your<00:04:22.060> body<00:04:22.300> and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
way that it affects your body and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
way that it affects your body and
worth<00:04:23.199> learning<00:04:23.830> because<00:04:24.220> who<00:04:24.639> doesn't<00:04:25.000> want

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
worth learning because who doesn't want

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.869 
worth learning because who doesn't want
to<00:04:25.210> feel<00:04:25.330> good<00:04:25.659> on<00:04:25.930> demand<00:04:26.500> that's<00:04:27.280> usually

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
to feel good on demand that's usually

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.820 
to feel good on demand that's usually
after<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.300> few<00:04:28.599> years<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.930> training<00:04:29.259> you<00:04:29.560> really

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
after a few years of training you really

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.710 
after a few years of training you really
can<00:04:30.099> decide<00:04:30.759> you<00:04:31.060> know<00:04:31.210> how<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.449> feel<00:04:31.690> good

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
can decide you know how to feel good

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.719 
can decide you know how to feel good
when<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.229> want<00:04:32.409> to<00:04:32.440> feel<00:04:32.680> good<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:32.889> that's

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
when you want to feel good and that's

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.059 
when you want to feel good and that's
something<00:04:34.300> that's<00:04:34.509> really<00:04:34.569> a<00:04:34.840> unique<00:04:35.349> that<00:04:35.710> we

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
something that's really a unique that we

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.460 
something that's really a unique that we
teach<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.639> be<00:04:37.180> able<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.449> do<00:04:37.539> on<00:04:37.659> yourself<00:04:38.080> but

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
teach to be able to do on yourself but

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.080 
teach to be able to do on yourself but

people an incredible way to feel great
every<00:04:43.449> day<00:04:43.479> because<00:04:44.050> when<00:04:44.289> I<00:04:44.319> do<00:04:44.440> my<00:04:44.710> training

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
every day because when I do my training

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.760 
every day because when I do my training
I<00:04:45.340> actually<00:04:45.879> put<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.629> attribute<00:04:47.319> into<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
I actually put that attribute into the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.950 
I actually put that attribute into the
electrical<00:04:48.280> form<00:04:48.580> and<00:04:48.849> when<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:49.449> go<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.720> use<00:04:49.930> it

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
electrical form and when I go to use it

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.529 
electrical form and when I go to use it
on<00:04:50.199> myself<00:04:50.440> or<00:04:51.009> in<00:04:51.099> a<00:04:51.190> quantum<00:04:51.580> healing<00:04:51.759> it<00:04:52.120> has

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
on myself or in a quantum healing it has

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.980 
on myself or in a quantum healing it has
the<00:04:52.750> exact<00:04:53.080> same<00:04:53.349> effect<00:04:54.030> it<00:04:55.030> really<00:04:55.090> does<00:04:55.449> and

and<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.069> we<00:05:27.759> find<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.210> using<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.139> that

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
and and we find that using it in that

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.320 
and and we find that using it in that
particular<00:05:29.620> way<00:05:30.039> so<00:05:30.069> that<00:05:30.639> you<00:05:30.759> can<00:05:30.789> get<00:05:31.060> along

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
particular way so that you can get along

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330 
particular way so that you can get along
with<00:05:31.599> everybody<00:05:31.900> even<00:05:32.469> people<00:05:32.889> that<00:05:32.919> you

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
with everybody even people that you

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.920 
with everybody even people that you
don't<00:05:33.550> normally<00:05:33.759> get<00:05:34.060> along<00:05:34.389> with<00:05:34.630> you<00:05:34.810> can

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
don't normally get along with you can

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.260 
don't normally get along with you can
get<00:05:35.080> along<00:05:35.259> with<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:36.550> really<00:05:36.669> works<00:05:37.000> well<00:05:37.240> for

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
get along with it really works well for

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.959 
get along with it really works well for
the<00:05:37.569> student<00:05:37.960> it<00:05:38.860> absolutely<00:05:39.370> does<00:05:39.699> there<00:05:39.940> is

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
the student it absolutely does there is

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.510 
the student it absolutely does there is
a<00:05:40.090> high<00:05:40.360> level<00:05:40.630> of<00:05:40.840> cooperation<00:05:41.190> which<00:05:42.190> is<00:05:42.340> not

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
a high level of cooperation which is not

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.399 
a high level of cooperation which is not
only<00:05:42.729> needed<00:05:43.090> on<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.240> daily<00:05:43.659> basis<00:05:44.139> with<00:05:44.380> people

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.680 
you interact with but on a healing basis
the<00:05:47.710> whole<00:05:47.889> reason<00:05:48.370> why<00:05:48.580> colleges<00:05:49.389> will

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
the whole reason why colleges will

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.510 
the whole reason why colleges will
achieve<00:05:49.840> energy<00:05:50.169> because<00:05:50.770> we<00:05:50.949> are<00:05:51.099> going<00:05:51.370> to

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
achieve energy because we are going to

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.040 
achieve energy because we are going to
give<00:05:51.699> them<00:05:51.879> healing<00:05:52.150> ways<00:05:52.449> to<00:05:52.750> use<00:05:52.900> this

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
give them healing ways to use this

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.260 
give them healing ways to use this
energy<00:05:53.289> we're<00:05:54.219> going<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:54.729> give<00:05:54.940> them<00:05:55.120> all

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
energy we're going to give them all

energy we're going to give them all
sorts<00:05:55.569> of<00:05:55.779> different<00:05:56.169> ways<00:05:56.319> that<00:05:56.379> will

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
sorts of different ways that will

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.879 
sorts of different ways that will
benefit<00:05:57.279> their<00:05:57.460> life<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:58.810> use<00:05:59.020> this<00:05:59.229> energy<00:05:59.770> in

benefit their life to use this energy in
a<00:05:59.979> particular<00:06:00.250> form<00:06:00.669> like<00:06:00.940> we<00:06:00.969> are<00:06:01.389> when<00:06:02.080> you

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
a particular form like we are when you

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.619 
a particular form like we are when you
can<00:06:02.440> actually<00:06:02.919> make<00:06:03.669> a<00:06:03.699> phone<00:06:04.060> come<00:06:04.300> out<00:06:04.449> of

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
particular areas of the body you can

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.890 
particular areas of the body you can
actually<00:06:11.379> change<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:12.190> way<00:06:12.340> you<00:06:12.400> feel<00:06:12.659> on<00:06:13.659> the

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
hormonal basis and you really can do

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.420 
hormonal basis and you really can do
that<00:06:16.719> not<00:06:16.960> only<00:06:17.080> yourself<00:06:17.710> but<00:06:17.830> on<00:06:18.129> other

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
that not only yourself but on other

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.969 
that not only yourself but on other
people<00:06:18.969> and<00:06:19.300> learning<00:06:20.259> those<00:06:20.529> particular

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
people and learning those particular

people and learning those particular
type<00:06:21.370> of<00:06:21.400> techniques<00:06:22.029> are<00:06:22.270> what<00:06:22.840> helps

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
type of techniques are what helps

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.899 
type of techniques are what helps
separate<00:06:23.680> us<00:06:23.919> from<00:06:23.949> other<00:06:24.250> type<00:06:24.580> of<00:06:24.759> energy

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:24.909 
separate us from other type of energy

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.140 
separate us from other type of energy
modalities<00:06:25.840> also<00:06:26.259> it's<00:06:27.099> very<00:06:27.370> true<00:06:27.639> that<00:06:27.669> is

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
modalities also it's very true that is

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.050 
modalities also it's very true that is
the<00:06:28.330> professional<00:06:28.930> level<00:06:29.110> I<00:06:29.639> think<00:06:30.639> so<00:06:30.819> in

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
the professional level I think so in

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.120 
the professional level I think so in
most<00:06:31.330> people<00:06:31.750> probably<00:06:32.139> unless<00:06:32.740> they<00:06:32.949> saw

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
most people probably unless they saw

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.570 
most people probably unless they saw
that<00:06:33.339> actually<00:06:33.639> in

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
that actually in

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.970 
that actually in
believe<00:06:35.570> that<00:06:35.810> that<00:06:35.990> wouldn't<00:06:36.350> be<00:06:36.440> something

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
believe that that wouldn't be something

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.950 
believe that that wouldn't be something
that<00:06:37.280> you<00:06:37.400> can<00:06:37.550> actually<00:06:37.790> do<00:06:38.180> and<00:06:38.480> I<00:06:38.630> would

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
that you can actually do and I would

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.410 
that you can actually do and I would
gently<00:06:39.470> take<00:06:40.160> us<00:06:40.310> up<00:06:40.490> on<00:06:40.610> it<00:06:40.850> check<00:06:41.120> out<00:06:41.270> our

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
gently take us up on it check out our

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.140 
gently take us up on it check out our
school<00:06:41.720> take<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.860> look<00:06:43.160> at<00:06:43.400> what<00:06:43.700> we<00:06:43.850> really

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
school take a look at what we really

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.450 
school take a look at what we really
have<00:06:44.330> to<00:06:44.510> offer<00:06:44.690> check<00:06:45.440> out<00:06:45.620> how<00:06:45.860> long<00:06:46.130> or

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
have to offer check out how long or

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.580 
have to offer check out how long or
curriculum<00:06:46.940> that<00:06:47.240> we<00:06:47.360> have<00:06:47.600> and<00:06:47.990> they<00:06:48.260> all<00:06:48.380> see

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
curriculum that we have and they all see

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.440 
curriculum that we have and they all see
that<00:06:48.800> we<00:06:48.980> can<00:06:49.310> teach<00:06:49.490> them<00:06:49.700> all<00:06:49.850> sorts<00:06:50.150> of<00:06:50.240> cool

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
that we can teach them all sorts of cool

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.260 
that we can teach them all sorts of cool
techniques<00:06:50.960> using<00:06:51.380> these<00:06:51.680> type<00:06:51.920> of<00:06:51.950> ways<00:06:52.940> that

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
techniques using these type of ways that

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.360 
techniques using these type of ways that
we<00:06:53.390> build<00:06:53.630> up<00:06:53.750> the<00:06:53.930> body<00:06:54.140> it<00:06:54.680> really<00:06:54.980> builds<00:06:55.280> it

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
we build up the body it really builds it

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.070 
we build up the body it really builds it
up<00:06:55.520> in<00:06:55.700> such<00:06:55.910> a<00:06:55.940> better<00:06:56.240> way<00:06:56.480> than<00:06:56.720> what<00:06:56.930> you'll

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
up in such a better way than what you'll

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.960 
up in such a better way than what you'll
find<00:06:57.290> out<00:06:57.590> there<00:06:57.920> in<00:06:58.070> other<00:06:58.220> systems<00:06:58.730> so

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
find out there in other systems so

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.670 
find out there in other systems so
that's<00:06:59.300> all<00:06:59.480> I<00:06:59.510> basically<00:07:00.110> wanted<00:07:00.410> to<00:07:00.530> go<00:07:00.650> over

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
that's all I basically wanted to go over

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.450 
that's all I basically wanted to go over
today<00:07:01.160> and<00:07:01.240> thanks<00:07:02.240> everybody
