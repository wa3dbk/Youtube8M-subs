00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello girls I'm delighted with you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.540
 find on the channel today 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.360
 because in the hands of the pools of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.660
 make a video to tell you about 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.580
 fixator of checchi co this is one of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.679
 my subscribers who asked me what did 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.710
 tried to talk to us about fixer from 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.230
 at kiko because I already talked about 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.779
 this fixer in my video hall that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.579
 I had done it I did not want 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 do it right now because I had 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.110
 not to step back from the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 fixer in Nikko if you not see 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.440
 what is the shakeel skin fixer ? 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 and it is the latter then I fixer 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 know that mac 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.800
 he also proposes a fixer but I 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.410
 have not bought yet so I do not have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.850
 tested I do not have an opinion by 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 compared to that of chili mac 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.800
 Besides I must have dropped to 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.650
 test to see the different 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.560
 fixer if you do not see what's a 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.799
 fixer in fact a fixer is used to 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.109
 fix makeup all day 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.270
 once you're done putting on makeup 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.300
 dudes his lipstick to do all 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.980
 two 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.860
 to do everything we had on the 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.130
 face we take the fixer and a 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.210
 asparagus in the face and wait until 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.150
 that's home 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.070
 and then it actually allows everything 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.240
 simply to hold the makeup 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.780
 all day 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.390
 so me in my opinion compared to 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.720
 checchi skin fixer I am a little 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.180
 on because I have the feeling of 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.410
 to attack my skin when I use this 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.420
 fixator why because actually older 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.370
 the sensible pause maybe that for 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.980
 other people who have enough skin 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.780
 it's okay but I have enough skin 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:56.350
 sensitive and fragile and it is actually 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.170
 I also feel like I'm hoping 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.090
 I have a bomb a mosquito 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.550
 you can say that like that I do not know if 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.070
 you see mosquito haunches like 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.720
 now country where we sprinkle in the house 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.360
 to avoid that they boost ics come 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.390
 so prick me I'm trying pennies to 2 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.840
 used that on my face and neck 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.840
 I do not like the product at all and I 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.580
 find it a shame because good it costs 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.050
 cheap it's a product that's it's 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.700
 true it is accessible to everyone 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.099
 but 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.930
 for me it's a product that I will not 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.330
 not use it I can not buy 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.900
 because I do not like her 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 efficiency on me it does not do so 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.410
 that's my opinion what I tell you by 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.410
 compared to those fixer checchi co 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.959
 now if you have skin shoes 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.750
 of you can be tested but if you 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.790
 have fragile skin is not worth it 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.980
 to buy it because really it's worth 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.349
 not the shot to buy it by cons 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.000
 can use it for something else I 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.250
 think we can always be received for 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.920
 not lose money if you already have it 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.600
 but for me it's not a product 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.840
 that I will 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.240
 buy so here are the girls what I 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.660
 could say with respect to the fixer from 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.460
 at kiko if you liked this video 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.660
