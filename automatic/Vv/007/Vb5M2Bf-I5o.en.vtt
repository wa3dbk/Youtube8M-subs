00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:53.539
 when the images captured by our cameras began to be processed to 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.530
 the computer 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.310
 where they are executed by digital format, which guarantees greater 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.400
 accuracy in disclosure of information the best visual finish 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.600
 in the news 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
 ansa 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.030
 how the digital transmissions of inter tv cabugi innovate once again 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.950
 he opened a new chapter in the history of television to adapt to the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.430
 digital system started very early there behind the scenes 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.570
 it was almost three years to get everything ready for the official launch of the tv 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.579
 digital photography on the northern grand river 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.680
 more than 30 professional technical engineers will participate in the 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.819
 installation of the structure which will allow the new quality standard in the 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.290
 front 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.060
 I think we 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 we've been doing this month and a half 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.159
 in scanning the signal here in Mexico I believe it's going to be a change 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.100
 very large 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.619
 accompanying even the development of every state of the whole 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.260
 Northeast then the digital TV here I think 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.930
 iptv comes to crown this problem only your whole pocket a whole here in the state 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.689
 to 200 thousand 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.960
 of the digital signal, the installed equipment is much smaller than the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.580
 old looks only at the following internal size difference that transmits the signal 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:19.200
 and the analog signal in addition to that the building was installed in the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.400
 53 meters from the intervet that is in the Tyrolean quarter. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.519
