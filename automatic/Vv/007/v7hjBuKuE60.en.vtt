00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:15.129
 good evening everyone and lots of full rate in London 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.369
 we offered our third plan we are still campaigning 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.750
 of mathieu he will in any case remain his complaint the casino-theater barrier 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.599
 so after this hour, you know, we're going to go to the boss 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.169
 confectioner 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.089
 this is the last plan will have between companies 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.579
 you have prepared a salad 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.559
 spector will be able to make a Caesar salad which is a great classic easy to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.700
 make 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.890
 so we need for that a romaine lettuce 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.730
 com 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.260
 does the seams advance? 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.240
 Parmesan shavings 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.240
 scrub a little bit at the big choice more freedom in our project 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900
 m 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.270
 he should see some 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 prepare it at the same time 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.100
 I go out that in a rising sitcom is simpler 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.210
 so in the heart of the city and by email 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.080
 I am proud to mow in the approach is very easy in my 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.040
 children 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.350
 The end of the tunnel 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.280
 I'm breaking 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.120
 above the water I wait for three-four minutes 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.250
 and white blue coagulates it makes me a very good chef very well at all 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.270
 time 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.210
 we will put all that in this info 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 so it's up to them that I dispose goes to the trap 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.790
 I am cut back 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.450
 in big enough pieces 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.480
 more important this crunchy salad 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 it's the drought 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.720
 fitch then stupidly I'm going to have 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.970
 but parmesan shavings 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.390
 frankly parmesan 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.250
 you advise you to put on the side of the big pieces like that one must 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.150
 stop those who otherwise they are very very very hungry 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.260
 that this for him aesthetics 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.150
 so then manage I have small croutons that I did beforehand 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.160
 so we said fighters who are down 500 armchairs but I get 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 porge size does a little everything i rub with him 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.110
 that's nothing 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.110
 for patrick o'hare 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.650
 excellent numbers q just like those in cup will have as in triangle 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.309
 she then 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.279
 the approached that I'm going to serve lukewarm 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:18.369
 but I will follow him 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 the Caesar hunt that the technical part of this 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.929
 so exactly how do we do percent for simple we did it 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.699
 we can start as a mayonnaise 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.309
 to kiss each other 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:34.249
 groupon started as a reason to make a mayonnaise and next to 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.029
 this mayonnaise buy 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.509
 prepare it 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.349
 cream and anchovies pardon 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.719
 algeria h church in be in a big evening at the end 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.869
 I add cream that will continue in choice 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.419
 to the hood and incorporated in marvel vs 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.999
 and then I will make them a war 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.299
 it will be the simplest 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.769
 for proof this lucky 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.689
 Then I have only 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.689
 to have a concern 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.109
 alas is stable 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.289
 so the doctor here is our salad Caesar it was for the side 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.759
 investment approaches 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.239
 tomorrow we will attack the buttocks 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.339
 the pastry chef 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.319
 so what unveiled you exclusively for what will prepare me 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.269
 I think it's going to revolve around the cinnamon apple pie after 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.569
 vanessa surprised 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.939

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.829
