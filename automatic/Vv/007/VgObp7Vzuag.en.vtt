the others they've gone up a little bit

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.570 
the others they've gone up a little bit

so I think it's good I think it's

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.060 
so I think it's good I think it's
reasonable<00:01:47.790> i<00:01:48.150> think<00:01:48.360> i<00:01:48.450> saw<00:01:48.570> an<00:01:48.690> ivor<00:01:49.070> for

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
reasonable i think i saw an ivor for

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.790 
reasonable i think i saw an ivor for
like<00:01:50.190> 150<00:01:50.700> pound<00:01:51.090> for<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.330> season<00:01:51.660> ticket<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
like 150 pound for a season ticket and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.620 
like 150 pound for a season ticket and
that's<00:01:52.980> better<00:01:53.250> that's<00:01:53.640> unbelievable<00:01:53.820> price

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that's better that's unbelievable price

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
that's better that's unbelievable price
I<00:01:55.010> know<00:01:56.010> probably<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> price<00:01:56.910> varies

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
I know probably the price varies
