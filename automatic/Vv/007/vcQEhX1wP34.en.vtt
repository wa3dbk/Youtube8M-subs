00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.290
 Hi people and the year around 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.340
 To use intersections 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.429
 Meier, it has come a lot in between 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 only one has to ask for nice questions 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 all 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.589
 All Lakic is currently carrying money Haren's emphasis is on having 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.039
 are more or less fortune 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.699
 Consecration I can not start opinion Kroos 11 you never can 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.529
 the timeless level stood 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.749
 I knew 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.760
 On the Main Helene Pigl Rodleben Schamoni can not watch anyone Shogun himself 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.949
 the Army OSE has done his aunt's work 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.590
 so and must 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.980
 Unfortunately, it does not work here 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.990
 he does that who heals above all else 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.930
 the marshy wool solid German already some way so rank 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.810
 Well, I have your ideas 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.830
 to look forward to it 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.560
 I will now 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.810
 around Rome 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.620
 I would do it this way 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.860
 the similarly promptly lost 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.360
 a different campaign games until the civil war tries the circumstances like that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.710
 come close to my the bear's how it's done but what about Millions of 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 almost impossible 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 and should become numbers 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.190
 I'll start from where I upper Romer as an appendage of my 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.130
 in the network world s 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.200
 reinsetzen 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.250
 it is not possible then the last play next episode not that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.250
 Sequels but about she wants at least 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.760
 could be 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.750
 and where computers played 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.620
 percent 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.690
 in the year 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.890
 that would of course do that 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830
 and it lacks 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.060
 so 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.790
 I'm just doing new ZBS 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.840
 Days practically 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 like Phoenix from the ashes 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.889
 I would like to surprise me because of that 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.139
 Nicolas Berggruen 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.249
 we say 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 Mr I had it from many 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.829
 yes UG smaller 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.590
 I have to look how high the number will be but if he thinks it's over 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:31.029
 should make two or a maximum of 4 anyway 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.119
 Make three percent 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.549
 around 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.549
 well work is then identical faster 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.549
 said simply 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.909
 then the further question for you is that also a poll 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.469
 I would 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 either male to the four last as or three net PlÃ¤nitz as 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.009
 Possibilities u2 puns or Fr 5 percent 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.469
 this means 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.889
 you have to say more in the hot topic would have the best say 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:10.039
 possibly Wenning more votes hold some shortcomings of the West 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.989
 Business world or just wanted to see Tokyo 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.930
 and tell me the number best if you think I should do less 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.389
 Process at 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.649
 leave at two three 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:25.929
 As I said I am in the middle of Pekan class graduation class 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.769
 you have to expect that the team is Bayer and know less 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.639
 hans-werner farmer 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.969
 it will be more varied 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:36.770
 becomes 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.540
 kita-leiterin net better so Jung is just fat way you know opinions 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.699
 Chlorine aging depth 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:46.109
 finally, so to speak, will make a smaller display project 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.279
 to the number Unterweser is stepping out to bridge the time 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 exactly 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.669
 including Mystique 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.689
 There is also a way to go worldwide, and yes, too 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.639
 for propagation 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.060
 Drost did not want to surprise the new one 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.120
 necessarily want to know or wanted to vote 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.430
 said me too 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.689
 so we are by the option so he would have to say 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:26.610
 Manske how many dead it is a maximum of 4 Tesla less it is the faster 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.629
 not all were in use but that is the people that event 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.080
 to be more varied 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.370
 a Tolo Wollitz only witness only from the tumor game take 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.409
 or maybe 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.279
 a dfs- we are staying and that it carries two other three great role and 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.330
 Menges around Miss North, then 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 we ourselves have 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.400
 want to determine in a democratic way 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 with voters it also tells me 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.659
 the Wars now the first 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:02.719
 and 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.979
 we'll see each other 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.120
 when would the next new ones have to
