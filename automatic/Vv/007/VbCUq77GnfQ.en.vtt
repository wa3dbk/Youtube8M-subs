let's<00:01:57.509> jump<00:01:57.659> into<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.960> actual<00:01:58.200> phone<00:01:58.469> itself

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
let's jump into the actual phone itself

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.649 
let's jump into the actual phone itself
so<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.549> cover<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> quick<00:02:00.479> look

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so I'm just going to cover a quick look

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
so I'm just going to cover a quick look
at<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> dialer<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.320> tower<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.009> performs<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.520> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
at the dialer in tower it performs as a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
at the dialer in tower it performs as a
phone<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.149> lot<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.840> people<00:02:04.079> seem<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> neglect

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
phone a lot of people seem to neglect

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
phone a lot of people seem to neglect
the<00:02:04.799> fact<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.460> know<00:02:05.549> these<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:05.939> still

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the fact that you know these are still

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
the fact that you know these are still
phones<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.350> other<00:02:07.469> primary<00:02:08.129> uses<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
phones and the other primary uses to

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
phones and the other primary uses to
make<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.849> telephone<00:02:09.179> call<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.470> don't

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
make a telephone call and all we don't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.619 
make a telephone call and all we don't
use<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.400> dead<00:02:11.580> but<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.450> date

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
use it as much was dead but and the date

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.400 
use it as much was dead but and the date
still<00:02:12.900> more<00:02:13.200> about

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
still more about

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.130 
still more about
form<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:15.330> terms<00:02:15.600> that's<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:15.960> call

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
form so in terms that's what call

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.810 
form so in terms that's what call
quality<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.710> very<00:02:16.860> impressed<00:02:17.040> by<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.520> you

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
quality I was very impressed by it you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.400 
quality I was very impressed by it you
know<00:02:17.850> he<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.390> know<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.630> very<00:02:18.990> very<00:02:19.200> strong

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
know he you know a very very strong

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.410 
know he you know a very very strong
signal<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.040> should<00:02:20.490> probably<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.090> he's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
signal I should probably see that he's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.480 
signal I should probably see that he's
got<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> full<00:02:21.810> four<00:02:22.080> bars<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.070> terms<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.370> that

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
got a full four bars so in terms of that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.610 
got a full four bars so in terms of that
it's<00:02:23.610> been<00:02:23.700> very<00:02:23.730> very<00:02:24.120> strong<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.530> other

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's been very very strong and the other

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
it's been very very strong and the other
thing<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:25.890> letting<00:02:26.130> down<00:02:26.220> slightly<00:02:26.640> was<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
thing it's letting down slightly was the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570 
thing it's letting down slightly was the
actual<00:02:27.780> speaker<00:02:28.260> performance<00:02:28.740> in<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.100> I'll

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
actual speaker performance in here I'll

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.710 
actual speaker performance in here I'll
then<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> little<00:02:30.060> over<00:02:30.270> there

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
then get a little over there

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.630 
then get a little over there
so<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.770> not<00:02:31.950> allowed<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
so in that it's not allowed just in the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
so in that it's not allowed just in the
world<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.780> not<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.200> know<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.470> not

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
world it's not you know it's not not

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.280 
world it's not you know it's not not
very<00:02:35.220> fair<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:36.120> loud<00:02:36.330> it's<00:02:36.960> kind<00:02:37.260> of

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
very fair but it's not loud it's kind of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.930 
very fair but it's not loud it's kind of
like<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:38.220> okay<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.820> about

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
like you know it's okay it's about

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.490 
like you know it's okay it's about
average<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.870> would<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> bit<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.380> effort

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
average that would be a bit of effort

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320 
average that would be a bit of effort
was<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.860> bit<00:02:41.010> louder<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.700> obviously<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.180> on

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
was a bit louder the obviously is on

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.030 
was a bit louder the obviously is on
full<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.810> wasn't<00:02:43.140> false<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.740> nothing<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
full it wasn't false so it's nothing to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.100 
full it wasn't false so it's nothing to
do<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.520> volume<00:02:44.970> it's<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
do that to a volume it's just that it's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.920 
do that to a volume it's just that it's
not<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.260> large<00:02:46.500> enough<00:02:46.650> speaker<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> I

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
not a large enough speaker in there so I

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020 
not a large enough speaker in there so I
mean<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.440> terms<00:02:49.620> actual<00:02:50.040> call<00:02:50.280> call<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.910> know

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
mean in terms actual call call you know

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.210 
mean in terms actual call call you know
no<00:02:51.540> problems<00:02:51.870> there<00:02:51.990> at<00:02:52.140> all<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.950> could<00:02:53.130> be

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
no problems there at all just could be

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.410 
no problems there at all just could be
due<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.820> allowed<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.180> smear

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
due for a little bit allowed to smear

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.400 
due for a little bit allowed to smear
they<00:02:54.570> could<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.810> that<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> firmware

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
they could do that and the firmware

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.550 
they could do that and the firmware
upgrade<00:02:55.650> who<00:02:56.070> knows<00:02:56.280> in<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.490> future<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.260> was

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
upgrade who knows in the future so I was

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.260 
upgrade who knows in the future so I was
the<00:02:58.710> nest<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.130> next<00:02:59.460> aspect<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.000> fund

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
the nest that next aspect of the fund

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.610 
the nest that next aspect of the fund
will<00:03:00.480> be<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> camera<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.170> myself

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
will be the camera for myself
