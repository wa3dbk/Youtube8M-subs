in<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.199> lesson<00:00:01.500> I'll<00:00:01.949> teach<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> formula

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in this lesson I'll teach you a formula

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.670 
in this lesson I'll teach you a formula
that<00:00:03.090> will<00:00:03.360> allow<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.750> break<00:00:04.049> any<00:00:04.410> two

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
that will allow you to break any two

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.710 
that will allow you to break any two
numbers<00:00:05.009> down<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.609> raw<00:00:05.850> polyrhythmic
