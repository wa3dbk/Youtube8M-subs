 I'm sorry I 'm here 8 silver foil stamping 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:33.970
 The surface is so back-to-back Which one gets a little semi-solid shape 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:39.520
 I think that I understand if I compare normal cards 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 Yes, it's a little sparkling, but it's a semi-solid form of silver foil stamping 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.910
 I will 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:53.970
 I think it's easy to see from the side, but a little 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.710
 It is a shape that is sparkling like a semi-solid shape 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.710

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.920
 It's silver foil Impressed 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.940
 It is familiar with the previous few cards 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.160
 a 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.640
 The ramen is half solid 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.030
 Let's go next if Shino Shino is shinobi 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.010
 The cell is a human face dog 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:53.520
 Yes, but we were all meetings and I bought 10 pack It is today in such a form 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.750
 a 2 sheets and 2 sheets of silver foil 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:01.600
 And by the way it's normal 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.990
 Well I am just was wearing Well 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.990
 To 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:15.150
 With the earthen pot 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.730
 There are 2 patterns and 2 types , but I've put on it and it comes out without properly wearing one by one 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.720
 Better was 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.110
 To Maji pack 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:29.020
 There are two types of things I 've put on, so it sounds quite new to me

 I feel Fu that kana not a distribution 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:45.550
 Finally, I would like to compare the card of this wafer with the card of the game console 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:49.900
 I feel like the card of the game console of Air is slightly thinner. 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.440
 And the card It is now Wheeler felt here have a firm if there is a record and the thickness 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.440
 is
