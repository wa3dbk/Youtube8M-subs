I know exactly can the reefs out there
feed<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> number<00:01:44.910> not<00:01:45.510> really<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.170> just

to feed this population everybody
thought<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.560> idea<00:03:08.860> was<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.310> good

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
thought that the idea was very good

you see that what we were doing a walk

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.110 
you see that what we were doing a walk
is<00:03:21.599> happening<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> future<00:03:25.099> maybe

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
is happening is that in the future maybe

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.270 
is happening is that in the future maybe
nothing<00:03:27.120> else<00:03:27.239> would<00:03:27.450> be<00:03:27.629> left<00:03:27.920> for<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> young

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
nothing else would be left for a young
