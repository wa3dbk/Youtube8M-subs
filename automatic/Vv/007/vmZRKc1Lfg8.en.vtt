then we move into the amp menus now
obviously<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.409> scene<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.739> incorporates<00:03:52.519> both

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
obviously the scene it incorporates both

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.009 
obviously the scene it incorporates both

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
an amp and blu-ray player so you've got

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.599 
an amp and blu-ray player so you've got
both<00:03:54.199> sets<00:03:54.409> of<00:03:54.500> menus<00:03:54.799> in<00:03:54.949> a<00:03:55.099> press<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.430> setup

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
both sets of menus in a press the setup

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.009 
both sets of menus in a press the setup
button<00:03:55.729> twice<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.299> get<00:03:56.389> into<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.629> out<00:03:56.720> menu

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.830 
button twice to get into the out menu
first<00:03:57.949> off<00:03:58.099> you've<00:03:58.280> got<00:03:58.310> your<00:03:58.519> source<00:03:59.479> select

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
first off you've got your source select

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.809 
first off you've got your source select
so<00:04:00.319> decode<00:04:00.769> mode<00:04:01.010> /<00:04:01.189> input<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.639> then<00:04:01.729> you

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
so decode mode / input and then you

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.280 
so decode mode / input and then you
obviously<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.180> can<00:04:02.299> rename<00:04:02.689> as<00:04:02.870> well<00:04:03.079> and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
obviously you can rename as well and

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.899 
obviously you can rename as well and
then<00:04:03.859> there's<00:04:04.010> certain<00:04:04.099> input<00:04:04.549> modes<00:04:04.760> for

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
then there's certain input modes for

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:09.399 
then there's certain input modes for
your<00:04:05.030> clearly<00:04:05.299> 1<00:04:05.510> &amp;<00:04:05.930> 0<00:04:06.189> -<00:04:07.989> moving<00:04:08.989> out<00:04:09.109> of<00:04:09.139> that

your clearly 1 &amp; 0 - moving out of that

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.319 
your clearly 1 &amp; 0 - moving out of that
we've<00:04:09.859> got<00:04:09.979> the<00:04:10.069> audio<00:04:10.310> adjust<00:04:10.699> menu<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.299> if

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
we've got the audio adjust menu so if

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.789 
we've got the audio adjust menu so if
first<00:04:11.750> off<00:04:11.900> we'll<00:04:11.959> just<00:04:12.260> drop<00:04:12.409> down<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.650> the

first off we'll just drop down to the
Odyssey<00:04:13.159> settings<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:14.090> we've<00:04:14.329> just<00:04:14.359> got<00:04:14.509> these

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720

you<00:05:44.910> leave<00:05:45.060> it<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.210> its<00:05:45.479> units<00:05:45.840> to<00:05:46.020> start<00:05:46.350> up

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
you leave it on its units to start up

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.110 
you leave it on its units to start up
quicker<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.280> will<00:05:47.460> consume<00:05:47.789> more<00:05:47.910> power

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
quicker but it will consume more power

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.550 
quicker but it will consume more power
and<00:05:48.270> standby<00:05:48.600> that's<00:05:48.900> not<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.080> huge<00:05:49.320> amount

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
and standby that's not the huge amount

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.690 
and standby that's not the huge amount
so<00:05:49.740> generally<00:05:50.100> would<00:05:50.220> recommend<00:05:50.610> leaving

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
so generally would recommend leaving

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.150
