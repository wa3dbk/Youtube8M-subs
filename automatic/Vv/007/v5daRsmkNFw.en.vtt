00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.629 

passing<00:04:27.720> all<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.020> cars

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639

I<00:04:29.669> think<00:04:30.449> this<00:04:30.569> is<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.870> vehicles<00:04:31.729> top<00:04:32.729> speed

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.779 
I think this is the vehicles top speed
yeah<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.409> is<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.770> vehicles<00:04:35.219> top<00:04:35.969> speed<00:04:36.330> I

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
yeah this is the vehicles top speed I

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.309 
yeah this is the vehicles top speed I
almost<00:04:38.789> feel<00:04:39.150> like<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.389> the<00:04:39.629> brakes<00:04:39.960> have

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:40.319 
almost feel like that the brakes have

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.469 
almost feel like that the brakes have
been<00:04:41.120> kind<00:04:42.120> of<00:04:42.710> modeled<00:04:43.710> quite<00:04:44.460> well<00:04:44.759> I'm<00:04:45.150> not

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.070 
been kind of modeled quite well I'm not
sure<00:04:45.539> if<00:04:45.780> that's<00:04:45.900> intentional<00:04:46.849> but<00:04:48.050> when<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
sure if that's intentional but when I

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.080 
sure if that's intentional but when I
was<00:04:49.259> driving<00:04:49.680> very<00:04:49.710> fast<00:04:49.949> he<00:04:50.520> try<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.759> brake

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
the car will veer off I'm not sure if it

you<00:04:55.650> know<00:04:55.680> it<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.550> intentional<00:04:57.210> but<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.389> feels

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659
