that<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.850> mean<00:01:40.150> but<00:01:41.080> when<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:41.470> have<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:41.830> many

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
that I mean but when you have so many

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.740 
that I mean but when you have so many
cases<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:43.600> have<00:01:43.780> two<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.200> far<00:01:48.360> what's<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.509> size

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
cases we have two so far what's the size

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.450 
cases we have two so far what's the size
we<00:01:50.470> believe<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.810> yard<00:01:52.810> or<00:01:53.080> 80<00:01:53.619> centimeter
