addition<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.959> game<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.769> route<00:03:08.070> based

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
addition to the game is the route based

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.660 
addition to the game is the route based
upgrade<00:03:08.820> system<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:10.200> right<00:03:10.920> now<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.549> most

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
upgrade system so right now the most

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.699 
upgrade system so right now the most
valuable<00:03:12.090> upgrades<00:03:12.930> will<00:03:13.170> fall<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.440> from

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
valuable upgrades will fall out from

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.860 
valuable upgrades will fall out from
enemies<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:14.489> that<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:15.420> think<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.840> will

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
enemies so that we think it will

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.470 
enemies so that we think it will
encourage<00:03:16.470> people<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:16.950> engage<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.910> combat<00:03:18.150> and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
encourage people to engage in combat and

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.729 
encourage people to engage in combat and
get<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> better<00:03:19.080> gear<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.620> yourself<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:21.739> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
get a better gear for yourself and the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.100 
get a better gear for yourself and the
finally<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.700> level<00:03:23.970> design<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.660> first<00:03:24.870> game

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
finally the level design the first game

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.020 
finally the level design the first game
was<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.350> corridor<00:03:25.650> shooter<00:03:25.950> which<00:03:26.549> was<00:03:26.730> sort<00:03:26.910> of

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
was a corridor shooter which was sort of

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.020 
was a corridor shooter which was sort of
a<00:03:27.299> no<00:03:27.750> match<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> old<00:03:28.500> school<00:03:28.739> games<00:03:29.030> but

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
a no match to the old school games but

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.400 
a no match to the old school games but
you<00:03:30.510> know<00:03:30.600> as<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.810> studio<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.200> want<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
you know as the studio we want to

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.640 
you know as the studio we want to
develop<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.100> we

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
develop so we

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.710 
develop so we
he<00:03:32.709> also<00:03:33.099> wanted<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.640> create<00:03:34.000> bigger<00:03:34.269> levels

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
he also wanted to create bigger levels

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.479 
he also wanted to create bigger levels
more<00:03:34.989> opened<00:03:35.319> levels<00:03:35.650> with<00:03:36.159> much<00:03:36.340> more

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
more opened levels with much more

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.630 
more opened levels with much more
freedom<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.909> movement<00:03:37.060> with<00:03:38.220> more<00:03:39.220> vertical

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
freedom of movement with more vertical

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.970 
freedom of movement with more vertical
architecture<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:41.200> also<00:03:41.379> allowed<00:03:41.769> us<00:03:41.799> to

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
architecture and that also allowed us to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.160 
architecture and that also allowed us to
implement<00:03:42.519> new<00:03:42.760> gameplay<00:03:43.390> features<00:03:43.930> like

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
implement new gameplay features like

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.589 
implement new gameplay features like
double<00:03:44.560> jams<00:03:44.799> are<00:03:45.040> real<00:03:45.220> dashes<00:03:45.700> climbing<00:03:46.480> up

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
double jams are real dashes climbing up

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.349 
double jams are real dashes climbing up
the<00:03:46.720> walls<00:03:46.930> running<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:47.799> the<00:03:47.890> rooftops<00:03:48.359> and

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the walls running on the rooftops and

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.890 
the walls running on the rooftops and
combine<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.840> with<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.980> combat<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.390> how<00:03:52.870> is

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
combine that with with combat so how is

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.229 
combine that with with combat so how is
the<00:03:53.170> experience<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:54.069> playing<00:03:55.060> with<00:03:55.209> other

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
the experience for playing with other

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.509 
the experience for playing with other
people<00:03:55.689> is<00:03:55.810> it<00:03:55.989> drop<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.500> drop<00:03:56.680> out<00:03:56.950> like<00:03:57.370> if

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
people is it drop in drop out like if

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
the experience of course the difficulty

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.759 
the experience of course the difficulty
will<00:04:16.600> increase<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.139> each<00:04:17.260> player<00:04:17.530> joining

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
will increase with each player joining

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.710 
will increase with each player joining
your<00:04:18.010> session<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.000> also<00:04:19.180> creates<00:04:19.419> a

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
your session but that also creates a

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.569 
your session but that also creates a
chance<00:04:19.930> for<00:04:20.139> better<00:04:20.470> alert<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.979> drop<00:04:21.280> out<00:04:21.400> from

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
chance for better alert to drop out from

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.520 
chance for better alert to drop out from
from<00:04:22.060> enemies<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:22.990> lutéce<00:04:23.229> of<00:04:23.350> course

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
from enemies the lutéce of course

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.890 
from enemies the lutéce of course
individual<00:04:24.190> for<00:04:24.430> every<00:04:24.760> player<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.720> don't

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
individual for every player so you don't

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.300 
individual for every player so you don't
have<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.080> fight<00:04:26.229> your<00:04:26.349> friends<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.889> mean<00:04:27.010> in

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
have to fight your friends I mean in

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.600 
have to fight your friends I mean in
order<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.669> pick<00:04:27.789> up<00:04:27.940> something<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.099> as<00:04:30.460> you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
order to pick up something and it as you

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
order to pick up something and it as you
mentioned<00:04:30.880> it's<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.030> drop<00:04:31.210> in<00:04:31.240> drop<00:04:31.449> out<00:04:31.740> co-op

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
mentioned it's a drop in drop out co-op

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.610 
mentioned it's a drop in drop out co-op
mode<00:04:32.949> so<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.759> can<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.150> know<00:04:34.240> freely<00:04:34.660> like<00:04:35.050> I

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
mode so you can you know freely like I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.330 
mode so you can you know freely like I
think<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:37.449> single<00:04:38.199> player<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.650> join<00:04:39.220> to

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
think it is single player to join to

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.219 
think it is single player to join to
somebody<00:04:39.610> else's<00:04:39.970> session<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:40.930> then

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
somebody else's session and then

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.879 
somebody else's session and then
continue<00:04:41.680> your<00:04:41.919> your<00:04:42.760> own<00:04:42.970> own<00:04:43.210> game

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:59.860 

what<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:48.340> mess

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.440 

so<00:05:00.870> how<00:05:01.380> does<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.620> split<00:05:02.370> from<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:02.820> from<00:05:03.420> the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
so how does it split from the from the

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.810 
so how does it split from the from the
main<00:05:03.690> story<00:05:03.900> campaign<00:05:04.170> because<00:05:04.530> I<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:05.160> imagine

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
main story campaign because I I imagine

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.730 
main story campaign because I I imagine
some<00:05:05.910> people<00:05:06.180> would<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.540> grind<00:05:06.780> with

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
some people would like to grind with

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.710 
some people would like to grind with
other<00:05:08.430> people<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:08.790> just<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> get<00:05:09.450> here<00:05:09.630> and

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
other people just just to get here and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.510 
other people just just to get here and
then<00:05:09.780> they<00:05:09.960> can<00:05:10.110> continue<00:05:10.380> on<00:05:11.010> their<00:05:11.220> own<00:05:11.340> in

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
then they can continue on their own in

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.140 
then they can continue on their own in
the<00:05:11.580> stories<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:13.290> have<00:05:13.470> we<00:05:14.370> have<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.580> story

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
the stories so we have we have a story

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.690 
the stories so we have we have a story
missions<00:05:15.480> like<00:05:15.630> in<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.840> first<00:05:16.020> game<00:05:16.550> we<00:05:17.550> also

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
missions like in the first game we also

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.420 
missions like in the first game we also
added<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.480> optional<00:05:19.260> side<00:05:19.530> quests<00:05:19.950> which<00:05:20.250> are

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
added the optional side quests which are

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.240 
added the optional side quests which are
they<00:05:21.270> are<00:05:21.420> sort<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.840> like<00:05:21.900> dependence<00:05:22.830> explode

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
they are sort of like dependence explode

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.880 
they are sort of like dependence explode
the<00:05:24.180> characters<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:25.140> NPC's<00:05:25.560> that<00:05:25.770> you

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
the characters the NPC's that you

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.100 
the characters the NPC's that you
interact<00:05:26.310> with<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:27.090> for<00:05:27.300> grinding<00:05:27.690> we<00:05:27.900> have<00:05:28.080> a

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
interact with but for grinding we have a

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.710 
interact with but for grinding we have a
special<00:05:28.470> random<00:05:29.460> assignments<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.510> this<00:05:30.690> is

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
special random assignments so this is

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.330 
special random assignments so this is
something<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:31.170> if<00:05:31.470> you've<00:05:31.620> beaten<00:05:31.920> all<00:05:32.220> of

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
something that if you've beaten all of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.800 
something that if you've beaten all of
the<00:05:32.460> missions<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:32.850> game<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:33.330> still<00:05:33.660> you

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810

assignments that can be you can play
them<00:05:40.440> infinitely<00:05:40.710> actually<00:05:41.460> just<00:05:41.730> for

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
them infinitely actually just for

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
always cool to make a game on on other

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.780 
always cool to make a game on on other
systems<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.780> than<00:06:16.380> 10pc<00:06:16.710> because<00:06:17.160> you

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
systems that the than 10pc because you

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.040 
systems that the than 10pc because you
can<00:06:17.940> also<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.330> know<00:06:18.479> think<00:06:18.720> of<00:06:18.810> some<00:06:19.020> new

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
can also you know think of some new

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.719 
can also you know think of some new
features<00:06:19.290> you<00:06:19.740> know<00:06:19.860> some<00:06:20.130> consoles<00:06:20.550> you<00:06:20.640> know

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
features you know some consoles you know

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:21.950 
features you know some consoles you know
they<00:06:20.880> have<00:06:21.060> something<00:06:21.390> created<00:06:21.780> with

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
they have something created with

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.159 
they have something created with
controller<00:06:22.380> that<00:06:22.650> kind<00:06:22.890> of<00:06:22.979> stuff<00:06:23.250> so<00:06:23.790> yeah<00:06:24.169> so

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
controller that kind of stuff so yeah so

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.960 
controller that kind of stuff so yeah so
we<00:06:25.290> can<00:06:25.410> experiment<00:06:25.770> with<00:06:26.070> something<00:06:26.550> new<00:06:26.729> all

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
we can experiment with something new all

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.420 
we can experiment with something new all
the<00:06:27.000> time<00:06:27.380> it's<00:06:28.380> also<00:06:28.530> challenging<00:06:28.800> you<00:06:29.310> know

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
the time it's also challenging you know

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.400 
the time it's also challenging you know
to<00:06:29.490> maintain<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.210> same<00:06:30.450> quality<00:06:30.960> of<00:06:31.169> course

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
to maintain the same quality of course

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.880 
to maintain the same quality of course
on<00:06:31.669> all<00:06:32.669> of<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:33.150> platforms<00:06:33.660> but<00:06:34.590> we<00:06:34.710> don't

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
on all of the platforms but we don't

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.340 
on all of the platforms but we don't
want<00:06:35.040> to<00:06:35.130> limit<00:06:35.280> ourselves<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:36.050> only<00:06:37.050> one

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
want to limit ourselves to only one

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.469 
want to limit ourselves to only one
systems<00:06:37.890> I<00:06:38.100> mean<00:06:38.520> we<00:06:38.669> know<00:06:38.940> that<00:06:39.120> we<00:06:39.240> have<00:06:39.270> to

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
systems I mean we know that we have to

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.310 
systems I mean we know that we have to
open<00:06:39.720> up<00:06:39.810> to

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
open up to

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.370 
open up to
to<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.650> lot<00:06:40.890> of<00:06:40.920> the<00:06:41.520> players<00:06:41.880> so<00:06:42.840> how<00:06:43.080> long<00:06:43.260> has

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
to a lot of the players so how long has

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.080 
to a lot of the players so how long has
a<00:06:43.410> game<00:06:43.620> being<00:06:43.800> available<00:06:44.100> in<00:06:44.490> development

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
a game being available in development

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.910 
a game being available in development
and<00:06:45.180> when<00:06:45.570> can<00:06:45.720> we<00:06:45.780> expect<00:06:45.810> to<00:06:46.170> see<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.800> game

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
and when can we expect to see the game

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.620 
and when can we expect to see the game
coming<00:06:47.220> up<00:06:47.310> we<00:06:47.730> started<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.120> development

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 
coming up we started the development

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.250 
coming up we started the development
like<00:06:49.110> a<00:06:49.140> year<00:06:49.410> from<00:06:49.620> a<00:06:50.130> year<00:06:50.490> ago<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:51.260> we

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
like a year from a year ago and we

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.190 
like a year from a year ago and we
speculate<00:06:52.740> that<00:06:52.770> the<00:06:53.100> game<00:06:53.280> will<00:06:53.460> be<00:06:53.700> released

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
speculate that the game will be released

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.320 
speculate that the game will be released
probably<00:06:55.200> a<00:06:55.770> year<00:06:56.490> from<00:06:56.730> now<00:06:56.790> so<00:06:57.120> it's<00:06:57.240> going

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:57.330 
probably a year from now so it's going

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.220 
probably a year from now so it's going
to<00:06:57.390> be<00:06:57.450> 2016<00:06:58.350> late<00:06:59.040> summer<00:06:59.600> on<00:07:00.600> all<00:07:01.020> platforms

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:01.230 
to be 2016 late summer on all platforms

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.620 
to be 2016 late summer on all platforms
I'm<00:07:01.620> within<00:07:01.860> easily<00:07:02.190> so<00:07:02.370> PC<00:07:02.700> ps4<00:07:02.970> xbox<00:07:03.540> one
