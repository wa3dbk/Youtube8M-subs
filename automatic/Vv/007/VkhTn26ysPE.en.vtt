this case is such a small area I'm gonna

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.500 
this case is such a small area I'm gonna
work<00:03:11.109> directly<00:03:11.379> out<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.889> can<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:13.269> will

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
work directly out of the can this will

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.879 
work directly out of the can this will
assure<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.230> paint<00:03:14.470> will<00:03:14.680> adhere

properly<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.209> surface<00:03:16.599> especially<00:03:17.349> since

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
properly to the surface especially since

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.399 
properly to the surface especially since
we<00:03:17.889> use<00:03:18.370> joint<00:03:19.180> compound<00:03:19.599> for<00:03:20.109> certain

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
we use joint compound for certain

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.949 
we use joint compound for certain
speckles<00:03:20.950> they're<00:03:21.639> water<00:03:21.970> soluble<00:03:22.420> meaning

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
speckles they're water soluble meaning

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.960 
speckles they're water soluble meaning
once<00:03:23.200> they<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.470> wet<00:03:23.799> again<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.489> reanimates

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
once they get wet again it reanimates

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.569 
once they get wet again it reanimates
them<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:25.959> if<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.139> was<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.440> rub<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> sponge<00:03:27.129> over

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
them so if you was to rub a sponge over

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.910 
them so if you was to rub a sponge over
to<00:03:28.060> spackle<00:03:28.359> that<00:03:28.629> we<00:03:28.750> just<00:03:28.930> did<00:03:29.139> it<00:03:29.799> would

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
to spackle that we just did it would

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.550 
to spackle that we just did it would
actually<00:03:30.099> re-wet<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.000> Reese<00:03:31.660> often<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.230> so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
actually re-wet it and Reese often it so

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.740 
actually re-wet it and Reese often it so
this<00:03:32.739> primer<00:03:33.669> is<00:03:33.849> the<00:03:33.940> only<00:03:34.120> way<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.359> we<00:03:34.569> can

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
this primer is the only way that we can

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.170 
this primer is the only way that we can
kind<00:03:35.019> of<00:03:35.139> seal<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.859> in<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.609> makes<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.910> hard

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
kind of seal it in and it makes it hard

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.770 
kind of seal it in and it makes it hard
as<00:03:37.299> concrete<00:03:37.680> ready<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.799> paint<00:03:41.549> one<00:03:42.629> sign<00:03:43.629> of

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
as concrete ready to paint one sign of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.379 
as concrete ready to paint one sign of
amateur<00:03:44.319> repair<00:03:44.709> work<00:03:44.919> is<00:03:45.160> we<00:03:45.459> can<00:03:45.760> totally

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
amateur repair work is we can totally

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.920 
amateur repair work is we can totally
see<00:03:46.780> it's<00:03:46.930> totally<00:03:47.199> obvious<00:03:47.530> repairs<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
see it's totally obvious repairs and

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.280 
see it's totally obvious repairs and
that's<00:03:50.079> what<00:03:50.199> I<00:03:50.260> wasn't<00:03:50.590> properly<00:03:50.949> sanded<00:03:51.760> out

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
that's what I wasn't properly sanded out

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.280 
that's what I wasn't properly sanded out
or<00:03:53.290> primed<00:03:56.549> okay<00:03:57.549> we're<00:03:58.480> gonna<00:03:58.599> let<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.959> dry

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
or primed okay we're gonna let that dry

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.860 
or primed okay we're gonna let that dry
in<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.769> then<00:04:00.639> our<00:04:01.030> surfaces<00:04:01.480> are<00:04:01.569> ready<00:04:01.750> to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
in and then our surfaces are ready to

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.049 
in and then our surfaces are ready to
paint
