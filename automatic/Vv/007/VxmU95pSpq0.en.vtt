on them like I think one glass is 1500
bucks<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:17.170> all<00:01:17.380> these<00:01:17.560> covers<00:01:17.980> start

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
bucks and then all these covers start

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.310 
bucks and then all these covers start
coming<00:01:18.550> out<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.940> if<00:01:19.360> they<00:01:19.570> harden<00:01:20.020> from<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
coming out and if they harden from the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.740 
coming out and if they harden from the
inside<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.070> I<00:01:21.310> really<00:01:21.820> wish<00:01:21.970> they<00:01:22.150> improve<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
inside so I really wish they improve the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.950 
inside so I really wish they improve the
quality<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.290> that<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.760> blushes<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:25.780> waste

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
quality of that of the blushes so waste

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.510 
quality of that of the blushes so waste
of<00:01:26.140> money<00:01:26.230> otherwise<00:01:26.620> so<00:01:27.040> this<00:01:27.160> is<00:01:27.310> peach

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
of money otherwise so this is peach

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.400 
of money otherwise so this is peach
twist<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.180> the<00:01:28.540> difference<00:01:28.870> between<00:01:29.020> this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
twist and the difference between this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.800

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140
