 enough video of ghost crows what 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 had never combined murid lebron a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.689

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.520
 possibility to try preview for you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.989

 this tenth chapter of call of duty 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.690
 but let's go with 2 barons in order 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.070
 on the event before we played 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 the tuber friend is all over europe for 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 4 hours and after an initial loss 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 due to the comparison between my level 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.399
 of average level of the players present in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.910
 room and having taken confidence again 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910
 with the joypad 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.250
 I must say that all in all I do not 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 I would say to say that it has hurt me knows 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.620
 that today will focus everything on 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.510
 sympathy is their expansion 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
 devastation these cazzutissimo name of the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.420
 maps package will include built 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.739
 four gt map for multiplayer 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 a new episode in the mode 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.340
 extinction a new weapon is heard of you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.869
 the reaper that we will see later on 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 it will be usable only in the mode 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.299
 extension 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 let's start with what was for me 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.420
 the key map of this package 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.799
 rubin maps set in what 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 it may seem like an ancient temple ever 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.850
 abandoned full of lianas and vegetation 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.229
 above all, what made me 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.520
 life is really hard on this map 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 been settling on the various levels and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.009
 orient myself through countless 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.970
 tunnels that compose it 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.890
 does not make a killer in time has an enemy 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 that zac takes another from the corner 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.860
 or on the stairs or worse yet, view of the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.570
 upper floors in that case you are 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 really fucked with the rough at the back he had 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 understood how sometimes it is useless a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.710
 leave blind as they count 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.939
 minimum for support fees 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.420
 especially when playing for le 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.560
 first times 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.450
 what are the innovations it introduces 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.930
 This faq was a take of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.340
 recipe 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.689
 two are the cool ones you will unlock 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.170
 carrying out directives of 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.640
 carrying case 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 the first is that you can point out 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.579
 the huge a drop placed in the middle of the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.140
 map that begin to hurl debris 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.520
 on fire to the cock as you can 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.299
 see could they help you out 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.299
 clean up the map 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.119
 inkwell premise 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.910
 the second thanks dredd for pee 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.950
 since I prevented it will allow you to 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.560
 unlock a particular media a little 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.780
 like the michael myers lippok the predator 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.250
 well the images speak for themselves 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.080
 you will become a kind of alien is 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.790
 crossed with wolverine equipped with a 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.320
 view I assume thermal that will allow you 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.060
 to eliminate your enemies with the farewell 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.270
 or hook them up to make them jump 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.270
 air 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.989
 if you love tight spaces 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.799
 am hof bichi mof in short, she is the map 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.209
 that's right for you 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.579
 now tell me a moment in the comments 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.560
 what do you think, but sad map remembered 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.409
 very special operation of with 4 golds 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.069
 to find myself played by someone else 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.230
 something to say 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.450
 well the frantic adrenaline rhythms you will say 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 yes you always like you are not late like 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.959
 me maybe it was the map where i got it 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.549
 more blows quite tangled el 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.620
 night setting is not that he had 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:01.060
 A lot of taxes is the wall listened to tell you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.980
 that now more than ever your time of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.719
 unleash yourself with entertaining beautiful company 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.349
 you rarely get the chance to fight 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:09.400
 long range paradoxically collision not 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.049
 gave me this impression 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.400
 set on the dullest ship of the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.169
 titanic that will present the same spaces 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
 tight of pim off is like the other two 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.109
 maps will be structured on several levels 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.219
 unfortunately for my happiness it was the 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.389
 map that we played less and 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.099
 perhaps this is the one that does not 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.180
 much appreciated perhaps though also because 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:26.219
 he was an immigrant for the whole duration 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.109
 of the game is the lupus in fabula a 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:31.180
 yes sweets basically has neither hearted something 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.859
 of family member is already who has played in q3 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.939
 will have noticed the similarity with dom 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.629
 and in fact it is his own 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:38.739
 revisiting well what about guys and dom 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.470
 balanced to neither too open nor too 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.449
 super brothel closed his ex cin domain 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.650
 but with a treat look at the fact 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:45.970
 the player's monitor is next 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.769
 managed to see that we guys are 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.449
 staff indicated a secret passage that 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.959
 but I don't want to tell you where it is like there 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.609
 you enter 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.079
 I only tell you that near via 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.000
 which I think will make many climb 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.169
 people at the first games but between 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.400
 the other this was the first of the 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.810
 maps we played in the domain e 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.579
 despite the staff and had us 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.329
 warned that the Moor was placed in us 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.030
 federation 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.650
 it's not that I understood it very well as well 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.540
 that fucking file had games that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.569
 We play 5 against 7 because of you 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.949
 ops well guys this video ends here 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.359
 if you liked it let me know how 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.419
 always left a nice I like 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.190
 and yesterday is the moment you are not 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.120
 mica forgot something but yes 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.120
 extinction 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.630
 as said at the beginning and how it was 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.520
 however it was also on devastation he would have a 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.410
 extra episode of killing mode 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.360
 aliens like concept more or less remains 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.410
 molin four players horde norms of 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.120
 exploding aliens splashing 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.830
 everywhere is a thriller to wear 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.420
 the living thing is going on throughout the whole round 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 this time the bonus weapon was not 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.660
 introduced in standard multiplayer but 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.460
 just 6 sting with the rapper one 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.900
 machine gun really shows itself here 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.310
 give a really good and capable weapon 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.000
 make a late man like me get over it 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.710
 all rounds 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.810
 perhaps also because they flow and a 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.790
 French really paid and facilitate 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.560
 final boss in the heart but I do not want 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.840
 spoil you nothing but mine 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 reaction to its appearance or despite 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.720
 never was a great player of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.550
 this mode is my budget on 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.040
 this second episode really positive 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.350
 especially hectic and fun 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.180
 very based on teamwork and then 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.280
 cabbage get to the final boss at 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.540
 first game is priceless 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.010
 Well guys tonight the video 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.330
 it really ends which I hope there is 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.800
 liked now I want to know 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.510
 especially ours as far as I am concerned 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.220
 concerns the final budget on this of 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 today I am quite positive 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.870
 I really liked the maps and found them 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.460
 well structured is above all enough 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.050
 difficult as you probably will have 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.060
 understood my favorite destination was 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.090
 definitely ruiz because I appreciated 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.340
 very much that like his blog south pong 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.090
 here too we have introduced these 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.150
 goodies that I think stimulate the 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.560
 player give him an extra boost 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.210
 to carry on was precisely the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.160
 briefcase missions and unlock the 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.810
 predator or the eruption of the volcano 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.880
 I think it was really something 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.560
 stupendous I surprised myself 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.200
 when I played for about an hour and 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.910
 half a row on extinction because 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.190
 we always went ahead and became 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.900
 more and more adrenaline and gradually 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.210
 that cervinia but that we approached the 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.770
 end so who knows that I do not rediscover 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.970
 this mode said this guy 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.560
 obviously now I want to know the 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.600
 show what you always have of this deal 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.520
 and especially what is the map that 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.840
 you think it will be the favorite show 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.460
 let me know with a comment here 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.130
 below I said this I leave you in 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.990
 description also the link for the two 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.580
