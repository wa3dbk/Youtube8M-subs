 the screen is great for moving from left to right 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.890
 and therefore even a fact inches thick so it is really a nice picture if you 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.940

 and those are private arm that means that you have TV programs on an external 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.500
 hard disk rich record 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.170
 You can also see 3 HDMI connections on the side 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.160
 and an optical flock 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.590

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.460
 the television from the sgp six series has a smooth and razor sharp for hd 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.170
 image thanks to its image refresh of no less than 3000 law so become after eleven 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.489
 really occur 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.310
 So it is a plasma TV which means that the image is made up of small ones 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.489
 pixels that can turn on or off independently of the other pixels 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:22.219
 The advantage of this is that you gillet better clubs and also thanks to the IMF with 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.549
 blackpool technology you have better black values ​​but dark 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.779
 scenes look nice and then you see a better difference between for example 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:30.649
 black and the rocker demanded 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.259

 it looks like the ad on a 3d by player than a bit of movies with much more 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.510
 depth 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.090
 and the funny thing is that you can also put any program in 3d thanks to the 2d 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.269
 to 3d conversion 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.510
 after the television from the gps 60 series fresh markets that and so that means 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.640
 that you can consult applications that you have purchased in the fia correct market 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.860
 and that all goes nice and fast thanks to the hexacore processor and that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.319
 You can also use applications on a home screen 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.270
 for example, places according to your own wishes so that you can go there immediately 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.800

 of course you can operate the television with the normal operation but you can 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.440
 also with you and droid or peppel the voice 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.410
 with the four people working 2 point 0 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.680
 then you can simply operate your TV from the couch even with frost control as 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.720
 if you then press that button, you can give a command with your voice 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.619
 for example, to raise the volume 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.279
 volume 20 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.389
 and so you see that the volume of the television goes to 20 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.609
 where the boat is on the internet search then you can also say for example 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.989

 on the cda and so I can already say to Jan van hoof and football 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.369
 draw analysis 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:02.430
 after, for example, this player who has been running for too long 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.690

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 with you football experts 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.549
 with this television and consumes slightly more power than, for example, a with 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.909

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.690
