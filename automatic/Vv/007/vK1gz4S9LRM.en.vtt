00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the channel is a partner of tgi games 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 hesselink has not forgotten and used me 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.880
 50 discount on all your accounts 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.490
 favor funk virus used there is one more 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.440
 video another video of black ops three eu 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.630
 I know you are a little tired 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 fifa staff relying on e copper 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 breasts in the canal but that's how I explained 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 in the last video for fifa fifteen is already 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.170
 at its end and the top 3 is something new then 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 of course it will get my attention more 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.670
 but we're almost on the 16th 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.920
 So I ask for a little patience to 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.630
 You guys from fifa are good, so let's go here. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 for one more match of that match in the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.930
 It will only serve as a background to get a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.450
 Any departure from here on my computer 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.610
 I played a lot of matches here and I played 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.829
 more than four and a half hours there 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 I was on my channel today to help you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 do not follow, just want an account if 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 dilates the meaning every time it starts 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.239
 the most it down the dog will 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.430
 approaching and taking the phone is a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 Delicious but although I enjoyed doing a lot 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.680
 these rage of some networks of the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.079
 good match game had a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.949
 Starting carlos you should know the dn 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 his was him 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 in the last video code or I spoke 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.030
 which was even a game today in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.549
 joinville on live that destroy it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.040
 sent me to destroy I made over 80 that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.619
 they go their own way and it was very very very 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.100
 of the time because he was very upset, right? 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.720
 And just as I did to play in the light says 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.869
 you must be wondering how 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.939
 I did because the botox three were very 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.790
 of Brazilian servers and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.530
 thanks to a great caruso Carlos who was 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 the guy who let me open 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 Duffy was 16 and this one unfortunately did not 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.799
 Can you record video posting to the speaker? 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.119
 nothing you want I can do one 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.880
 video talking about my impressions 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.369
 end because I threw the attack with the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.439
 women and such but at last the position was him 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.090
 What impressed me open and judge 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.189
 today he saved me one more time because he 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
 lives in the United States than theoretical 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.700
 Onlive called us to prepare and from the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.189
 goal 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.890
 the American server and thence was a tetéia 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.170
 Of course it's bad because it 's a little 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 net is playing to drive 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.689
 then united states but it's much better 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.000
 than playing in ceará and brturbo ladha 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.640
 suppose locking all the time comes many people 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.440
 made many rounds it was very cool and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.050
 I'm much I cry 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.470
 crusades about how the beta will be 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.590
 no xbox one is expensive because the game itself 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.370
 I recommend stans and basically it was 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.690
 face 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.660
 Of course there is something that needs improvement. 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.850
 that's the bag of hacking now I'm going 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 forget the black straight band and this can 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.580
 be told by people absurd lenses a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 kind of touch is a tenth to china 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.260
 also old must be fado 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 absurdly other people occupied by 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.200
 there goes people that the game has many 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.540
 advice that they need to be 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.880
 made but we have a beta for three 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.940
 months of release these are defects 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.980
 small face taking out the servers 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.510
 the game is excellent and if they 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.670
 fixing the servers is one thing 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.270
 and made these minor adjustments. 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.550
 face is a new one of xbox 2 is the black ops 3 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.620
 it's a sea level game it 's 42 I think 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.510
 What are you guys going to like? 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.800
 speaking the digital globe when playing 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.660
 will arm your arm 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.110
 so what do I wanna open for a 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.850
 xbox one is that there are not cattle there that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.459
 servers is not overloaded with 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.660
 they put it through these two days to 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.700
 that we 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.580
 xbox staff the year i'm going to play there 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.890
 I can also enjoy watching them 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.650
 better still had to be taken in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.700
 I get fado and launch a game in November 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.670
 Amazing 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.350
 that's all I want and man I think 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.810
 that the game has everything to do very well 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.730
 as I said it will not be bigger than it gets 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.350
 here on the channel you will not be 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.890
 momentarily but it will not go because it will 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.330
 serve for 16 now in September and will 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.260
 blow up video on stuck channel 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.030
 explode 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.739
 no longer getting ready to make is that the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.360
 At first I think it will not be a problem 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.980
 I do not know, but I'm already 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.810
 receiving and saving money for 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.030
 stay here so there is no lack of content 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.910
 You 're worried, but this is it. 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.220
 Dude, I like this open I like too much. 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.410
 I found it open very good, taking the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.380
 problem of the servers in which a game is 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.390
 I liked it and others looking forward to xbox 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.670
 year it has no such problems 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.610
 servers through you that do not 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.830
 they also played and have xbox one see how 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.260
 The game is okay, it's okay. 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.970
 invalidated every hour and that's the idea is 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 I wanted to take advantage of this 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.300
 space also to exchange an idea with 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.620
 about the time of the videos that 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.620
 you leave here a comment that the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.510
 normally 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.490
 if you explore that you would like it to go away 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.800
 because we have a conflict here in the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.600
 channel that the issue of time 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.010
 videos with the time of the roots teens 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.150
 because I like to start watching on 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.889
 late afternoon 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.199
 I'm one of the videos at 7 o'clock then 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.199
 It ended up giving a conflict. I tried to jump. 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:46.660
 videos earlier and did not work out so well 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.490
 videos later I already let go and gave 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.500
 It worked out better because the staff 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 watch it at the end of the night before 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.190
 of sleep and such and has a staff that 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.080
 watched the one who wakes up the other day 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.590
 what about college school around? 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.900
 go 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.789
 so I wanted you to tell me 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.880
 For me, any time is better for me. 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.260
 you guys so I can reconcile 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.419
 thinking that the larvae are always 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.639
 explored there but let's give 6 and on 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.080
 so I like to have acted in that 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.630
 worked on the weekday 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.460
 So at 7 o'clock I think I'll have to 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.729
 stop posting this will not mess up 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.800
 many live is connected on the other hand 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.840
 posting earlier I find it a bit bad 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.210
 because strip also saw the light 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.539
 My idea was always posted after 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.320
 daline this video was after 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.360
 autographing him after the louis vuitton 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.010
 also why it's coming out more 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.020
 afternoon is still on 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.300
 usually assad to leave on the days of 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.510
 week and would finish by the 9 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.700
 videos go out well the 93 cattle then to 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.229
 do not be confused that you think so 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.300
 It's good for you, I wish 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.280
 do honest opinion because it is very 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.860
 important for me to help you 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.330
 to improve increasingly the channel then it is 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.580
 I hope you have. 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.440
 this short video like me 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.199
 said to me, I do not have anything else to say 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.210
 Open the game is good for a 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.949
 beta is sensational they need 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.150
 to fix the brains and with that I 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.250
 I think we're going to have a great 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.860
 I play there in November I'm pretty 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.199
 anxious now to play in xbox the year 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.910
 ps4 I quit now that the fall was the 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.949
 to play and I do not have to play anymore 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.570
 in american series in brazil unfortunately 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.039
 is not giving is that what you have 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.470
 liked also does not include background 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.150
 need comments or request low 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.680
 forgot to rate the video too much 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.660
 important for me I liked the course 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.810
 recognized that uncle my comment 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.039
 There, a hug goes out to the 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.460
 next 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.460
 I was
