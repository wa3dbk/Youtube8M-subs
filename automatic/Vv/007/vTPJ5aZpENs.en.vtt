00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.230
 my name is money 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.080
 I'm captain of the university district. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 federal abc prototype he went 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.879
 created in 2011 with the intention of taking the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.800
 name of university to great 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.980
 university engineering competitions 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 and has as its worst and the application of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.140
 techniques learned in the classroom 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.840
 the creation of the neighborhood helped to promote 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 application of engineering and 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 improving the concepts of students can 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.920
 lead the student to have better concepts 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 when he arrives in a company does not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.579
 arrive totally raw in a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.379
 already has an experience of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.759
 teamwork and work with 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.500
 engineering projects 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.570
 My name is Henrique and I am in charge. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.070
 by the braking system in the prototype 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.590
 baggio fbc 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.440
 competition organized by the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.030
 society of mobility engineers 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.729
 makes the students closer to the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 industries in the competition there is a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.810
 series of evaluations on the vehicle being 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.580
 they are theoretical and practical 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.369
 theoretical assessments are made by 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.890
 judges who are trained engineers who 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.959
 already participated in projects like this 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.660
 practical assessments require much of the 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.450
 vehicle are evidence of a long race 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.810
 duration of four hours and other evidence 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 require the car to be good at braking 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.640
 suspension and safety in the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 expectation for this year in the competition 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 are very good because in our first 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.200
 year of competition in the regional stage we 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 we got a trophy at the most 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.670
 traditional proof that they think of 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.069
 traction we were in fifth place 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.200
 this national year we modified 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.470
 the car and we hope to win the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.479
 in douro or be among the first and 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.009
 also have better results in the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.739
 static dynamic tests 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.870
 I'm giving a yes, I'm the technician. 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.030
 workshop and student 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.890
 in the workshop that is the space that people 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.790
 develop people assemble constructs 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.150
 same car 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.160
 we have an equipment has a major part 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.780
 of the necessary equipment 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.700
 the construction of the car always helped 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.400
 technical training and all 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.360
 people could use the tools 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.030
 drilling tools 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.920
 bench and the best way to use 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.140
 this type of material also participate 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.970
 of the competitions was already in two 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.980
 and one national and the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 knowledge that new students 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 get here in the workshop recognition 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.330
 to those who give it gives him even a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.300
 adjustment techniques mechanical adjustment 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.730
 mounting of the own own 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.480
 prototype the maintenances some breakdown 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.400
 that has the same test is in competition 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.800
 all this experience in competition is 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.270
 very valid for you to fix some 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.520
 real-time problem 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.260
 in the heat of competition then the work 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.390
 workshop is very important for the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.450
 I'm developing here. 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.570
 I am responsible for the part of the structure 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.180
 of the chassis car and also operates in the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.550
 part of the team's management every year 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 team needs to be renewed because it has 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.190
 students who are graduating in the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.190
 university and also for the opportunity 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.950
 for students to participate in the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.200
 design in the selection we make a 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.680
 provided a basic knowledge of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.200
 drawing and electrical mechanics 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.320
 depending on the area the student 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.110
 I would like to participate in the bass and we 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.810
 we do an interview with the students 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.660
 to check whether their interest in 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.680
 enter the team and its goals 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.920
 even as what they want after 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.670
 and what they can add to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.290
 the team 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.150
 if you would like to follow our 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.450
 I called my website at 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.810

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.530
