00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.339 
seven games he was good I liked him a
lot<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.370> all<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.489> really<00:03:08.700> can<00:03:08.940> say<00:03:09.120> last<00:03:09.959> but

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
lot that's all I really can say last but

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.289 
lot that's all I really can say last but
certainly<00:03:10.500> not<00:03:10.980> least<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.610> in-form

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
certainly not least is the in-form

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.089 
certainly not least is the in-form
storage<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.140> he<00:03:13.200> picked<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.500> five<00:03:13.830> goals

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
storage and he picked up the five goals

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.589 
storage and he picked up the five goals
in<00:03:14.220> seven<00:03:14.430> games<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.120> kind<00:03:15.330> of<00:03:15.420> sauce

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
in seven games but that's kind of sauce

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.780 
in seven games but that's kind of sauce
focusing<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.980> rest<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> team<00:03:17.579> like

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
focusing on the rest of the team like

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.729 
focusing on the rest of the team like
storage<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.269> just<00:03:18.480> plodding<00:03:18.810> along<00:03:18.900> possibly

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
storage was just plodding along possibly

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.080 
storage was just plodding along possibly
not<00:03:19.859> in<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.100> best<00:03:20.250> side<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.790> he<00:03:20.850> could<00:03:21.000> have

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
not in the best side that he could have

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.490 
not in the best side that he could have
been<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.329> he<00:03:21.450> probably<00:03:21.630> with<00:03:21.840> him<00:03:21.989> or<00:03:22.140> suit<00:03:22.350> at

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
been on he probably with him or suit at

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.229 
been on he probably with him or suit at
the<00:03:22.560> other<00:03:22.739> side<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.609> was<00:03:23.760> playing<00:03:24.000> like

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
the other side and I was playing like

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.270 
the other side and I was playing like
part<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.290> along<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.829> ground<00:03:26.010> balls

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
part of like along the ground balls

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.770 
part of like along the ground balls
where<00:03:26.489> storage<00:03:26.850> definitely<00:03:27.239> prefers<00:03:27.510> fru

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
where storage definitely prefers fru

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
where storage definitely prefers fru
balls<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> balls<00:03:28.620> onto<00:03:28.859> his<00:03:29.040> head<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.400> he<00:03:29.459> was

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
balls and balls onto his head but he was

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.610 
balls and balls onto his head but he was
still<00:03:29.970> good<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:30.359> what<00:03:30.569> he<00:03:30.690> was<00:03:30.780> worth<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.230> I

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
still good for what he was worth and I

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.110 
still good for what he was worth and I
definitely<00:03:31.920> will<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.310> doing<00:03:32.519> an<00:03:32.640> individual

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120
