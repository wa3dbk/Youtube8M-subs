00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
commentary of the footage that we have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.539 
commentary of the footage that we have
pretty<00:01:33.270> much<00:01:33.299> these<00:01:33.990> two<00:01:34.229> ladies<00:01:34.619> walking<00:01:35.280> by

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
pretty much these two ladies walking by

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.399 
pretty much these two ladies walking by
and<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> them<00:01:36.479> appears<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.079> already<00:01:37.229> have

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and one of them appears to already have

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.679 
and one of them appears to already have
some<00:01:37.890> super<00:01:38.159> client<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.700> their<00:01:38.850> hand<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.600> she

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
some super client in their hand but she

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
some super client in their hand but she
most<00:01:40.049> likely<00:01:40.110> stole<00:01:40.560> from<00:01:40.650> neighbor<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
most likely stole from neighbor and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.580 
most likely stole from neighbor and
they're<00:01:41.310> looking<00:01:41.400> through<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> garbage

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
they're looking through the garbage

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
they're looking through the garbage
we'll<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.829> oh<00:01:43.860> here's<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.420> could<00:01:45.570> pick

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
we'll see oh here's a can I could pick

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
we'll see oh here's a can I could pick
up<00:01:45.810> that's<00:01:46.110> five<00:01:46.500> extra<00:01:46.770> sense<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.189> me<00:01:47.280> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
up that's five extra sense for me and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370 
up that's five extra sense for me and
one<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.329> start<00:01:48.600> walking<00:01:48.899> back<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
one of them will start walking back and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
one of them will start walking back and
my<00:01:49.979> guess<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.850> dropped<00:01:51.270> off

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
my guess is that they dropped off

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.690 
my guess is that they dropped off
whatever<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.320> stole<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
whatever they stole so you know one of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.160 
whatever they stole so you know one of
them<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> standing<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.509> guard<00:01:54.540> while<00:01:55.020> the

other<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.560> who<00:01:56.070> most<00:01:56.310> likely<00:01:56.369> lost<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.270> rock

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
other one who most likely lost the rock

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.480
