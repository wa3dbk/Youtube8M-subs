00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.600
 kilos however in the account sector

 lauquen in the choapa says that it is possible 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.579

 his flashlight and observed a colored animal 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.299
 blue that moved quickly between 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 waters followed him and with great effort he could 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.830
 catch him it was a lobster that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 it is strange to find it in the rivers of the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.560
 area but the most incredible thing is that it was 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 blue color, I do not wear 9 as they were 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.750
 as the 7 the 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.740
 7 o'clock in the afternoon when it's my turn to the water 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.550
 and had about 77 shrimp 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.240

 at that moment you are surprised with a flashlight 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.439
 at night win shined like this when I go 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.429
 catching quiet when something comes up 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.439
 blue like this and I follow it and the bio according to 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.390
 records of the international press are 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.759
 it's about a phenomenon that occurs once 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.380
 in two million and they have found this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.359
 type of lobsters in new scotland and 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.219
 canada it is a variation 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.649
 genetics that cause the molluscum 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.810
 produce an excessive amount of a 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.239
 protein that gives the appearance to your side 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.579
