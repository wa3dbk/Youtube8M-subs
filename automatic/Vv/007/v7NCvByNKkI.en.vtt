00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 al tranquilÃ£o welcome more galley 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.460
 A class at the slide school today I go 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.520
 to teach you to strike that the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 that mellow air jump that is 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.060
 your hand behind the legs 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.769
 the maneuver that many people have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.989
 there are many people who 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.129
 asked him to teach the maneuver in the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.050
 next class 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.120
 So I 'm going to give you this trip. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.250
 today that the maneuver is very quiet and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.159
 make easier if you follow the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 logic at the moment if you follow the 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.299
 stages of the maneuver 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.129
 You're sure to make it very easy. 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:53.220
 It's a maneuver that you can do. 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.269
 that the skateboard is 111 x 36 in the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.280
 longboard is a classic in the case the 60 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.080
 inches up to those younger children 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 to see if it is possible to do this 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.619
 maneuver is basically because you 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.930
 need to know is the following you do not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.240
 can lift one 's own weight 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 There's no way you can get off the ground if you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.440
 You do not jump regardless of that. 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.370
 it appears that the person is in the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 downloaded tatÃ¡ fergie year it is not so 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.330
 You're jumping, there's a jump over there. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.030
 inside that wonder of your body 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.880
 jump and take the skate along with you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.909
 your skateboard could not throw you up 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 Jump and take the skateboard with you without 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.700
 It tells you exactly how many to do. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 this maneuver 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
 the skate does not jump who cares are you and 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 You carry the skateboard, let's go up. 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.310
 the next I'll teach you now 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.310
 is the basic principle to get it right 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.159
 So you remember that the following 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090
 'you will jump and take the skateboard together 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.049
 with you crouched down and that is why the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.909
 sebrae over there 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.190
 this movement even though the skateboard is a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.900
 video with the scene you give a jolt to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.979
 to be able to take strength since already 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.920
 it will be downloaded 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.840
 You 're down a little bit, and you're 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.840
 rises up every year 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.030
 basically this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.860
 only now you're going to do what you want 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.000
 managed to make it beautiful and solve 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.920
 one step of the maneuver 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.610
 now the next you will do the same 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.140
 thing only that you will hold the skateboard and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.030
 when you jump 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.160
 You'll bring the warmth in. 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.110
 of you you leave loose knee that is 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 to be able to obey when you pull 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.410
 the work arm does not have a problem, do not give 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.350
 to fall, yes we are balanced use your 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.420
 arm freshness gain more balance in 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.080
 The top of the skateboard is what will you do if you go 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.239
 to hold 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.790
 You will skip to bring the days of 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.920
 delicious protest you jump your 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.950
 arm that is here doing you lift the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.950
 arm 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.810
 understood if you stick your hand you will jump and 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.420
 If Brazil gets loose on this you 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.010
 Assert, lock him up for you. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.760
 feels that you are climbing on your arm in 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.160
 that comes together 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.320
 but it's two moves I take care of 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.450
 you give on skateboard and other your 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.450
 arm making the kit accompanies you 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.420
 for this second way for this other 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.150
 The way you're going to leave each one 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.280
 near you will leave more weight on the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.010
 back and at the time you pull with your 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.450
 hand and if this larger weight goes back 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.820
 make the move late 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.190
 and have your Thai pad come up later 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.650
 is more or less like you boot 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.060
 hand safety what will you leave the 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
 weight of the hind foot 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.010
 bigger stronger would only make it heavier 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.750
 bringing farm to create a legacy for 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.930
 create a delay between the movement of 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.930
 today 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.330
 so what happens are you 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.820
 taking a stop already chewed 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.280
 This is simplified to be able to 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.260
 You guys hit the fastest to learn. 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.450
 The faster I've been walking for over eight years 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.860
 and I'll tell you the time I 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.790
 I started to walk that she had no 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.560
 right club 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.420
 so you did not see people walking 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.280
 did not you see people doing the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.040
 maneuver the first 36 that still heard in 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.590
 Cold ground by brother Simon I play most loves 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.180
 in the world and he was not even in the sped 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.500
 the guy who loves the most in the world 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.510
 But what can I say to you? 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.580
 you are already receiving a 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.040
 stop which gives a little easier 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.990
 It was a while ago so do not give up. 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.610
 from the quick stop if you make a mistake try again 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.980
 inside again try again try to 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.690
 new inside again try again 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.310
 Leandro, because it's in your hand. 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.470
 took the globe not only depends on the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.780
 effort you are making 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.310
 to stop doing a favor 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.660
 Did you like the video you got?
