show you how to draw a cartoon Apple so

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.239 
show you how to draw a cartoon Apple so
first<00:00:14.220> up<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.300> is<00:00:15.510> we<00:00:15.750> draw<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> circle

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:19.249 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.739 

nice<00:00:20.249> round<00:00:20.640> circle<00:00:20.820> there<00:00:23.390> then<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.599> top

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
nice round circle there then at the top

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:25.429 
nice round circle there then at the top
of<00:00:24.929> the<00:00:24.990> circle

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
of the circle

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.749 
of the circle
we<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.859> add<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.669> bump<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> top

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
we just add a little bump at the top

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:32.269 
we just add a little bump at the top
with<00:00:29.759> a<00:00:29.849> little<00:00:29.880> wavy<00:00:30.539> line<00:00:30.800> just<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> seam

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
with a little wavy line just in the seam

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.490 
with a little wavy line just in the seam
to<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.430> air<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.760> another<00:00:33.030> bump<00:00:33.980> mounting<00:00:34.980> side

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
to the air in another bump mounting side

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.410 
to the air in another bump mounting side
and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:37.830> add<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.340> little<00:00:38.550> bump<00:00:38.910> at

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and then we just add a little bump at

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.370 
and then we just add a little bump at
the<00:00:39.510> bottom<00:00:39.900> near<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:42.000> carry<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> line<00:00:42.660> up

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
the bottom near and carry the line up

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.170 
the bottom near and carry the line up
and<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.890> back<00:00:44.490> into<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.910> circle<00:00:46.940> then<00:00:47.940> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and around back into the circle then on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.550 
and around back into the circle then on
the<00:00:48.570> top<00:00:49.200> bone<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.670> add<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.360> rectangle<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:52.260> long

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
the top bone we add a rectangle a long

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.820 
the top bone we add a rectangle a long
thin<00:00:53.010> rectangle<00:00:54.440> because<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.560> want<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
thin rectangle because we want the

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.250 
thin rectangle because we want the
sample<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> have<00:00:56.400> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.700> leaf<00:00:57.050> wood<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
sample to have a little leaf wood or a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040 
sample to have a little leaf wood or a
little<00:00:58.620> leaf<00:00:58.770> at<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.040> top<00:00:59.220> so<00:00:59.630> we<00:01:00.630> just<00:01:00.810> draw<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
little leaf at the top so we just draw a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.800 
little leaf at the top so we just draw a
rounded<00:01:01.560> line<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.730> another<00:01:02.970> rounded

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
rounded line and then another rounded

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.880 
rounded line and then another rounded
line<00:01:04.039> opposite<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> aligned<00:01:07.380> up<00:01:07.590> through<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
line opposite and aligned up through the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
line opposite and aligned up through the
middle<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.549> some<00:01:09.390> lines<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
middle and then some lines on the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.139 
middle and then some lines on the
diagonal<00:01:10.759> to<00:01:11.759> form<00:01:11.999> a<00:01:12.090> texture<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> leaf

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
diagonal to form a texture of the leaf

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.029 
diagonal to form a texture of the leaf
because<00:01:15.149> that<00:01:15.270> effort<00:01:15.569> is<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.719> nice<00:01:16.049> shiny

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
because that effort is a nice shiny

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.489 
because that effort is a nice shiny
Apple<00:01:17.640> add<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.329> of<00:01:18.420> reflection<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.319> do

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
Apple add a bit of reflection how we do

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.399 
Apple add a bit of reflection how we do
that<00:01:19.679> is<00:01:19.829> we<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.249> add<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:22.249> kind<00:01:23.249> of<00:01:23.369> misshapen

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
that is we just add a kind of misshapen

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.190 
that is we just add a kind of misshapen
oval<00:01:26.299> yeah<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.719> little<00:01:27.990> circle<00:01:30.200> yeah

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
oval yeah and in a little circle yeah

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.989 
oval yeah and in a little circle yeah
because<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.130> want<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> able<00:01:32.609> to<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.850> little

because we want to able to have a little

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:43.090 
because we want to able to have a little
face<00:01:34.219> or<00:01:35.219> add<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:39.109> half<00:01:40.109> circle<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> end<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
face or add a half circle the end and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.819 
face or add a half circle the end and
some<00:01:44.100> ovals<00:01:44.639> for<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:46.200> eyes

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

some ovals for the eyes
add<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> little<00:01:47.639> bit<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.969> a<00:01:48.060> light<00:01:49.069> reflection

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
add a little bit of a light reflection

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.069 
add a little bit of a light reflection
there<00:01:50.459> just<00:01:50.700> by<00:01:50.789> adding<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.119> circles<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
there just by adding little circles and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.569 
there just by adding little circles and
then<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.350> fill<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.679> rest<00:01:52.859> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.929> oval<00:01:55.579> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
then we fill in the rest of the oval and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
then we fill in the rest of the oval and
then<00:01:56.729> foot<00:01:56.969> cheeks<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.689> draw<00:01:57.929> some

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
then foot cheeks we just draw some

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.340 
then foot cheeks we just draw some
circles

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.900 

except<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.470> I'd<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
and can the drawing so with some black

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.210 
and can the drawing so with some black
pin<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:09.960> I<00:02:09.990> grab<00:02:10.229> my<00:02:10.260> black<00:02:10.500> peon<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.040> just

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
pin so I grab my black peon and I just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:42.110 
pin so I grab my black peon and I just
outlined<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.730> pencil

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.059 

next<00:02:42.840> out<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.080> like<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.379> do<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.709> just

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
next out what I like to do is just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.740 
next out what I like to do is just
double<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.400> thickness<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.150> main<00:02:45.360> parts

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
double the thickness of the main parts

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.180 
double the thickness of the main parts
of<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.019> illustration<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.680> this<00:02:46.800> is<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.099> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
of the illustration and this is just to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580 
of the illustration and this is just to
make<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.489> look<00:02:47.610> even<00:02:47.760> more<00:02:48.060> cartoony<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.989> this

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
make it look even more cartoony so this

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:20.460 
make it look even more cartoony so this
is<00:02:49.709> how<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:50.040> it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.820 

then<00:03:21.470> we<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.650> wait<00:03:21.800> for<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:22.010> ink<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.250> dry

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
then we just wait for the ink to dry

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.589 
then we just wait for the ink to dry
then<00:03:24.830> we<00:03:24.920> just<00:03:25.069> grab<00:03:25.250> an<00:03:25.489> eraser<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.330> go<00:03:26.450> in

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
then we just grab an eraser and we go in

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:43.770 
then we just grab an eraser and we go in
and<00:03:26.720> we<00:03:26.780> rub<00:03:26.959> out<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.140> pencil

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.990 

so<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:44.590> you<00:03:44.710> have<00:03:44.740> it<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.190> cartoon<00:03:45.610> Apple

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
so there you have it a cartoon Apple

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.780 
so there you have it a cartoon Apple
happy<00:03:46.570> joy
