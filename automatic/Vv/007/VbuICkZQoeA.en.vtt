and it's certain like the side cut and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.610 
and it's certain like the side cut and
then<00:00:59.930> Hubble<00:01:00.350> others<00:01:01.129> feel<00:01:01.399> free<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.350> it<00:01:03.350> kind

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
then Hubble others feel free so it kind

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.590 
then Hubble others feel free so it kind
of<00:01:03.680> frees<00:01:03.920> need<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.399> do<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:04.820> since<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.390> might

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
of frees need to do that since I might

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.930 
of frees need to do that since I might
have<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.930> start<00:01:06.229> over<00:01:06.560> anyway<00:01:06.740> which<00:01:07.640> would<00:01:07.820> be

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
have to start over anyway which would be

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.410 
have to start over anyway which would be
my<00:01:08.090> third<00:01:08.360> big<00:01:08.690> trouble<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.259> don't<00:01:09.590> really<00:01:09.860> mind

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
my third big trouble I don't really mind

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.560 
my third big trouble I don't really mind
but<00:01:11.420> there's<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.700> I'm<00:01:13.700> probably<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.270> to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
but there's that I'm probably going to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.030 
but there's that I'm probably going to
post<00:01:15.140> some<00:01:16.009> of<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:16.880> bleaching<00:01:17.150> process<00:01:18.040> just

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040
