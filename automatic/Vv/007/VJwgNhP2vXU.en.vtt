00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.480
 the Lord our God and our 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:20.020
 we put ourselves at the 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:26.790
 river during your face 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.790
 My god in your eyes 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:39.940
 we are sure now that your 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:46.500
 eyes are here on us and that your 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.500
 ears are attentive to our voice. 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.980
 even though there is no dignity in 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.399
 we 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:05.160
 no merit in being here much less 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:08.710
 to be heard by you 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.420
 but we are here with the fear and 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.980
 tremor 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:21.330
 before you presenting our 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:24.480
 life my father as an offer 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:30.520

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:38.770

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:45.100
 we get current are about us and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:49.240
 we can leave here as people who 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.990
 are starting all over again all the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.060
 zero 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:59.830
 My father, we are here looking for yours. 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:07.090
 holy spirit for him to come is 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 repair everything that is broken everything 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:21.160
 that is weak is strengthened than 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:26.350
 Those who are weak are fallen, my God. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.670
 come to receive the strength to get up and 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 those 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:38.170
 who stand upright 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:42.870
 will receive the fear not to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:47.830
 relax not trust their justice 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.940
 but only trust you in the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:57.849
 daily conquest of our salvation 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:03.750
 the holy spirit comes and takes in your hands 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:10.810
 our lives my father takes what we have 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:17.760
 Why everything in this life passes my God? 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:24.780
 everything still happens yesterday we were 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:29.920
 children and young people planning the future 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:34.660
 My father and time has been fast 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:40.239
 days are past fast and we do not even have 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:44.380
 My father noticed that the things that 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.850
 we once thought we were important no longer 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:54.010
 They are more my father. 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:59.500
 we stand here to value 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:05.290
 above all this communion of our 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:11.920
 salvation and our privilege of my 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:15.819
 power to serve comes the holy spirit comes 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 talk to your waiting servants 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.220
 with much struggle with great anxiety for 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.789
 this day they came from afar 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.050
 My god have faced everything to be 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:36.070
 here because of this moment then 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.590

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.000

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.000
 in Lord Jesus' name
