see<00:04:19.870> me<00:04:20.320> go<00:04:20.500> really<00:04:21.160> slowly<00:04:21.459> with<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
see me go really slowly with the

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.440 
see me go really slowly with the
blending<00:04:23.640> basically<00:04:24.640> when<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.850> blend<00:04:25.210> I'm

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
blending basically when I blend I'm

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.250 
blending basically when I blend I'm
trying<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:26.370> build<00:04:27.370> things<00:04:27.550> up<00:04:27.760> gradually<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.570> am

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
trying to build things up gradually I am

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.980 
trying to build things up gradually I am
trying<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:30.030> start<00:04:31.030> out<00:04:31.150> by<00:04:31.330> pressing<00:04:31.570> really

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
trying to start out by pressing really

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.590 
trying to start out by pressing really
really<00:04:32.500> light<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.980> as<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.400> go<00:04:33.580> further<00:04:34.240> on<00:04:34.570> I

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
really light and as I go further on I

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.010 
really light and as I go further on I
press<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.320> lot<00:04:35.860> harder<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.850> also<00:04:37.270> use<00:04:37.630> different

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
press a lot harder I also use different

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.700 
press a lot harder I also use different
pencils<00:04:38.290> as<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:39.130> go<00:04:39.280> further<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:39.700> I<00:04:40.630> get<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.260> use

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
pencils as I go further on I get I use

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.550 
pencils as I go further on I get I use
higher<00:04:41.980> number<00:04:42.400> B<00:04:42.640> pencils<00:04:43.150> so<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:44.140> might<00:04:44.320> start

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
higher number B pencils so I might start

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.310 
higher number B pencils so I might start
out<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.890> an<00:04:45.040> HB<00:04:45.490> pencil<00:04:45.700> which<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.390> same

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
out with an HB pencil which is a same

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.680 
out with an HB pencil which is a same
thing<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> number-two<00:04:48.130> pencil<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.790> I'm

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
thing as a number-two pencil and I'm

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.570 
thing as a number-two pencil and I'm
developing<00:04:50.260> all<00:04:50.410> parts<00:04:50.800> I'm<00:04:51.010> looking<00:04:51.370> at<00:04:51.460> my

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
developing all parts I'm looking at my

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.820 
developing all parts I'm looking at my
photo<00:04:51.880> reference<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:53.140> could<00:04:53.320> look<00:04:53.440> at<00:04:53.590> mine

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
photo reference you could look at mine

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.260 
photo reference you could look at mine
if<00:04:54.310> you<00:04:54.790> want

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
if you want

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.350 
if you want
I've<00:04:55.720> actually<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.200> recommend<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.890> do

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
I've actually I recommend that you do

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.230 
I've actually I recommend that you do
and<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:59.380> make<00:04:59.590> sure<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.980> look<00:05:00.220> once<00:05:00.730> every<00:05:01.060> 5

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
and I make sure that I look once every 5

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.740 
and I make sure that I look once every 5
seconds<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:02.370> always<00:05:03.370> try<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.669> see<00:05:03.940> things<00:05:04.450> as

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
seconds I always try to see things as

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.570 
seconds I always try to see things as
shapes<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.500> know<00:05:05.620> both<00:05:05.830> when<00:05:06.100> you're<00:05:06.220> setting

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
shapes you know both when you're setting

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.880 
shapes you know both when you're setting
up<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.730> form<00:05:07.180> of<00:05:07.390> the<00:05:07.960> drawing<00:05:08.320> but

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
up the form of the drawing but

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.590 
up the form of the drawing but
especially<00:05:09.250> when<00:05:09.790> you're<00:05:09.970> doing<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.360> shading

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
especially when you're doing the shading

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.780 
especially when you're doing the shading
it's<00:05:11.290> really<00:05:11.680> important<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.310> remain<00:05:12.580> in<00:05:12.760> that

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
it's really important to remain in that

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.970 
it's really important to remain in that
habit<00:05:13.270> as<00:05:13.419> well<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:14.410> know<00:05:14.530> look<00:05:14.710> at<00:05:14.830> your

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
habit as well you know look at your

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.790 
habit as well you know look at your
reference<00:05:15.160> image<00:05:15.550> and<00:05:15.930> keep<00:05:16.930> comparing<00:05:17.410> see

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
reference image and keep comparing see

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.200 
reference image and keep comparing see
if<00:05:17.890> you<00:05:18.010> could<00:05:18.160> notice<00:05:18.900> nuances<00:05:19.900> of<00:05:20.110> shadows

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
if you could notice nuances of shadows

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.340 
if you could notice nuances of shadows
you<00:05:22.210> know<00:05:22.330> try<00:05:22.570> to<00:05:22.600> break<00:05:22.870> things<00:05:23.050> down<00:05:23.200> into

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
you know try to break things down into

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.340 
you know try to break things down into
shapes<00:05:23.860> as<00:05:24.070> much<00:05:24.580> as<00:05:24.760> possible<00:05:24.970> work<00:05:25.930> from<00:05:26.140> big

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
shapes as much as possible work from big

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.070 
shapes as much as possible work from big
shapes<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.890> small<00:05:27.160> shapes<00:05:28.350> very<00:05:29.350> important

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
shapes to small shapes very important

the lighting but when you use the
graphite<00:05:37.370> stick<00:05:37.700> like<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:37.940> do<00:05:38.650> you<00:05:39.650> know<00:05:39.740> and

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
graphite stick like I do you know and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.100 
graphite stick like I do you know and
that's<00:05:40.070> a<00:05:40.190> very<00:05:40.370> high<00:05:40.880> number<00:05:40.910> graphite<00:05:41.780> stick

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
that's a very high number graphite stick

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.140 
that's a very high number graphite stick
there<00:05:42.950> you<00:05:43.040> see<00:05:43.220> me<00:05:43.370> working<00:05:43.700> with<00:05:43.730> it<00:05:43.970> now
