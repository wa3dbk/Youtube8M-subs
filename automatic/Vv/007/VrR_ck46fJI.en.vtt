not gonna repeat this for all the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.640 
not gonna repeat this for all the
classes<00:02:27.180> because<00:02:27.330> that's<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.900> gonna<00:02:28.110> waste

a<00:02:28.830> lot<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.010> time<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:30.209> basically<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.630> sniper

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
a lot of time but basically a sniper

rifle it's not about your got a little
duty<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:34.950> about<00:02:35.160> your<00:02:35.310> positioning<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:36.060> your

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
think flanking is that the word know it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.330 
think flanking is that the word know it
how<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.100> use<00:02:41.489> cover<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.270> your<00:02:42.540> positioning

he's going to win that every time ok so
what<00:03:09.180> why<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.900> about<00:03:10.049> sniping<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.890> it

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
what why don't like about sniping is it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.370 
what why don't like about sniping is it
takes<00:03:11.880> away<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.330> fact<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.660> it's<00:03:13.019> all<00:03:13.200> about

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
takes away the fact that it's all about

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.039 
takes away the fact that it's all about
positioning<00:03:13.590> cover<00:03:14.510> all<00:03:15.510> these<00:03:15.690> crazy

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
positioning cover all these crazy

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.630 
positioning cover all these crazy
elements<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:16.799> probably<00:03:16.980> forgetting<00:03:17.160> one<00:03:17.519> of

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
elements I'm probably forgetting one of

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.470 
elements I'm probably forgetting one of
the<00:03:17.730> key<00:03:17.880> ones<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:19.230> basically<00:03:19.650> says<00:03:20.480> how

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
the key ones and it basically says how

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.570 
the key ones and it basically says how
well<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.290> remember<00:03:22.530> where<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:22.920> center

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
well can you remember where that center

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.360 
well can you remember where that center
of<00:03:23.610> your<00:03:23.850> screen<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.799> you<00:03:25.799> can<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.340> can

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
you go into this the skill skill I've

quartz<00:03:38.880> woo<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:40.650> skill<00:03:40.980> that's<00:03:41.250> involved<00:03:41.640> in

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
quartz woo the skill that's involved in

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.780 
quartz woo the skill that's involved in
sniping<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:43.380> not<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.890> skill<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.489> call<00:03:44.700> of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
sniping is not the skill that is call of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.170 
sniping is not the skill that is call of
duty<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.829> therefore<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:46.860> think<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.549> more<00:03:47.820> thus

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
duty and therefore I think it more thus

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.030 
duty and therefore I think it more thus
that's<00:03:48.810> why<00:03:48.989> I<00:03:49.019> don't<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.230> modern<00:03:49.560> fitted<00:03:49.769> in

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
that's why I don't like modern fitted in

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220 
that's why I don't like modern fitted in
black<00:03:50.340> ops<00:03:50.660> admittedly<00:03:51.660> it's<00:03:51.810> underpowered

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
black ops admittedly it's underpowered

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.009 
black ops admittedly it's underpowered
so<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.250> modern<00:03:53.489> warfare<00:03:53.519> free<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.209> think<00:03:54.660> there

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
so in modern warfare free I think there

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.330 
so in modern warfare free I think there
should<00:03:55.140> be<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.230> one-hit<00:03:55.470> sniper<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.190> one

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
should be a one-hit sniper this is one

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.460 
should be a one-hit sniper this is one
hand<00:03:56.579> you<00:03:56.640> in<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.820> body<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.900> they<00:03:58.049> should<00:03:58.260> get

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
hand you in the body but they should get

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.110 
hand you in the body but they should get
