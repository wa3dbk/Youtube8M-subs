hey gamers the red dragon here from
Venice<00:00:03.000> transcom<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.140> wanted<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.500> share

Venice transcom and I wanted to share
with<00:00:04.799> you<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.040> creation<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.759> made<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.210> halo

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
with you a creation that I made on halo

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.320 
with you a creation that I made on halo
reach<00:00:06.810> forge<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.529> call<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.610> crucible

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
reach forge I call this the crucible

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.970 
reach forge I call this the crucible
this<00:00:10.080> was<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:11.240> map<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.269> was<00:00:13.170> totally<00:00:13.620> inspired

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
this was a map that was totally inspired

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
this was a map that was totally inspired
just<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.269> building<00:00:15.269> blocks<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.900> started<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.470> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
just by building blocks I started with a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.950 
just by building blocks I started with a
floor<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.690> continually<00:00:18.690> built

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
floor and I just continually built

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.010 
floor and I just continually built
around<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.710> tried<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> create<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.330> math<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
around it I tried to create this math to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.140 
around it I tried to create this math to
be<00:00:22.140> as<00:00:22.320> even<00:00:22.710> as<00:00:22.830> possible<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.760> one

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
be as even as possible so that not one

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.939 
be as even as possible so that not one
team<00:00:24.390> has<00:00:24.630> advantage<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.720> map<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.320> large

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
team has advantage so this map is large

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.910 
team has advantage so this map is large
it<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.550> hold<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.179> 16<00:00:30.660> players<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.890> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it can hold up to 16 players you can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.299 
it can hold up to 16 players you can
play<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> lot<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> different<00:00:33.590> map<00:00:34.590> variations

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
play a lot of different map variations

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.370 
play a lot of different map variations
on<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.760> I'll<00:00:35.940> involve<00:00:36.360> capture<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> flag

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
on here I'll involve capture the flag

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.110 
on here I'll involve capture the flag
Slayer<00:00:37.890> etc<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.570> built<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> map<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.219> Bobby

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
Slayer etc we I built the map but Bobby

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.770 
Slayer etc we I built the map but Bobby
186<00:00:43.020> he<00:00:43.230> actually<00:00:44.180> took<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> time<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
186 he actually took the time to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.330 
186 he actually took the time to
actually<00:00:45.899> set<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> game<00:00:46.860> modes<00:00:47.129> on

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
actually set up all the game modes on

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
actually set up all the game modes on
there<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.420> you'll<00:00:48.570> notice<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.350> have

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
there so you'll notice that it does have

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.040 
there so you'll notice that it does have
a<00:00:49.620> few<00:00:49.920> vehicles<00:00:50.129> there's<00:00:50.640> no<00:00:50.820> air<00:00:51.390> vehicles

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a few vehicles there's no air vehicles

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.330 
a few vehicles there's no air vehicles
as<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.460> few<00:00:53.789> teleporters<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.280> there's<00:00:56.280> one

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
as a few teleporters on it there's one

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.119 
as a few teleporters on it there's one
and<00:00:57.020> here's<00:00:58.020> another<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> call<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and here's another one I call this the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
and here's another one I call this the
parking<00:00:59.640> garage<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.300> has<00:01:00.750> some<00:01:00.960> vehicles<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
parking garage it has some vehicles in

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.329 
parking garage it has some vehicles in
this<00:01:01.680> side<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:04.170> teleporters<00:01:04.920> they

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this side and these teleporters they

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
this side and these teleporters they
will<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.140> down<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.500> basement<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
will take you down to the basement and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.250 
will take you down to the basement and
as<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.299> there's<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> lot<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> different

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
as you see there's a lot of different

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.929 
as you see there's a lot of different
ways<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.340> basement<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
ways to get down into the basement I

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420 
ways to get down into the basement I
believe<00:01:12.780> there's<00:01:13.020> four<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.409> ways<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
believe there's four different ways the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.999
