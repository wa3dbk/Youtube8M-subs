00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.320
 very good guys, how are you doing? 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.440
 today I come with a video something special a 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.910
 video that is preceded because I'm 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.369
 making many comments in the wake 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.080
 of my 2014 video talking about the 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.349
 news there are many people who 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 ask for twitter especially what 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.789
 happens with the line is what will happen if 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.329
 the teams are going to have their names 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.160
 originals in see 2014 is there are a lot 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.599
 people who do not know well what it is that 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.899
 happens in this in this area and I want 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.270
 explain well I explain the licenses 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.399
 of the equipment you have to buy worth that 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.750
 you can put the name for example the 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.550
 chelsea that comes in the hollow is not 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.500
 can put chelsea fc and put the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.239
 official chelsea outfit 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.590
 can be done to do that you have to 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.050
 buy the license you do not have to talk 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.489
 with the chelsea in this case and buy in 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.140
 the license the chelsea puts the price and 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.899
 I had buy the license there are others in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.460
 other cases that you do not have to give to 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.960
 team with equipment ok I do not know if in the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.910
 English you have to do it like that but for 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.589
 example in the Spanish simply with a 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.720
 what he has done has been to talk to the 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.610
 federation of spain and the federation 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.020
 Spain has given him all the licenses of 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.890
 all the equipment that as you know this 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.960
 year 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.310
 13 have gotten all the children of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840
 the spanish league well that's because no 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.700
 has needed business never team 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 just talked to the federation the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240
 federation has put a price accordingly 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.640
 with all the equipment and the entire license 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.020
 for that they would be the league of spain but 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.850
 however in English I'm not very 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
 sure but I think that's the way you have to see 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.570
 with each team worth then each 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.070
 team puts your conditions what 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.310
 does this mean it means that 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.290
 for example, they have the license 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 I want to tell you that you can not put the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.920
 name as well because you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.360
 they would denounce vale is very obvious is a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.490
 very obvious thing but it seems there is 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.200
 many people who do not know yet 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.729
 then I do not English society is that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.740
 this case happens what we want to do 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.940
 never team but it's the same no no no 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.680
 I mean that what I want 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.710
 explain is that you can not put the 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.110
 name like that because you want there are 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.550
 than buying a license to equipment and 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.289
 pay you software west because you're 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.630
 exploiting your rights worth we are 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.190
 exploiting these thanks to your license and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.509
 thanks to your occupations you are 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.940
 getting had an economic benefit 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.470
 that means that it is not legal 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.769
 to the students you can not do that is 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.110
 well once explained this is by vale 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.280
 with fifa is the one that has bought this 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.050
 type of licenses 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.030
 if you notice obviously good 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.630
 fifa has all the license of all 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.880
 leagues even from leagues that are not known 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.500
 for nothing or are leagues that have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.470
 players that neither god knows well 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.050
 he has also bought them 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.190
 this wants this because it happens is because 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.080
 it's a much bigger company than 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.450
 konami has many games and has 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.000
 a lot more money than the company 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.940
 Japanese then what happens what happens 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.610
 well that is why in this case it has 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.650
 exclusive licenses 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.000
 what does the league mean, for example? 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.060
 German without going any further the German league 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.310
 can not even appear in the weight 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.540
 if you notice the German league does not appear 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.520
 simply appears Bayern Munich 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.740
 and the schalke in this case but they appear 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.180
 in separate leagues in leagues that are 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.160
 together with the rest of europe with others 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.870
 teams in Europe because they can not 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.460
 nor appear the German league them by 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.920
 has an exclusive contract with the league 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.050
 German until 2016 if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.580
 from a milk to 2015 2016 that directly 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.740
 is an exclusivity contract that 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.530
 prevents other companies in this case not 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.940
 there's more than just konami to name 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.800
 the league can not even make reference no 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.820
 they can invent the bear that would be 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.370
 illegal and they would have to pay a fine 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.620
 awesome so they fixed up what 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.750
 level reaches these people of as porn with 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.170
 the line is the same as they are 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.660
 a company from that one there is not 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.730
 a company there because they have a contract 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.800
 exclusive with all the input and set 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.690
 up to what level he 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.970
 it's all he has is the manchester 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.020
 united of license be set and now 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.239
 what happens is what is the problem 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.519
 konami could reach chelsea and 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.970
 I look at you tell hundred million 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.380
 euros 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.450
 the license imagine I do not know how much 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.280
 costing but what happens that is for 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.530
 off 20 for that same license now 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.300
 I will not pay triple or four 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.250
 times more complaints for the same 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.230
 license then that's what check 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.780
 backwards really that they can already 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.100
 has paid 20 and you have to pay 200 for 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.930
 same because they have a contract for 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.580
 exclusivity with others or is it 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.740
 say it's a pretty fat problem and already 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.360
 I tell you it's not going to be solved face 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.740
 but 1,014 would be very complicated 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.390
 I do not think it's time to solve 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.359
 because when they are very well tied 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.760
 the advertising of this game is brutal 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.550
 brutal and the only way to unseat 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.340
 I am telling you by doing a great game 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.590
 impressive and that although I put the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.870
 deep blue man or not we remember 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.240
 that you do not have a license to fix that 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.430
 konami to counter this has already 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.010
 announced and as I told you in my video of 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.990
 cutting information 14 the second one has already 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.600
 announced that the editor is going to renew 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.160
 completely so that this this shortage 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.930
 of licenses we can supply them with a 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.310
 full editor that we can change the 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.080
 pants that we can change the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.100
 means that we can change any 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.840
 thing for 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.060
 even if we do not have the license 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.410
 can edit it and so have as if 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.170
 we had the license then exactly 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.900
 so then this the licenses is a 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.580
 and very complex issue and I do not say as 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.310
 you are listening to me is a very very 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.040
 complex basically for that because she 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.460
 is based on the checkbook and offers both 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.870
 money to a team and contracts for 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.180
 exclusivity that prevent others 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.770
 companies negotiate with those teams 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.390
 this is simply the crux of the 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.590
 question then there are many people who 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.450
 says you do not say that konami does not have 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.880
 clear licenses because they have 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.030
 very well tied all the success of ace for 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.610
 in these last years in these 34 years 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.110
 it is not coincidence of our quality it 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.290
 has worked very well has worked very 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.480
 well and I 'm telling you regardless of 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.210
 how is your game publicized it 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.250
 He has carefully worked a lot and as you see has 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.720
 Spent money but heaps for 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.520
 get the licenses and no longer 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.650
 only get them but do 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.030
 exclusive contracts I do not know until what 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.950
 point to get to that maybe they get paid 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.030
 much more to have your accounts of 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.220
 exclusive I do not have even the most remote 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.529
 idea but note that not only is 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.929
 limited to buying the license but 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.129
 also makes exclusive contracts with 

00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:03.229
 these equipment so that they can not 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.789
 negotiate or negotiate with konami 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.819
 you can see to what level it arrives 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.289
 these people then clear konami will 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.929
 faces a very powerful company with 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.849
 a lot of pasta and I'm telling you to get 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:15.289
 the equipment licenses that never 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.599
 has had is very complicated very 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.499
 so complicated because so 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:23.389
 we have been saying and that I do not 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.059
 ask more this topic because ya 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.059
 I say with me he does not even know he's leaving 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:31.159
 to be able to have for this year for the year 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:32.629
 2014 for the pro 2014 not even 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.819
 with me knows what initiation to be able 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.799
 to be able to end up negotiating so 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:40.039
 imagine the crashes we already know hopefully 

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:41.779
 I hope you do not just do not have 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.829
 hopes for new licenses so 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:43.999
 less in regards to the league 

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:46.209
 english in regards to the league 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.209
 german 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.040
 and then we have the Dutch league that 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.310
 is licensed to the French league 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.170
 also the Italian 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.630
 the Spanish good as these will continue 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.640
 I hope that in the league of spain 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.020
 to follow being completely with 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.210
 all stages I hope so 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.610
 I imagine that they will have made a 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.200
 license for several years I imagine not in 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.580
 another unit but I hope I do hope 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.900
 that this one I hope the license to be 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.720
 keep it and do not lose it because 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.700
 previously agreed that the league of 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.320
 Spain came with false names like bread 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.930
 red for ace ones and things like that 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.400
 then they are licenses that have gone 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.630
 taking and losing time so 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.520
 let's see let's see what to put or 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.260
 anything but let's go more 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.820
 licenses do not have much hope 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.070
 because as you see them so it has very 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.750
 well tied up so I do not expect anything to be 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.730
 has become clear this issue if 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.260
 you need some more question if I 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.490
 ask something, I think it repeats 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.920
 much then in another video so that what 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.990
 you have everything clear and nothing says goodbye 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.030
 guys come I hope you've been left 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.970
 all very well clarified so that you know 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.390
 what is the whole subject of a salutary and 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.390
 until next time
