00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.320
 after you have decided that 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.779
 passive or something 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.110
 also always put me on medication 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.110
 not true 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.329
 in our society we believe that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.350
 we have to be happy if not 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.330
 we feel hopelessly miserable 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.710
 after taking the overdose 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 the heart has stopped 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.270
 The mechanism was simplified 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.190
 damaged the blood supply regulates and 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.070
 this is harming fear their version 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.910
 So I'm still quitting 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 maybe it's just about 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 weeks 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.590
 it's all about it 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.460
 to talk veronika 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.730
 I hate your stupid desk and 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.820
 i hate your ugly tie and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.470
 I hate everyone who is locked up here and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.380
 have the families of other patients 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.920
 over irregular 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.920
 weighted treatment methods 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.130
 did not feel better about it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.180
 do you think you are out there? 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.149
 less crazy than us what about him 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.630
 yes damn well you can talk with 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.630
 not him 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.940
 there is still so much that i do not care of 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.940
 I know 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.210
 some people see their whole 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.930
 live after a moment like you 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.930
 have experienced
