00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.970
 all our feet hello everyone 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.500
 guys as a base and welcome back to this 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 new press appointment of 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.920
 Monday the first series here on youtube 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.380
 italy that shows you how much it is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 quick and easy to print with a 3d 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:32.070
 printer acronym now guys you know it a 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.170
 me sometimes like to shoot open videos 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.410
 as happened in this case or in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.629
 this case in fact today I will print for 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 you an object that lends itself precisely 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.260
 be used outdoors some of 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.940
 you already know what I'm talking about 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 because they followed the live streaming 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.460
 on my second channel last Wednesday 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.620
 or have seen the highlights 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.210
 reloaded on this first channel if not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.739
 you are still subscribed to my second 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.320
 channel find the link description 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.020
 because every Wednesday at 9 pm there will be 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.690
 and there was a live streaming in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.000
 which carries out a project of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.540
 projects that I will present on this first 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 channel and I will bring you some advances 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.600
 talk we talk about more and less 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 then answer your questions 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.400
 all the nightmares my second channel 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.560
 to other social media and my newsletter 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.030
 find everything in description not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.049
 let's get lost in other chatter vi 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.049
 I immediately leave to the press 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.120
 as you will have a certain chapter covered by 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.340
 today or a boomerang 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.580
 not a boomerang with two arms but a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.400
 boomerang with three arms was printed 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.050
 this size is quite small 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.050
 as big as in the palm of my hand 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.259
 because precisely the maximum size of 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:00.100
 what to print on an axis of 15 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.950
 centimeters school other axis of 25 and 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.290
 so these 15 cm have limited me 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.450
 a lot seeing that it is this boomerang e 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.209
 a lot of small will be very difficult 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.730
 to throw and that's why the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.000
 3d model of this boomerang provided 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.670
 the addition of some pieces that in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.190
 this case are represented by gods 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.350
 cents precisely to increase 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.480
 inertia during the launch to do yes 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.390
 that the launch is successful 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.000
 But I decided to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.520
 make another boomerang of a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 another type is always three-armed however it has 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 a different shape as you can see 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.370
 how did I print this visa 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.430
 that there is not inside the printer 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 it is printed at once divided 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.350
 cut or cut the model by 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.890
 in pubs or cut into three parts it 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.680
 printed in three different prints and ho 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.400
 combined everything with a certificate and doing 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 be careful to keep the object well 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.770
 flat we hope that everything regulates and 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.450
 now let's go out see you guys later 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.180
 ok guys we're here at the ticino park 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.700
 to launch the boomerang 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.050
 I'm not an expert in launches of 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.019
 boomerang in fact I did a course 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.390
 accelerated a few days ago with some 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.700
 videos found on oil youtube 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.860
 always throw boomerangs like this 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.100
 so horizontally but how it explains 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.730
 also explained in Wednesday's live 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.769
 last the boomerang must be launched 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.700
 so with a corner 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.329
 towards one o'clock seeing it in this one 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.440
 direction 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:44.190
 towards one o'clock with an inclination of 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.850
 30 degree arm doing this 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.709
 arm movement like this and giving 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.560
 a final lash 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.290
 ok guys with the phone in hand then 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.870
 the other camera and the boom is now 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.090
 we move a little further into the field e 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.519
 we try to do some throwing me now 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.019
 you will see from there but above all from here 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.280
 room on board 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:11.850
 now the wind has disappeared, however, like vi 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.549
 I also said in the live the wind yes 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.829
 should hold towards the chest 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.239
 so if the wind comes from the tree 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.580
 I have to keep my chest 90 degrees e 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.490
 move the boomerang by 45 then 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.220
 pulled towards 45 degrees relative to the wind 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.440
 but now there is no wind and therefore 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.540
 we can pull in the direction 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.650
 in which we want I will pull will take how 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.170
 reference 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.670
 the tree always the usual but the arms 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:44.490
 back and then the boom is finally swerved e 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.210
 you can keep it that way here or 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.520
 so I keep it that way because it facilitates me 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.540
 more the release of the boomerang to the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.540
 end towards one load and spear 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.610
 the experiment has succeeded guys I have to 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.240
 just a little bit to improve the technique e 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.090
 handle the wind a little 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.710
 But let's say we're doing it 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.480
 some other launches and then we go to 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.510
 home 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.130
 the wind then returned 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:36.510
 we take a bit of scrub and 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.460
 actually the wind is in this 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.020
 direction here so we'll have to pull 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.980
 45 degrees then always towards tree 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.980
 we load and ask 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.690
 wants to our feet as always 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.250
 guys I hope the video is there 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.169
 liked to say that the experiment with 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.409
 pink boomerang has succeeded with full marks 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:07.199
 we hope to improve with the technique of 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.180
 flight if you want to print this too 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.250
 model I leave the link in the description 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.449
 as always I hope the video is there 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.159
 liked it and we'll see each other in a few 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.520
 day with a next video bye 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.520
 boys
