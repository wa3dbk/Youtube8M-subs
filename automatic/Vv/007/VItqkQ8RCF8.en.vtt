00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.680
 justice 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.609
 justice a single man 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
 the relief at the final tournament for the poor 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.509
 same time as the last time also ran but my dream 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.710
 Fewer people are heard 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.290
 so I'm in the company of thomas froome we passed ishares tests 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.069
 half past five if their corner if a customer is complete 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.770
 so by chewing my milla sector 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.490
 nobody on the right 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.270
 nobody left 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.900
 we have a part will go 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.150
 a little wider than the last time 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.520
 so hoping that to know rolled out 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.720
 so here you go 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.320
 we will see what it gives 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 to fear 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.720
 for me here is perreault puts in difficulty 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 benjamin general 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.740

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.270
 there are not everywhere it's what we called models to enter 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 we killed our cat with her after 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 here is shit 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 these memos the boat 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 good or not good tumbled full 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.760
 so 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 I'm fishing half is busy I'm going to die 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.200
 for now 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.650
 so here's a little more poker presentation where laurent stands for the 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 second time magnum 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
 in the bfi overview 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.790
 me but let's go here I did not care about the afp 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.910
 Muster Host Border 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 in euroleague syfy people friendship 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.049
 so during the night we had a debate 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.639
 funny of the air 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.639
 here is the time lends itself a little 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.969
 they want m he would have developed allows a little isolated results of the 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.599
 night to pass the hand 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.039
 to white love she was taking 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.939
 a pen stroke 5 1 on my homeland 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.369
 after corner 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.739
 dolphin of com narrator 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.409
 memorable 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 a little disgusted too 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.969
 so the cards as narbonne is not the sound 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.629
 difficult maybe the weather is overfished which brings for now in 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.909
 Africa and the market 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.559
 we must 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.559
 during yesterday's day stirred ermotti well 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:02.510
 general a fisherman has removed the golden palm is in small form to now 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.359
 she has the rating 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.469
 there are a lot of black sheep so 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:11.719
 we have one who left me a message on the same site ie 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.859
 his creed is no longer afraid 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.859
 eqtype ...% a few people who have gone 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.900
 contrary to morale and then we'll see 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.749
 next time but I think next time we'll be 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.279
 a little less motivated 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:28.669
 we will see 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.979
 the motivation is flat 

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.979
 so go hi 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.939
 we see there 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.189
 Before leaving 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.189
 paulo is going to be the case 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.309
 mostly 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.309
 pick up your trash 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.579
 my place indicated m 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:03.249
 the new note 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.049
 this season 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.159
 That's what happened 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.210
 what
