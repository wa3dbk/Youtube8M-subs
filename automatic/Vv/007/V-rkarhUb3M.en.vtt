00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
probably most famous by Eric Clapton on

probably most famous by Eric Clapton on
his<00:00:15.209> unplugged<00:00:15.930> CD<00:00:16.529> nobody<00:00:17.070> knows<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.640> when

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
his unplugged CD nobody knows you when

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.439 
his unplugged CD nobody knows you when
you're<00:00:18.210> down<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.690> out<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:20.210> fair<00:00:21.210> amount<00:00:21.420> of

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
you're down and out and fair amount of

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
you're down and out and fair amount of
course<00:00:21.690> in<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.199> but<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> figured<00:00:23.009> it

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
course in this one but I figured it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
course in this one but I figured it
would<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.189> worth<00:00:23.429> worth<00:00:24.029> looking<00:00:24.390> at<00:00:24.509> anyway

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
would be worth worth looking at anyway

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.169 
would be worth worth looking at anyway
so<00:00:25.169> it's<00:00:25.320> not<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> three<00:00:26.189> chord<00:00:26.460> guitar

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
so it's not really a three chord guitar

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:34.349 
so it's not really a three chord guitar
song<00:00:28.039> you'll<00:00:29.039> need<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.249> c<00:00:29.609> e<00:00:30.800> me<00:00:31.800> seven

chord<00:01:30.050> changes<00:01:30.560> where<00:01:30.800> you'll<00:01:30.950> have<00:01:31.190> several

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
chord changes where you'll have several

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.850 
chord changes where you'll have several
beats<00:01:31.880> on<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.119> same<00:01:32.420> chord<00:01:32.780> before<00:01:33.410> you<00:01:33.679> go<00:01:33.800> to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
beats on the same chord before you go to

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.450 
beats on the same chord before you go to
the<00:01:34.070> next<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:35.270> this<00:01:35.390> particular<00:01:35.539> song

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
the next one in this particular song

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.669 
the next one in this particular song
it's<00:01:37.460> pretty<00:01:37.820> much<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:38.750> chord<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.080> beat<00:01:39.380> and

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's pretty much one chord for beat and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.499 
it's pretty much one chord for beat and
most<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.340> so<00:01:40.460> that's<00:01:40.580> going<00:01:40.789> to<00:01:40.850> require<00:01:41.000> if

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
most of it so that's going to require if

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.779 
most of it so that's going to require if
you're<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> newer<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.679> guitar<00:01:43.070> for<00:01:43.429> you<00:01:43.580> to

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
you're a newer to the guitar for you to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.430 
you're a newer to the guitar for you to
sort<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.300> take<00:01:44.420> your<00:01:44.570> time<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:45.080> get<00:01:45.319> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
sort of take your time to get the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.469 
sort of take your time to get the
transitions<00:01:46.009> down<00:01:46.250> for<00:01:46.819> example<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.270> first

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
transitions down for example the first

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.889 
transitions down for example the first
line<00:01:47.750> goes<00:01:48.050> from<00:01:48.259> C<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.940> e7<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.679> to<00:01:51.679> a7<00:01:52.899> so

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
line goes from C to e7 to a to a7 so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.169 
line goes from C to e7 to a to a7 so
until<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.259> a7<00:01:54.710> comes<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.250> it's<00:01:55.580> one<00:01:55.880> chord

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
until the a7 comes around it's one chord

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.940 
until the a7 comes around it's one chord
for<00:01:56.240> beat<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.530> may<00:01:57.619> be<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.770> bit

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
for beat so that may be a bit

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.160 
for beat so that may be a bit
challenging<00:01:58.099> at<00:01:58.459> first<00:01:58.489> but<00:01:58.880> we<00:01:59.840> both<00:01:59.959> know

challenging at first but we both know

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.630 
challenging at first but we both know
you<00:02:00.229> can<00:02:00.440> do<00:02:02.349> so<00:02:03.349> starts<00:02:03.619> in<00:02:03.709> C<00:02:03.950> once<00:02:04.729> I<00:02:05.060> live<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
first twenty ten years that I played and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.210 
first twenty ten years that I played and
found<00:02:41.480> some<00:02:41.720> very<00:02:41.989> inventive<00:02:42.319> ways<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.860> work

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
found some very inventive ways to work

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.070 
found some very inventive ways to work
around<00:02:43.370> having<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.090> do<00:02:44.299> an<00:02:44.480> F<00:02:44.599> chord<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:44.989> you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
around having to do an F chord but you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.330 
around having to do an F chord but you
know<00:02:45.170> what<00:02:45.349> comes<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.650> day<00:02:45.769> when<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.160> have

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
know what comes a day when you just have

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.729 
know what comes a day when you just have
to<00:02:46.459> do<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.360> what<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> learned<00:02:48.110> as<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.470> quick

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
to do it so what I learned as a quick

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.009 
to do it so what I learned as a quick
trick<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.910> I<00:02:49.940> have<00:02:50.239> to<00:02:50.360> look<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:50.660> anchor

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
trick is that I have to look for anchor

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.350 
trick is that I have to look for anchor
fingers<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.739> by<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.489> mean<00:02:52.579> is<00:02:52.970> fingers

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
fingers and by that I mean is fingers

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.890 
fingers and by that I mean is fingers
that<00:02:53.480> don't<00:02:53.690> change<00:02:54.170> position<00:02:55.099> or<00:02:55.310> fret<00:02:56.090> from

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
that don't change position or fret from

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.809 
that don't change position or fret from
one<00:02:57.290> chord<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.739> whatever<00:02:58.010> chord<00:02:58.400> is<00:02:58.489> before

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
one chord to whatever chord is before

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.819 
one chord to whatever chord is before
the<00:02:58.910> F<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.540> F<00:02:59.660> chord<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:00.260> is<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.650> this

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
the F to the F chord so it is in this

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.009 
the F to the F chord so it is in this
example<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:02.060> gonna<00:03:02.269> be<00:03:02.420> my<00:03:02.540> Johnny<00:03:02.780> Cash

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.979 
example that's gonna be my Johnny Cash

finger because I go from a D minor to an
F<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:08.209> may<00:03:08.329> notice<00:03:08.630> that<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:08.870> finger<00:03:09.110> has

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
F you may notice that this finger has

okay it's in the same exact fret
position<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:18.639> so<00:03:19.639> I'm<00:03:19.730> gonna<00:03:19.880> use<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.389> finger

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
position so so I'm gonna use that finger

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.379 
position so so I'm gonna use that finger
to<00:03:20.810> anchor<00:03:21.319> my<00:03:21.500> hand<00:03:21.799> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> neck<00:03:22.310> okay<00:03:22.819> and

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
go from one to the other it helps me

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.690 
go from one to the other it helps me
with<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.930> grip<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.859> helps<00:03:28.130> me<00:03:28.310> get<00:03:28.489> there

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
with the grip it helps me get there

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.870 
with the grip it helps me get there
easier<00:03:29.150> better<00:03:29.630> balance<00:03:30.170> with<00:03:30.639> more<00:03:31.639> power

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
easier better balance with more power

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.580 
easier better balance with more power
which<00:03:32.299> means<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.690> my<00:03:32.870> F<00:03:32.989> chord<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.350> actually

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
which means that my F chord is actually

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.710 
which means that my F chord is actually
gonna<00:03:33.739> sound<00:03:33.980> like<00:03:34.130> an<00:03:34.280> F<00:03:34.400> chord<00:03:34.430> as<00:03:35.359> opposed

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
gonna sound like an F chord as opposed

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.330 
gonna sound like an F chord as opposed

to this muffle mess that I usually end
up<00:03:37.430> with<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.750> don't<00:03:39.440> know<00:03:39.500> if<00:03:39.560> that's
