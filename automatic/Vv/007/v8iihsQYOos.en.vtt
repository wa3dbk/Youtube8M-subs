00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
 Do you dare to drink? Water filled with emerging pollutants! 

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.709
 Our clean water source has been polluted because of human activities. 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.289
 As the Earth's population grows, the use of chemicals is becoming more frequent, and emerging pollutants inevitably enter the water. 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.860
 The source of pollution comes from agriculture, industry and our homes. 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.150
 Take a look at the most common and familiar sources of pollution - our home 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 Emerging pollutants are derived from everyday products. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.149
 For example: washing powder, personal care products and drugs. 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.629
 When we use or process these things, the residue is flushed to the drain along with the sewage. 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.729
 When producing daily necessities, the factory releases chemicals into the air and water. 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.799
 Exhaust from the car will increase the pollutants in the air and eventually enter the water through the cycle. 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.789
 Fertilizers and pesticides used in the production of food are another major source of emerging pollutants. 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.549
 The pollutants produced by these activities are ultimately left in the water source. 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.340
 Since the sewage treatment equipment can purify the sewage, 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.531
 Most of the contaminants can be filtered out before being released into the natural environment. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.590
 Furthermore, our drinking water will also be filtered. 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.369
 Because we have been using new drugs and personal care products, 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.039
 This has led to the continuous entry of new pollutants into water resources. 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:40.030
 However, some existing pollutants cannot be completely removed through existing filtration technology, so trace amounts of emerging pollutants will remain in drinking water and the environment. 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.229
 At present, there are very few emerging pollutants in the water in the environment. 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.520
 But still in a safe and drinkable range. Drinking water may be harmed in the future. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.549
 Until now, 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.499
 We are still unclear about the dangers and effects of emerging pollutants on humans or the environment. 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.310
 In particular, there has not been enough research on the possible effects of long-term and mixed conditions. 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 Corresponding to emerging pollutants, there are two major directions that need to be resolved in a two-pronged approach. 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 First, personal consumption habits must change, and everyone must work to reduce the amount of chemical products. 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.390
 Second, we need an effective way to remove emerging pollutants that inevitably enter the water. 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.940
 Innovative technologies that remove emerging pollutants are being studied, 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.380
 But further actual testing is needed. 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.990
 This technology has been mentioned in research projects in several European countries. 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.940
 This innovative technology is a reference to natural purification models to filter emerging pollutants. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.450
 For example, using a ceramic filter or a method of simulating soil to purify groundwater, 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.670
 It also helps to strengthen traditional sewage treatment technologies. 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.430
 Other techniques can also use ozone, hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet light to destroy contaminants. 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.540
 Combined with the above technology, the emerging pollutants can be removed to the utmost extent. 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.980
 Although it is expensive to purchase advanced processing equipment, 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.440
 But this investment can reduce the long-term hazards we ignore today. 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.230
 It is everyone's right to have clean and safe drinking water, and it is everyone's responsibility to maintain it. 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.410
 Be positive, take the initiative to ask local water supply agencies, 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.920
 Is the water you use contaminated with emerging pollutants? 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.000
 Your concern for water can cause changes in water supply agencies. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.830
 Entice them to use innovative technology. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
