00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 hi friends continuing the topic of the previous one 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 video wanna show you another option 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.470
 mating the bottom harness with 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.910
 using a rope and for this we take three 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.880
 three and a half meters of rope or ribbon 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.880
 add it in half and take 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.750
 I'll start knitting on the left side placing 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.670
 mid rope yourself on the left side 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.180
 and your around the belt then without shifting 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.630
 ropes from this place place the rope 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.630
 right in front of you now attack wrapped 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:24.119
 rope three times i think will 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.510
 enough to fasten on his belt 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.750
 We've got two of these here is the end of them 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.750
 drop down and skip between the legs 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 now the right part of the rope we can on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.770
 right side left to left side then 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.930
 right side 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.790
 skip bottom subscription rope below 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.880
 in the same way 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.360
 do and on the left side 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
 letting the bottom 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.530
 in this way we now need 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.580
 secure this stretch of rope for this 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.380
 let's say our running end is down 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.530
 skip it below 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.830
 This rope will turn out such here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 loop here yes we will miss our undercarriage 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890
 end 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.630
 and then watch 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.190
 on the running end was parallel to the spring 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 rope now on the left side doing 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 we let it down too we skip it 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.120
 under the rope and skip to the loop 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.670
 we got two of these 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.409
 the end we started to knit on the left side 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.950
 as you noticed we have left left end 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.849
 ropes 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.670
 shorter than the right one did it 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:09.799
 to tie a right angle 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.799
 these ends are on the left side 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:20.030
 what do we do often 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:22.969
 tie a knot here take the rest here 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 these tails should be shorter and you 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:30.500
 should tie here on the left side 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.140
 control nodes so they don't you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.629
 interfered as I have a long rope 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.290
 I'll come up with something here now 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.290
 so that it does not interfere 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.870
 I see counter 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.870
 if the rope to itself 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 it was all done in order to 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.660
 work with a rope if you're right handed you 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.160
 nothing hindered here 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.470
 now take this section of the rope 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:14.190
 and this one and connect them carbines 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:19.769
 carabiner will post for its part this 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:22.770
 the coupling here we got the bottom 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.460
 safety system do not forget about that 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.030
 that it will all be very painful since 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.040
 this is a thin rope thanks for watching
