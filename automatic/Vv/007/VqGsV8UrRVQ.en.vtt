forearms here it's gonna tell us a
little<00:00:24.349> bit<00:00:24.500> about<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.800> suppressor<00:00:25.310> rail

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
little bit about the suppressor rail

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.359 
little bit about the suppressor rail
system<00:00:26.240> yeah<00:00:27.020> well<00:00:27.350> we've<00:00:27.530> worked<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:28.280> a

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
system yeah well we've worked it's a

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.920 
system yeah well we've worked it's a
collaborative<00:00:28.640> project<00:00:29.270> with<00:00:29.330> rat<00:00:29.660> works

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
collaborative project with rat works

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.400 
collaborative project with rat works
it's<00:00:30.800> called<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.220> rat<00:00:31.460> works<00:00:31.730> zxr<00:00:32.510> suppressor

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
it's called the rat works zxr suppressor

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.470 
it's called the rat works zxr suppressor
and<00:00:34.120> basically<00:00:35.120> what<00:00:35.300> it<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:35.420> is<00:00:36.080> for<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.739> tour

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
and basically what it is is for the tour

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.790 
and basically what it is is for the tour
they<00:00:38.480> make<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.750> 9<00:00:38.900> millimeter<00:00:39.110> kits<00:00:39.590> right

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
they make the 9 millimeter kits right

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.100 
they make the 9 millimeter kits right
now<00:00:40.040> but<00:00:40.970> we<00:00:41.089> were<00:00:41.210> looking<00:00:41.479> for<00:00:41.659> a<00:00:41.690> better<00:00:41.960> way

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
now but we were looking for a better way

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.229 
now but we were looking for a better way
to<00:00:42.140> do<00:00:42.710> suppressor<00:00:43.519> with<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:43.909> where<00:00:44.120> it's

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
to do suppressor with that where it's

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.790 
to do suppressor with that where it's
not<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:44.540> long<00:00:44.809> but<00:00:45.170> still<00:00:45.320> get<00:00:45.530> a<00:00:45.559> lot<00:00:45.710> of

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
not this long but still get a lot of

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.369 
not this long but still get a lot of
value<00:00:46.300> stuff<00:00:47.300> like<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:47.960> we<00:00:48.050> can<00:00:48.170> get<00:00:48.260> it

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
value stuff like that so we can get it

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.750 
value stuff like that so we can get it
sound<00:00:48.800> save<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.940> anyhow<00:00:50.629> we<00:00:51.339> we<00:00:52.339> have<00:00:52.460> our<00:00:52.550> rail

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
sound save so anyhow we we have our rail

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.670 
sound save so anyhow we we have our rail
system<00:00:52.790> here<00:00:53.449> this<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.839> normally<00:00:54.320> called<00:00:54.500> the

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
system here this is normally called the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.430 
system here this is normally called the
rat<00:00:54.799> works<00:00:55.360> commander<00:00:56.360> or<00:00:56.989> I'm<00:00:57.080> sorry<00:00:57.229> the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
rat works commander or I'm sorry the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.430 
rat works commander or I'm sorry the
manticore<00:00:58.339> arms<00:00:58.760> commander<00:00:59.360> length<00:00:59.870> rail<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
manticore arms commander length rail and

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.200 
manticore arms commander length rail and
you<00:01:00.500> can<00:01:00.620> see<00:01:00.769> it's<00:01:00.949> solid<00:01:01.370> on<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.549> sides<00:01:01.790> here

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
you can see it's solid on the sides here

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.990 
you can see it's solid on the sides here
and<00:01:02.330> this<00:01:03.049> basically<00:01:03.440> acts<00:01:03.710> acts<00:01:04.220> as<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.640> body

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
and this basically acts acts as the body

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.020 
and this basically acts acts as the body
of<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.770> suppressor<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:06.979> then<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:07.880> we've

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
of the suppressor and then here we've

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.850 
of the suppressor and then here we've
actually<00:01:08.210> got<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.810> core<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.350> goes<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.710> it

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
actually got the core that goes in it

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.000 
actually got the core that goes in it
and<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.280> can<00:01:10.400> see<00:01:10.960> right<00:01:11.960> here<00:01:12.020> we're

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
and you can see right here we're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.890 
and you can see right here we're
actually<00:01:13.100> using<00:01:13.430> a<00:01:13.850> muzzle<00:01:14.480> brake<00:01:14.510> that

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
actually using a muzzle brake that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.400 
actually using a muzzle brake that
they've<00:01:15.140> developed<00:01:15.470> as<00:01:16.010> a<00:01:16.630> blast<00:01:17.630> baffle<00:01:18.140> for

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
they've developed as a blast baffle for

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.530 
they've developed as a blast baffle for
it<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.740> what<00:01:18.860> happens<00:01:19.160> is<00:01:19.310> that<00:01:19.340> goes<00:01:19.700> in<00:01:20.000> this

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
it so what happens is that goes in this

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.790 
it so what happens is that goes in this
actually<00:01:20.840> will<00:01:20.930> thread<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.410> barrel<00:01:21.710> of

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
actually will thread on the barrel of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.670 
actually will thread on the barrel of
your<00:01:21.830> 9<00:01:22.070> millimeter<00:01:22.490> tube<00:01:22.730> or<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.960> drops<00:01:24.290> in

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
your 9 millimeter tube or that drops in

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.290 
your 9 millimeter tube or that drops in
and<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.010> can<00:01:25.250> see<00:01:25.460> how<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.640> works

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
and you can see how that works

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.330 
and you can see how that works
and<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.710> slides<00:01:28.160> in<00:01:29.440> like<00:01:30.440> that<00:01:30.650> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
and then it slides in like that and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.400 
and then it slides in like that and
normally<00:01:32.180> we<00:01:32.300> would<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.840> these<00:01:32.990> holes<00:01:33.200> on

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
normally we would with these holes on

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.350 
normally we would with these holes on
the<00:01:33.530> top<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:34.040> had<00:01:34.160> mount<00:01:34.400> our<00:01:34.580> light<00:01:34.820> ring<00:01:35.120> or

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the top we had mount our light ring or

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.120 
the top we had mount our light ring or
some<00:01:35.540> other<00:01:35.660> accessories<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.680> that's

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
some other accessories and that's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.160 
some other accessories and that's
actually<00:01:37.370> will<00:01:37.910> run<00:01:38.090> two<00:01:38.240> screws<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:39.050> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually will run two screws in here to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.750 
actually will run two screws in here to
hold<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.470> suppressor<00:01:39.980> core<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.370> so<00:01:40.610> when

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
hold that suppressor core in so when

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.570 
hold that suppressor core in so when
it's<00:01:40.910> done<00:01:41.590> got<00:01:42.590> karke<00:01:42.800> light<00:01:43.040> rail<00:01:43.250> on<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
it's done got karke light rail on the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.950 
it's done got karke light rail on the
back<00:01:43.730> it's<00:01:44.030> basically<00:01:44.330> our<00:01:44.420> normal<00:01:44.840> rail

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
back it's basically our normal rail

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.020 
back it's basically our normal rail
system<00:01:45.410> here<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.920> in<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.280> front<00:01:46.580> that's<00:01:46.850> your

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
system here and in the front that's your

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.270 
system here and in the front that's your
suppressor<00:01:47.630> its

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
suppressor its

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.780 
suppressor its
hearing<00:01:50.030> safe<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.690> shoot<00:01:50.930> only<00:01:51.830> ads<00:01:52.040> you<00:01:52.730> know

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
hearing safe to shoot only ads you know

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.550 
hearing safe to shoot only ads you know
this<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.060> three<00:01:53.330> inches<00:01:53.630> here<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.380> that's

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
this is three inches here and that's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.560 
this is three inches here and that's
four<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:55.400> you're<00:01:55.550> really<00:01:55.760> with<00:01:56.480> the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
four here so you're really with the

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.670 
four here so you're really with the
barrel<00:01:56.810> length<00:01:56.900> you're<00:01:57.140> only<00:01:57.230> adding<00:01:57.380> about

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
barrel length you're only adding about

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.200 
barrel length you're only adding about
four<00:01:57.950> inches<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.490> overall<00:01:58.580> length<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:59.150> the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
four inches to the overall length of the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930 
four inches to the overall length of the
weapon<00:01:59.320> and<00:02:00.320> works<00:02:01.160> really<00:02:01.340> well<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:01.760> know<00:02:01.850> we

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
weapon and works really well you know we

III model you know or they have anything
in<00:03:55.910> mind<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.360> without<00:03:57.260> saying<00:03:57.470> we're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
in mind like that without saying we're

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.200 
in mind like that without saying we're
doing<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.340> yeah<00:03:58.550> there's<00:03:58.730> been<00:03:58.850> lots<00:03:59.090> of

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
doing it yeah there's been lots of

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.510 
doing it yeah there's been lots of
thoughts<00:03:59.450> on<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.470> main<00:04:00.950> difference<00:04:01.400> is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.910 
thoughts on it the main difference is
just<00:04:01.760> looking<00:04:02.120> at<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:03.260> aluminum<00:04:03.710> walls

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
just looking at it the aluminum walls

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.520 
just looking at it the aluminum walls
with<00:04:04.460> a<00:04:04.490> nine<00:04:05.210> millimeter<00:04:05.450> it's<00:04:05.900> it's<00:04:06.200> easier

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
with a nine millimeter it's it's easier

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.199 
with a nine millimeter it's it's easier
to<00:04:06.620> do<00:04:06.770> that<00:04:06.920> we're<00:04:07.160> gonna<00:04:07.220> look<00:04:07.550> at<00:04:07.790> some

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
to do that we're gonna look at some

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.380 
to do that we're gonna look at some
other<00:04:08.390> ways<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.110> do<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.709> or<00:04:10.610> to<00:04:10.760> do<00:04:10.910> three<00:04:11.180> so

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
other ways to do it or to do three so

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.790 
other ways to do it or to do three so
it's<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.630> bit<00:04:12.020> of<00:04:12.050> a<00:04:12.170> different<00:04:12.470> ends<00:04:12.709> of

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
it's a bit of a different ends of

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.870 
it's a bit of a different ends of
