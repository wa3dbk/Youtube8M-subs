this is one I like this is a cotton burr
compost<00:00:28.920> has<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> lot<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.060> biological<00:00:30.289> activity

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
compost has a lot of biological activity

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.650 
compost has a lot of biological activity
in<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> lot<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> nutrients<00:00:32.640> another<00:00:33.480> one

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.630 
that I like to use for compost tea is
maybe<00:00:37.170> even<00:00:37.469> more<00:00:37.649> concentrated<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.430> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
maybe even more concentrated this is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.540 
maybe even more concentrated this is
earthworm<00:00:39.140> castings<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.770> yes<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that's really full of life because then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
that's really full of life because then
our<00:00:56.280> compost<00:00:57.000> tea<00:00:57.149> will<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.420> full<00:00:57.600> life<00:00:57.899> at

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
our compost tea will be full life at

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860 
our compost tea will be full life at
home<00:00:58.590> use<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> five-gallon<00:00:59.730> bucket<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
home use a five-gallon bucket like this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.850 
home use a five-gallon bucket like this
and<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:02.010> put<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.730> quart<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.860> compost

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and we put in about a quart of compost

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.810 
and we put in about a quart of compost
into<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> water<00:01:07.100> now<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
into the water now you can do about it

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.820 
into the water now you can do about it
but<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.270> recommend<00:01:09.600> highly<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> next<00:01:10.530> thing

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
but I recommend highly the next thing

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.920 
but I recommend highly the next thing
that<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.310> need<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.850> pump<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that you need is a pump and this is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
that you need is a pump and this is
where<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.400> make<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> compost<00:01:15.330> tea

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
where you really make the compost tea

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
where you really make the compost tea
special<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> pump<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.790> an<00:01:18.030> aquarium

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
special get a pump from an aquarium

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.140 
special get a pump from an aquarium
store<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> tube<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.369> stones

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
store with a tube one of these stones

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.310 
store with a tube one of these stones
and<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.860> compost<00:01:23.130> tea<00:01:24.080> stir<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and put it in the compost tea stir it up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.160 
and put it in the compost tea stir it up
a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.710> better<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.250> well<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.990> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a little bit better as well to really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.480 
a little bit better as well to really
see<00:01:28.380> what's<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.310> more

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
see what's going on a little more

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
see what's going on a little more
clearly<00:01:29.939> let's<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.810> glass<00:01:31.200> bowl

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
clearly let's do it in this glass bowl

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
clearly let's do it in this glass bowl
and<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.070> we'll<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.030> handful<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:35.090> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and this time we'll use a handful of the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.700 
and this time we'll use a handful of the
earthworm<00:01:36.479> castings<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.320> five-gallon

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
earthworm castings in a five-gallon

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
earthworm castings in a five-gallon
bucket<00:01:38.189> we'd<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.579> use<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> quart<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
bucket we'd still use a quart but in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.609 
bucket we'd still use a quart but in
this<00:01:39.570> container<00:01:39.930> we'll<00:01:40.170> use<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.439> bit

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this container we'll use a little bit

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.050 
this container we'll use a little bit
less<00:01:41.390> stir<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.600> first

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
less stir it up first

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
less stir it up first
again<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.240> could<00:01:45.390> leave<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.229> 24<00:01:46.799> hours

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
again you could leave this for 24 hours

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
again you could leave this for 24 hours
in<00:01:47.369> big<00:01:47.610> good<00:01:47.790> compost<00:01:48.329> tea<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.799> be

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
in big good compost tea it will just be

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.090 
in big good compost tea it will just be
much<00:01:50.549> better<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.840> add<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> oxygen<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:52.950> we

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
much better if we add the oxygen if we

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
much better if we add the oxygen if we
aerate<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.759> you'll<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.090> able<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> little

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
aerate it you'll be able to see a little

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.469 
aerate it you'll be able to see a little
more<00:01:54.869> clearly<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.649> aeration<00:01:56.189> works<00:01:56.610> now

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
more clearly how the aeration works now

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
more clearly how the aeration works now
to<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> compost<00:01:58.380> tea<00:01:58.649> even<00:01:58.890> more

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399

first<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.950> all<00:03:11.099> we<00:03:11.370> use<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.700> as<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:11.879> liquid

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
first of all we use it as a liquid

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.420 
first of all we use it as a liquid
fertilizer<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.019> foliar<00:03:13.560> feed<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.220> means

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
fertilizer and foliar feed it that means

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.750 
fertilizer and foliar feed it that means
that<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.299> fertilizer<00:03:15.599> value<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.919> right
