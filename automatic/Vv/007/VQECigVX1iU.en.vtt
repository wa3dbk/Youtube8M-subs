alright<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.140> down<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> bottom<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.100> says

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
alright so down at the bottom it says

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.819 
alright so down at the bottom it says
because<00:01:48.030> there's<00:01:48.240> our<00:01:48.360> 52<00:01:48.869> grams<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> protein

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
because there's our 52 grams of protein

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.830 
because there's our 52 grams of protein
32<00:01:50.729> grams<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.450> BCAAs<00:01:52.350> plus<00:01:52.820> EAS<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> glutamine

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
32 grams of BCAAs plus EAS and glutamine

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
32 grams of BCAAs plus EAS and glutamine
so<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> guys<00:01:55.530> should<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:55.979> know<00:01:56.369> and

so as you guys should probably know and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.590 
so as you guys should probably know and
l-glutamine

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
l-glutamine

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
l-glutamine
is<00:01:57.659> used<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.320> recovery<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.219> set<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
is used for recovery and on set the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.840 
is used for recovery and on set the
BCAAs<00:02:00.450> also<00:02:01.259> includes<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.950> month<00:02:02.219> hours<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
BCAAs also includes a month hours and a

BCAAs also includes a month hours and a
sixty<00:02:03.360> calories<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.100> this<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.310> where<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.909> very
