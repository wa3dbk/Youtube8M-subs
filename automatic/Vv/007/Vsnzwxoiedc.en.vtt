00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.089 
your top everybody who's watching and if
you<00:02:46.879> dig<00:02:47.209> around<00:02:47.239> there<00:02:47.840> you'll<00:02:48.140> find<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.769> big

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
you dig around there you'll find a big

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.030 
you dig around there you'll find a big
bowl<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.480> he<00:02:50.659> kept<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.290> top<00:02:51.470> of<00:02:51.620> his<00:02:51.769> bow

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040

on his desk

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.600 
on his desk

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.039 
I reckon that was the most valuable
thing<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.239> was<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.390> bit<00:02:56.690> of<00:02:56.840> his<00:02:57.019> own

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
thing because it was a bit of his own

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.009 
thing because it was a bit of his own
