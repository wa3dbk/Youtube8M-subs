00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.149 
out with pencil or anything I went
straight<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.180> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.140> crayons<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.890> sketch

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
straight in with the crayons and sketch

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.230 
straight in with the crayons and sketch
with<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> crayons

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
with the crayons

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
with the crayons
I<00:01:42.500> used<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:44.430> Strathmore<00:01:44.880> drawing<00:01:45.540> paper

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
I used some Strathmore drawing paper

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.880 
I used some Strathmore drawing paper
because<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.229> heard<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.560> supposed<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
because I heard it's supposed to be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
because I heard it's supposed to be
really<00:01:47.189> good<00:01:47.340> for<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.579> prismacolor<00:01:48.149> pencils

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
really good for like prismacolor pencils

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.609 
really good for like prismacolor pencils
so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> thought<00:01:50.299> like<00:01:51.299> crayons<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.049> wax<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
so I thought like crayons or wax and the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.980 
so I thought like crayons or wax and the
prismacolor<00:01:52.979> wax<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> means<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.750> paper

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
prismacolor wax so that means this paper

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
prismacolor wax so that means this paper
must<00:01:55.289> be<00:01:55.470> good<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.649> kraton<00:01:56.189> -<00:01:56.310> -<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> kind

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
must be good with kraton - - and it kind

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
must be good with kraton - - and it kind
