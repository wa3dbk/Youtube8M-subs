00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.420 
of access okay so I don't disagree that

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.700 
of access okay so I don't disagree that
access<00:07:22.900> can<00:07:23.140> add<00:07:23.290> color<00:07:23.590> to<00:07:23.940> what<00:07:24.940> continent

why did you do that what was the

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.180
