00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
good job with the articulation on this

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.190 
good job with the articulation on this
figure<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.000> simple<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> know<00:00:42.930> there's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
figure it's simple but you know there's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
figure it's simple but you know there's
no<00:00:43.320> problems<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> joints<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.760> at<00:00:44.879> his

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
no problems with the joints and at his

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.540 
no problems with the joints and at his
leg<00:00:45.059> joints<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.100> nice<00:00:47.309> they're

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
leg joints you know it's nice they're

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.740 
leg joints you know it's nice they're
articulated<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.120> they<00:00:48.180> don't<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.420> matter

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
articulated but they don't really matter

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.350 
articulated but they don't really matter
because<00:00:49.320> there's<00:00:50.070> only<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.489> real<00:00:51.000> stance

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
because there's only one real stance

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
because there's only one real stance
that<00:00:51.539> allows<00:00:51.840> him<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.110> stand<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.309> let's<00:00:53.699> take

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that allows him to stand but let's take

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
that allows him to stand but let's take
a<00:00:53.879> closer<00:00:54.180> look<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.870> his<00:00:55.260> surface<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
a closer look at his surface because I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.319 
a closer look at his surface because I
think<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.520> good<00:00:56.789> job<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.210> only

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
think I did a really good job not only

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.939 
think I did a really good job not only
with<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> texture<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.230> sculpting<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

painted little black highlights that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.010 
painted little black highlights that
kind<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> give<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.210> surface<00:01:06.540> impression

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
kind of give the the surface impression

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.260

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
of an avocado and that little use of
black<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.080> also

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890

collectors<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> think<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
collectors and I think this is one of

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.940 
collectors and I think this is one of
the<00:02:01.590> rare<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.430> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.649> applies<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the rare kind that kind of applies to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
the rare kind that kind of applies to
both<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> commend<00:02:07.020> mezco<00:02:07.439> for

as<00:02:19.349> an<00:02:19.530> adult<00:02:19.739> collector<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> think<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.790> sculpt

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
as an adult collector I think the sculpt

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.940 
as an adult collector I think the sculpt
and<00:02:21.329> the<00:02:21.390> paint<00:02:21.629> on<00:02:21.719> this<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.079> pretty<00:02:22.469> good<00:02:22.709> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and the paint on this is pretty good I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.830 
and the paint on this is pretty good I
find<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.879> some<00:02:23.909> action<00:02:24.329> figures<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
find with some action figures with the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020 
find with some action figures with the
legs<00:02:25.140> sculpted<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.859> bent<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.579> straight<00:02:26.879> leg

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
legs sculpted and bent and straight leg

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.759 
legs sculpted and bent and straight leg
positions<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.569> this<00:02:27.810> they<00:02:28.319> can<00:02:28.379> be<00:02:28.530> kind<00:02:28.739> of

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
positions like this they can be kind of

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.990 
positions like this they can be kind of
hard<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> balance<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.579> think<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.849> great

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
hard to balance so I think it's great

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
hard to balance so I think it's great
that<00:02:30.060> they<00:02:30.239> included<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.810> figure<00:02:31.079> stand<00:02:31.379> but<00:02:31.950> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that they included a figure stand but I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
that they included a figure stand but I
also<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.430> great<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.700> figure

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
also think it's great this figure

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880 
also think it's great this figure
doesn't<00:02:33.209> need<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.840> figure<00:02:34.109> stand<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.620> stands

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
doesn't need the figure stand it stands

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.399 
doesn't need the figure stand it stands
really<00:02:35.280> well<00:02:35.459> on<00:02:35.640> its<00:02:35.760> own<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.959> sculpting<00:02:37.349> on

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409
