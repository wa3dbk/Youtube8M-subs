at here and explain at the same time how
to<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:10.980> started<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.519> sculpture<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.059> figure

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
to get started with a sculpture I figure

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.650 
to get started with a sculpture I figure
that<00:00:12.540> would<00:00:12.599> be<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> good<00:00:12.929> idea<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.660> promise

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
that would be a good idea so I promise

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.090 
that would be a good idea so I promise
to<00:00:15.750> make<00:00:15.870> another<00:00:16.139> video<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.619> I'm<00:00:16.740> kind<00:00:17.039> of

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to make another video and I'm kind of

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
to make another video and I'm kind of
being<00:00:17.250> slow<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.449> figured<00:00:19.199> I'd<00:00:19.380> get

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
being slow at it so I figured I'd get

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.750 
being slow at it so I figured I'd get
going<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.300> suka<00:00:21.660> -<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.230> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
show you the is card so there you go

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
show you the is card so there you go
look<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> internet<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> no

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
look for that on the internet and no

order from him it's amazing seriously
you<00:01:50.700> gotta<00:01:50.909> buy<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.990> anyway<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.880> right

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you gotta buy it so anyway this right

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.289 
you gotta buy it so anyway this right
here<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> skeletal<00:01:55.579> drawing<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:57.060> one's

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
here is a skeletal drawing this one's

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.910 
here is a skeletal drawing this one's
actually<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.689> good<00:01:58.259> because<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.680> an<00:01:58.799> all

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
actually really good because it's an all

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.520 
actually really good because it's an all
angle<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> can<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.000> see<00:02:00.270> how<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.259> has

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
angle so you can kind of see how it has

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.550 
angle so you can kind of see how it has
to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.189> every<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> that's<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> first

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
to be for every side so that's the first

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.810 
to be for every side so that's the first

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
that's what you need references you got

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.510 
that's what you need references you got
to<00:02:51.150> make<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.450> right<00:02:51.600> size<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.260> guy's<00:02:52.520> 16

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
to make it the right size this guy's 16

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.780 
to make it the right size this guy's 16
inches<00:02:53.850> long<00:02:54.120> which<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> one<00:02:55.380> in<00:02:55.530> 15<00:02:56.010> scale<00:02:56.460> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
inches long which is one in 15 scale of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.960 
inches long which is one in 15 scale of
a<00:02:56.910> 20<00:02:57.390> foot<00:02:57.600> long<00:02:57.780> animal<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.710> largest<00:02:59.130> 7<00:02:59.400> 23

a 20 foot long animal the largest 7 23

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.730 
a 20 foot long animal the largest 7 23
feet<00:03:00.210> but<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> figured<00:03:00.840> I'd<00:03:00.930> go<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.200> 20<00:03:01.530> feet

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
feet but I figured I'd go with 20 feet

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.370 
feet but I figured I'd go with 20 feet
just<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.010> make<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.220> safe<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:06.140> then<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.230> need

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
just to make it safe so then you need

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.030 
just to make it safe so then you need
some<00:03:07.590> basic<00:03:07.980> materials<00:03:08.520> sculpting<00:03:09.420> tools<00:03:10.040> you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
some basic materials sculpting tools you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.820 
some basic materials sculpting tools you
can<00:03:11.190> find<00:03:11.430> them<00:03:11.550> at<00:03:11.640> Michael's<00:03:12.060> curries<00:03:12.830> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
kind of clay called epoxy sculpt it's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.220 
kind of clay called epoxy sculpt it's
good<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.160> put<00:03:32.340> underneath<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:34.110> do

of show you what's going on you'll need

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.660 
of show you what's going on you'll need
also<00:03:48.150> some<00:03:49.880> wire<00:03:50.880> here<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.270> almost<00:03:51.510> forgot

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
also some wire here I almost forgot

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.340 
also some wire here I almost forgot
armature<00:03:53.670> wire<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:56.420> this<00:03:57.420> time<00:03:57.690> I'm<00:03:58.110> going<00:03:58.260> to

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
armature wire and this time I'm going to

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.380 
armature wire and this time I'm going to
try<00:03:58.560> actually<00:03:58.709> using<00:03:59.280> wood<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.970> kind<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.270> make

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
try actually using wood to kind of make

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.140 
try actually using wood to kind of make
it<00:04:00.420> more<00:04:00.540> sturdy<00:04:00.959> inside<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.739> armature<00:04:02.190> so

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it more sturdy inside the armature so

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.479 
it more sturdy inside the armature so
hopefully<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:04.140> talented<00:04:04.500> sculptors<00:04:05.280> will

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
hopefully really talented sculptors will

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.090 
hopefully really talented sculptors will
watch<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.120> say<00:04:06.650> you're<00:04:07.650> not<00:04:07.709> making

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
watch this and say you're not making

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.560 
watch this and say you're not making
your<00:04:08.190> armature<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:08.790> good<00:04:09.030> here's<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.360> better

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
your armature so good here's a better

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.630 
your armature so good here's a better
way<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> make<00:04:09.959> them<00:04:10.340> because<00:04:11.340> it's<00:04:11.489> always

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
way to make them because it's always

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.860 
way to make them because it's always
