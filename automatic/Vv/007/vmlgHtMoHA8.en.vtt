sculptures<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.410> we<00:00:25.410> collaborated<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.220> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
sculptures that we collaborated on we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.990 
sculptures that we collaborated on we
built<00:00:27.119> these<00:00:27.300> structures<00:00:27.980> as

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
built these structures as

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.720 
built these structures as
representations<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.739> data<00:00:31.739> from<00:00:32.250> Klaus

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
representations of data from Klaus

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.160 
representations of data from Klaus
Hilton's<00:00:33.300> lab<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.780> Beckman<00:00:33.960> Institute

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
Hilton's lab at the Beckman Institute
it's<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.790> data<00:00:35.970> was<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.269> folding<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.050> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it's the the data was the folding of a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.740 
it's the the data was the folding of a
protein<00:00:37.260> called<00:00:37.920> villain<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.360> protein

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
protein called villain and the protein

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.740 
protein called villain and the protein
folds<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.440> seven<00:00:41.070> microseconds<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.970> I<00:00:42.329> mean

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
folds in seven microseconds so I mean

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.210 
folds in seven microseconds so I mean
it's<00:00:43.050> thousands<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> thousands<00:00:43.949> of<00:00:44.010> times

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
it's thousands and thousands of times

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.520 
it's thousands and thousands of times
faster<00:00:44.970> than<00:00:45.089> the<00:00:45.210> blink<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.540> an<00:00:45.629> eye<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.019> what

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
faster than the blink of an eye and what

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
faster than the blink of an eye and what
we<00:00:46.649> did<00:00:46.829> was<00:00:46.979> we<00:00:47.159> took<00:00:47.309> five<00:00:47.610> snapshots<00:00:48.329> along

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
we did was we took five snapshots along

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
we did was we took five snapshots along
that<00:00:48.960> trajectory<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.769> with<00:00:50.489> those

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that trajectory and with those

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.570 
that trajectory and with those
coordinates<00:00:51.360> fed<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.290> into<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.680> program<00:00:53.549> that

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
coordinates fed it into a program that

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.299 
coordinates fed it into a program that
would<00:00:53.790> give<00:00:53.939> us<00:00:54.089> cutting<00:00:54.449> diagrams<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.799> for

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
would give us cutting diagrams for for

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
would give us cutting diagrams for for

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
beauty of alien technology to me it's

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.039 
beauty of alien technology to me it's
it's<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.609> a<00:01:41.729> world<00:01:41.969> that<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.329> perfect<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's it's a world that is perfect and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.599 
it's it's a world that is perfect and
and<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.689> I'm<00:01:45.689> amazed<00:01:46.109> by<00:01:46.530> how<00:01:47.280> little

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
and and I just I'm amazed by how little

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.389 
and and I just I'm amazed by how little
we<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.090> visually<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.950> about<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.130> kind

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
we know visually about about that kind

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.289 
we know visually about about that kind
of<00:01:50.490> world<00:01:50.810> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.259> domain<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.579> living<00:01:54.030> cells

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
of world in the domain of living cells

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.760 
of world in the domain of living cells
which<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.609> at<00:01:56.609> the<00:01:56.909> molecular<00:01:57.240> domain<00:01:57.840> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
which is at the molecular domain this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
which is at the molecular domain this
size<00:01:59.369> scale<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:01.319> is<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.770> difficult<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.819> my

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
size scale it is just difficult for my

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.090 
size scale it is just difficult for my
microscopes<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:05.009> visualize<00:02:05.670> things<00:02:07.100> with

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
microscopes to visualize things with

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.520 
microscopes to visualize things with
like<00:02:08.340> microscopes<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.690> don't<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
like microscopes so you don't have the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.699 
like microscopes so you don't have the
resolution<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.600> electron<00:02:12.600> microscopes<00:02:13.319> are

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
resolution and electron microscopes are

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.300 
resolution and electron microscopes are
not<00:02:13.860> really<00:02:14.660> well-suited<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:16.140> studying<00:02:17.099> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
not really well-suited for studying the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.850 
not really well-suited for studying the
processes<00:02:17.849> in<00:02:18.150> living<00:02:18.450> cells<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> protein

processes in living cells when a protein

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
processes in living cells when a protein
is<00:02:19.980> produced<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.819> kind<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.209> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
is produced you can kind of think of it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.540 
is produced you can kind of think of it
as<00:02:21.420> starting<00:02:21.780> out<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.200> floppy<00:02:22.620> string<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
as starting out as this floppy string of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.850 
as starting out as this floppy string of
beads<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> then

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
beads and then

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.880 
beads and then
it<00:02:25.100> folds<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.000> final<00:02:26.450> structure<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
it folds into a final structure the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.530 
it folds into a final structure the
string<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.400> beads<00:02:28.580> each<00:02:28.820> bead<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.090> an<00:02:29.300> amino

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
string of beads each bead is an amino

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.030 
string of beads each bead is an amino
acid<00:02:29.660> there's<00:02:30.140> 20<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.470> these<00:02:30.560> things<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
acid there's 20 of these things and the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.800 
acid there's 20 of these things and the
amazing<00:02:31.370> thing<00:02:31.460> about<00:02:31.520> proteins<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.210> that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
amazing thing about proteins is that

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.840 
amazing thing about proteins is that
they<00:02:33.260> perform<00:02:33.710> all<00:02:33.950> kinds<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.490> different

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
they perform all kinds of different

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
they perform all kinds of different
tasks<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:36.350> tasks<00:02:36.710> that<00:02:36.740> they<00:02:36.920> perform<00:02:37.400> is

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
tasks and the tasks that they perform is

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
scientists became aware of it shortens

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.880 
scientists became aware of it shortens
work<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.960> know<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.320> really<00:05:02.560> well<00:05:02.710> because

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
work is I know it really well because

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.360 
work is I know it really well because
I'm<00:05:03.490> always<00:05:03.700> interested<00:05:04.240> in<00:05:04.570> seeing<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:06.220> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
I'm always interested in seeing the the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.760 
I'm always interested in seeing the the
the<00:05:06.610> what's<00:05:07.000> beyond<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.510> static<00:05:07.960> aspect<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.650> a

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
the what's beyond the static aspect of a

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.500 
the what's beyond the static aspect of a
protein<00:05:09.100> structure<00:05:09.400> for<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.790> last<00:05:09.970> decades

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
protein structure for the last decades

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.590 
protein structure for the last decades
people<00:05:11.200> saw<00:05:11.530> only<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> static<00:05:12.480> aspect<00:05:13.480> they

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
people saw only the static aspect they

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.090 
people saw only the static aspect they
see<00:05:13.660> only<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:14.110> protein<00:05:14.560> as<00:05:14.710> something

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
see only a protein as something

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.010 
see only a protein as something
unmovable<00:05:15.940> but<00:05:16.360> it<00:05:16.450> turns<00:05:16.630> out<00:05:16.780> the<00:05:16.990> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
unmovable but it turns out the the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.050 
unmovable but it turns out the the
moving<00:05:17.590> aspect<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.490> dynamics<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:18.970> a

moving aspect of the dynamics of a

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.360 
moving aspect of the dynamics of a
protein<00:05:19.390> is<00:05:19.420> absolutely<00:05:20.080> crucial<00:05:20.290> and<00:05:20.680> and

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
protein is absolutely crucial and and

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.060 
protein is absolutely crucial and and
his<00:05:21.610> group<00:05:21.880> does<00:05:22.060> an<00:05:22.150> amazing<00:05:22.390> job<00:05:22.630> in

his group does an amazing job in
visualizing<00:05:24.070> that<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.580> was<00:05:24.970> out<00:05:25.090> there<00:05:25.240> looking

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
visualizing that I was out there looking

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.070 
visualizing that I was out there looking
for<00:05:25.630> resources<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.740> would<00:05:27.010> help<00:05:27.280> me<00:05:27.730> teach

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
for resources that would help me teach

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.030 
for resources that would help me teach
concepts<00:05:29.080> of<00:05:29.230> protein<00:05:29.590> folding<00:05:29.950> in

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
concepts of protein folding in

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.170 
concepts of protein folding in
particular<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.520> was<00:05:30.640> looking<00:05:30.880> for<00:05:31.030> something

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
particular I was looking for something

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.850 
particular I was looking for something
that<00:05:31.300> showed<00:05:31.600> motion<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.260> these

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
that showed motion and these

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.350 
that showed motion and these
supplementary<00:05:33.340> videos<00:05:33.730> that<00:05:33.910> they<00:05:34.000> published

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
supplementary videos that they published

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.320 
supplementary videos that they published
really<00:05:34.930> struck<00:05:35.320> me<00:05:35.350> as<00:05:35.680> being<00:05:35.710> very<00:05:36.370> powerful

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
really struck me as being very powerful

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570 
really struck me as being very powerful
for<00:05:37.810> communicating<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.950> idea<00:05:39.220> that<00:05:39.400> there

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
for communicating the idea that there

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.300 
for communicating the idea that there
are<00:05:39.700> multiple<00:05:39.910> paths<00:05:40.420> to<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:41.200> single<00:05:41.980> native

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
are multiple paths to a single native

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.340 
are multiple paths to a single native
state<00:05:42.580> you<00:05:43.090> could<00:05:43.240> see<00:05:43.600> these<00:05:43.840> proteins

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
state you could see these proteins

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.950 
state you could see these proteins
getting<00:05:44.740> stuck<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.820> local<00:05:46.180> minima<00:05:46.390> and

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
getting stuck in local minima and

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.450 
getting stuck in local minima and
getting<00:05:47.320> out<00:05:47.470> of<00:05:47.620> it<00:05:47.740> and<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.100> you<00:05:48.280> can

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
getting out of it and and you can

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.000 
getting out of it and and you can
visually<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.420> could<00:05:49.570> watch<00:05:49.870> these<00:05:50.140> things<00:05:50.470> go

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
visually you could watch these things go

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.590 
visually you could watch these things go
through<00:05:51.040> different<00:05:51.730> paths<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.570> same

through different paths to the same
final<00:05:53.200> structure<00:05:53.620> many<00:05:54.160> people<00:05:54.550> who<00:05:54.670> see<00:05:54.970> for

the first time what we actually offer

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.650 
the first time what we actually offer
scientifically<00:05:59.980> they<00:06:00.190> think<00:06:00.460> oh<00:06:00.610> we're<00:06:01.390> just

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
scientifically they think oh we're just

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.940 
scientifically they think oh we're just
using<00:06:01.900> beautiful<00:06:02.470> colors<00:06:03.010> and<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.960> this<00:06:05.650> new

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
using beautiful colors and and this new

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
using beautiful colors and and this new
type<00:06:06.250> movies<00:06:06.960> but<00:06:07.960> that<00:06:08.860> is<00:06:09.100> true<00:06:09.520> in<00:06:09.820> a<00:06:09.940> way

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
type movies but that is true in a way

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.960 
type movies but that is true in a way
but<00:06:10.510> is<00:06:10.690> also<00:06:10.950> much<00:06:11.950> more<00:06:12.220> than<00:06:12.460> that<00:06:12.490> because

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
but is also much more than that because

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.470 
but is also much more than that because
this<00:06:13.420> is<00:06:13.480> the<00:06:13.720> only<00:06:13.840> way<00:06:14.200> actually<00:06:14.800> of

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
this is the only way actually of

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.480 
this is the only way actually of
grasping<00:06:16.480> the<00:06:16.810> human<00:06:17.170> mind<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:18.160> kind<00:06:18.370> of

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
grasping the human mind the kind of

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.540 
grasping the human mind the kind of
complexity<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.570> is<00:06:19.810> natural<00:06:20.440> to<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:21.250> living

cell<00:06:22.650> what<00:06:23.650> I<00:06:23.680> really<00:06:23.890> love<00:06:24.040> to<00:06:24.160> do<00:06:24.340> is<00:06:24.640> is<00:06:24.970> to

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
cell what I really love to do is is to

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.420 
cell what I really love to do is is to
walk<00:06:25.720> around<00:06:26.050> these<00:06:26.440> things<00:06:26.680> up<00:06:26.860> there<00:06:27.040> you

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
walk around these things up there you

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.310 
walk around these things up there you
look<00:06:27.580> at<00:06:27.670> them<00:06:27.760> from<00:06:27.880> one<00:06:28.090> direction<00:06:28.420> and<00:06:28.930> you

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
look at them from one direction and you

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.940 
look at them from one direction and you
see<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:30.040> timeline<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:30.940> see<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.420> protein

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
see a timeline you see that protein

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.770 
see a timeline you see that protein
folding<00:06:32.950> you<00:06:33.280> go<00:06:33.460> to<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.640> other<00:06:33.730> end<00:06:34.000> you<00:06:34.210> see

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
folding you go to the other end you see

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.140 
folding you go to the other end you see
it<00:06:34.870> unfolding<00:06:35.590> and<00:06:35.740> as<00:06:36.100> you<00:06:36.220> walk<00:06:36.550> around<00:06:36.760> you

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
it unfolding and as you walk around you

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.940 
it unfolding and as you walk around you
get<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.330> better<00:06:37.570> sense<00:06:37.960> I<00:06:38.140> think<00:06:38.410> then<00:06:38.680> you

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
get a better sense I think then you

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.000 
get a better sense I think then you
would<00:06:39.490> from<00:06:39.640> a<00:06:39.760> two-dimensional<00:06:40.030> still<00:06:40.690> of<00:06:41.010> of

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
would from a two-dimensional still of of

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.570 
would from a two-dimensional still of of
the<00:06:42.760> space<00:06:43.450> that<00:06:43.780> HeLa<00:06:44.470> sees<00:06:44.680> take-up<00:06:44.980> of<00:06:45.430> the

the proximity of one backbone to the

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.490 
the proximity of one backbone to the
next<00:06:48.490> you<00:06:49.090> get<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.270> better<00:06:49.480> picture<00:06:49.750> of<00:06:49.990> a<00:06:50.050> pro

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
next you get a better picture of a pro

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.770 
next you get a better picture of a pro
it<00:06:51.500> certainly<00:06:51.889> provokes<00:06:52.759> people<00:06:52.879> to<00:06:53.180> ask<00:06:53.389> and

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 
it certainly provokes people to ask and

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.589 
it certainly provokes people to ask and
if<00:06:54.020> they<00:06:55.009> hear<00:06:55.189> the<00:06:55.310> answer<00:06:55.699> that<00:06:56.180> this<00:06:56.330> is

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 
if they hear the answer that this is

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.330
