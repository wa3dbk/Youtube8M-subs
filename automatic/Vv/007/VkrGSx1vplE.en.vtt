00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.609
 very good to all boys and girls who 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.769
 you are fighting is the heat that 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 come back here specifically to 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.620
 Spain you already know that you will attack very 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.290
 strong but we have not come here to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.970
 talk about the heat but about nintendo- nx 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.590
 that keeps releasing news 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.710
 iwata has talked about overlapping 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.750
 between nx and wiiu and the support of the cir 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.180
 Attentive parties because the rumor about 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 manufacture in October of nintendo in xy 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.190
 his sale next summer goes without 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.730
 stop the different forums the networks 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.739
 also in the most known forums but 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.630
 the final words on this 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.030
 new console has said satoru iwata 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 that has made it very clear that there will be games 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.970
 for the console that I replaced 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.980
 way parallel to its output given the base 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.660
 installed from each console in the 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.760
 Board of Directors are clear that they need 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.040
 continue to rely on current models 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.530
 while the new model of nintendo 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.600
 takes off especially in terms of games 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.809
 attentive to these words from the point 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 of view of the software would be very 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.220
 inefficient stop throwing games for 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.720
 nintendo 3ds or for wii a just after 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.640
 of the release of nx 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.190
 words from the iwata itself and the most 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 important is the desktop since 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.700
 ensures that it is a priority for the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 company think about how we can 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.960
 satisfy the maximum possible 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.930
 consumers who have bought a 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.600
 wii console and how to keep increasing the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.790
 catalog of these consoles machines is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 a fully open debate within 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.800
 own nintendo and also with the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.230
 other studies will be constituted party with 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.000
 those who work so they say with 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.710
 these words so I think that you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 why not have concern 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.510
 occur immediately as soon as 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 if the problem of lack or support of 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.860
 external developers will be fixed 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 in your future machine the only thing that has 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.110
 said Mr. iwata is that they will try 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.930
 Offer nx using a typical solution 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.400
 from nintendo a phrase a phrase that everything 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.800
 It must be said- well, it turns out 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.460
 difficult for users to 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 understand good because I already tell you that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.410
 there is not much confidence in these moments 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.119
 in the future of wiiu is something that has 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.980
 pissed off a lot of users during 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.410
 this past three we remember that 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.480
 nintendo was teaching nx 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 to the big publishers as he said 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.590
 fortune during the fair received 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.560
 many proposals for initiatives 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.900
 together we will be pending more 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.030
 information about nintendo nx that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.090
 I repeat is giving a lot to talk about 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.010
 the overlap between wii and nintendo nx 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.660
 the future of wiiu all sqp during 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 during these days these summer days 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.540
 there is a lot of tension in the environment 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 I say so
