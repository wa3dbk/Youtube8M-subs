00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.940 
really tough condition it can work both
ways<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.670> mean<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:52.019> know<00:02:52.140> obviously<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.620> know

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
ways I mean you know obviously we know

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
ways I mean you know obviously we know
what<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.190> takes<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.640> hopefully<00:02:54.209> we'll<00:02:54.390> we'll

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
what it takes and hopefully we'll we'll

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.449 
what it takes and hopefully we'll we'll
be<00:02:55.050> able<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.200> replicate<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:55.980> not<00:02:56.129> go<00:02:56.310> one

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
be able to replicate it if not go one

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.520 
be able to replicate it if not go one
better<00:02:56.930> you<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:58.050> we've<00:02:58.200> obviously<00:02:58.290> got

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
better you know we've obviously got

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.990 
better you know we've obviously got
confidence<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.069> ourselves<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.819> think

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
confidence in ourselves because I think

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.160 
confidence in ourselves because I think
we're<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> better<00:03:00.300> place<00:03:00.540> now<00:03:00.629> than<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.140> were

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
we're in a better place now than we were

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.660 
we're in a better place now than we were
then<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.709> we<00:03:01.769> did<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> good<00:03:02.069> job<00:03:02.129> on<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.370> day

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
then and we did a good job on that day

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.000 
then and we did a good job on that day
by<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.599> same<00:03:03.870> token<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.379> they'll<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.709> feeling

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
by the same token and they'll be feeling

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.830 
by the same token and they'll be feeling
hurt<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.550> they'll<00:03:05.760> be<00:03:05.940> we're<00:03:06.510> looking<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
hurt from it they'll be we're looking to

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.600 
hurt from it they'll be we're looking to
right<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.440> wrongs<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.830> put<00:03:08.010> set<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.459> story

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
right the wrongs and put set the story

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
right the wrongs and put set the story
straight<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.989> know<00:03:10.110> they<00:03:10.230> might

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
straight so when you know they might

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.509 
straight so when you know they might
have<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.620> little<00:03:10.769> bit<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.920> extra<00:03:11.129> motivation

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
have a little bit of extra motivation

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.570 
have a little bit of extra motivation
from<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:13.290> know<00:03:13.409> it<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.129> walk<00:03:14.280> Eva

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
from that so you know it can walk Eva

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.610 
from that so you know it can walk Eva
way<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.300> you've<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.110> go<00:03:16.230> get<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:16.470> top

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
way and it's you've got to go get on top

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.140 
way and it's you've got to go get on top
on<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.830> day<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.430> said<00:03:17.580> perhaps<00:03:17.670> don't<00:03:17.909> let<00:03:18.060> us

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
on the day you said perhaps don't let us

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.729 
on the day you said perhaps don't let us
focus<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.450> individuals<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.080> Peter<00:03:19.409> Marnie

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739

teams we playing well in the Six Nations
and<00:03:21.420> Ireland<00:03:21.659> seem<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> get<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.959> lot<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.080> energy

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
and Ireland seem to get a lot of energy

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.080 
and Ireland seem to get a lot of energy
from<00:03:22.620> his<00:03:22.769> work<00:03:23.010> at<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.280> breakdown<00:03:23.489> is<00:03:23.879> that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
from his work at the breakdown is that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.580 
from his work at the breakdown is that
something<00:03:24.360> you've<00:03:24.659> spoken<00:03:24.900> about<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
something you've spoken about and and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.410 
something you've spoken about and and
it's<00:03:26.430> someone<00:03:26.670> individual<00:03:27.150> like<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.330> an

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
it's someone individual like that an

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.539 
it's someone individual like that an
important<00:03:27.810> person<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.140> target<00:03:28.530> yeah<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.310> guess

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
important person to target yeah I guess

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.649 
important person to target yeah I guess
that<00:03:29.700> looking<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.090> island<00:03:30.390> side<00:03:30.510> at<00:03:30.599> the

make decisions we've got out of movement

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.570 
make decisions we've got out of movement
out<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.569> back<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.110> that<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:53.040> know<00:03:53.159> their

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
out the back so that you know their

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.460 
out the back so that you know their
defenders<00:03:54.030> can't<00:03:54.299> line<00:03:54.659> up<00:03:54.689> tacklers<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.379> get

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
defenders can't line up tacklers and get

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.080 
defenders can't line up tacklers and get
hold<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.709> people<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.610> they<00:03:56.700> can't<00:03:56.909> gang

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
hold of people and so they can't gang

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.089 
hold of people and so they can't gang
tackling<00:03:57.480> numbers<00:03:57.840> will<00:03:58.379> nullify<00:03:58.590> some<00:03:59.040> of

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
tackling numbers will nullify some of

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.160 
tackling numbers will nullify some of
their<00:03:59.220> individuals<00:03:59.760> like<00:03:59.970> Peter<00:04:00.269> imani<00:04:00.569> if<00:04:01.019> we

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
their individuals like Peter imani if we

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.770 
their individuals like Peter imani if we
do<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.319> well<00:04:01.680> collectively<00:04:02.420> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.540> and

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
do that well collectively you know and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360 
do that well collectively you know and
if<00:04:03.870> we<00:04:03.989> don't<00:04:04.140> if<00:04:04.379> we<00:04:04.409> r<00:04:04.500> 1<00:04:04.680> out<00:04:04.799> runners<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.310> we

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
if we don't if we r 1 out runners and we

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.550 
if we don't if we r 1 out runners and we
present<00:04:05.730> easy<00:04:05.909> targets<00:04:06.420> then<00:04:06.629> you<00:04:07.349> know<00:04:07.439> we'll

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
present easy targets then you know we'll

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.070 
present easy targets then you know we'll
like<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.250> say<00:04:08.459> they'll<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.849> field<00:04:09.090> day<00:04:09.120> do

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
like I say they'll have a field day do

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.630 
like I say they'll have a field day do
target<00:04:10.470> individuals<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.159> feel<00:04:11.340> that's<00:04:11.489> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
target individuals do you feel that's a
