00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
little bugs still left to iron out there

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.080 
little bugs still left to iron out there
but<00:03:31.650> as<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.190> once<00:03:32.459> we<00:03:32.550> do<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.850> we

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
but as you can see once we do that we

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.550 
but as you can see once we do that we
can<00:03:33.209> actually<00:03:33.330> go<00:03:33.570> talk<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.019> paladin<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
item obviously we will have a function

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000 
item obviously we will have a function
where<00:03:39.269> he<00:03:39.540> will<00:03:39.840> actually<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.530> hand<00:03:40.860> in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
where he will actually have to hand in

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
this video but I can tell you it's there

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.870 
this video but I can tell you it's there
it's<00:03:54.300> done<00:03:54.690> tile<00:03:54.959> optimization<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.640> if

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
it's done tile optimization so this if

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.130 
it's done tile optimization so this if
you're<00:03:57.120> running<00:03:57.330> this<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.630> server<00:03:57.930> for

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
you're running this on a server for

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.540 
you're running this on a server for
multiplayer<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.800> going<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.040> run<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> lot

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
multiplayer it's going to run a lot

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.430 
multiplayer it's going to run a lot
smoother<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.269> won't<00:04:00.630> need<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.840> strong

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
smoother I you won't need a strong

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.759 
smoother I you won't need a strong
server<00:04:01.709> really<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.190> run<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> um<00:04:03.650> another<00:04:04.650> thing

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
server really to run it um another thing

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.110 
server really to run it um another thing
that's<00:04:05.010> been<00:04:05.160> added<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.640> also<00:04:05.820> can't

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
that's been added and I also can't
