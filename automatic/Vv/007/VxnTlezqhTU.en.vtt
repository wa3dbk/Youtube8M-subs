00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.700
 unit follows instructions a family 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:11.160
 the words the objective is to know 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.160
 families of words and apply them

 every positive day take notes of the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.250
 main ideas and make the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.700
 requested activities it 's time to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700
 to learn 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 activity 1 what word does not have 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.750
 relationship with the rectum you want after 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.199
 or third time fish or fish 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.199
 fishes 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.600
 very well exposed let's continue 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.610
 What I have in common is that I was a fisherman 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.610
 of fish and fishmongers 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 they have the same root that yes the child 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.989
 origin 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.049
 therefore if it is root of a word 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.180
 in the common part at the origin of the 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:11.009
 meaning of the words that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.960
 belong to the same family example 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.500
 fishery fisher 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 and fish shop 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.440
 has the same root 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 that is, at the origin 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.430
 and we must ask ourselves soon what is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.890
 a family of words is a set 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.790
 of words that share the same root 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.550
 and they relate in their meanings 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.970
 example these words correspond to the 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:47.750
 family of words after I want 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.750

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.720
