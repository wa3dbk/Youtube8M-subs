 life imprisonment on so 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.630
 called prison servers where they will 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.480
 serve their sentence 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.819
 on such servers it will be impossible not 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.010
 create a clan or join him 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.450
 be leader boards as well 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 interact with honest 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.099
 users all that remains to the player 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.849
 so it is only to play along with the same 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.220
 hare 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.120
 rules are not there so it can be enough 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.859
 use your entire arsenal of cheat code 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.160
 it is important to understand that all of the above 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.980
 only where are they preparing to speak 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.329
 force bill before proceeding 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.459
 to change the rules 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:17.579
 developers want to see the reaction 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.579
 people but for now it is mostly negative 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.340
 in one of the issues already mentioned 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.739
 what programmer n hitler creator 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.870
 first three road rage began to think 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.230
 about the revival of the famous biker 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.349
 series but he had license issues 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.610
 but so far dan thought studio guys 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.040
 darkside games 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.760

 and how easy it will be to guess 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.840
 in the spirit of road rage for all this the team 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.959
 rather large composition 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.860
 it is formed by sega sonic 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:02.790

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.030
 managed to lose all his authority and 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.380
 now he has to conquer from scratch 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.019
 respect for your gang

 taking part in crazy races 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.940
 for survival it is clear that the plot is here 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.760
 so minor thing 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.380
 and generally do without it 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.530

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.240
 opinion

 tied to the network and nobody any 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:38.110
 difficulties according to few 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.479
 the world is ready for this and how
