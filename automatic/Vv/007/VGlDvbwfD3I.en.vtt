00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 part 2 laser printer can 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.889
 print any document in a few 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.549
 seconds this printer uses a laser but 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.590
 never touching paper 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.750
 powder that creates an image 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.240
 contained in the tone of ari and sticks to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:34.490
 paper by static 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:38.870
 electricity but like a laser printer 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:41.600
 printed circuit board laser printing unit 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.250
 cartridge when digital document 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 printed circuit board 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.790
 processes it and the laser sends 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.790
 light pulses on the cartridge 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.990
 it is here that the laser beam and the static 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.160
 electricity turns digital 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.160
 image in real 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.430
 disassemble the printer to find out by 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.430
 more 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 cartridge consists of two parts drum 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.500
 and toner with the start of printing drum 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 starts to rotate 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.570
 electrified scooter charges 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.830
 drum surface negative 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.250
 charges charges stick to the surface 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.660
 no this static electricity when 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.510
 laser beam hits on 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.530
 photosensitive drum surface 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.530
 he kills the charge 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.260
 this way on the surface of the drum 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 created by an uncharged zone the laser has 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.510
 linear scan and scans the drum with 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.850
 very high frequency due to which 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.200
 appears on the drum we need 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.480
 picture but to transfer image 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.890
 on paper 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:40.850
 neutral charged and need zones 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:44.310
 fill the donor as it happens 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.380
 because of the friction of the drum over he ari too 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.870
 static electricity occurs 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.030
 this way for each donor piece 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.030
 sits down a negative charge 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 how does toner get on the donor drum 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:11.909
 gets on a scooter near which and 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.340
 the drum is spinning donor just nowhere 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.629
 to go away 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.150
 negatively charged toner particles 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.939
 fall on neutral charged and zones 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.950
 on the drum 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.139
 following the laws of physics powder itself 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.359
 sticks to places free of charge 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.389
 every time drum and scooter 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.010
 touch at the same time 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.780
 negative charge on the drum 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.540
 repels all the wrong amount 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.280
 toner is thus filled only 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.650
 areas marked by laser toner forms 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.099
 mirror image of the image 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.099
 on the drum 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.699
 after that the printer is positive 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.699
 charges a sheet of paper 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.220
 the drum scrolls a piece of paper and 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:04.150
 leaves a toner mark on it 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.170
 here the law of physics comes into effect again 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.569
 positively charged paper 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.849
 attracts negative toner particles 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.970
 stronger than neutrally charged 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.970
 drum 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.199
 paper as if 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.060
 tears off the drum people so 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.060
 image is transferred to the sheet 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.260
 and finally the heating roller melts 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.100
 toner in paper at about 200 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.100
 degrees Celsius 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.030
 laser printer 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.440
 simple but ingenious invention 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.800
 I use a laser system such 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.890
 Printers can print up to 27 pages per page. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.890
 a minute 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.260
 incredible
