this<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.930> me<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:20.240> how<00:02:21.240> lazy<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.170> how

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
this to me is how lazy it is and how

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.980 
this to me is how lazy it is and how
unconvincing<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:23.580> because<00:02:24.540> even<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> lot<00:02:24.960> of

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
unconvincing it is because even a lot of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.300 
unconvincing it is because even a lot of
Christians<00:02:25.290> are<00:02:25.470> gonna<00:02:25.590> hear<00:02:25.770> Matthew<00:02:26.070> Negi
