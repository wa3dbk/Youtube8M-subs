00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.700
 Many people pay attention today when buying shoes mainly to the 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.900
 In doing so, the most important point is often neglected criminally 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.349
 because shoes are much more than just a fashion accessory 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.860
 and first and foremost have to be careful a foot is not a block 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.630
 but it consists of many 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.039
 Sharing and those are int special relationship to each other 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.119
 With certain proportions there are certain proportions 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.789
 Need to court to fit the right shoe again 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.550
 because the shoe is too big or too small, these proportions are not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.210
 and the shoe then forces its own Mischa Annick on the foot and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.410
 changed 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.530
 this leads in the worst case to deformations of the 10th 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.800
 Inflammation swelling or even stiffening to 4 feet 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.420
 in the industrialized countries 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 60 percent of adults suffer from foot problems 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.240
 Even in Germany, the topic of proper footwear is no problem 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.430
 very big even 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.220
 such as the German shoe institute and the Federal Association of German 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.110
 Shoe industry now found out in a study 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
 About 80 percent of Germans wear the right school 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.950
 and this terrifying result has led us to say one 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120
 'We have to do more for the program now we have to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.750
 To provide educational work 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.250
 it should now be counteracted with the shoe that fits the initiative 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.710
 the information campaign with the help of an enlightening book 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.900
 and through targeted media work, the population for the health of their 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.620
 Sensitize feet 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.840
 but exactly what 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.420
 you have to pay attention when buying shoes who should 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.470
 to be stuck but never too tight 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.110
 and you should 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.369
 fitting in 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.470
 It was important to pay attention to the length 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.850
 You should never buy something 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.170
 in the somebody somewhere in the spring value 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.009
 and soon to dress or anything else fits who wants to go for sure 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.249
 should be professional before buying his feet in a specialty store 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.350
 let it measure 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.990
 because it should be worth it if they continue without complaints 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.600
 want to occur firmly
