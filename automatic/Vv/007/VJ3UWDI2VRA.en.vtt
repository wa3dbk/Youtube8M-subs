00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
different aspects how to use the

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.100 
different aspects how to use the
dictionary<00:00:33.150> what<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.600> information<00:00:34.840> is

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
dictionary what the information is

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.520 
dictionary what the information is
provided

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.120 

so<00:00:39.340> let's<00:00:39.550> see<00:00:39.850> if<00:00:40.120> they<00:00:40.390> have<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.960> example

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
so let's see if they have for example

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.650 
so let's see if they have for example
let's<00:00:45.130> see<00:00:45.280> computer<00:00:48.270> okay<00:00:49.270> so<00:00:49.360> they've<00:00:49.540> got

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
let's see computer okay so they've got

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.549 
let's see computer okay so they've got
one<00:00:49.840> word<00:00:50.020> for<00:00:50.050> computers<00:00:50.620> we<00:00:50.890> click<00:00:51.130> on<00:00:51.280> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
one word for computers we click on that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.189 
one word for computers we click on that
computer<00:00:54.360> now<00:00:55.360> notice<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.809> difference

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
computer now notice the difference

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.720 
computer now notice the difference
between<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.680> way<00:00:56.770> I<00:00:56.800> pronounce<00:00:57.160> it<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.610> the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
between the way I pronounce it and the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.180 
between the way I pronounce it and the
way<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:59.080> computer<00:00:59.470> pronounces<00:00:59.920> it<00:01:00.070> I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
way that the computer pronounces it I

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.609 
way that the computer pronounces it I
say<00:01:00.400> computer<00:01:03.180> computer<00:01:04.180> ok<00:01:04.989> so<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.199> really

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
say computer computer ok so I really

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.219 
say computer computer ok so I really
need<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:05.800> improve<00:01:06.190> that<00:01:06.550> T<00:01:06.820> sound<00:01:07.119> now<00:01:07.780> I<00:01:07.810> would

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
need to improve that T sound now I would

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.540 
need to improve that T sound now I would
always<00:01:08.380> claim<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:09.070> just<00:01:09.220> because<00:01:09.340> I'm

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
always claim that it's just because I'm

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.440 
always claim that it's just because I'm
Canadian<00:01:09.850> but<00:01:10.240> maybe<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.899> should<00:01:11.440> rethink<00:01:11.740> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
Canadian but maybe I should rethink that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.330 
Canadian but maybe I should rethink that
so<00:01:13.450> let's<00:01:13.630> see<00:01:13.869> we<00:01:14.170> use<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> computer<00:01:14.619> at<00:01:15.100> least

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
so let's see we use a computer at least

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.230 
so let's see we use a computer at least
once<00:01:15.759> every<00:01:16.600> day<00:01:17.729> interesting<00:01:18.729> so<00:01:18.880> let's<00:01:18.910> see

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
once every day interesting so let's see

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.570 
once every day interesting so let's see
fine<00:01:19.479> words<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:19.960> are<00:01:20.140> so<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.220> can<00:01:21.369> select

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
fine words that are so you can select

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.730 
fine words that are so you can select
many<00:01:22.000> different<00:01:22.450> things<00:01:22.660> so<00:01:23.020> contains

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
many different things so contains

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.690 
many different things so contains
computer<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:26.080> not<00:01:26.229> just<00:01:26.440> exact<00:01:26.890> matches<00:01:27.460> for

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
computer so not just exact matches for

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.520 
computer so not just exact matches for
computer<00:01:28.149> but<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.660> can<00:01:28.840> also<00:01:28.990> contain

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
computer but it can also contain

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.590 
computer but it can also contain
computer<00:01:29.979> so<00:01:30.100> computer<00:01:30.520> programmer<00:01:31.060> for

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
computer so computer programmer for

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.480 
computer so computer programmer for
example<00:01:34.350> she<00:01:35.350> took<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.560> lot<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.830> courses<00:01:36.160> to

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
example she took a lot of courses to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.380 
example she took a lot of courses to
become<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.789> computer<00:01:37.180> programmer<00:01:39.180> ok<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.330> you

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
become a computer programmer ok and you

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.719 
become a computer programmer ok and you
can<00:01:40.420> also<00:01:40.630> find<00:01:40.899> words<00:01:41.200> all<00:01:41.740> words<00:01:42.250> or<00:01:42.549> word

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729
