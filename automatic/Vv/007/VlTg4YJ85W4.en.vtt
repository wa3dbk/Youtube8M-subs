00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
of the mechanics that you're normally

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.680 
of the mechanics that you're normally
going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> encounter<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> fight<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are going to talk about them just a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
are going to talk about them just a
little<00:00:35.010> bit<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> lead<00:00:36.510> up<00:00:36.660> into

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
little bit so I can kind of lead up into

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
little bit so I can kind of lead up into
the<00:00:37.079> 20-percent<00:00:37.620> face<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.430> 20-percent

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
the 20-percent face because a 20-percent

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.400 
the 20-percent face because a 20-percent
phase<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.270> when<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> fight<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:40.020> starts

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
phase is when this fight really starts

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
phase is when this fight really starts
now<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.120> under<00:00:42.420> them<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.809> have

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
now as you can see under them they have

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
now as you can see under them they have
a<00:00:43.050> little<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.680> bar<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.789> like

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
a little a little bar of like it's like

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
a little a little bar of like it's like
a<00:00:45.000> rage<00:00:45.210> bar<00:00:45.480> whenever<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> rage<00:00:46.469> bar<00:00:46.739> hits

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
a rage bar whenever that rage bar hits

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
a rage bar whenever that rage bar hits
30<00:00:47.399> they<00:00:47.760> gain<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> secondary<00:00:48.510> ability<00:00:48.960> now

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
30 they gain a secondary ability now

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
30 they gain a secondary ability now
whenever<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.800> rage<00:00:49.920> work<00:00:50.129> hits<00:00:50.309> 100<00:00:50.730> they

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
whenever that rage work hits 100 they

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
whenever that rage work hits 100 they
gain<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> tertiary<00:00:51.270> ability<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.469> only

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
gain a tertiary ability now the only

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.990 
gain a tertiary ability now the only
time<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> their<00:00:53.219> rage<00:00:53.399> bar<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:53.850> ever

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
time that their rage bar is really ever

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
time that their rage bar is really ever
got<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> hit<00:00:54.390> 100<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.199> whenever<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.649> reach

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
got a hit 100 is whenever they reach

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
got a hit 100 is whenever they reach
twenty<00:00:56.129> percent<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> first<00:00:57.239> Iron<00:00:57.840> Maiden

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
twenty percent now the first Iron Maiden

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
twenty percent now the first Iron Maiden
reach<00:00:58.320> twenty<00:00:58.620> percent<00:00:58.890> gives<00:00:59.399> all<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> them<00:01:00.000> a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
reach twenty percent gives all of them a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
reach twenty percent gives all of them a
one<00:01:00.750> hundred<00:01:00.989> percent<00:01:01.020> rage<00:01:01.440> bar<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
one hundred percent rage bar and so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.590 
one hundred percent rage bar and so
that's<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.730> you're<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.059> rage<00:01:03.239> phase

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that's kind of like you're in rage phase

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
that's kind of like you're in rage phase
that's<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.920> DPS<00:01:05.400> race

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that's that's the that's the DPS race

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
that's that's the that's the DPS race
and<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.780> reason<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:07.979> top<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and the reason for that is it on top of

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
and the reason for that is it on top of
gaining<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.820> tertiary<00:01:09.450> ability<00:01:10.140> they<00:01:10.500> also

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
gaining a tertiary ability they also

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.440 
gaining a tertiary ability they also
gain<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> stacking<00:01:11.460> damage<00:01:11.790> buff<00:01:12.000> did<00:01:12.240> last

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gain a stacking damage buff did last

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
gain a stacking damage buff did last
until<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> end<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> fight<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
until the end of the fight and so the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.410 
until the end of the fight and so the
longer<00:01:14.340> they're<00:01:14.580> alive<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.119> more<00:01:15.270> damage

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
longer they're alive the more damage

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.149 
longer they're alive the more damage
they<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> becomes<00:01:16.740> harder<00:01:17.130> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
they do and so it becomes harder and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
they do and so it becomes harder and
harder<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> harder<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.659> why<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
harder and harder and so that's why you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.390 
harder and harder and so that's why you
want<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> save<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.320> heroes<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.040> everything

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
want to save your heroes and everything

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039 
want to save your heroes and everything
like<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.299> twenty<00:01:21.600> percent<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
like that for about twenty percent so

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690 
like that for about twenty percent so
you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> push<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.070> also<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you can push them down and also I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.010 
you can push them down and also I
wouldn't<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.180> wait<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> save<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.900> until

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
wouldn't really wait to save it until

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.149 
wouldn't really wait to save it until
like<00:01:25.350> towards<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> end<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> fight

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
like towards the end of the fight

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.109 
like towards the end of the fight
because<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.520> might<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.729> people<00:01:26.939> dead

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
because you might have people dead

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.380 
because you might have people dead
Exedra<00:01:28.110> personally<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.369> say<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.790> use

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
Exedra personally I would say just use

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.580 
Exedra personally I would say just use
it<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.630> soon<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.960> hit<00:01:31.049> twenty<00:01:31.290> percent

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it as soon as they hit twenty percent

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.870 
it as soon as they hit twenty percent
and<00:01:31.829> you'll<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.369> their<00:01:32.549> bar<00:01:32.700> go

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and you'll see their bar go

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.730 
and you'll see their bar go
automatically<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> 100<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> know

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
automatically up to 100 and so you know

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.109 
automatically up to 100 and so you know
when<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> happen<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> get

get it's on guess wiki in Group one and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.980 
get it's on guess wiki in Group one and
so<00:02:38.850> he<00:02:39.000> should<00:02:39.180> pop<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> cool<00:02:39.660> down<00:02:39.780> whenever

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
so he should pop a cool down whenever

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.780 
so he should pop a cool down whenever
the<00:02:40.230> dot<00:02:40.410> ends<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> doesn't<00:02:41.310> kill<00:02:41.460> him<00:02:41.640> but

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the dot ends so it doesn't kill him but

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
the dot ends so it doesn't kill him but
it<00:02:41.880> only<00:02:42.000> took<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.360> half<00:02:42.420> health<00:02:42.780> visitant<00:02:43.560> full

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it only took a half health visitant full

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.470 
it only took a half health visitant full

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
that's pretty much going to do is it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.120 
that's pretty much going to do is it

penetrating shot if you don't know what

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.660 
penetrating shot if you don't know what
that<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.020> it's<00:03:16.410> very<00:03:16.590> simple<00:03:16.860> ability<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
that is it's very simple ability it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.370 
that is it's very simple ability it
functions<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> same<00:03:18.390> way<00:03:18.450> as<00:03:18.690> skiers<00:03:19.020> aimed

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
functions the same way as skiers aimed

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.160 
functions the same way as skiers aimed

at in Paragons at the klaxxi except for

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.330 
at in Paragons at the klaxxi except for
you<00:03:22.260> don't<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> cleave<00:03:22.860> mechanic

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
you don't have to cleave mechanic

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.560 
you don't have to cleave mechanic
whenever<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.670> have<00:03:24.090> bunch<00:03:24.330> of<00:03:24.390> people

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
whenever you have bunch of people

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.110 
whenever you have bunch of people
standing<00:03:24.660> too<00:03:25.020> close<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:26.280> anyway<00:03:26.550> whenever

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
standing too close so anyway whenever

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.610 
standing too close so anyway whenever
they<00:03:27.239> get<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.480> about<00:03:27.630> ten<00:03:27.840> percent<00:03:28.020> or<00:03:28.440> five

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
they get to about ten percent or five

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.960 
they get to about ten percent or five
percent<00:03:28.980> then<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.370> pretty<00:03:29.520> much<00:03:29.610> start

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
percent then you can pretty much start

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.790 
percent then you can pretty much start
avoiding<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.840> turrets<00:03:31.170> or<00:03:31.260> ignoring<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
avoiding the turrets or ignoring the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.440 
avoiding the turrets or ignoring the
turrets<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.970> makes<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.270> very

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
turrets and what makes this very

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.090 
turrets and what makes this very
difficult<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.020> you<00:03:34.200> can't<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.590> kill<00:03:34.860> one<00:03:35.070> of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
difficult is you can't just kill one of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.920 
difficult is you can't just kill one of
them<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.489> they<00:03:35.820> had<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> lot<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.360> health<00:03:36.720> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
them and they had a lot of health and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930 
them and they had a lot of health and
like<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.560> makes<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.830> very<00:03:37.950> long<00:03:38.160> fight<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.850> you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
like this makes a very long fight so you

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.370 
like this makes a very long fight so you
want<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.150> make<00:03:39.180> sure<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.200> don't

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
want to make sure that like you don't

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.720 
want to make sure that like you don't
just<00:03:40.620> have<00:03:40.770> one<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.160> kind<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.370> just<00:03:41.580> gets

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
just have one that kind of just gets

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.610 
just have one that kind of just gets
ahead<00:03:41.970> at<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.150> other<00:03:42.330> two<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.810> keep<00:03:43.470> them

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
ahead at the other two and keep them

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080 
ahead at the other two and keep them
stacked<00:03:43.920> up<00:03:44.100> as<00:03:44.280> much<00:03:44.400> as<00:03:44.580> possible<00:03:44.730> of<00:03:45.030> course

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
stacked up as much as possible of course

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.759 
stacked up as much as possible of course
for<00:03:45.660> cleave<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.110> everything<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
for cleave and everything like that and

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.380 
for cleave and everything like that and
see<00:03:47.250> there<00:03:47.430> we've<00:03:47.640> got<00:03:47.670> one<00:03:48.000> right<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.330> the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
see there we've got one right in the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.479 
see there we've got one right in the
middle<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.810> us<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.380> it's<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.769> like<00:03:49.980> that's

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
middle of us and it's just like that's

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
middle of us and it's just like that's
really<00:03:50.820> really<00:03:51.120> bad<00:03:51.360> know<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:51.810> happens<00:03:52.140> like

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
really really bad know that happens like

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.509 
really really bad know that happens like
we<00:03:52.380> shouldn't<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.680> having<00:03:52.830> those<00:03:53.100> guys<00:03:53.280> there

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
we shouldn't be having those guys there

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.610 
we shouldn't be having those guys there
at<00:03:53.640> all<00:03:53.760> but<00:03:54.450> it's<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.930> very<00:03:55.080> important

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
at all but it's just very important

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.710 
at all but it's just very important
you're<00:03:55.830> on<00:03:55.920> top<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.280> that<00:03:56.340> stuff<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.330> know

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
you're on top of that stuff and you know

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.180 
you're on top of that stuff and you know
that's<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.170> arranged<00:03:58.620> everything<00:03:58.890> else

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.940 
to be able to pay attention and kill
those<00:04:00.900> turrets<00:04:01.170> because<00:04:01.440> turrets<00:04:01.800> cause

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
those turrets because turrets cause

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.620 
those turrets because turrets cause
people<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.400> kinds<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.700> problems<00:04:02.910> also

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
people all kinds of problems also

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.210 
people all kinds of problems also
because<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.080> have<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.320> run<00:04:04.440> with<00:04:04.590> rapid<00:04:05.040> fire

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
because you have to run with rapid fire

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.620 
because you have to run with rapid fire
there's<00:04:05.670> just<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.940> thousand<00:04:06.330> everything's

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
there's just a thousand everything's

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.630 
there's just a thousand everything's
going<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.989> during<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.290> fight<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.340> soon<00:04:08.459> as

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
going on during the fight and as soon as

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.040 
going on during the fight and as soon as
they<00:04:08.730> reach<00:04:08.910> about<00:04:09.120> like<00:04:09.330> one<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.690> two<00:04:09.720> percent

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
they reach about like one to two percent

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.570 
they reach about like one to two percent
you<00:04:10.620> can<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.830> everybody<00:04:11.160> pop<00:04:11.370> their

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
you can have everybody pop their

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.570 
you can have everybody pop their
cooldowns<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.209> AOE<00:04:12.660> them<00:04:12.900> down<00:04:13.110> at<00:04:13.680> we<00:04:14.400> got

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
cooldowns and AOE them down at we got

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.220 
cooldowns and AOE them down at we got
this<00:04:14.700> achievement<00:04:15.060> like<00:04:15.330> it<00:04:15.570> happened<00:04:16.140> very

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this achievement like it happened very

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.409 
this achievement like it happened very
easily<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.890> us<00:04:17.010> honestly<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.090> wouldn't

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
easily for us honestly and so I wouldn't

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.759 
easily for us honestly and so I wouldn't
really<00:04:18.750> say<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.169> it's<00:04:19.320> going<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.500> be<00:04:19.590> too

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
really say that it's going to be too

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.710 
really say that it's going to be too
hard<00:04:19.799> as<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.220> see<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.580> like<00:04:20.700> maybe<00:04:20.940> four

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
hard as you can see it's like maybe four

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.960 
hard as you can see it's like maybe four
seconds<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.130> have<00:04:23.220> plenty<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.580> time<00:04:23.789> to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
seconds and so we have plenty of time to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.120 
seconds and so we have plenty of time to
spare<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.840> you<00:04:25.320> guys<00:04:25.440> really<00:04:25.680> shouldn't<00:04:26.039> have

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
spare and you guys really shouldn't have

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.540 
spare and you guys really shouldn't have
too<00:04:26.250> much

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
too much

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.040 
too much
with<00:04:26.759> this<00:04:26.909> as<00:04:27.120> long<00:04:27.270> as<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.449> make<00:04:27.599> sure<00:04:27.780> that

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
with this as long as you make sure that

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.439 
with this as long as you make sure that
you're<00:04:28.169> able<00:04:28.259> to<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:29.310> know<00:04:29.400> control<00:04:29.879> them<00:04:30.120> and

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
you're able to you know control them and

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.850 
you're able to you know control them and
control<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.900> abilities<00:04:31.229> and<00:04:31.379> avoid<00:04:31.620> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
control the abilities and avoid the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.350 
control the abilities and avoid the
mechanics<00:04:32.310> like<00:04:32.490> avoiding<00:04:32.759> mechanics<00:04:33.210> and

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
mechanics like avoiding mechanics and

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.730 
mechanics like avoiding mechanics and
being<00:04:33.930> able<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.169> deal<00:04:34.289> with<00:04:34.409> those<00:04:34.560> is

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
being able to deal with those is

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.960 
being able to deal with those is
probably<00:04:34.949> going<00:04:35.069> to<00:04:35.129> be<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.250> biggest<00:04:35.460> part<00:04:35.789> of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
probably going to be the biggest part of

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.909 
probably going to be the biggest part of
this<00:04:36.180> fight<00:04:36.389> but<00:04:37.050> anyway<00:04:37.379> guys<00:04:37.530> that's<00:04:37.590> how

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
they get the achievement be quicker be

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.909 
they get the achievement be quicker be
dead<00:04:39.449> so<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.289> pretty<00:04:40.409> much<00:04:40.530> all<00:04:40.680> again

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
dead so it's pretty much all again

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.499
