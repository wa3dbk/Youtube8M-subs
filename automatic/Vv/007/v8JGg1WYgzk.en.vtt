quite durable as well the only thing
that<00:03:58.919> I<00:03:59.009> couldn't<00:03:59.340> say<00:03:59.489> about<00:03:59.699> these<00:03:59.879> gloves

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
that I couldn't say about these gloves

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.689 
that I couldn't say about these gloves
is<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.569> you<00:04:00.780> must<00:04:01.079> get<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.739> gloves<00:04:02.009> one<00:04:02.430> size

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
is that you must get the gloves one size

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.909 
is that you must get the gloves one size
bigger<00:04:03.000> because<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:03.599> is<00:04:03.719> a<00:04:03.750> negative<00:04:04.169> cut<00:04:04.709> and

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
bigger because it is a negative cut and

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.849 
bigger because it is a negative cut and
usually<00:04:05.790> I'm<00:04:05.909> a<00:04:05.939> size<00:04:06.209> 9<00:04:06.569> but<00:04:06.870> now<00:04:07.079> I<00:04:07.289> change<00:04:07.680> it

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
usually I'm a size 9 but now I change it

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.979 
usually I'm a size 9 but now I change it
to<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:08.009> size<00:04:08.310> 10<00:04:08.669> this<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.479> because<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
to a size 10 this is because the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.779 
to a size 10 this is because the
negative<00:04:10.139> cut<00:04:10.590> glove<00:04:10.829> is<00:04:11.009> generally<00:04:11.639> a<00:04:11.669> little

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:11.789 
negative cut glove is generally a little

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.729 
negative cut glove is generally a little
bit<00:04:12.150> tighter
