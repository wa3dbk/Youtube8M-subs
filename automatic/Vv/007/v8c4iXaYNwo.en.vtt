 that had been of maturity 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.310
 in those years in fact lorenzen was also passionate about philosophy and

 immediately after the war there were strong controversies 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:32.289
 many accuse lenzenzetti of having been a sister 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.680
 found wise in which the Austrian scientist had argued the need

 of a reproductive selection to avoid race degeneration 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.449
 in 1949

 obsessed with the fear that man will drive himself to the domestic world 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:54.389
