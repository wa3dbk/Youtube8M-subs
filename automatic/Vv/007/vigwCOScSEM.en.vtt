00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
became evident that this just wasn't

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
became evident that this just wasn't
going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> happen<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.490> bruins<00:01:50.909> just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
going to happen because the bruins just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to happen because the bruins just
couldn't<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.450> any<00:01:51.600> breaks<00:01:51.869> whatsoever

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
couldn't get any breaks whatsoever

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
couldn't get any breaks whatsoever
although<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.100> were<00:01:53.159> knocking<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> door

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
although they were knocking on the door

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
although they were knocking on the door
it<00:01:54.509> did<00:01:54.869> feel<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.500> point<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
it did feel like at some point the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.469 
it did feel like at some point the
bruins<00:01:56.340> were<00:01:56.430> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> score<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.000> least<00:01:57.030> one

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
bruins were going to score at least one

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
bruins were going to score at least one
goal<00:01:57.720> because<00:01:57.869> they're<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.350> playing<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
goal because they're really playing so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
goal because they're really playing so
well<00:01:59.220> that's<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.299> thing<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.600> was<00:02:00.720> crazy<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
well that's the thing that was crazy the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.410 
well that's the thing that was crazy the
worst<00:02:01.829> player<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.549> ice<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.000> whole<00:02:03.149> entire

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
worst player on the ice the whole entire

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
worst player on the ice the whole entire
night<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.930> Bruins<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.829> Tuukka<00:02:05.189> Rask<00:02:05.299> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
night for the Bruins was Tuukka Rask the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.179 
night for the Bruins was Tuukka Rask the
second<00:02:06.750> worst<00:02:06.899> player<00:02:07.229> was<00:02:07.409> David<00:02:07.770> Krejci<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.189 
second worst player was David Krejci I

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:10.190 
second worst player was David Krejci I
thought<00:02:08.429> David<00:02:08.639> Krejci<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.509> horrible<00:02:10.079> in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
thought David Krejci was horrible in

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.490 
thought David Krejci was horrible in
this<00:02:10.349> game<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.829> I<00:02:11.249> thought<00:02:11.519> Tuukka<00:02:11.879> Rask

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
this game and I thought Tuukka Rask

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.950 
this game and I thought Tuukka Rask
a<00:02:12.530> bad<00:02:12.800> night<00:02:13.100> those<00:02:13.820> two<00:02:14.060> guys<00:02:14.240> were<00:02:14.540> horrible

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
a bad night those two guys were horrible

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.070 
a bad night those two guys were horrible
and<00:02:15.140> for<00:02:16.130> whatever<00:02:16.310> reason<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.870> get

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
and for whatever reason so then you get

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.180 
and for whatever reason so then you get
to<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.940> third<00:02:20.570> period<00:02:20.870> when<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.380> Rangers

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
to the third period when the Rangers

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.580 
to the third period when the Rangers
have<00:02:22.310> now<00:02:22.460> gone<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.850> 320<00:02:23.570> three<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.380> nothing

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
have now gone up 320 three to nothing

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.130 
have now gone up 320 three to nothing
and<00:02:25.010> that's<00:02:25.460> when<00:02:25.760> even<00:02:26.420> some<00:02:26.600> Bruins<00:02:26.900> fans

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
and that's when even some Bruins fans

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.530 
and that's when even some Bruins fans
started<00:02:27.530> leaving<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.520> mean<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.700> turn<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.209> TV

miraculous comeback to make it 3 to 3
which<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.280> just<00:02:58.489> insane<00:02:59.290> by<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.350> way

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
which is just insane by the way

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.140 
which is just insane by the way
something<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.250> don't<00:03:01.489> expect<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.910> happen

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
something you don't expect to happen

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.360 
something you don't expect to happen
especially<00:03:02.690> against<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.590> going<00:03:03.980> like<00:03:04.130> long

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
especially against a going like long

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.140 
especially against a going like long
quest<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:06.340> nevertheless<00:03:07.340> they<00:03:07.700> had<00:03:07.820> nothing

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
quest but nevertheless they had nothing

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.910 
quest but nevertheless they had nothing
to<00:03:08.239> lose<00:03:08.390> they<00:03:08.600> went<00:03:08.810> for<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.260> they<00:03:09.440> got<00:03:09.739> it

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
to lose they went for it and they got it

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.160 
to lose they went for it and they got it
and<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:11.090> has<00:03:11.270> been<00:03:11.300> something<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.870> Bruins

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
and this has been something the Bruins

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.690 
and this has been something the Bruins
have<00:03:12.260> actually<00:03:12.590> done<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:12.800> few<00:03:13.040> times<00:03:13.280> over<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
have actually done a few times over the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.550 
have actually done a few times over the
last<00:03:13.880> few<00:03:14.150> years<00:03:14.239> pulled<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.140> goalie<00:03:15.290> and

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
last few years pulled the goalie and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.830 
last few years pulled the goalie and
scored<00:03:15.860> on<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.160> but<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.760> don't<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.720> I

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
scored on it but I don't and I and I

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.970 
scored on it but I don't and I and I
think<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.230> might<00:03:18.350> have<00:03:18.410> happened<00:03:18.530> one<00:03:18.950> other

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
think it might have happened one other

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
think it might have happened one other
time<00:03:19.610> where<00:03:20.180> they<00:03:20.299> pulled<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.660> goalie<00:03:20.690> twice

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
time where they pulled the goalie twice

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.630 
time where they pulled the goalie twice
and<00:03:21.440> scored<00:03:21.500> twice<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:22.160> might<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.400> been<00:03:22.459> last

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
and scored twice it might have been last

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.430 
and scored twice it might have been last
year<00:03:22.940> or<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> year<00:03:23.150> before<00:03:23.299> I<00:03:23.660> can't<00:03:24.049> remember

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
year or the year before I can't remember
