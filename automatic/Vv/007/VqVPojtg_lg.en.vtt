remember<00:03:24.500> Brona<00:03:24.799> exercised<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.549> rematch

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
remember Brona exercised the rematch

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.180 
remember Brona exercised the rematch
clause<00:03:26.180> in<00:03:26.449> his<00:03:26.510> contract<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:27.199> Floyd<00:03:28.040> has

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
clause in his contract and Floyd has

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.670 
clause in his contract and Floyd has
managed<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.489> override<00:03:29.000> all<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.680> obviously

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
managed to override all that obviously

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.469 
managed to override all that obviously
in<00:03:30.889> exchange<00:03:31.340> he's<00:03:31.639> had<00:03:31.819> Broner<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.359> his

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:32.479 
in exchange he's had Broner on his

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.319 
in exchange he's had Broner on his
undercard<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.470> maybe<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:34.639> could<00:03:34.790> see<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.150> as

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
undercard so maybe you could see that as

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.369 
undercard so maybe you could see that as
a<00:03:35.690> fair<00:03:36.680> trade<00:03:37.010> possibly<00:03:37.609> but<00:03:38.359> just<00:03:38.690> as<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:38.900> man

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
a fair trade possibly but just as a man

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.649 
a fair trade possibly but just as a man
