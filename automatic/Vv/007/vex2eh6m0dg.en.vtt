everyone in this area I'm going to have
the<00:01:47.880> terminal<00:01:48.240> server<00:01:48.509> dictate<00:01:49.170> who<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the terminal server dictate who the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
the terminal server dictate who the
printer<00:01:50.280> deployment<00:01:50.819> is<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.389> go<00:01:51.569> to<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
printer deployment is going to go to so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.779 
printer deployment is going to go to so
this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.469> a<00:01:52.530> great<00:01:52.859> solution<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.490> task

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
this is a great solution for a task

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.969 
this is a great solution for a task
worker<00:01:54.179> well<00:01:54.749> let's<00:01:54.869> log<00:01:55.200> off<00:01:55.499> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
worker well let's log off this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.739 
worker well let's log off this
application<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.119> remember<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:57.539> just

application because remember we're just
in<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:57.990> application<00:01:58.189> sometimes<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.549> need<00:01:59.700> more

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
in an application sometimes we need more

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.269 
in an application sometimes we need more
than<00:02:00.060> an<00:02:00.270> application<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.409> need<00:02:01.649> an<00:02:01.859> entire
