know and I think that's what or at least
I<00:01:17.549> felt<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.030> people<00:01:18.180> didn't<00:01:18.509> understand<00:01:18.990> you

people<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.920> PTSD<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.090> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> living

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
people with PTSD like it is a living

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.399 
people with PTSD like it is a living
like<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.509> depression<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.290> know

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
like it's not just depression you know

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.340 
like it's not just depression you know
it's<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.159> oh<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.689> feel<00:01:27.689> hopeless<00:01:28.229> or

it's not just like oh I feel hopeless or

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
it's not just like oh I feel hopeless or
something<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.220> literally

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
something like that it is literally

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
something like that it is literally
physically<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.259> brain-wise<00:01:31.890> like

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
physically and brain-wise like

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.080 
physically and brain-wise like
unbearable<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.680> was<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.970> know

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
unbearable and that that was you know

unbearable and that that was you know
like<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.680> least<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.040> assume

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
like I think that's at least I assume

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.620 
like I think that's at least I assume
that's<00:01:38.520> why<00:01:38.700> people<00:01:38.970> kill<00:01:39.119> themselves<00:01:39.180> it's

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that's why people kill themselves it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
that's why people kill themselves it's
not<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.530> mean<00:01:41.430> maybe<00:01:41.549> somebody

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
not out of like I mean maybe somebody

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.420 
not out of like I mean maybe somebody
does<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.390> circumstance<00:01:42.990> um<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.979> try

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
does it out of circumstance um and I try
