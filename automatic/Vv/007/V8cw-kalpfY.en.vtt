00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
as hard as a lot people make it out to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.980 
as hard as a lot people make it out to
be<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.460> try<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> read<00:00:15.089> music<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.809> can

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
be in if you try to read music it can

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.689 
be in if you try to read music it can
take<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.170> long<00:00:16.500> time<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.160> very<00:00:17.369> complicated

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
take a long time to be very complicated

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.570 
take a long time to be very complicated
I'd<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.690> very<00:00:18.779> complicated<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.800> if<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.550> are

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I'd be very complicated but if you are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
I'd be very complicated but if you are
just<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.060> few<00:00:21.090> basic<00:00:21.420> chords<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.230> say<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> G

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
just a few basic chords let's say the G

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.679 
just a few basic chords let's say the G
C<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.490> D<00:00:23.670> chord<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:25.140> just<00:00:25.500> those<00:00:25.680> chords

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.209 

so<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.529> play<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.949> chord

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so what you do is just play the chord

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920 
so what you do is just play the chord
with<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.460> right<00:00:32.640> hand<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.270> bass<00:00:33.480> notes<00:00:33.780> with
