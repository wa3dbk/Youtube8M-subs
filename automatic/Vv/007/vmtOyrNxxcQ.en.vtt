00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
has all-call in it that's a problem

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.380 
has all-call in it that's a problem
we're<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:49.309> well<00:00:50.309> we're<00:00:50.670> macerated<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.239> what

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
we're going well we're macerated so what

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.150 
we're going well we're macerated so what
we<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.379> heat<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> port

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we can do is we can heat up the port

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
we can do is we can heat up the port
wine<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.820> bowl<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> microwave<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.379> draw

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to cut the sugar way down let's do it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
to cut the sugar way down let's do it
cut<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> sugar<00:01:06.479> down<00:01:06.720> let's<00:01:06.960> make<00:01:07.110> sure<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
cut the sugar down let's make sure that

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
cut the sugar down let's make sure that
we're<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.500> spiking<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:07.950> blood<00:01:08.189> sugar<00:01:08.460> level

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
we're not spiking your blood sugar level
let's<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.600> extent<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.290> want

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

let's go to that extent because I want
everyone<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.220> go<00:01:11.430> through<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.760> extent<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
everyone to go through that extent to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
everyone to go through that extent to
keep<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> sugar<00:01:12.720> low<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.560> we

were soaking for about an hour the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.539 
were soaking for about an hour the
longer<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.710> can<00:01:28.799> soak<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> more<00:01:29.310> flavor

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
longer you can soak it the more flavor

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.920 
longer you can soak it the more flavor
gonna<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> small<00:01:30.450> sauce<00:01:30.720> pot

gonna get out I have a small sauce pot

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.390 
gonna get out I have a small sauce pot
here<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.500> gonna<00:01:31.590> start<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.220> our

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
here we're gonna start right in on our

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.630 
here we're gonna start right in on our
sauce<00:01:32.640> by<00:01:33.630> sautéing<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.229> onions<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.829> once

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sauce by sautéing some onions and once

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
sauce by sautéing some onions and once
again<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> figs<00:01:36.180> are<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.720> high<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.350> sugar

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
again the figs are so high in sugar

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
again the figs are so high in sugar
that's<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.490> cup<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that's one cup I think is about a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840 
that's one cup I think is about a
hundred<00:01:40.110> grams<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.860> sugar<00:01:41.159> which<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
hundred grams of sugar which is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.749 
hundred grams of sugar which is
equivalent<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> three<00:01:42.990> Snickers<00:01:43.500> bars<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.430> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
equivalent to three Snickers bars so I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.670 
equivalent to three Snickers bars so I
don't<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.689> stickers<00:01:45.930> mark<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.560> them

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
don't I like stickers mark I like them

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.830 
don't I like stickers mark I like them
too<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.759> isn't<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.119> cheat<00:01:48.329> day<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
too but this isn't a cheat day this is a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
too but this isn't a cheat day this is a
legitimate<00:01:49.259> recipe<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.070> we<00:01:50.189> want<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.549> do

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
legitimate recipe that we want to do

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.130 
legitimate recipe that we want to do
that<00:01:50.850> doesn't<00:01:51.090> spike<00:01:51.299> our<00:01:51.479> blood<00:01:51.659> sugar<00:01:51.689> level

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that doesn't spike our blood sugar level

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
that doesn't spike our blood sugar level
so<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.649> appreciate<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.280> we're<00:01:53.369> taking<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
so I do appreciate that we're taking the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.870 
so I do appreciate that we're taking the
time<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:55.290> separate<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> cut<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> down

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
time to separate it and to cut it down

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.810 
time to separate it and to cut it down

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
add in again just a few pieces of fig in

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
add in again just a few pieces of fig in
there<00:02:42.360> just<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.930> couple<00:02:42.960> of<00:02:43.200> figs<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.920> flip

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
there just a couple of figs on the flip

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.330 
there just a couple of figs on the flip
side<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.910> figs<00:02:45.210> are<00:02:45.450> high<00:02:45.840> in<00:02:46.200> fiber<00:02:46.590> they're

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
side the figs are high in fiber they're

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.770 
side the figs are high in fiber they're
not<00:02:47.460> high<00:02:47.610> enough<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:48.090> fiber<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:48.570> they<00:02:48.660> are

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
not high enough in fiber but they are

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
not high enough in fiber but they are
high<00:02:48.960> in<00:02:48.990> dietary<00:02:49.200> fiber<00:02:49.530> which<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:49.950> good<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.030> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
high in dietary fiber which is good so a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.940 
high in dietary fiber which is good so a
will<00:02:51.300> buffer<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.080> release<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.470> sugar<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.860> your

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
will buffer the release of sugar in your

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.490 
will buffer the release of sugar in your
bloodstream<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:54.210> a<00:02:54.240> certain<00:02:54.630> extent<00:02:54.930> okay

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bloodstream to a certain extent okay

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.050
