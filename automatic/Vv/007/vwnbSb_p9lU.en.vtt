anyway I'm playing this with the spectre
the<00:01:14.220> spectre<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> able<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the spectre I would like to be able to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.140 
the spectre I would like to be able to
say<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.650> i<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.890> compare<00:01:17.340> anything<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.939> black

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

ops anything in any previous game but
honestly<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.780> spectre<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.100> its

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
honestly the spectre is pretty much its

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
honestly the spectre is pretty much its
own<00:01:23.460> gun<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> cross

low<00:02:04.110> fire<00:02:04.469> rate<00:02:04.500> guns<00:02:04.979> though<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.270> ain't

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
low fire rate guns though so this ain't

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.650 
low fire rate guns though so this ain't
exactly<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.110> gun<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.530> me<00:02:07.649> besides<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.300> Chi

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
exactly the gun for me besides the Chi

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.050 
exactly the gun for me besides the Chi
Paris<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.530> better<00:02:10.800> than<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.190> gun<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.670> every

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
Paris is better than this gun in every

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.150 
Paris is better than this gun in every
single<00:02:12.270> way<00:02:12.480> unless<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.620> like

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
single way unless you like

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.340 
single way unless you like
tons<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.490> don't<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.300> higher<00:02:15.870> rates<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
tons that don't have higher rates of

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.130 
tons that don't have higher rates of
fire<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.340> will<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.540> kill<00:02:18.840> people

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
fire and then will you know kill people

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.140 
fire and then will you know kill people
faster<00:02:19.590> now<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> make<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> mistake<00:02:20.640> by

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
faster now here I make a mistake by

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.540 
faster now here I make a mistake by
turning<00:02:21.480> around<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.200> don't<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.340> know

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
turning around I don't know I don't know

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.890 
turning around I don't know I don't know
what<00:02:23.790> possessed<00:02:23.940> me<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.390> think<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.690> they

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
what possessed me to think that they

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.110 
what possessed me to think that they
were<00:02:24.960> behind<00:02:25.320> me<00:02:25.530> but<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.250> turned<00:02:26.700> around<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
were behind me but I turned around and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
were behind me but I turned around and
got<00:02:27.270> myself<00:02:27.480> killed<00:02:27.980> anyway<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.430> I'm

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
got myself killed anyway you can see I'm

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.000 
got myself killed anyway you can see I'm
playing<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.940> grid<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.350> map<00:02:31.590> really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
playing on grid and this map really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.320 
playing on grid and this map really
reminds<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.520> block<00:02:32.820> from<00:02:33.090> call<00:02:33.360> duty<00:02:33.540> 4<00:02:33.920> but

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
reminds me a block from call duty 4 but

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.900 
reminds me a block from call duty 4 but
this<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.720> map<00:02:36.960> isn't<00:02:37.470> nearly<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.220> linear<00:02:38.700> as

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
this this map isn't nearly as linear as

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.660 
this this map isn't nearly as linear as
block<00:02:39.420> because<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.800> little<00:02:41.130> areas

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
block because there are little areas

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.370 
block because there are little areas
outside<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:46.140> yeah<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
outside that you can go to but so yeah I

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.810 
outside that you can go to but so yeah I
don't<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.190> map<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.430> anywhere

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
don't think that this map is anywhere

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.600 
don't think that this map is anywhere
near<00:02:47.880> as<00:02:48.180> bad<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:48.660> block<00:02:49.020> was<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.460> good

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
near as bad as block was but it's a good

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.520 
near as bad as block was but it's a good
nap<00:02:50.880> nonetheless<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.140> see<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.500> that

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
nap nonetheless so you can see here that

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.670 
nap nonetheless so you can see here that
I'm<00:02:55.800> doing<00:02:56.070> okay<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:57.020> generally<00:02:58.020> don't<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.500> was

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
I'm doing okay I generally don't do was

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.710 
I'm doing okay I generally don't do was
good<00:02:58.980> at<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.340> this<00:02:59.610> game<00:02:59.850> as<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.060> didn't<00:03:00.390> modern

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
good at in this game as I didn't modern

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440 
good at in this game as I didn't modern
warfare<00:03:00.870> 2<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.530> swear<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.460> went<00:03:02.730> back<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> modern

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
warfare 2 I swear I went back to modern

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.100 
warfare 2 I swear I went back to modern
warfare<00:03:03.660> 2<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.640> yeah<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.030> hit<00:03:06.360> detection<00:03:06.540> is

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
warfare 2 and yeah the hit detection is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.970 
warfare 2 and yeah the hit detection is
amazing<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.190> game<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:09.530> don't<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.770> think

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
amazing on that game I don't I think

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.310 
amazing on that game I don't I think
that<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.520> game<00:03:11.640> honestly<00:03:12.330> does<00:03:12.690> just<00:03:13.200> have

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
that this game honestly does just have

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.830 
that this game honestly does just have
problems<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.800> hit<00:03:14.040> detection<00:03:14.190> even<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.210> even

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
problems with hit detection even it even

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.960 
problems with hit detection even it even
with<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.140> framerate<00:03:16.470> issues<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.670> lag

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
with the framerate issues and the lag

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.900 
with the framerate issues and the lag
even<00:03:18.870> looking<00:03:19.260> beyond<00:03:19.650> all<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.520> still

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
even looking beyond all that I still

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.520 
even looking beyond all that I still
think<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.420> game<00:03:21.690> has<00:03:21.720> some<00:03:22.260> hit

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
think that this game has some hit

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.310 
think that this game has some hit
detection<00:03:22.709> issues<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.700> well<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.330> mean<00:03:25.020> I<00:03:25.140> go

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
detection issues as well I mean I go

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.280 
detection issues as well I mean I go
back<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.530> call<00:03:25.860> duty<00:03:26.070> 4<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.820> god<00:03:27.480> damn<00:03:27.840> i<00:03:28.080> can

will come for me and I have a feeling
it's<00:04:01.440> because<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:02.010> spawns<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:02.970> game<00:04:03.239> are

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
it's because the spawns in this game are

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.210 
it's because the spawns in this game are
much<00:04:03.840> different<00:04:04.140> than<00:04:04.470> they<00:04:04.650> weren't<00:04:04.980> called

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
much different than they weren't called

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.840 
much different than they weren't called
in<00:04:05.820> a<00:04:06.060> modern<00:04:06.510> warfare<00:04:06.660> 2<00:04:07.190> like<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.580> modern

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
in a modern warfare 2 like in modern

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.250 
in a modern warfare 2 like in modern
like<00:04:09.120> I've<00:04:09.270> said<00:04:09.480> before<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.959> modern<00:04:10.230> warfare

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
like I've said before in modern warfare

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.190 
like I've said before in modern warfare
2<00:04:10.860> there<00:04:11.610> was<00:04:11.850> a<00:04:11.880> much<00:04:12.150> more<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:13.080> know

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
2 there was a much more you know

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.500 
2 there was a much more you know
straightforward<00:04:14.040> spawning<00:04:14.370> system<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.180> this

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
straightforward spawning system and this

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.960 
straightforward spawning system and this
in<00:04:15.930> black<00:04:16.290> ops<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.980> you<00:04:17.310> kind<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.609> seem<00:04:17.820> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
in black ops you can you kind of seem to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.360 
in black ops you can you kind of seem to
spawn<00:04:18.270> all<00:04:18.540> over<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.049> place<00:04:19.320> and<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:20.100> think

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
spawn all over the place and I think

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.010 
spawn all over the place and I think
that<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.549> makes<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.660> little<00:04:21.900> more

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
that that makes it a little more

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.380 
that that makes it a little more
possible<00:04:22.680> for<00:04:22.890> them<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.039> spawn<00:04:23.430> closer<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.240> you

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
possible for them to spawn closer to you

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.920 
possible for them to spawn closer to you
and<00:04:24.630> therefore<00:04:25.500> makes<00:04:26.010> it

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
and therefore makes it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.570 
and therefore makes it
hmm<00:04:27.930> much<00:04:28.380> more<00:04:28.680> possible<00:04:28.949> for<00:04:29.430> them<00:04:29.550> to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
hmm much more possible for them to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.790 
hmm much more possible for them to
actually<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.870> don't<00:04:33.960> actually<00:04:34.380> get<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.620> your

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
actually you don't actually get to your

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.779 
actually you don't actually get to your
