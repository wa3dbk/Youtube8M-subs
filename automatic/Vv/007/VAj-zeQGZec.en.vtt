00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
Amazon of course recommended the lock

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.720 
Amazon of course recommended the lock
ring<00:00:08.000> which<00:00:08.540> I<00:00:08.660> initially<00:00:09.020> did<00:00:09.200> not<00:00:09.350> buy<00:00:09.730> then

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
ring which I initially did not buy then

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:11.859 
ring which I initially did not buy then
I<00:00:10.760> thought<00:00:10.969> I'd<00:00:11.090> better<00:00:11.209> take<00:00:11.420> a<00:00:11.450> quick<00:00:11.719> look

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:11.869 
I thought I'd better take a quick look

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.080 
I thought I'd better take a quick look
at<00:00:12.110> my<00:00:12.139> pump<00:00:12.860> and<00:00:13.100> see<00:00:13.639> if<00:00:13.730> I<00:00:13.789> can<00:00:13.910> get<00:00:14.000> this

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
at my pump and see if I can get this

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.580 
at my pump and see if I can get this
lock<00:00:14.330> ring<00:00:14.539> off<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.869> it<00:00:14.930> looks<00:00:15.230> like<00:00:15.410> it's

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
lock ring off and it looks like it's

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.740 
lock ring off and it looks like it's
going<00:00:15.709> to<00:00:15.770> crumble<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:17.030> idea<00:00:17.270> here<00:00:17.510> is<00:00:17.630> you

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
going to crumble the idea here is you

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.900 
going to crumble the idea here is you
need<00:00:17.840> to<00:00:17.900> pull<00:00:18.110> this<00:00:18.260> back<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:18.860> then<00:00:19.730> give

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
need to pull this back and then give

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.680 
need to pull this back and then give
this<00:00:20.030> a<00:00:20.090> spin<00:00:20.950> counterclockwise<00:00:22.630> so<00:00:23.630> I'm

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
this a spin counterclockwise so I'm

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.520 
this a spin counterclockwise so I'm
going<00:00:23.810> to<00:00:23.870> go<00:00:23.930> ahead<00:00:23.990> and<00:00:24.170> set<00:00:24.290> the<00:00:24.350> camera

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
going to go ahead and set the camera

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.440 
going to go ahead and set the camera
down<00:00:24.770> and<00:00:24.890> see<00:00:24.980> if<00:00:25.070> that<00:00:25.220> is<00:00:25.700> going<00:00:25.940> to<00:00:26.000> work<00:00:26.210> if

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
down and see if that is going to work if

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.320 
down and see if that is going to work if
not<00:00:26.530> my<00:00:27.530> my<00:00:28.220> strategy<00:00:28.730> is<00:00:28.789> basically<00:00:28.970> going<00:00:29.270> to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
not my my strategy is basically going to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:40.000 
not my my strategy is basically going to
be<00:00:29.680> breaking<00:00:30.680> these<00:00:31.010> off<00:00:38.710> all<00:00:39.710> right<00:00:39.859> let's

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
be breaking these off all right let's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.259 
be breaking these off all right let's
see<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:40.129> happens<00:00:40.579> here<00:00:40.699> we<00:00:40.819> just<00:00:40.940> give<00:00:41.149> it<00:00:41.210> a

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
see what happens here we just give it a

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.660 
see what happens here we just give it a
couple<00:00:41.449> gentle<00:00:42.440> taps<00:00:42.739> see<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:43.399> it's<00:00:43.519> going<00:00:43.609> to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
couple gentle taps see if it's going to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:01:02.349 
couple gentle taps see if it's going to
move<00:01:00.399> okay<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.609> can<00:01:01.729> see<00:01:01.760> after<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.149> little

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
move okay so you can see after a little

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.329 
move okay so you can see after a little
bit<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.780> persuasive<00:01:03.170> hammering<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.010> some

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
bit of a persuasive hammering and some

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.340 
bit of a persuasive hammering and some
chiseling<00:01:04.760> with<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.909> screwdriver<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:05.720> chipped

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
chiseling with a screwdriver I chipped

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.620 
chiseling with a screwdriver I chipped
away<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:06.860> basically<00:01:07.490> removed<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.330> metal

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
away and I basically removed the metal

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.360 
away and I basically removed the metal
from<00:01:08.780> underneath<00:01:09.200> these<00:01:09.410> tabs<00:01:09.770> because<00:01:10.250> these

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
from underneath these tabs because these

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.060 
from underneath these tabs because these
tabs<00:01:10.640> kind<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.230> hook<00:01:12.230> in<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.680> that's<00:01:12.800> how<00:01:12.950> it

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
tabs kind of hook in and that's how it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.670 
tabs kind of hook in and that's how it
locked<00:01:13.340> down<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.730> was<00:01:16.880> able<00:01:17.120> to<00:01:17.530> get<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.650> to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
locked down and I was able to get it to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.100 
locked down and I was able to get it to
spin<00:01:24.310> okay<00:01:25.310> I'm<00:01:26.270> actually<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.840> go<00:01:26.960> ahead

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
spin okay I'm actually going to go ahead

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.480 
spin okay I'm actually going to go ahead
and<00:01:27.230> drain<00:01:27.950> all<00:01:28.160> this<00:01:28.370> gas<00:01:28.580> out<00:01:28.880> anyways<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.660> I

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
and drain all this gas out anyways and I

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.790 
and drain all this gas out anyways and I
probably<00:01:31.490> won't<00:01:31.700> run<00:01:31.910> it<00:01:32.030> through<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.330> Blazer

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
probably won't run it through the Blazer

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
probably won't run it through the Blazer
but<00:01:33.800> I<00:01:33.830> think<00:01:34.100> it'd<00:01:34.190> be<00:01:34.220> fine<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.730> the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
but I think it'd be fine in the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.340 
but I think it'd be fine in the
lawnmower<00:01:35.270> maybe<00:01:35.690> I'll<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:35.990> run<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.290> through

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
lawnmower maybe I'll just run it through

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
lawnmower maybe I'll just run it through
a<00:01:36.590> filter<00:01:37.550> or<00:01:37.760> something<00:01:40.720> that's<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.020> so

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
a filter or something that's it so

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.380 
a filter or something that's it so
obviously<00:01:42.800> if<00:01:43.250> you're<00:01:43.400> doing<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:43.760> job<00:01:44.060> I

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
obviously if you're doing this job I

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.520 
obviously if you're doing this job I
guess<00:01:45.020> I'd<00:01:45.170> recommend<00:01:45.710> buying<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.670> lock<00:01:46.880> ring

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
guess I'd recommend buying the lock ring

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.230 
guess I'd recommend buying the lock ring
I'm<00:01:48.530> going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.770> go<00:01:48.830> ahead<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.160> remove<00:01:49.850> the

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'm going to go ahead and remove the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:02.600 
I'm going to go ahead and remove the
pump<00:01:50.510> here<00:01:50.720> from<00:01:50.900> the<00:01:51.020> tank

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.649 

okay<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:03.820> can<00:02:03.940> see<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.119> my<00:02:04.330> tank

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
okay so you can see you have my tank

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.190 
okay so you can see you have my tank
completely<00:02:05.080> empty<00:02:05.350> got<00:02:06.040> my<00:02:06.159> new<00:02:06.280> pump<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.840> I'm

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
completely empty got my new pump and I'm

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.870 
completely empty got my new pump and I'm
going<00:02:08.350> to<00:02:08.410> go<00:02:08.470> ahead<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.740> install<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:11.880> okay

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
going to go ahead and install that okay

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120 
going to go ahead and install that okay
so<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.120> pump<00:02:13.330> came<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> new<00:02:13.959> gasket<00:02:14.590> even

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
so the pump came with a new gasket even

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.420 
so the pump came with a new gasket even
though<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.250> pulled<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.760> old<00:02:15.790> one<00:02:16.090> off<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:18.250> use

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
though I pulled the old one off we use

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
though I pulled the old one off we use
the<00:02:18.640> new<00:02:18.790> one<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.150> put<00:02:22.300> that

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:31.009 
the new one here I'm going to put that
on<00:02:22.690> before<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:23.380> put<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.709> our<00:02:26.670> fuel<00:02:27.670> gauge<00:02:27.940> float

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.330 

kind<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.080> excited<00:02:32.470> about<00:02:32.530> because<00:02:32.950> my<00:02:33.070> fuel

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
kind of excited about because my fuel

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.770 
kind of excited about because my fuel
gauge<00:02:33.400> hasn't<00:02:33.880> worked<00:02:34.030> since<00:02:34.300> I've<00:02:34.480> owned<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
gauge hasn't worked since I've owned the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.300 
gauge hasn't worked since I've owned the
vehicle<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:37.660> don't<00:02:37.750> want<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:37.989> break<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.320> slide

remember<00:03:07.450> from<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.959> removal<00:03:08.769> video<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.340> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
remember from the removal video that the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.090 
remember from the removal video that the
lines<00:03:10.870> are<00:03:11.049> facing<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.500> back<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.950> there's

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
lines are facing the back and there's

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.680 
lines are facing the back and there's
also<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.640> notch<00:03:12.940> here<00:03:13.329> I<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.570> know<00:03:13.630> if

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
also a little notch here I don't know if

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.340 
also a little notch here I don't know if
you<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:16.480> tells<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> which<00:03:17.019> way<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
you can see it tells you which way the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.590 
you can see it tells you which way the
pump<00:03:17.590> supposed<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.980> go<00:03:19.260> alright<00:03:21.360> okay<00:03:22.360> here's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
pump supposed to go alright okay here's

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.590 
pump supposed to go alright okay here's
the<00:03:22.720> new<00:03:22.840> lock<00:03:23.079> ring<00:03:23.380> is<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.370> old<00:03:24.519> one<00:03:24.760> this

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
the new lock ring is the old one this

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.990 
the new lock ring is the old one this
was<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.980> $17<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.100> Amazon<00:03:27.549> I<00:03:27.579> believe<00:03:29.820> just<00:03:30.820> slip

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
was a $17 on Amazon I believe just slip

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.160 
was a $17 on Amazon I believe just slip
it<00:03:31.120> over<00:03:31.329> here<00:03:36.060> couldn't<00:03:37.060> really<00:03:37.299> see<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:38.140> I

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
it over here couldn't really see when I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.890 
it over here couldn't really see when I
remove<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.560> lock<00:03:38.890> ring<00:03:39.160> how<00:03:40.120> this<00:03:40.420> went

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
remove the lock ring how this went

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.940 
remove the lock ring how this went
but<00:03:41.079> basically<00:03:43.109> what<00:03:44.109> needs<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.320> happen<00:03:44.410> is<00:03:44.829> it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
but basically what needs to happen is it

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.099 
but basically what needs to happen is it
needs<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.190> slide<00:03:45.430> down<00:03:45.640> over<00:03:45.670> these<00:03:46.109> metal

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
needs to slide down over these metal

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.020 
needs to slide down over these metal
notches<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.829> then<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.280> ring<00:03:48.430> will<00:03:48.609> spin<00:03:48.850> this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
notches and then the ring will spin this

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.070 
notches and then the ring will spin this
way<00:03:49.299> clockwise

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.480 

you<00:03:55.080> may<00:03:55.200> need<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.500> clear<00:03:55.890> some<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.280> rust

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
you may need to clear some of the rust

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:25.550 
you may need to clear some of the rust
out<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:57.510> get<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.900> spin<00:03:58.140> all<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.440> way<00:04:24.560> we

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
out to get it to spin all the way we

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.350 
out to get it to spin all the way we
need<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.800> do<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.010> get<00:04:26.160> this<00:04:26.400> notch<00:04:26.640> past<00:04:27.150> this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
need to do is get this notch past this

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:46.250 
need to do is get this notch past this
plastic<00:04:44.480> okay<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.900> what<00:04:45.990> we<00:04:46.080> want

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
plastic okay so this is what we want

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.290 
plastic okay so this is what we want
right<00:04:46.350> here<00:04:46.710> basically<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.850> prevents<00:04:48.240> it

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
right here basically that prevents it

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.580 
right here basically that prevents it
from<00:04:48.390> sliding<00:04:48.720> back<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:49.050> don't<00:04:49.290> think<00:04:49.470> it's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
from sliding back I don't think it's

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.100 
from sliding back I don't think it's
going<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.740> slide<00:04:49.980> back<00:04:50.010> easily<00:04:50.430> anyways

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
going to slide back easily anyways

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.420 
going to slide back easily anyways
because<00:04:52.110> how<00:04:52.230> much<00:04:52.350> rust<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.890> on<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:53.190> thing

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
because how much rust is on this thing

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.010 
because how much rust is on this thing
but<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:54.300> what<00:04:54.450> we<00:04:54.540> need<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.810> do<00:04:56.150> okay<00:04:57.150> so

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
but that's what we need to do okay so

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.710 
but that's what we need to do okay so
the<00:04:58.140> next<00:04:58.230> thing<00:04:58.380> we<00:04:58.560> need<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.740> do<00:04:58.980> is<00:04:59.510> wire<00:05:00.510> up

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
the next thing we need to do is wire up

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.800 
the next thing we need to do is wire up
a<00:05:00.810> new<00:05:00.930> pigtail<00:05:01.410> for<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.800> pump<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:06.510> is<00:05:06.690> what

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
a new pigtail for this pump this is what

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.910 
a new pigtail for this pump this is what
the<00:05:06.960> old<00:05:07.080> connection<00:05:07.860> looks<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.830> is

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
the old connection looks like this is

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.160 
the old connection looks like this is
what<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.130> new<00:05:14.250> one<00:05:14.430> looks<00:05:14.640> like<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:15.810> comes<00:05:16.050> to

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
what the new one looks like it comes to

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.290 
what the new one looks like it comes to
the<00:05:16.260> pigtail<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.980> some<00:05:17.100> connectors<00:05:17.520> I'm

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the pigtail and some connectors I'm

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.520 
the pigtail and some connectors I'm
probably<00:05:18.540> actually<00:05:18.900> going<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.080> solder<00:05:19.260> the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
probably actually going to solder the

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.410 
probably actually going to solder the
connections<00:05:19.980> and<00:05:20.190> use<00:05:20.340> some<00:05:20.580> shrink<00:05:21.090> tubing

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
connections and use some shrink tubing

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.270 
connections and use some shrink tubing
so<00:05:22.170> let<00:05:22.290> me<00:05:22.350> get<00:05:22.500> set<00:05:22.680> up<00:05:22.740> under<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.130> vehicle

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
so let me get set up under the vehicle

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:34.909 
so let me get set up under the vehicle
and<00:05:23.670> go<00:05:24.090> ahead<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.300> do<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.480> next

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.409 

okay<00:05:35.460> first<00:05:35.729> thing<00:05:35.879> we're<00:05:35.969> going<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.150> do<00:05:36.270> is

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
okay first thing we're going to do is

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.869 
okay first thing we're going to do is
take<00:05:36.599> and<00:05:36.810> cut<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.250> existing<00:05:38.250> pig<00:05:38.430> tail<00:05:38.669> off

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
take and cut that existing pig tail off

00:05:38.879 --> 00:06:01.230 
take and cut that existing pig tail off
and<00:05:39.090> strip<00:05:39.300> these<00:05:39.449> back

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.400 

okay<00:06:02.240> see<00:06:02.300> I've<00:06:02.600> got<00:06:02.780> them<00:06:02.870> all<00:06:02.960> stripped<00:06:03.290> back

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
okay see I've got them all stripped back

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.500 
okay see I've got them all stripped back
and<00:06:03.830> I've<00:06:03.950> got<00:06:03.980> the<00:06:04.250> pigtail<00:06:04.640> strip<00:06:05.000> back<00:06:05.240> i

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
and I've got the pigtail strip back i

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.820 
and I've got the pigtail strip back i
left<00:06:05.840> quite<00:06:06.080> a<00:06:06.110> bit<00:06:06.260> of<00:06:06.350> length<00:06:06.440> on<00:06:06.680> there

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
left quite a bit of length on there

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.050 
left quite a bit of length on there
probably<00:06:07.160> more<00:06:07.280> than<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.520> need<00:06:07.670> and<00:06:07.850> I<00:06:07.940> also

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
probably more than I need and I also

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.660 
probably more than I need and I also
have<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.830> shrink<00:06:09.830> tubing<00:06:10.160> on<00:06:10.310> my<00:06:10.460> wires

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:10.670 
have the shrink tubing on my wires

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.460 
have the shrink tubing on my wires
already<00:06:11.000> I'm<00:06:11.870> going<00:06:11.990> to<00:06:12.050> take<00:06:12.140> a<00:06:12.170> look<00:06:12.320> at<00:06:12.410> the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
already I'm going to take a look at the

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.140 
already I'm going to take a look at the
instruction<00:06:12.980> though<00:06:13.130> if<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.550> can<00:06:13.730> see<00:06:13.970> that

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
instruction though if you can see that

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.600 
instruction though if you can see that
or<00:06:14.330> not<00:06:14.390> but<00:06:14.870> basically<00:06:15.170> I<00:06:15.260> want<00:06:15.410> to<00:06:15.470> go<00:06:15.610> black

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
or not but basically I want to go black

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.630 
or not but basically I want to go black
and<00:06:16.910> white<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:17.450> orange<00:06:17.960> black<00:06:18.400> grade<00:06:19.400> of

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
and white to the orange black grade of

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.310 
and white to the orange black grade of
the<00:06:19.730> gray<00:06:19.910> purple<00:06:20.420> to<00:06:20.630> the<00:06:20.720> purple<00:06:21.050> and<00:06:21.170> black

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
the gray purple to the purple and black

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.410 
the gray purple to the purple and black
to<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.560> black<00:06:21.650> there<00:06:22.640> is<00:06:22.760> a<00:06:22.790> combination<00:06:23.390> to

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:23.420 
to the black there is a combination to

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.070 
to the black there is a combination to
one<00:06:23.780> here<00:06:24.020> as<00:06:24.170> well<00:06:26.380> let's<00:06:27.380> take<00:06:27.560> a<00:06:27.590> look<00:06:27.860> here

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
one here as well let's take a look here

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.900 
one here as well let's take a look here
but<00:06:30.080> I<00:06:30.440> appear<00:06:30.980> to<00:06:31.100> have<00:06:31.280> the<00:06:31.310> black<00:06:31.670> with<00:06:31.880> a

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
but I appear to have the black with a

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.830 
but I appear to have the black with a
white<00:06:32.000> wire<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:34.270> that's<00:06:35.270> going<00:06:35.690> to<00:06:35.750> the

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
white wire and that's going to the

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.400 
white wire and that's going to the
orange<00:06:36.170> and<00:06:36.320> black<00:06:37.900> all<00:06:38.900> right<00:06:39.050> let's<00:06:39.290> get

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
orange and black all right let's get

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:52.620 
orange and black all right let's get
wired<00:06:39.710> up

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.850 

and<00:06:53.630> of<00:06:53.840> course<00:06:54.020> you<00:06:54.110> don't<00:06:54.140> have<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.470> do<00:06:54.710> this

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
and of course you don't have to do this

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.410 
and of course you don't have to do this
you<00:06:55.040> could<00:06:55.280> use<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:55.610> connectors<00:06:56.120> that<00:06:56.150> it

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:56.420 
you could use the connectors that it

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.720 
you could use the connectors that it
came<00:06:56.600> with<00:06:57.130> and<00:06:58.130> some<00:06:58.370> of<00:06:58.400> my<00:06:58.490> other<00:06:58.670> videos

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
came with and some of my other videos

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.310 
came with and some of my other videos
aren't<00:06:59.240> left<00:06:59.420> you've<00:06:59.540> noticed<00:06:59.990> but<00:07:00.140> the

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
aren't left you've noticed but the

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.180 
aren't left you've noticed but the
connectors<00:07:00.740> end<00:07:01.160> up<00:07:01.910> being<00:07:02.570> quite<00:07:02.690> bulky<00:07:03.190> even

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
connectors end up being quite bulky even

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.670 
connectors end up being quite bulky even
when<00:07:04.310> you<00:07:04.400> tape<00:07:04.580> them<00:07:04.700> all<00:07:04.850> up<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.690> this<00:07:06.500> isn't

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
when you tape them all up and this isn't

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.190 
when you tape them all up and this isn't
something<00:07:07.010> I<00:07:07.130> really<00:07:07.370> want<00:07:07.580> to<00:07:07.750> have<00:07:08.750> to<00:07:08.960> fix

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
something I really want to have to fix

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:18.100 
something I really want to have to fix
later<00:07:15.940> okay<00:07:16.940> so<00:07:17.510> now<00:07:17.630> what<00:07:17.750> I'm<00:07:17.810> going<00:07:17.930> to<00:07:17.990> do

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
later okay so now what I'm going to do

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.110 
later okay so now what I'm going to do
is<00:07:18.230> I'm<00:07:18.320> going<00:07:18.410> to<00:07:18.470> apply<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.610> little<00:07:19.820> bit<00:07:19.940> of

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
is I'm going to apply a little bit of

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.340 
is I'm going to apply a little bit of
solder<00:07:20.330> on<00:07:20.510> each<00:07:20.750> of<00:07:20.900> these<00:07:21.340> we'll<00:07:22.340> slide<00:07:22.610> our

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:23.350 
solder on each of these we'll slide our

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.840 
solder on each of these we'll slide our
shrink<00:07:24.350> tubing<00:07:24.620> up<00:07:24.770> over<00:07:25.100> the<00:07:25.220> connection<00:07:25.550> if

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
shrink tubing up over the connection if

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.870 
shrink tubing up over the connection if
we<00:07:25.970> can<00:07:26.210> and<00:07:26.560> then<00:07:27.560> see<00:07:28.220> if<00:07:28.310> we<00:07:28.400> get<00:07:28.520> to<00:07:28.670> shrink

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 
we can and then see if we get to shrink

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:41.590 
we can and then see if we get to shrink
down<00:07:39.250> okay<00:07:40.250> so<00:07:40.310> you<00:07:40.460> can<00:07:40.580> see<00:07:40.610> I<00:07:40.730> put<00:07:41.180> an

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.600 
down okay so you can see I put an

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.880 
down okay so you can see I put an
electrical<00:07:41.900> tape<00:07:42.080> the<00:07:42.230> whole<00:07:42.380> length<00:07:42.590> of<00:07:42.740> that

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:42.890 
electrical tape the whole length of that

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.990 
electrical tape the whole length of that
and<00:07:43.040> the<00:07:43.100> other<00:07:43.220> thing<00:07:43.370> I<00:07:43.460> did<00:07:43.670> just<00:07:43.880> because

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 
and the other thing I did just because

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.900 
and the other thing I did just because
there<00:07:44.270> were<00:07:44.330> some<00:07:44.450> sharp<00:07:44.780> edges<00:07:44.930> on<00:07:45.380> those

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:45.910 
there were some sharp edges on those

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.430 
there were some sharp edges on those
twisted<00:07:46.910> wires<00:07:47.180> I<00:07:47.570> actually<00:07:47.780> use<00:07:48.050> electrical

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 
twisted wires I actually use electrical

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.820 
twisted wires I actually use electrical
tape<00:07:48.500> between<00:07:49.160> the<00:07:49.750> the<00:07:50.750> shrink<00:07:51.350> tubing<00:07:51.680> as

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:51.830 
tape between the the shrink tubing as

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.530 
tape between the the shrink tubing as
well<00:07:52.040> so<00:07:52.430> I<00:07:52.460> think<00:07:52.640> it's<00:07:52.940> probably<00:07:53.300> in<00:07:53.360> good

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:53.540 
well so I think it's probably in good

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.080 
well so I think it's probably in good
shape<00:07:54.070> and<00:07:55.070> just<00:07:55.250> about<00:07:55.460> getting<00:07:55.700> ready<00:07:55.850> to

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090 
shape and just about getting ready to

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:05.500 
shape and just about getting ready to
pop<00:07:56.600> the<00:07:56.750> tank<00:07:56.990> back<00:07:57.200> in

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:05.510 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.570 

you
