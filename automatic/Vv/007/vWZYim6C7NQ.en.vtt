00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 traffic on roads and streets 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.650
 causes the deaths of 40,000 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.119
 per year according to data from the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 Ministry of Justice 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.019
 many of these fatalities could be 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 avoided if the behavior of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.820
 drivers were different 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.769
 thinking about it the foundation volkswagen 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.600
 decided to face the problem facing 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.610
 pioneer in social projects and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
 educational programs with more than one million 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
 students benefited in the last nine 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 volkswagen years in line with the pact 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.940
 the reduction of accidents in the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 of the UN and created the game project 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.019
 life in transit and aims to raise awareness 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.969
 young people who are the drivers of 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.019
 future about a more 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.899
 responsible 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.489
 for some time the foundation volkswagen 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.730
 sought an education project in the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.379
 transit on account of a reality which 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.620
 deserves our attention 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.510
 the foundation that already works with education 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.480
 who then saw an opportunity there one 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.290
 foundation of the automobile industry 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.799
 opportunity to work with the project 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.530
 education means more than that. 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.740
 is citizenship and education in traffic 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.350
 a project to change the behavior of the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.290
 driver we are all but us 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.930
 we choose a focus focus on the next 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.600
 driver who is the most 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.229
 affected by these accident 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.640
 and traffic incidents we then chose 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.380
 for a video game 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.869
 the project consists of a game of 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.990
 computer or tops and a roadmap for 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 teachers that allows educators to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.979
 working on the concepts of in- game 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.329
 from the beginning we thought a 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.289
 set of activities so that the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.750
 teacher should appropriate the game as 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.149
 a context generator and mainly 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.090
 as a motivator of these young people 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.990
 there is a whole didactic menu of which the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 teacher can serve to generate in room 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.340
 the context and to promote the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 motivation of the students so that they 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.870
 that they can discuss 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.450
 various activities based on 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.670
 projects that will allow students and author 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.709
 and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.120
 develop self-criticism above all 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.950
 This system is not talking to us. 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
 simply to consume knowledge 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.180
 ready we are talking about 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.540
 sensitize the student so that he can 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.390
 be responsible for their actions 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.130
 virtual 3d board 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.739
 autÃ³polis transmit concepts of 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.459
 security legislation and citizenship in 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.410
 Traffic 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.959
 many players drive a car 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.390
 simulating real life education and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.940
 fun the autopolis takes the player to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.790
 reflect on situations involving limit 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.340
 and traffic lights and radars and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.420
 even punishments follow the rules 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.080
 in this 3d board environment the player 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.000
 you can walk through homes like in the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.130
 traditional tray and then when it 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.489
 arrives at the place he decides if he wants 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.640
 enter that place or not as it 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.590
 moving through the van 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.250
 happening stories is this narrative 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.180
 that is creating the game sequence a 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.310
 interactive narrative to our proposal 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.799
 We are already trying to bring pro 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.799
 driver who does not have much 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.120
 contact what still the next driver 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.980
 try to bring these 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.519
 we automatize these habits of how 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.829
 works the ownership of the car you 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.019
 You have to worry so much and the best. 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.269
 the autopolis is available for the whole 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.660
 the public school network as well as on the 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:46.160
 of the foundation always free of charge and 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.380
 open to all 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.239
 using an innovative tool that 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.160
 arouses the interest of young people 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.109
 volkswagen takes another step towards 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.299
 contribute to the formation of future 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:01.180
 drivers to transform traffic 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.180
 with safer and more citizen-friendly attitudes
