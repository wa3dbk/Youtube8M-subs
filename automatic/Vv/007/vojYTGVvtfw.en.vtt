also if you keep attaching these
energies<00:04:37.740> plus<00:04:38.160> with<00:04:38.340> add-on<00:04:38.580> stadium<00:04:39.060> out

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
energies plus with add-on stadium out

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.400

what's<00:04:40.980> this<00:04:41.100> Tom<00:04:41.400> stadium<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.780> can<00:04:42.990> end<00:04:43.110> its

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
what's this Tom stadium you can end its

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.560 
what's this Tom stadium you can end its
green<00:04:43.650> vest<00:04:43.890> which<00:04:44.160> lets<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.610> attach<00:04:44.790> energy

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
green vest which lets you attach energy

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.000 
green vest which lets you attach energy
to<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.960> and<00:04:46.310> removes<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.550> start<00:04:48.360> removes<00:04:48.600> three

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
to it and removes to start removes three

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.090 
to it and removes to start removes three
so<00:04:50.010> plus<00:04:50.850> tango<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.270> healing<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:52.950> move

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
so plus tango is healing so you can move

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.910 
so plus tango is healing so you can move
a<00:04:53.160> possibility<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.090> seven<00:04:54.390> per<00:04:54.690> term<00:04:54.960> which<00:04:55.800> is

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
a possibility of seven per term which is

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.270

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
its wild growth its count makes every

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.900 
its wild growth its count makes every
basic<00:05:05.880> energy<00:05:06.180> grass<00:05:06.930> energy<00:05:07.550> attached<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.790> my

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
basic energy grass energy attached to my

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.390 
basic energy grass energy attached to my
grass<00:05:09.360> pokemon<00:05:09.600> is<00:05:09.930> too<00:05:10.110> so<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:11.040> removes

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
grass pokemon is too so that removes

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.430 
grass pokemon is too so that removes
obviously<00:05:12.410> 24<00:05:14.240> there's<00:05:15.240> 40<00:05:15.630> plus<00:05:15.960> another<00:05:16.140> one

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
obviously 24 there's 40 plus another one

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.590 
obviously 24 there's 40 plus another one
for<00:05:17.040> pasta<00:05:17.460> too<00:05:17.820> for<00:05:18.180> a<00:05:18.210> thon<00:05:19.110> stadium<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:20.600> 60

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
for pasta too for a thon stadium is 60

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.400 
for pasta too for a thon stadium is 60
Plus<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:23.130> so<00:05:23.610> I<00:05:23.640> can<00:05:23.730> pop<00:05:24.090> moon<00:05:24.240> possibly<00:05:24.810> 100

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
Plus this so I can pop moon possibly 100

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.670 
Plus this so I can pop moon possibly 100
if<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.710> have<00:05:26.070> my<00:05:26.280> full<00:05:26.520> setup<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.530> that's

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
if I have my full setup and that's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.420 
if I have my full setup and that's
actually<00:05:29.070> really<00:05:29.220> good<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.320> what's<00:05:32.220> uh

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
actually really good so that's what's uh

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.630 
actually really good so that's what's uh
what's<00:05:33.380> pretty<00:05:34.380> freaking<00:05:35.040> awesome<00:05:35.160> not<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
what's pretty freaking awesome not the

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.480 
what's pretty freaking awesome not the
stats<00:05:36.320> it<00:05:37.320> might<00:05:37.500> take<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.740> while<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.130> set<00:05:38.370> up

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
stats it might take a while to set up

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.030 
stats it might take a while to set up
but<00:05:38.610> it's<00:05:38.790> really<00:05:38.970> good<00:05:39.180> once<00:05:39.420> you<00:05:39.480> do<00:05:40.040> but

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
but it's really good once you do but

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.400 
but it's really good once you do but
it's<00:05:41.820> been<00:05:41.970> working<00:05:42.270> pretty<00:05:42.390> good<00:05:42.510> so<00:05:42.960> far<00:05:42.990> I

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
it's been working pretty good so far I

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.910 
it's been working pretty good so far I
guess<00:05:43.710> for<00:05:44.070> me<00:05:44.220> at<00:05:44.310> least<00:05:44.420> and<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.900> got<00:05:46.020> to<00:05:46.320> go

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
guess for me at least and I got to go

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.720 
guess for me at least and I got to go
Val<00:05:47.750> one<00:05:48.750> with<00:05:48.990> tail<00:05:49.200> shaken<00:05:49.620> with<00:05:49.800> green<00:05:50.190> this

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
Val one with tail shaken with green this

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.480 
Val one with tail shaken with green this
so<00:05:53.090> if<00:05:54.090> anyone<00:05:54.420> has<00:05:54.800> another<00:05:55.800> one<00:05:56.220> of<00:05:56.340> these

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
so if anyone has another one of these

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.150 
so if anyone has another one of these
grovyle's<00:05:57.260> it'd<00:05:58.260> be<00:05:58.470> great<00:05:58.710> for<00:05:58.740> me<00:05:59.100> and
