into the middle position so whenever I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
into the middle position so whenever I
open<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.900> doors<00:01:31.140> they'll<00:01:31.500> come<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> have

two there one there and step out of the
car

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.789 

there<00:01:39.100> are<00:01:39.460> gonna<00:01:39.610> be<00:01:39.729> two<00:01:40.350> right<00:01:41.350> by<00:01:41.590> my

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.700 
can see goes on the ground a little bit
I<00:01:47.979> like<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.880> might<00:01:49.450> put<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.720> piece<00:01:50.290> of<00:01:50.320> carbon

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
I like it I might put a piece of carbon

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.160 
I like it I might put a piece of carbon
carbon<00:01:51.490> fiber<00:01:51.820> or<00:01:52.090> something<00:01:52.330> like<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.479> or

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
carbon fiber or something like that or

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.649 
carbon fiber or something like that or
Plexiglas<00:01:53.860> right<00:01:54.580> under<00:01:54.880> here<00:01:55.240> I'm<00:01:55.509> gonna

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
Plexiglas right under here I'm gonna

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.270 
Plexiglas right under here I'm gonna
probably<00:01:56.020> mold<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.560> after<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.860> while<00:01:56.979> because

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
probably mold that after a while because

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.039 
probably mold that after a while because
my<00:01:57.399> lights<00:01:57.670> I'm<00:01:58.299> not<00:01:58.479> sure<00:01:58.659> if<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.869> can

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
my lights I'm not sure if you can

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.700 
my lights I'm not sure if you can
actually<00:01:59.229> see<00:01:59.710> them<00:01:59.979> but<00:02:00.759> basically<00:02:01.659> I<00:02:02.140> lost

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
actually see them but basically I lost

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually see them but basically I lost
the<00:02:03.360> protector<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.509> goes<00:02:04.659> around<00:02:04.810> them<00:02:05.170> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the protector that goes around them it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.300 
the protector that goes around them it
must<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:05.680> fell<00:02:05.830> off<00:02:05.979> when<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.159> had<00:02:06.250> a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
so if I put a piece of plexiglass or

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.559 
so if I put a piece of plexiglass or
carbon<00:02:14.650> fiber<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.250> might<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.910> able<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> no<00:02:16.269> fix

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
carbon fiber I might be able to no fix

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.559 
carbon fiber I might be able to no fix
that<00:02:16.750> maybe<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.110> won't<00:02:17.170> be<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.500> bright<00:02:17.769> by
