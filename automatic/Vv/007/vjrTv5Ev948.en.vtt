new console but I got this with my first
council<00:03:38.709> wasn't<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.340> black<00:03:39.489> one<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.060> was<00:03:40.120> the

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
council wasn't the black one it was the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.849 
council wasn't the black one it was the
grey<00:03:40.450> one<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:43.120> good<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.690> you're<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.650> know<00:03:44.680> if

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
grey one it's good if you're you know if

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.020 
grey one it's good if you're you know if
you<00:03:44.980> don't<00:03:45.160> have<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.310> turtle<00:03:45.549> beach<00:03:45.819> or

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
you don't have a turtle beach or

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.300 
you don't have a turtle beach or
something<00:03:46.239> then<00:03:46.630> you<00:03:46.959> just<00:03:47.530> chillin<00:03:47.950> out<00:03:48.100> and

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
something then you just chillin out and

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.740 
something then you just chillin out and
you<00:03:48.430> need<00:03:48.609> something<00:03:49.060> really<00:03:49.900> quick<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.750> that

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
you need something really quick so that

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.900 
you need something really quick so that
the<00:03:52.959> input<00:03:53.139> jack<00:03:53.530> right<00:03:53.769> here<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.280> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
the input jack right here and the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.770 
the input jack right here and the
chatpad<00:03:55.180> actually<00:03:55.840> has<00:03:56.049> input<00:03:56.590> jack<00:03:56.799> too<00:03:57.130> so

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
chatpad actually has input jack too so

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.160 
chatpad actually has input jack too so
it's<00:03:58.780> pretty<00:03:59.019> versatile<00:03:59.620> right<00:03:59.920> there<00:04:01.019> if<00:04:02.019> you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
it's pretty versatile right there if you

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.899 
it's pretty versatile right there if you
guys<00:04:02.350> saw<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.680> review<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:04.500> extend<00:04:05.500> play

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
feel delete on the controller actually I

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.040 
feel delete on the controller actually I
kind<00:06:17.860> of<00:06:17.890> like<00:06:18.070> it<00:06:18.510> control<00:06:19.510> is<00:06:19.630> pretty<00:06:19.840> light

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
kind of like it control is pretty light

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.529 
kind of like it control is pretty light
before<00:06:20.409> and<00:06:20.770> it<00:06:21.640> makes<00:06:21.849> the<00:06:22.030> controller<00:06:22.419> a

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
before and it makes the controller a

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:23.399 
before and it makes the controller a
little<00:06:22.810> bigger

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
little bigger

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.769 
little bigger
my<00:06:24.009> fingers<00:06:24.610> are<00:06:24.699> rusting<00:06:25.239> on<00:06:25.330> the<00:06:25.449> back<00:06:25.629> of

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:25.779 
my fingers are rusting on the back of

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.070 
my fingers are rusting on the back of
the<00:06:25.839> chatpad<00:06:26.110> now<00:06:26.679> my<00:06:27.219> pinky<00:06:27.899> so<00:06:28.899> that's

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
the chatpad now my pinky so that's

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.379 
the chatpad now my pinky so that's
pretty<00:06:29.289> good<00:06:29.499> maybe<00:06:30.369> this<00:06:30.610> actually

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
pretty good maybe this actually

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:35.249 
pretty good maybe this actually
alleviates<00:06:32.319> the<00:06:32.739> reason<00:06:33.429> to<00:06:33.580> buy<00:06:33.989> buy<00:06:34.989> and

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259 
alleviates the reason to buy buy and
