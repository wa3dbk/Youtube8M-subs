00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.270
 today a small fryer estaing 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:21.110
 with hull the riviera a boat of 574 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.239
 which is a stainless steel and digital fryer 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.880
 will see later why then the 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.669
 lid first it's a lid 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.629
 with a permanent filter so we do not have 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.480
 need to change 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:34.520
 we also have a small window of 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.020
 visualization but that's wrong or 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.449
 because there is a lot of steam and a 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.039
 as we call it, I do not know anymore 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.809
 something to lift 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:49.760
 so they saw that then we went 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.760
 obviously a basket in which we go 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.190
 put six frying with a handle 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.539
 foldable and removable one can 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.030
 actually move her to trap her 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:05.020
 which allows to go back up or huntelaar to 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.479
 beat to be able to put away his fryer 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.990
 then we have the resistance with the block 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.780
 engine 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
 so she does 1250 watts of 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.280
 power which m 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.500
 which is good so it works like 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.430
 a normal fryer is behind a 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.010
 resistance that will come to heat the oil 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.380
 then there is a stainless steel vessel in 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.630
 which one will put the oil obviously 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.970
 so all the elements except the block 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.110
 motor I specified it can be 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.730
 dishwasher safe 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.140
 finally dallas finally the hull that 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.570
 protects the set with two handles 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.120
 cold to lift it and 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.750
 barge and two passes so obviously we 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.750
 puts him 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.620
 up to four liters or that one is 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.070
 his basket makes 1.3 kg of fries 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.850
 so we add in oil we put his 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.510
 basket we put its lid or not according to 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.380
 what we do as cooking and then 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.450
 just plug the device in to 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.180
 that his digital screen sound goes into 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.490
 road here I unplugged I'm going to 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 reconnect that and so appears a 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.970
 small digital screen with actually 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.250
 preprogrammed cooking modes at 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.390
 both temperature is cooking time 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.070
 depending on what you want to do 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.080
 so what's good is that for 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.130
 each mode can choose between fresh 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.500
 or frozen and therefore temperature is 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.390
 cooking time changes but we are 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.000
 not stuck on these programs we can 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.890
 choose ourselves to change 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.120
 that's what I do with the big 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.989
 mussel and so we can add some 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 cooking time can be decreased or 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.340
 add the temperature as you want 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 so what is convenient especially 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.870
 that I had looked for example for 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.440
 fresh french fries 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.990
 there is really I do one everyone does 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.640
 according to a little bit this desire so 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.940
 temperatures are never and even 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.730
 extended if not more so when we have 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.500
 selected the whole just 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.340
 to press on not on timer 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:36.070
 no on off stop and the device will 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.320
 put in heat and when he will have 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:44.040
 reaches its temperature it will be necessary to 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.590
 on timer to start the timer 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.090
 expected part but there is no beep 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.340
 sound that tell you the times so 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.100
 you have to stay next to his 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.050
 deep fryer here I wanted to show a little 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.120
 that it gave upstream donated 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:05.560
 tours to with kitchen from 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.690
 puff pastry so here's one more time 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.080
 the device said he had reached his 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.060
 temperature my sail in may our dough to 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.470
 cabbage in the frying is good if it's 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.210
 no it's not something 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.129
 revolutionary but that's it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.629
 must see that a fryer with 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.759
 oil allows us to do things 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.669
 like that like things like 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.659
 donuts we can not do on the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.909
 deep fryer without oil 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:37.650
 although obviously there are a lot of 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:43.349
 constraints that we will discuss everything to 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:46.349
 the time and on the blog on the use 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.629
 a fryer at home here they are 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:53.300
 are not good something else 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:53.300
 have a good appetite see you soon
