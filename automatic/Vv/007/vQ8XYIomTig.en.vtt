00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.050
 my people like to come here with another one 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.390
 Comment and that is about the today 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.530
 black ops 2 fox these are currently 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.289
 completely known 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.440
 On Monday, there was a small one in Cologne 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.510
 preview for the games magazine and so on 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.310
 Continue while keeping good gameplay 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.890
 shown and punctual have fast 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.540
 found your way to the net and we 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.270
 also start the lay one with the animal 1 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.090
 Perks and there are at the beginning times 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.320
 directly a change that affects everyone 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.300
 really a bit over 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.249
 In a hurry, and there are no commissions 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.780
 more of the turks yes that does not apply 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:47.320
 completely there is only perks in 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.280
 a version no per effect no 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.059
 trainereffekt like the beginning 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.829
 was rumored 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.679
 no, there is no second effect 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.390
 more only one and you can take 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.629
 a maximum of two points from one animal 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.999
 that means a total of 6 bircks and one 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.679
 few costs just one point and if you 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.630
 has to run around with six bircks 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.180
 you can pay six points now 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.340
 we really start with the tier 1 and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.439
 Although there is bulletproof vest there like 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.119
 we already scan from black ops 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.600
 However, there are only a few 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.490
 Explosions hurt then there are big 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.360
 is back again and is only against 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.549
 hewitt 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.110
 then it gives out - three known big ones 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:29.210
 blind but that is only there to counter 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.360
 to be invulnerable to the killstreaks of the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.649
 The computers are not controlled by the computer 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.509
 that means if 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.200
 for example, in a chopper 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.939
 Ghana plays the controlled by the opponent 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.390
 then you are not planning with one 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.700
 More surely then there is still hotline 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.920
 You get a bonus again 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.719
 you need less points for that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.609
 difficult to achieve imbalance 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.409
 you can run faster and that 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.890
 they were all one piece 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.240
 seems to be very out of ballast 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.340
 good you can go back to big now 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.049
 but it was even small take 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.490
 nothing is overpowered why are we seeing 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.950
 right in the 42 pips 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.979
 Then we still have animal two 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.450
 breaks kevin so so can blind with it 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.680
 this time only ammunition from the opponent 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.260
 that means you can not anymore 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.720
 money pro that am directly ultra ammo 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.640
 does not work then we have complete 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.180
 again that we are the third 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.420
 salzburg and with that you are invisible 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.350
 from ticketingsystemen that is to 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.270
 example of this annes outlook as ims 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.550
 from poppy 43 for example so wehrmann 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.990
 invulnerable against and against 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.920
 player controlled air defense or 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.140
 an air killstreaks, so to speak, went 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.060
 schoppa ghana and so on that is 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.920
 you really need three parks around 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.690
 to be completely safe and there is 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.810
 just something to say so i hope that has 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.030
 you hear a bit and then you go 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.900
 still toughness that means less 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.820
 decorate 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.000
 if you are hit that was there too 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.000
 already in black ops 1 i just know more 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.010
 how to wait and then we come 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.489
 even to the 43 perks and results 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.070
 there the engineer and there the channel 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.290
 see opposing equipment and also 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.540
 manipulate the content of care package 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.750
 and make it a trap so to speak 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.030
 the hacker then we have the lines 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.040
 so you have more steps and stop 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.510
 no, you can not stop that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.250
 you do not make any steps because it 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.390
 there is no pro version then we have 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.519
 still marathon 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.560
 so you can sprint longer, I think 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.590
 Also nice that you're back in it 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.030
 Measure tactical measure so you know yes 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 you already know that 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.780
 one is not so blatant by flash 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.280
 and so on affects airways 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.350
 we still have it with you the opponents 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.049
 Listening louder that is almost what was called 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.519
 more I know no longer existed there but 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.019
 also already desperately contracted and so 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.560
 further and then we still have decks 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.709
 terry 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.840
 so you can ladder and so on 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.239
 climb faster and faster 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.579
 recover from knives and so on 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.140
 pull harder after the sprint so that 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.170
 is already something I have now 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.280
 example will recover and stop 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.700
 just pull because of this tailor 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.410
 after sprinting and people were that 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.269
 all parks and me is direct 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.120
 noticed there is no found pro me 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.410
 that you arrive faster in the visor 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.919
 This is probably cucumbers history 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.349
 out of time without a visor which is then 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.110
 again no war zone so right 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.330
 and also state 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.430
 the prefect of spam is still in there index 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.210
 theory but otherwise it was 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.810
 actually marathon was hung up and 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.890
 All in all, I have to say that I am 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.660
 Enthusiastic about the byrds but thinks 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.670
 not by but stick with 66 through 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.890
 race will be there so can already 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.540
 really introduce myself and me 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.200
 could imagine it with hardliners 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.660
 first slot with skits second slot 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.670
 and with six terry in the third slot too 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.680
 then possibly play the 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.990
 engineer to pick as fourth work 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.180
 when the climate is so strong again and 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.160
 as it has in black ops 1 then 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.630
 it's gonna be such an explosion again 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.900
 Delay Klusemann sees that 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.120
 equipment so then engineer gets up 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.130
 every case also my favorite and 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.660
 a must be for me but the charity 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.360
 I just like it with it 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.180
 one stops faster from the place and comes 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.460
 so that you can achieve it quickly 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.710
 So a water park and I will 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.100
 certainly then we use what thinks 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.900
 you already have such a small one 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.520
 yes a small equipment considered how 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.410
 you go to the battlefield is black 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.660
 would the comments and what is yours 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.970
 Opinion on balancing sounds very good 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.340
 Nothing goes very wrong that could disturb you 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.440
 Art were split three super 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.970
 I somehow have to do it yourself 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.610
 yes distribute and I think so 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.570
 is the best solution 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.160
 So you have to be three now 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.510
 Points to invest in complete 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.120
 is invisible and then you have to 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.000
 Good kills the route cheap out of the animal 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.260
 a slot where the best pics in there anyway 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.880
 are waive 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.200
 So write me your opinion in the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.320
 comments tomorrow then comes 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.000
 video to the conclusion series and yes we 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.000
 hear charlotte next time
