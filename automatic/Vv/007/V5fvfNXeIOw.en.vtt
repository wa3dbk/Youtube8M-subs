below in the more info it's actually

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.730 
below in the more info it's actually
surprising<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.510> found<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.020> far<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.530> with

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
surprising that I found so far just with

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.770 
surprising that I found so far just with
my<00:03:37.890> tests<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:38.910> actually<00:03:39.330> incredibly

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
my tests this is actually incredibly

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100 
my tests this is actually incredibly
faster<00:03:40.560> than<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.100> 2011<00:03:42.060> model<00:03:42.450> macbook<00:03:42.720> air

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
faster than the 2011 model macbook air

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.020 
faster than the 2011 model macbook air
even<00:03:43.530> though<00:03:43.770> its<00:03:43.920> specifications<00:03:44.610> wouldn't

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
even though its specifications wouldn't

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.610 
even though its specifications wouldn't
really<00:03:45.180> suggest<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:45.960> and<00:03:46.170> that's<00:03:46.440> primarily

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
really suggest so and that's primarily

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.220 
really suggest so and that's primarily
because<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.460> new<00:03:47.760> ivy<00:03:48.240> bridge<00:03:48.510> processor

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
because of the new ivy bridge processor

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.960 
because of the new ivy bridge processor
as<00:03:49.320> opposed<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> previous<00:03:49.950> sandy<00:03:50.790> bridge

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
as opposed to the previous sandy bridge

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.780 
as opposed to the previous sandy bridge
processor<00:03:51.660> featured<00:03:52.080> in<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.290> 2011<00:03:53.100> models<00:03:53.400> so

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
processor featured in the 2011 models so

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.400 
processor featured in the 2011 models so
of<00:03:53.850> course<00:03:54.000> I'll<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.300> some<00:03:54.510> more<00:03:54.630> videos<00:03:55.110> on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410
