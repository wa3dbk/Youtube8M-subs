good<00:00:05.670> afternoon<00:00:06.060> more<00:00:06.569> medic<00:00:06.870> 1<00:00:07.050> today<00:00:07.680> we

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
good afternoon more medic 1 today we

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.009 
good afternoon more medic 1 today we
have<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> little<00:00:08.580> troy<00:00:08.970> bilt<00:00:09.180> generator<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.990> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
have a little troy bilt generator on the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.620 
have a little troy bilt generator on the
bench<00:00:10.460> the<00:00:11.460> complaint<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.330> it's<00:00:12.480> not

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
bench the complaint is that it's not

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.560 
bench the complaint is that it's not
putting<00:00:12.930> out<00:00:13.080> power<00:00:14.300> basically<00:00:15.300> we're<00:00:15.480> going

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
putting out power basically we're going

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
putting out power basically we're going
to<00:00:15.660> run<00:00:15.810> through<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.019> diagnosis<00:00:16.619> process<00:00:16.650> or

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
to run through the diagnosis process or

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.210 
to run through the diagnosis process or
the<00:00:17.760> diagnostic<00:00:18.420> process<00:00:18.860> if<00:00:19.860> you're<00:00:20.070> not

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the diagnostic process if you're not

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
the diagnostic process if you're not
getting<00:00:20.520> anything<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:21.030> of<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.270> receptacles

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
getting anything out of your receptacles

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.870 
getting anything out of your receptacles
I've<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> load<00:00:23.130> back<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:25.279> how<00:00:26.279> well

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
I've got a load back here how well

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.570 
I've got a load back here how well
basically<00:00:27.570> what<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> want<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
basically what you want to do this is

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.760 
basically what you want to do this is
what<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> did<00:00:31.609> you<00:00:32.609> got<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> set<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> brushes

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
what I did you got a set of brushes

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.610 
what I did you got a set of brushes
sometimes<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.980> will<00:00:35.190> work<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:36.350> this<00:00:37.350> style

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
sometimes this will work on this style

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.919 
sometimes this will work on this style
of<00:00:37.769> generator<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.429> has<00:00:38.670> an<00:00:39.569> automatic

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:39.929 
of generator that has an automatic

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:43.610 
of generator that has an automatic

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
voltage regulator called an AVR a lot of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
voltage regulator called an AVR a lot of
times<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.039> will<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.429> bad<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.569> will

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
times that will go bad and that will

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.979 
times that will go bad and that will
cause<00:00:45.839> it<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.139> have<00:00:46.350> power<00:00:47.510> your<00:00:48.510> ABR

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:54.389 
sends 24 volts DC to your brushes if you

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.939 
sends 24 volts DC to your brushes if you
introduce<00:00:56.359> if<00:00:57.359> you<00:00:57.539> introduce<00:00:57.870> 12<00:00:58.409> volts<00:00:58.799> DC

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
to your brushes from a battery source

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.469 
to your brushes from a battery source
here

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
here

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.790 
here
I<00:01:05.180> should<00:01:07.190> once<00:01:08.190> you<00:01:08.340> hook<00:01:08.730> it<00:01:08.940> up<00:01:09.620> I'm<00:01:10.620> going

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
I should once you hook it up I'm going

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.560 
I should once you hook it up I'm going
to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:10.980> this<00:01:11.130> thing<00:01:11.310> cranked<00:01:11.730> up<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to get this thing cranked up and if you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.190 
to get this thing cranked up and if you
put<00:01:12.840> half<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:14.100> voltage<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.930> AVR<00:01:15.930> puts

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
put half as much voltage as the AVR puts

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.930 
put half as much voltage as the AVR puts
out<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> your<00:01:16.680> brushes<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.550> only<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
out to your brushes you're only going to

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.200 
out to your brushes you're only going to
get<00:01:18.120> about<00:01:18.390> 50<00:01:18.870> volts<00:01:19.260> on<00:01:19.410> your<00:01:20.010> meter<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
get about 50 volts on your meter so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.360 
get about 50 volts on your meter so
let's<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.510> it<00:01:21.630> cranked<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.290> we'll<00:01:23.190> see

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
let's get it cranked up and we'll see

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.969 
let's get it cranked up and we'll see
how<00:01:23.780> your<00:01:24.780> positive<00:01:25.320> wire

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
how your positive wire

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.600 
how your positive wire
very

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:52.140 

took<00:01:30.790> this<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.300> Pro<00:01:31.480> Bowl

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:02.289 

put<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.390> load<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:52.720> it

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.800 

have<00:02:02.390> an<00:02:02.509> AVR<00:02:03.079> of<00:02:03.350> duh

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
have an AVR of duh

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:40.760 
have an AVR of duh
and<00:02:04.899> raw<00:02:05.140> voltage<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.799> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.260 

what<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:41.920> did<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:42.460> verify<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.120> my

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
what I just did was verify that my

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.450 
what I just did was verify that my
automatic<00:02:43.960> voltage<00:02:44.080> regulator<00:02:44.710> is<00:02:44.920> not

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
automatic voltage regulator is not

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.010 
automatic voltage regulator is not
sending<00:02:45.880> voltage<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.540> my<00:02:46.920> rotor<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.330> we're

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
sending voltage to my rotor so we're

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.160 
sending voltage to my rotor so we're
going<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.200> replace<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:51.000> AVR<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.360> one<00:02:52.540> and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
going to replace the AVR on this one and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.210 
going to replace the AVR on this one and
it<00:02:53.350> should<00:02:54.930> well<00:02:55.930> I've<00:02:56.110> got<00:02:56.230> my<00:02:56.380> little<00:02:56.530> AVR<00:02:57.010> in

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
it should well I've got my little AVR in

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.460 
it should well I've got my little AVR in
the<00:02:57.310> day<00:02:57.490> got<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.600> generator<00:02:58.990> back<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the day got the generator back on the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.700 
the day got the generator back on the
bench<00:03:00.810> took<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> little<00:03:02.020> while<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> get<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.680> a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
bench took a little while to get it a

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.160 
bench took a little while to get it a
couple<00:03:03.100> three<00:03:03.280> days<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:05.320> here's<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.650> new<00:03:05.770> AVR

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
couple three days but here's the new AVR

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.860 
couple three days but here's the new AVR
basically<00:03:08.170> just<00:03:08.470> kind<00:03:09.250> of<00:03:09.370> if<00:03:10.210> you<00:03:10.360> want<00:03:10.720> to

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
basically just kind of if you want to

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.290 
basically just kind of if you want to
even<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.260> take<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> picture<00:03:11.710> of<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.940> old<00:03:13.120> one

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
even just take a picture of the old one

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.170 
even just take a picture of the old one
and<00:03:13.480> but<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:14.500> marked<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:15.340> wires<00:03:15.580> are<00:03:15.850> marked

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
and but it's marked the wires are marked

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.970 
and but it's marked the wires are marked
actually<00:03:16.510> has<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> know<00:03:17.080> you<00:03:17.290> can't<00:03:17.500> see<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.800> but

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
actually has I know you can't see it but

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.450 
actually has I know you can't see it but
it's<00:03:18.790> got<00:03:18.970> like<00:03:19.120> six<00:03:20.100> stamped<00:03:21.100> on<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> wire

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
it's got like six stamped on the wire

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.490 
it's got like six stamped on the wire
right<00:03:21.670> here<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.810> going<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.020> have<00:03:23.170> six

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
right here and it's going to have six

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.440 
right here and it's going to have six
marked<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.130> your<00:03:24.160> AVR<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.970> can<00:03:25.210> get<00:03:25.330> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
marked on your AVR so you can get the

so let's just recap of what it did

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.150 
so let's just recap of what it did
basically<00:05:17.300> I<00:05:17.450> disconnected<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.500> old<00:05:18.680> AVR

basically I disconnected the old AVR

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.880 
basically I disconnected the old AVR

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
replaced the part that I diagnosed but
