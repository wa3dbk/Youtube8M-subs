today<00:01:52.630> destruction<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.440> course<00:01:53.649> has<00:01:53.830> been

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
today destruction of course has been

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.410 
today destruction of course has been
very<00:01:54.310> much<00:01:54.399> talked<00:01:54.729> about<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.300> it's

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
very much talked about and it's

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.380 
very much talked about and it's
definitely<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.140> strong<00:01:56.350> feature<00:01:56.649> in<00:01:56.950> there<00:01:57.390> but

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
definitely a strong feature in there but

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.330 
definitely a strong feature in there but
if<00:01:58.690> you<00:01:58.899> look<00:01:59.080> at<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.289> physics<00:01:59.800> system<00:02:00.160> the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
if you look at the physics system the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.180 
if you look at the physics system the
audio<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.229> lot<00:02:02.380> of<00:02:02.410> pieces<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
audio and there's a lot of pieces that

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.870 
audio and there's a lot of pieces that
are<00:02:03.520> kind<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.570> we<00:02:05.020> had<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.410> push<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:06.100> be<00:02:06.520> able<00:02:06.610> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
built a whole brand new engine frostbite

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.979 
built a whole brand new engine frostbite
which<00:02:11.739> allows<00:02:12.250> us<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:12.700> do<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.360> destruction

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
which allows us to do the destruction

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.600
