00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 by hiding them would have removed the box removed the clutch 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:11.820
 what can I tell you let's start with 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.389
 gear 4 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.710
 we are fine I twisted it spinning 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.750
 with a pleasant strain revealed a leak 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.590
 gland shank 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 the stuffing box backlash is not all good 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 here, at first glance, everything is also 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
 good but we will hide to watch more 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.079
 bearing is easy to crown ideally except 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.280
 gland means everything in the box is good with 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.000
 points of view 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.610
 nothing of the fact that nothing flows everything 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.910
 glands ideally 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 there are no hints anywhere even 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.379
 problems now and now the most 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.859
 interesting now I'll show you this one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.609
 the wonderful nature of this knock I took off 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.470
 clutch 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.570
 here it is a disk slave here are the leading disks 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 you can see almost in 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.510
 ideally there are no blue stripes even on 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.970
 touch 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.040
 that is, they are still normal drives 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.790
 a million kilometers passes the slave drive 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.890
 6 millimeters thick, almost like new 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.740
 it looks like it is all the same for these 8 5 thousand 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 changed once 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 yes now let's look carefully 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 what we have with the slots 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.920
 notice this trial is clearly visible 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.759
 especially 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.869
 especially clearly seen from here where the shaft 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.240
 not in contact with the sleeve the slots in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 ideally the inside slots is completely broken 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.710
 we see the same picture on the oval 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.590
 Here is clearly seen in the formulation 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:03.930
 the place where the disk worked was known 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.750
 design error for me already said more than once 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.050
 steve harris something too small 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.510
 gearing area bushing insufficient 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.060
 comes on the shaft besides there is no dm 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.310
 accordingly, the impact shock is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.130
 everyone breaks nowhere from that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.910
 getting away and now here I am essentially 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.420
 I will demonstrate this one when when 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.180
 You drive works you go from 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:39.490
 engine vibration load and you 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:43.150
 hear here is such a sound is probably 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.430
 immediately remembered so far but happens here 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.790
 he has this play in this lift 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.530
 due to the fact that uneven pressure on 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.310
 clutch disc only occurs in 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.860
 time flashes, respectively, 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.160
 cylinders it appears this one 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.990
 wonderful knock accordingly when 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.450
 this knock at you is very loud let's say 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.010
 so noticeably loud preferably of course 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.420
 change this primary shaft along with 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.750
 clutch plate because this shaft 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.460
 Of course, just worn out simply installation 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.540
 new disk it will not help try 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:33.880
 backlash of course it became less as a whole it all 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.300
 anyway there will still be this thing 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.920
 it is necessary to further break 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.310
 change primary course here 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.900
 Well, I must honestly say that of course 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.750
 problem for these motorcycles with one 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.210
 hand on the other side with a motorcycle with 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.250
 this was 85,000 and did not say that 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.070
 here wear is what it is from the day to 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.950
 the day will be covered that is 100,000 of this 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.130
 designs exactly passes in principle 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.500
 change one shaft worth there 11,000 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.740
 rubles once a hundred thousand kilometers even 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.930
 if you are a lot of truth motorcycle 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.150
 I think you can afford now 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.239
 let's see why not knocking 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.820
 nothing on 1100 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.190
 here came lech which is mad 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.730
 Officials bought money Talysh bought not 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.890
 the street is not official for rabid day 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.200
 not bought in Russia, I bought means everything 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.720
 new disk why did you buy a new one yet 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.000
 cart 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.020
 let's just compare wheels 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.440
 so here we have the right drive from 1150 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.640
 there is a left 1100 first disk 1150 and 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.500
 it is smaller in diameter 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.050
 second pay attention to the slots i 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.630
 so put 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:56.910
 mean slots on the disk 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:02.400
 from 1100 more than 1150 and slots more 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.130
 large and less so I think where 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.440
 lies the catch 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.250
 why similar problems cuts happen 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.250
 at 1100
