this exact this format that you see here
is<00:04:03.500> actually<00:04:04.459> what<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.910> going<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.930> be<00:04:06.169> output

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
is actually what is going to be output

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.960 
is actually what is going to be output
to<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.660> 2014<00:04:08.660> fantasy<00:04:08.959> football<00:04:09.319> draft<00:04:09.349> file

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
so that's exactly what it's going to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.860 
so that's exactly what it's going to
look<00:04:13.280> like<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:13.730> let<00:04:14.239> me<00:04:14.329> pull<00:04:14.569> this<00:04:14.599> back<00:04:14.930> up

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
look like so let me pull this back up

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.740 
look like so let me pull this back up
okay<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:18.829> we<00:04:18.889> have<00:04:19.070> this<00:04:19.449> test<00:04:20.449> one<00:04:20.630> is

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
okay so now we have this test one is

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.330 
okay so now we have this test one is
traffic<00:04:20.900> now<00:04:21.140> another<00:04:21.769> way<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.190> can

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
traffic now another way that you can

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.670 
traffic now another way that you can
draft<00:04:22.640> now<00:04:22.909> you<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.750> problem<00:04:24.260> with<00:04:24.409> doing<00:04:24.530> it

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
draft now you the problem with doing it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.610 
draft now you the problem with doing it
that<00:04:24.740> way<00:04:25.039> and

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
that way and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.820 
that way and
since<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.280> didn't<00:04:26.940> really<00:04:27.350> bother<00:04:28.350> making<00:04:28.770> this

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
since I didn't really bother making this

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.020 
since I didn't really bother making this
too<00:04:29.100> fancy

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
too fancy

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.250 
too fancy
you<00:04:30.240> have<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.419> type<00:04:30.600> in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.780> players<00:04:31.080> name

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
you have to type in the players name

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.860 
you have to type in the players name
exactly<00:04:31.560> correctly<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:33.030> let's<00:04:33.060> say<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:33.480> come

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
exactly correctly so let's say you come

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.450 
exactly correctly so let's say you come
down<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.410> see<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> Shawn<00:04:34.830> McCoy<00:04:35.190> well

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
down and you see the Shawn McCoy well

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.790 
down and you see the Shawn McCoy well
that's<00:04:36.300> for<00:04:36.540> capital<00:04:36.930> letters<00:04:37.199> that's<00:04:37.470> very

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
that's for capital letters that's very

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.500 
that's for capital letters that's very
difficult<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:38.669> someone<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.060> just

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
difficult for someone to just

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.420 
difficult for someone to just
necessarily<00:04:39.870> type<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:41.070> let's<00:04:41.220> say<00:04:41.340> you

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
necessarily type in so let's say you

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.680 
necessarily type in so let's say you
want<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.639> draft<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:41.910> on<00:04:42.060> McCoy<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.510> come

down here you find his name and it's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.040 
down here you find his name and it's
gonna<00:04:47.669> draft<00:04:47.880> him<00:04:48.000> for<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.690> as<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.960> can

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.469 
see test1 just drafted LeSean McCoy so
that's<00:04:53.699> how<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.060> works

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
that's how it works

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.780

tool<00:06:24.800> it's<00:06:25.800> designed<00:06:26.280> to<00:06:26.490> be<00:06:26.639> very<00:06:26.849> well

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
tool it's designed to be very well

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.990 
tool it's designed to be very well
simple<00:06:28.080> last<00:06:28.680> year<00:06:28.889> I<00:06:28.950> used<00:06:29.010> an<00:06:29.340> excel<00:06:29.700> file

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
simple last year I used an excel file

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.300 
simple last year I used an excel file
and<00:06:30.300> I<00:06:31.050> realized<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.560> I<00:06:31.620> wasn't<00:06:31.800> typing<00:06:32.220> in

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
and I realized that I wasn't typing in

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.420 
and I realized that I wasn't typing in
players<00:06:32.820> full<00:06:33.150> names<00:06:33.419> and<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:34.110> got<00:06:34.229> very

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
players full names and it got very

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.339 
players full names and it got very
jumbled<00:06:35.430> and<00:06:35.580> messy<00:06:36.030> and<00:06:36.210> so<00:06:36.360> this<00:06:36.570> way<00:06:36.780> the

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
jumbled and messy and so this way the

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.080 
jumbled and messy and so this way the
reason<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.620> wrote<00:06:37.770> this<00:06:37.950> is<00:06:38.130> because<00:06:38.370> I<00:06:38.610> just

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
reason I wrote this is because I just

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.820 
reason I wrote this is because I just
Python<00:06:39.630> and<00:06:39.750> it's<00:06:39.900> something<00:06:40.169> that's<00:06:40.320> pretty

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
Python and it's something that's pretty

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.850 
Python and it's something that's pretty
simple<00:06:41.160> and<00:06:41.370> right<00:06:42.800> so<00:06:43.800> that's<00:06:43.919> it<00:06:44.870> if<00:06:45.870> enough

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
simple and right so that's it if enough

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.610 
simple and right so that's it if enough
