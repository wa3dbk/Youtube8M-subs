00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.499 
about man he never know he could be
though<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.310> yeah<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> full-on<00:01:24.060> French

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
though and yeah it's a full-on French

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
though and yeah it's a full-on French
team<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.350> thought<00:01:25.680> it's<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> good

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
team so I thought it's gonna be a good

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
team so I thought it's gonna be a good
cuz<00:01:26.670> they've<00:01:26.790> got<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> green<00:01:27.540> links

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
cuz they've got a couple of green links

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.830 
cuz they've got a couple of green links
and<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.590> when<00:01:29.159> i<00:01:29.189> play<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.150> green<00:01:30.420> links

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and I think when i play the green links

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.420 
and I think when i play the green links
play<00:01:31.229> better<00:01:31.470> when<00:01:31.770> they<00:01:31.950> had<00:01:32.040> linked<00:01:32.310> up

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
play better when they had linked up

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.670 
play better when they had linked up
obviously<00:01:32.670> rather<00:01:33.060> than<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.540> yellow<00:01:34.290> links

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
obviously rather than i was yellow links
