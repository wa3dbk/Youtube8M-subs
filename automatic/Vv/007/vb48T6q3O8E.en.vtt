my friends message me look to my options

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.470 
my friends message me look to my options
if<00:00:31.830> hey<00:00:32.070> why<00:00:32.730> aren't<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> looking<00:00:33.149> at<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
if hey why aren't you looking at the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.530 
if hey why aren't you looking at the
sm58<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> industry<00:00:34.980> standard<00:00:35.540> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
sm58 it's the industry standard and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.900 
sm58 it's the industry standard and
basically<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> said<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> last<00:00:38.010> video<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
basically as I said in the last video I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.680 
basically as I said in the last video I
I<00:00:39.480> did<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.960> my<00:00:40.140> thought<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> sm58<00:00:41.850> but

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
I did have my thought was in a sm58 but

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.819 
I did have my thought was in a sm58 but
it<00:00:42.809> turned<00:00:43.020> out<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.850> Chinese<00:00:44.850> ripoff<00:00:45.829> so

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it turned out to be a Chinese ripoff so

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.760 
it turned out to be a Chinese ripoff so
I<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.820> hesitant<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.390> that

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
I was a little bit hesitant on that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.910 
I was a little bit hesitant on that
however<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> went<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.640> Mike's<00:00:51.030> eye

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
however when I went and got Mike's eye

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.510 
however when I went and got Mike's eye
picks<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.070> -<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.480> was<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.870> sure<00:00:55.829> bet<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
picks up - one of them was a sure bet a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
picks up - one of them was a sure bet a
-<00:00:57.030> 58<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.320> with<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> blue<00:00:58.649> ring

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
- 58 that's the one with the blue ring

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
- 58 that's the one with the blue ring
and<00:00:59.480> I<00:01:00.480> also<00:01:00.629> picked<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.109> secondary<00:01:01.500> one

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and I also picked up a secondary one

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.020 
and I also picked up a secondary one
which<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.370> egg<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.820> GD<00:01:03.750> five<00:01:04.729> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
which was an egg a GD five which is this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.350 
which was an egg a GD five which is this
one<00:01:10.760> now<00:01:12.500> people<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.010> me<00:01:14.360> they've

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
one now people have said to me they've

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.990 
one now people have said to me they've
expected<00:01:15.930> me<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> sm58<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.790> my

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
expected me to use the sm58 as my

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.179 
expected me to use the sm58 as my
primary<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.799> but<00:01:19.880> nope<00:01:21.229> this<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.920> my

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
primary one but nope this one is my

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.230 
primary one but nope this one is my
primary<00:01:23.460> one<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> reason<00:01:25.890> being<00:01:26.090> is<00:01:27.500> that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
primary one and the reason being is that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.219 
primary one and the reason being is that
it's<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.840> slot<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.780> firstly<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.990> nice

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it's got a slot this firstly it's nice

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.490 
it's got a slot this firstly it's nice
nicer<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.829> hold<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:36.020> secondly<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
nicer to hold and secondly it's got a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.929 
nicer to hold and secondly it's got a
what<00:01:37.770> hide<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> frequency<00:01:38.850> range<00:01:39.140> it's<00:01:40.140> 70<00:01:41.070> 70

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
what hide a frequency range it's 70 70

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
what hide a frequency range it's 70 70
he<00:01:42.659> up<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:44.659> 20,000<00:01:45.659> kilohertz<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.649> frequency

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
he up to 20,000 kilohertz the frequency

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
he up to 20,000 kilohertz the frequency
range<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.840> whereas<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.610> sm58<00:01:50.610> Amida<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.299> 50

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
range and whereas the sm58 Amida as 50

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.139 
range and whereas the sm58 Amida as 50
up<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:53.420> 15,000<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> bet<00:01:55.020> 80<00:01:55.409> goes<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.950> to

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
up to 15,000 and the bet 80 goes up to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
up to 15,000 and the bet 80 goes up to
16,000<00:01:57.149> same<00:01:57.719> frequency<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.100> lose<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
16,000 same frequency so you lose a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
16,000 same frequency so you lose a
little<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.880> low<00:02:00.000> end<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.420> near<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
little bit on the low end down near on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.590 
little bit on the low end down near on
you<00:02:01.110> lose<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> little<00:02:01.530> bit<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> low<00:02:01.860> end<00:02:01.890> but

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you lose a little bit on the low end but

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.480 
you lose a little bit on the low end but
there's<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.320> frequency<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.310> high

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
there's some more frequency in the high

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.660 
there's some more frequency in the high
range<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:07.170> ask<00:02:07.619> me<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.550> mic<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:10.400> just<00:02:11.400> as

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
range you ask me this mic is just as

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.970 
range you ask me this mic is just as
good<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.180> personally<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.260> it's<00:02:13.440> better

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
good I personally think it's better

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.750 
good I personally think it's better
yes<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.640> 58<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.890> also<00:02:17.099> slightly<00:02:17.340> cheaper

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
yes in 58 and it's also slightly cheaper

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.410 
yes in 58 and it's also slightly cheaper
as<00:02:18.030> well

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
as well

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.350 
as well
these<00:02:18.750> Gausman<00:02:19.319> are<00:02:19.410> round<00:02:19.709> about<00:02:19.830> 70<00:02:20.489> pounds

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
these Gausman are round about 70 pounds

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.820 
these Gausman are round about 70 pounds
there's<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.630> switch<00:02:21.900> version<00:02:22.319> as<00:02:22.440> well<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
there's a switch version as well as the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.520 
there's a switch version as well as the
