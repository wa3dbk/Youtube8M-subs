00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.829
 with 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:17.470
 we ask for the 2011 welcome but the literary program that takes seriously the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.659
 pop literature 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.719
 and will have everything you can read lying in bed you can see on the way to the 

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.079
 work or even in the 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.109
 and it's not because nobody told you it's not because you want 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.949
 and today I'm here to talk about the book 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.949
 The Battle of the Labyrinth 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.300
 cidec-south the mpx are already real character the author of the book here is very linked 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 né accompanying cameli will have recorded this highlighted by the first team 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 book 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.040
 so come on 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.640
 this dilemma 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.690
 which I can do from principle the boring continuous appreciation 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 is one of the main characters low of all the literature that I have seen 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.610
 encare tecnosport to the side but there are some that saved the clear 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
 a pity is that until the middle of September 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.680
 so to date the languages ​​you have to comment with the psd action 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.190
 Why groove that? 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.310
 this collapse had also at the time 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.970
 that she was of the race here with every victory every book most exported 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 also in the beginning even in the kitchen 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 but which is a vital piece decided 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.640
 return 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.170
 I think tomorrow I do not know if you can fill this gap. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.730
 spain just say so 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.030
 I do not know, but it's really cool people who call this book back 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.229
 nor the rain nor speak then why I was surprised at the time I saw 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.490
 I do not know if I would have liked it if someone had said that there 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.560
 but in spite of very interesting the small participations of other 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.340
 books is that I change the tip it always turns out very quickly there is not 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.880
 two pandemics like that for her but it was always spectacular 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.159
 initiative has matos the book it appearing so it's very cool I had 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.950
 until the middle of the book it got kind of tiring it follows God happens nothing 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.810
 in this thing the same as always even though things 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.169
 The Talks of the Lula Government 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.029
 but then better now with the correction of this new character 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.679
 there is no more character 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.679
 in that particular book 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.389
 ah the third book 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.919
 that acts was the previous one I liked 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:32.400
 much much much much more 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.589
 and it's much better than this 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.139
 but you follow this far 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:40.249
 it does not cost anything after metals book better then you have to have 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.459
 patience until you get there 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.860
