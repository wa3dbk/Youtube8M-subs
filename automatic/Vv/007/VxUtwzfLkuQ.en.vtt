gets real aggravating and try and put
something<00:01:35.259> back<00:01:35.319> together<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.830> can't

side<00:01:46.709> okay<00:01:47.709> now<00:01:47.920> we've<00:01:48.159> got<00:01:48.310> the<00:01:48.429> wheel

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
side okay now we've got the wheel

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.880 
side okay now we've got the wheel
removed<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.780> put<00:01:49.990> them<00:01:50.140> aside<00:01:50.259> got<00:01:50.770> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
removed and I put them aside got the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.499 
removed and I put them aside got the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
other tools up and out of the way it's

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.330 
other tools up and out of the way it's
good<00:01:52.630> idea<00:01:52.899> kind<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.289> keep<00:01:53.530> things<00:01:53.679> picked<00:01:54.220> up

I<00:01:59.920> kind<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.220> set<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:01.119> parts<00:02:01.420> i<00:02:01.509> take<00:02:01.690> them

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
I kind of set the the parts i take them

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.690 
I kind of set the the parts i take them
off<00:02:01.899> in<00:02:02.049> one<00:02:02.200> place<00:02:02.409> in<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.740> tools<00:02:03.220> close<00:02:03.490> by

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
off in one place in the tools close by

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.010 
off in one place in the tools close by
where<00:02:03.909> they're<00:02:04.060> accessible<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.750> out<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:04.959> the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
where they're accessible but out of the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
way while i'm working our next segment

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.029 
way while i'm working our next segment
we'll<00:02:07.149> be<00:02:07.299> on<00:02:07.420> we're<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.470> inspect<00:02:08.920> to

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
we'll be on we're going to inspect to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.699 
we'll be on we're going to inspect to
brake<00:02:09.220> system<00:02:09.609> prior<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:10.060> taking<00:02:10.269> it<00:02:10.709> apart

brake system prior to taking it apart

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.759 
brake system prior to taking it apart
dismantling<00:02:12.370> that'll<00:02:13.000> give<00:02:13.120> us<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.299> good<00:02:13.450> idea

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
dismantling that'll give us a good idea

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.199 
dismantling that'll give us a good idea
that<00:02:14.769> everything<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.160> working<00:02:15.370> correctly<00:02:15.519> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
that everything is working correctly and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.960 
that everything is working correctly and
smoothly<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.190> verify<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.579> got<00:02:18.730> warm

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
smoothly and verify we just got warm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
smoothly and verify we just got warm
pads<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.540> other<00:02:19.750> problems<00:02:20.109> in<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.260> braking
