00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
north each east so we just take a boat

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
north each east so we just take a boat
in<00:02:03.299> here<00:02:03.990> which<00:02:04.200> pretend<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.619> pretend<00:02:05.340> it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
in here which pretend about pretend it's

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.570 
in here which pretend about pretend it's
actually<00:02:05.990> floating<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> boat<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
actually floating we get in the boat and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.460 
actually floating we get in the boat and
we<00:02:08.729> those<00:02:09.209> roll<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.289> just

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
we those roll out of here and just

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.290 
we those roll out of here and just
transport<00:02:10.890> goods<00:02:11.129> across<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.760> content

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
transport goods across the content

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.530 
transport goods across the content
getting<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.780> back<00:02:13.810> how<00:02:14.530> much<00:02:15.010> boats<00:02:15.310> left<00:02:15.580> but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
getting it back how much boats left but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.480 
getting it back how much boats left but
yeah<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.320> this<00:02:17.680> which<00:02:17.950> also<00:02:18.100> works<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.460> a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
yeah and this which also works for a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.340 
yeah and this which also works for a
distraction<00:02:19.090> -<00:02:19.270> we<00:02:19.480> could<00:02:19.600> also<00:02:19.720> go<00:02:19.960> out<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
distraction - we could also go out that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.600 
distraction - we could also go out that
way<00:02:20.530> with<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.520> not

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
way with the at that but it's not

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.330 
way with the at that but it's not
advised<00:02:21.910> since<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.450> upstream<00:02:22.840> but<00:02:23.710> I<00:02:23.740> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
advised since this is upstream but I you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.480 
advised since this is upstream but I you
know<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.760> still<00:02:25.180> works<00:02:25.360> slower<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.890> also<00:02:27.070> have

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
know it still works slower we also have

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.520 
know it still works slower we also have
a<00:02:27.520> well<00:02:28.360> show<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.960> security<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.470> the

this is a faction claimed land so for

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.500 
this is a faction claimed land so for
them<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.160> like<00:02:39.220> Oh<00:02:39.430> open<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.030> closes<00:02:40.390> back

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.150 
them it's like Oh open it closes back
automatically<00:02:40.930> see<00:02:41.230> they<00:02:41.350> can't<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:42.010> can

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
automatically see they can't you can

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.370 
automatically see they can't you can
just<00:02:42.310> walk<00:02:42.430> through<00:02:42.460> it<00:02:42.700> super<00:02:43.150> simple<00:02:43.380> so

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
just walk through it super simple so

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.640 
just walk through it super simple so
this<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.280> basically<00:02:45.870> unopenable<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> add

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
this is basically unopenable but the add

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.040 
this is basically unopenable but the add
more<00:02:47.830> security<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.520> always<00:02:48.640> just<00:02:49.050> always

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
more security you can always just always

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.720 
more security you can always just always
do<00:02:50.500> just<00:02:50.710> do<00:02:50.830> this<00:02:51.300> add<00:02:52.300> more<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.350> more

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
do just do this add more and more

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.860 
do just do this add more and more
security<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:56.560> works<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.040> well<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.870> some

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
security this works as well to some

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.530 
security this works as well to some
cacti<00:02:59.350> right<00:02:59.590> there<00:02:59.860> well<00:03:00.760> i<00:03:00.790> guess<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.240> gets

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
thing is good to have basically a tree

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.480 
thing is good to have basically a tree
farm<00:05:42.520> in<00:05:42.849> your<00:05:43.300> backyard<00:05:43.509> which<00:05:44.500> our<00:05:44.860> base<00:05:45.310> is

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
farm in your backyard which our base is

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.059 
farm in your backyard which our base is
located<00:05:45.789> in<00:05:46.150> this<00:05:46.270> nice<00:05:46.719> safe<00:05:47.020> value<00:05:47.319> however

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
there you can see that Sarah it's our

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.040 
there you can see that Sarah it's our
base<00:05:50.319> tree<00:05:51.099> farms<00:05:51.370> up<00:05:51.490> here<00:05:51.759> it's<00:05:52.599> secure<00:05:52.960> to

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
base tree farms up here it's secure to

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.180 
base tree farms up here it's secure to
put<00:05:53.169> away<00:05:53.259> from<00:05:53.409> me<00:05:53.650> because<00:05:53.800> what<00:05:53.949> if<00:05:54.039> you

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
put away from me because what if you

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.700 
put away from me because what if you
know<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:55.000> catches<00:05:55.330> fire<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.659> fire<00:05:56.289> spreads<00:05:56.590> to

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
know it catches fire and fire spreads to

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.930 
know it catches fire and fire spreads to
your<00:05:56.830> base<00:05:56.949> you<00:05:57.099> don't<00:05:57.250> want<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.490> to<00:05:57.610> happen

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
your base you don't want that to happen

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.240 
your base you don't want that to happen
so<00:05:58.599> basically<00:05:58.960> this<00:05:59.199> tree<00:05:59.500> farm<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.889> basically

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
so basically this tree farm is basically

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.969 
so basically this tree farm is basically
completely<00:06:00.759> safe<00:06:01.000> far<00:06:01.659> away<00:06:01.779> from<00:06:01.840> our<00:06:02.139> base

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:02.979 
completely safe far away from our base

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.950 
completely safe far away from our base
in<00:06:03.009> a<00:06:03.430> catches<00:06:03.849> on<00:06:04.000> fire<00:06:04.210> which<00:06:04.479> is<00:06:04.599> a<00:06:04.630> very
