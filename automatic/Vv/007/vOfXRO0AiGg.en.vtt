00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 joule hi guys with you ilya and you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 see reviews of devices on the channel 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.560
 play day today in my hands 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.609
 Got a rather interesting tablet from 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.750
 archos namely arhaz 96 xenon 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 let's see let's go 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.250
 open this treasured box by 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.850
 we have the most complete set 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 tablet power supply usb wire and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 paperwork documentation is nothing superfluous 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 as they say there is no longer the only thing 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 I would like of course some 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
 headphones but in general it is not so 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.949
 The problem is the external tablet looks quite 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.960
 to myself worthy of course nothing special 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.059
 but at the same time plastic does not crunch and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.059
 all collected a very high quality 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 screen is 9 and 6 inches resolution 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 1280 by 800 and image quality I would 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 I called the average I compare the screen with 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.520
 more or less top - end devices because 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.229
 well accustomed to using it already and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750
 here of course a little bit all the same 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.080
 loses but in general anyway 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.159
 four hands such a tip, I would put 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.860
 describe screen technology allows 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.020
 provide wide viewing angles ie 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.689
 you get a clear image of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 any position with this here all 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.150
 excellent about the control buttons 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.970
 here is also all standard adjustment 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.189
 Our volume is on the side and here 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.250
 the same button to turn off the device 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.380
 now about the ports and beating the course with us 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.509
 located on the other side right there 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.970
 lid opening which we see entrances 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.479
 under the USB flash drive and sim card 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.060
 sinki whole davey here but I do not know on 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.040
 I think this is superfluous especially in the tablet 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.770
 but at the same time it can still someone 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.439
 and it is useful but the fact that the sim card 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 supported this anyway 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.829
 huge plus because and always with 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.860
 Such a device will be online in 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.349
 the internet is very good about 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.330
 internet here we have a 3g module 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.910
 of course not ltn 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.220
 in any case, not bad either 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.310
 we can make calls send 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.260
 sms and everything else you can do with 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.500
 using a full mobile 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.320
 we have 8 gigabyte memory devices 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.320
 and just a flash drive will even help 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.450
 there are also two quality cameras here 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.030
 also of course mean but for 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.250
 video calls quite fit on the back 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.280
 side we go to one speaker and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.860
 also one microphone now 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.410
 the most interesting talk about iron and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.780
 test the most popular toys 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.330
 I am sure that my audience is also like me 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.570
 love mobile games so for us 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.030
 it is well very important in general tablet 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.010
 us equipped with quad - core processor 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.860
 mediatek 1 and 3 gigahertz I am one 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.560
 gigabytes of ram in antutu 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.290
 the tablet was 17 thousand 793 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 parrots and the result is honest to say 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.280
 not the most outstanding but at the same time not 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.190
 we forget that it's all the same with us and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.360
 inexpensive device and I'm talking now 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.970
 not only about small 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.910
 games, but also a large-scale projects the same 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.910
 modern combat 3 ha real racing 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.440
 and so on, and here we have the whole thing just 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.510
 still in optimization 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.940
 guys with this case tried and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.950
 optimized the graphics just filed and 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.500
 iron to give was more or less 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.110
 comfortable by itself the graphics became 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.360
 much worse but nothing lays and 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.910
 in my opinion it is much better than they were 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.470
 battle hard lags and hangs and we in 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.500
 in any case could not play 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.080
 i played indie game here too 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.890
 all at a height all beautiful no 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.050
 brakes 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.060
 so if you are looking for an inexpensive 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.640
 tablet for games this device 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.459
 more than that, I am also a little 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.970
 villages on the internet youtube looked 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.310
 Sat in contact and failure behaved quite 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.290
 surely well well i think it's time to let 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.750
 results and I can say that the tablet 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.750
 such is worth 8 and a half thousand rubles 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.480
 and considering that there is a sim card + 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.280
 what optimization in games and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.859
 the principle of lags here is what someone is like 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.100
 No, then this is quite an adequate price. 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.150
 Of course this is not a top device and this 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.430
 by itself well 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.100
 on understand if you are looking for a budget 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.960
 option let's say for the child either myself 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.300
 inexpensive but at the same time high quality 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.110
 device you can watch this 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.030
 tablet 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.160
 a reference to it I leave in the description 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.590
