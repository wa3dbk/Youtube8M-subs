00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.260 
camels I don't think it's going to be
like<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.110> pack<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> punch<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.280> 20<00:00:57.000> times

mk10<00:01:23.159> i<00:01:23.369> guess<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.710> indication<00:01:25.710> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
mk10 i guess that's the indication of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.690 
mk10 i guess that's the indication of
how<00:01:26.369> much<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.479> cleaning<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.840> weapon<00:01:28.700> next

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in the bank so I'm guessing that the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
in the bank so I'm guessing that the
bank<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.759> making<00:01:36.119> return<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.659> EXO<00:01:36.990> zombies

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
but it's not necessarily the bank that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.069 
but it's not necessarily the bank that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
gonna guess that that's what they mean I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
that's what it is deposit and then when
you<00:01:50.100> play<00:01:50.310> another<00:01:50.610> game<00:01:50.759> you'll<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.420> able<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
you play another game you'll be able to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.800 
you play another game you'll be able to
make<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> withdrawal<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> I'm<00:01:53.579> truly<00:01:54.299> sorry

if<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.409> hearing<00:01:55.619> babies<00:01:56.070> screaming<00:01:56.579> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
if you're hearing babies screaming in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
if you're hearing babies screaming in
the<00:01:56.939> background<00:01:57.119> there's<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.590> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
the background there's not really much I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.120 
the background there's not really much I
can<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> why<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.600> traveled

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
can do this is why I have traveled

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.789 
can do this is why I have traveled
videos<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.030> whatever<00:02:02.869> for<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> fifth

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
videos but whatever for the fifth

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.370 
videos but whatever for the fifth
achievement<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.700> have<00:02:04.969> cheapskates<00:02:05.869> acquire

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
achievement we have cheapskates acquire

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.650 
achievement we have cheapskates acquire
the<00:02:06.619> exosuit<00:02:07.250> without<00:02:07.789> spending<00:02:08.149> any<00:02:08.450> money

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
the exosuit without spending any money

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.719 
the exosuit without spending any money
so<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.440> kind<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.709> confirms<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.489> won't

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
so this kind of confirms that you won't

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
so this kind of confirms that you won't
start<00:02:11.120> with<00:02:11.390> an<00:02:11.510> exosuit<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.380> seems<00:02:12.620> like

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
start with an exosuit and it seems like

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.339 
start with an exosuit and it seems like
you<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.130> use<00:02:14.090> your<00:02:14.300> money<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.660> acquire<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
you can use your money to acquire this

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.680 
you can use your money to acquire this
as<00:02:15.590> well<00:02:16.040> as<00:02:16.250> without<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:17.060> money<00:02:17.239> so<00:02:17.480> there

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
as well as without your money so there

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.259 
as well as without your money so there
won't<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.989> different<00:02:18.500> ways<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.970> acquire<00:02:19.970> it

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
won't be different ways to acquire it

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.150 
won't be different ways to acquire it
not<00:02:20.450> sure<00:02:20.660> how<00:02:20.900> but<00:02:21.170> maybe<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.010> turn

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
not sure how but maybe you have to turn

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.800 
not sure how but maybe you have to turn
on<00:02:22.370> some<00:02:22.550> sort<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.819> power<00:02:23.120> or<00:02:23.420> maybe<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.780> have

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
on some sort of power or maybe you have

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.410 
on some sort of power or maybe you have
to<00:02:24.019> do<00:02:24.140> an<00:02:24.370> objective<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.550> something<00:02:26.120> like

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
to do an objective or something like

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.559 
to do an objective or something like
that<00:02:26.480> next<00:02:27.260> burgle<00:02:27.860> burgle<00:02:28.310> burgle<00:02:28.910> steel

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
that next burgle burgle burgle steel

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.720 
that next burgle burgle burgle steel
tank<00:02:29.959> kills<00:02:30.170> from<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.590> teammate<00:02:31.099> now<00:02:31.310> this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
tank kills from a teammate now this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.729 
tank kills from a teammate now this
month<00:02:32.030> either<00:02:32.300> really<00:02:32.810> interesting<00:02:33.440> or<00:02:33.560> not

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
month either really interesting or not

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.949 
month either really interesting or not
so<00:02:33.950> interesting<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:35.030> you're<00:02:35.209> able<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.720> still

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
so interesting so you're able to still

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.900 
so interesting so you're able to still
kills<00:02:36.140> from<00:02:36.290> your<00:02:36.500> teammate<00:02:36.950> does<00:02:37.489> this<00:02:37.670> mean

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
kills from your teammate does this mean

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.270 
kills from your teammate does this mean
that<00:02:37.940> some<00:02:38.480> zombies<00:02:38.989> only<00:02:39.349> go<00:02:39.470> after<00:02:39.650> certain

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
that some zombies only go after certain

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.180 
that some zombies only go after certain
characters<00:02:40.849> it's<00:02:41.510> strange<00:02:41.870> but<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.799> trophy

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
characters it's strange but the trophy

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.190 
characters it's strange but the trophy
kind<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.489> hints<00:02:43.760> at<00:02:43.849> that<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.989> thing<00:02:45.170> is

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
kind of hints at that but the thing is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.259 
kind of hints at that but the thing is
zombies<00:02:45.680> run<00:02:45.920> after<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.370> closest<00:02:46.819> character

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
zombies run after the closest character

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.570 
zombies run after the closest character
so<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:48.049> kind<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.349> tricky<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.980> tell<00:02:49.190> what<00:02:49.400> they

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
so it's kind of tricky to tell what they

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.759 
so it's kind of tricky to tell what they
mean<00:02:49.819> by<00:02:49.970> still<00:02:50.269> 10<00:02:50.510> kills<00:02:50.780> but<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.380> guess<00:02:51.590> we'll

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
mean by still 10 kills but I guess we'll

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.479 
mean by still 10 kills but I guess we'll
see<00:02:52.150> next<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.329> have<00:02:53.569> game<00:02:53.989> over<00:02:54.290> man<00:02:54.410> call<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.310> a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
see next we have game over man call in a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.400 
see next we have game over man call in a
rescue<00:02:56.000> now<00:02:56.329> I<00:02:56.360> don't<00:02:56.630> know<00:02:56.870> how<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.140> feel

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
rescue now I don't know how to feel

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.589 
rescue now I don't know how to feel
about<00:02:57.470> this<00:02:57.769> I'm<00:02:58.220> either<00:02:58.790> going<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.360> be

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
about this I'm either going to be

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.270 
about this I'm either going to be
extremely<00:02:59.900> happy<00:03:00.620> or<00:03:00.769> extremely

extremely happy or extremely
disappointed<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.569> trophy<00:03:02.810> basically<00:03:03.440> tells

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
disappointed this trophy basically tells

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.170 
disappointed this trophy basically tells
us<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.010> there<00:03:04.250> will<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.430> an<00:03:04.760> end<00:03:04.910> game

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
us that there will be an end game

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.170 
us that there will be an end game
however<00:03:05.720> an<00:03:06.170> ending<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.190> occur<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.150> many

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
however an ending can occur in many

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.270 
however an ending can occur in many
different<00:03:08.569> ways<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:09.260> extinction<00:03:09.829> the<00:03:10.100> game

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
different ways in extinction the game

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.250 
different ways in extinction the game
just<00:03:10.489> straight<00:03:10.760> up<00:03:10.790> hence<00:03:11.180> game<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.930> literally

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
just straight up hence game is literally

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.099 
just straight up hence game is literally
over<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.549> didn't<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
over and I didn't like that I like the

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.289 
over and I didn't like that I like the
way<00:03:15.290> they<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:16.069> it<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.310> zombies<00:03:16.730> endless

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
way they have it in zombies endless

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.599 
way they have it in zombies endless
round<00:03:17.600> but<00:03:18.319> in<00:03:18.470> zombies<00:03:18.859> they<00:03:19.040> have<00:03:19.220> Easter

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
round but in zombies they have Easter

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.479 
round but in zombies they have Easter
eggs<00:03:19.730> that's<00:03:20.269> their<00:03:20.720> ending<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.319> really<00:03:22.130> really

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
eggs that's their ending I really really

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.430 
eggs that's their ending I really really
hope<00:03:22.639> that<00:03:23.000> they're<00:03:23.569> going<00:03:23.870> with<00:03:24.260> these

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
hope that they're going with these

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.379 
hope that they're going with these
tricks<00:03:24.769> instead<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.400> having<00:03:25.579> an<00:03:25.850> ending<00:03:26.209> like

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
tricks instead of having an ending like

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.050 
tricks instead of having an ending like
in<00:03:26.630> extinction<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.920> think<00:03:28.489> it's<00:03:28.609> more<00:03:28.700> likely

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
in extinction I think it's more likely

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.629 
in extinction I think it's more likely
they're<00:03:29.450> going<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:30.049> an<00:03:30.709> easter<00:03:31.069> egg<00:03:31.190> because

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
they're going with an easter egg because

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.180 
they're going with an easter egg because
that's<00:03:31.910> obviously<00:03:32.090> more<00:03:32.569> popular<00:03:33.139> but<00:03:33.799> it's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
that's obviously more popular but it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.460 
that's obviously more popular but it's
also<00:03:34.430> very<00:03:34.760> likely<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.209> there's<00:03:36.019> going<00:03:36.290> to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
also very likely that there's going to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.440 
also very likely that there's going to
be<00:03:36.500> an<00:03:36.739> optional<00:03:37.310> ending<00:03:37.670> maybe<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.329> don't

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
be an optional ending maybe you don't

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.990 
be an optional ending maybe you don't
have<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.930> call<00:03:39.079> in<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.319> rescue<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:39.889> whatever<00:03:40.819> it

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
have to call in a rescue but whatever it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.390 
have to call in a rescue but whatever it
is<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.329> just<00:03:41.359> hope<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.139> doesn't<00:03:42.170> end<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.220> game

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
is I just hope it doesn't end the game

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.449 
is I just hope it doesn't end the game
like<00:03:43.639> in<00:03:43.850> extinction<00:03:44.590> next<00:03:45.590> up<00:03:45.739> we<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:45.980> come

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
like in extinction next up we have come

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.960 
like in extinction next up we have come
on<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:46.930> slam<00:03:47.930> 10<00:03:48.470> zombies<00:03:48.859> at<00:03:49.040> once<00:03:49.250> pretty

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
on and slam 10 zombies at once pretty

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.210 
on and slam 10 zombies at once pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:50.480> it<00:03:51.200> sounds<00:03:51.620> pretty<00:03:51.889> hard

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
self-explanatory it sounds pretty hard

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.760 
self-explanatory it sounds pretty hard
though<00:03:52.579> I<00:03:52.819> mean<00:03:53.299> 10<00:03:53.480> zombies<00:03:53.870> at<00:03:54.049> once<00:03:54.260> that's

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
though I mean 10 zombies at once that's

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.640 
though I mean 10 zombies at once that's
quite<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:54.980> lot<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.330> slam<00:03:57.050> isn't<00:03:57.410> really

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
quite a lot and the slam isn't really

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.260 
quite a lot and the slam isn't really
that<00:03:57.800> powerful<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:58.490> don't<00:03:58.760> know<00:03:58.820> we'll<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.000> how

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
that powerful I don't know we'll see how

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.160 
that powerful I don't know we'll see how
it<00:03:59.300> plays<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.470> then<00:04:00.710> we<00:04:00.950> have<00:04:01.220> pc<00:04:01.820> load<00:04:02.060> letter

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
it plays so then we have pc load letter

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.620 
it plays so then we have pc load letter
use<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.410> 3d<00:04:03.740> printer<00:04:04.310> 15<00:04:04.820> times<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.570> single

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
use the 3d printer 15 times in a single

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.850 
use the 3d printer 15 times in a single
match<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.760> 3d<00:04:08.210> printer<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.780> basically<00:04:09.350> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
match so the 3d printer is basically the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.970 
match so the 3d printer is basically the
mystery<00:04:10.340> box<00:04:10.550> i<00:04:10.910> guess<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.560> see<00:04:12.800> it

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
mystery box i guess and you can see it

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.270 
mystery box i guess and you can see it
in<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.490> EXO<00:04:14.330> zombies<00:04:14.360> trailer<00:04:15.010> but<00:04:16.010> it

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
in the EXO zombies trailer but it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.190 
in the EXO zombies trailer but it
doesn't<00:04:16.640> necessarily<00:04:16.700> have<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.630> be<00:04:17.870> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
doesn't necessarily have to be the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.260 
doesn't necessarily have to be the
alternative<00:04:18.590> of<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.190> mystery<00:04:19.520> box<00:04:19.670> because<00:04:20.239> a

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
alternative of the mystery box because a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.640 
alternative of the mystery box because a
mystery<00:04:20.720> box<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.290> supposed<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.220> be<00:04:22.370> random<00:04:22.940> and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
mystery box is supposed to be random and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.720 
mystery box is supposed to be random and
beauty<00:04:24.650> printer<00:04:25.040> isn't<00:04:25.220> wheeling<00:04:25.700> that

beauty printer isn't wheeling that

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.790 
beauty printer isn't wheeling that
random<00:04:26.330> but<00:04:26.510> maybe<00:04:26.750> they<00:04:26.990> just<00:04:27.020> don't<00:04:27.380> follow

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
random but maybe they just don't follow

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.220 
random but maybe they just don't follow
the<00:04:28.100> definition<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.700> what<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:29.180> 3d<00:04:30.080> printer

the definition of what a 3d printer

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.980 
the definition of what a 3d printer
