 the Pontebbana is unlikely to date 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.080
 they tell of closed wagons from where they come out 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.140
 pitiful moans and invocations where I fall 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.360
 fetid and shit laurina someone has 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.940
 shouted that they would open because inside you 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.059
 they were dead the railway is 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.890
 littered with corpses 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.350
 it seems that the podestÃ s of the countries on the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.120
 Pontebbana railway have achieved that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.129
 trains stop at stations up to 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.960
 when the soldiers received water a

 Enough is as hot as it is 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.060
 it was not in living memory in this

 fruit of affects all the rich poor 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 no because everyone had children watching 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.240
 so it's an inter-class outrage 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.500
 therefore also beats boys of the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.970
 bourgeoisie 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.020
 of the incredible also a certain point in

 all stations as an order e 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.750
 it was not an order women girls run 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.880
 they arrive bringing water especially 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.440
 asked these soldiers so food 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.540
 they could pass for others 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.570
 narrow night windows have wagons 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.570
 livestock 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:56.300
 I remember with my hands or always 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 forward to the eyes with the hands that 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:05.240
 they always pleaded I will never forget 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.730
 because they are things that remain so much more 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.730
 when everyone agazzi share 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.100
 and speak to the was important that I do not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 I could communicate hard hunger that yesterday 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.240

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.930
 additions vin d'albania veni vidi 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.850
 Yugoslavia and through the windows 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.700
 small of the cattle carts threw down 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.740
 the cards with the young address 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.220
 register at my parents home 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.680
 say that I have passed by hearing that there 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.010
 took Germans who bring us in 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.800
 Germany and we did not collect the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.710
 little notes and we have written so many 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.890
 postcards of those of a rockol e 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.700
 fine postal cartons and we wrote i 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.220
 there were boys we are going to nuremberg 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.890
 when we come back we bring you a doll 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.209
 and I said I'm still waiting for the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.130
 I no longer saw them beard 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 none of these letters I have 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:17.470
 sent I also had feedback from two 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:20.650
 but then the correspondence is over 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.880
 because I could not help them not 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.209
 I knew what to say no I was 16 years old it was one 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.700
 sort of transmission and then also of 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:34.480
 more and more awareness of 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.400
 what was happening and understand that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.530
 your contribution 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.530
 it was important to change the story 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.100
 it was beginning to get dark 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.110
 they loaded us are freight cars e 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.030
 they closed a hatch 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.530
 the train moved and entered the station 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.990
 central 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.330
 helped by a companion I looked out to the 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.780
 high grating of the wagon and I saw on the 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.150
 quay a girl in free milan le 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.100
 I asked why he was there and she answered 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.920
 who was the controller on the trains 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.859
 passengers and could not return home 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.870
 due to curfew 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.370
 he begs you to unhook the hook 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.190
 he closed the door of the freight car 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.940
 where we were prisoners and to tell al 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.280
 driver to slow down before lean 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.730
 at that moment the train did again 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.010
 maneuver and went into the second track her 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.810
 through to the tracks and release to the 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.910
 hatchback 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.040
 I remember hearing the sound of 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.160
 hook that opened and in the same 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.290
 moment the whistle of a train that covered 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.770
 hook noise so that the Germans 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.010
 they didn't notice anything 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.010
 the train left I tried to open and yes 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.310
 he opened was immensely grateful to that 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.310
 unknown
