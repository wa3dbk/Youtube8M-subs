00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
for that reason that did buy a whole

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.390 
for that reason that did buy a whole
bottle<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.879> for<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.250> want

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
to scant this over your liver dish now I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.259 
to scant this over your liver dish now I
was<00:02:29.640> very<00:02:29.849> lucky<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:31.370> when<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> bought<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
was very lucky because when I bought the

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.199 
was very lucky because when I bought the
liver<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.989> was<00:02:34.590> already<00:02:35.160> cleaned<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.090> me

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
liver it was already cleaned out for me

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.630 
liver it was already cleaned out for me
but<00:02:36.450> if<00:02:36.569> you're<00:02:36.780> finding<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.230> fresh<00:02:37.530> liver<00:02:37.920> most

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but if you're finding a fresh liver most

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.789 
but if you're finding a fresh liver most
likely<00:02:39.090> you'd<00:02:39.299> have<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.870> cut<00:02:40.230> out<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.530> fine

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
likely you'd have to cut out the fine

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.860 
likely you'd have to cut out the fine
membranes<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.790> blood<00:02:42.030> vessels<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.660> other

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
membranes the blood vessels and other

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.589 
membranes the blood vessels and other
filaments<00:02:43.590> mine<00:02:44.400> was<00:02:44.579> already<00:02:44.819> done<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.420> me

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
filaments mine was already done for me

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.400 
filaments mine was already done for me
so<00:02:46.160> this<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.400> its<00:02:47.519> gonna<00:02:47.579> look<00:02:47.700> like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
so this is what its gonna look like

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.280 
so this is what its gonna look like
you're<00:02:49.410> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.860> let<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.489> sit<00:02:50.879> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
you're going to let it sit and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.190 
you're going to let it sit and
refrigerate<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:52.670> 12<00:02:53.670> hours<00:02:54.200> you'll

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
refrigerate this for 12 hours you'll

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.250 
refrigerate this for 12 hours you'll
want<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.500> turn<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.950> liver<00:02:56.420> once<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.780> each<00:02:57.959> side

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
want to turn the liver once on each side
