etc so the reason that it's so confusing

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.759 
etc so the reason that it's so confusing
is<00:00:44.420> because<00:00:44.659> you<00:00:44.749> actually<00:00:44.989> earn<00:00:45.379> squad

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
is because you actually earn squad

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.130 
is because you actually earn squad
points<00:00:46.039> any<00:00:46.339> variety<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.850> ways<00:00:47.120> like<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.870> jump

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640

points that goes towards you now this

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.790 
points that goes towards you now this
probably<00:01:17.660> seems<00:01:17.870> unfair<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.500> was<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.680> only

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
probably seems unfair it was the only

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.860 
probably seems unfair it was the only
way<00:01:19.010> because<00:01:19.310> it<00:01:19.460> usually<00:01:19.700> costs<00:01:20.150> from<00:01:20.510> around

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
way because it usually costs from around

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.930 
way because it usually costs from around
three<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.650> four<00:01:21.920> points<00:01:22.430> for<00:01:22.550> an<00:01:22.610> attachment

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
three to four points for an attachment

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.110 
three to four points for an attachment
for<00:01:23.810> 29<00:01:24.320> points<00:01:24.830> or<00:01:24.950> sometimes<00:01:25.400> even<00:01:25.550> up<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.910> 10

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
for 29 points or sometimes even up to 10

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.150 
for 29 points or sometimes even up to 10
points<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.630> gun<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.410> would<00:01:27.770> take<00:01:27.980> you<00:01:28.130> a

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
points for a gun so it would take you a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.280 
points for a gun so it would take you a
lot<00:01:28.400> maybe<00:01:28.610> around<00:01:28.970> more<00:01:29.270> than<00:01:29.420> 40<00:01:29.810> points<00:01:30.170> to

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
lot maybe around more than 40 points to

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.960 
lot maybe around more than 40 points to
be<00:01:30.410> able<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.830> decent<00:01:31.010> attachments<00:01:31.850> and

to make sure that if you do complete all
the<00:02:24.440> objectives<00:02:24.860> you<00:02:25.070> can<00:02:25.250> continue<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.730> get

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
the objectives you can continue to get

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.330 
the objectives you can continue to get
more<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.870> continue<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.440> give<00:02:27.710> more<00:02:27.950> kind<00:02:28.250> of

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
more is to continue to give more kind of

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.580 
more is to continue to give more kind of
operations<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.300> need<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.720> every<00:02:30.410> two

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
operations that you need to do every two

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.890 
operations that you need to do every two
weeks<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.130> what<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.460> looks<00:02:31.670> like<00:02:31.850> now<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.750> was

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
weeks is what it looks like now that was

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.570 
weeks is what it looks like now that was
the<00:02:32.990> second<00:02:33.320> way<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.440> get<00:02:33.770> squad<00:02:34.130> points<00:02:34.340> out

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580

the second way to get squad points out
the<00:02:34.730> third<00:02:34.940> way<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.180> get<00:02:35.390> squad<00:02:35.720> point<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
the third way to get squad point is to

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.320 
the third way to get squad point is to
actually<00:02:36.620> play<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.130> objective<00:02:37.790> this<00:02:37.970> one<00:02:38.180> is

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
actually play the objective this one is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.110 
actually play the objective this one is
a<00:02:38.630> little<00:02:38.810> kind<00:02:39.200> of<00:02:39.350> fuzzy<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.830> what<00:02:39.980> exactly

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
a little kind of fuzzy on what exactly

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
a little kind of fuzzy on what exactly
how<00:02:41.120> many<00:02:41.180> points<00:02:41.450> against<00:02:41.750> stuff<00:02:41.960> like<00:02:42.110> that

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
how many points against stuff like that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.810 
how many points against stuff like that
but<00:02:42.380> from<00:02:42.560> what<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.740> have<00:02:43.070> understood<00:02:43.610> from

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
but from what I have understood from

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.090 
but from what I have understood from
playing<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> game<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:44.570> multiple<00:02:45.470> hours<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
playing the game for multiple hours is

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.190 
playing the game for multiple hours is
that<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:46.790> get<00:02:46.940> squad<00:02:47.300> points<00:02:47.540> were<00:02:47.750> actually

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
that you get squad points were actually

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.870 
that you get squad points were actually
playing<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> objective<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:49.100> what<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.550> mean<00:02:49.760> by

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
playing the objective now what I mean by

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.430 
playing the objective now what I mean by
playing<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.270> objective<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.840> not<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.410> know

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
playing the objective it's not you know

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.500 
playing the objective it's not you know
go<00:02:51.770> capture<00:02:52.280> flag<00:02:52.640> so<00:02:52.880> do<00:02:53.030> all<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.240> kind<00:02:53.450> of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
go capture flag so do all that kind of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.600 
go capture flag so do all that kind of
stuff<00:02:53.570> you<00:02:54.200> know<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.380> get<00:02:54.920> more<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.550> you

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
stuff you know you get more and you

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.850 
stuff you know you get more and you
level<00:02:55.910> up<00:02:56.000> faster<00:02:56.480> by<00:02:56.630> doing<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.020> but<00:02:57.620> what<00:02:57.830> I

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
level up faster by doing that but what I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.740 
level up faster by doing that but what I
mean<00:02:58.160> by<00:02:58.340> playing<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> objective<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.480> if

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
mean by playing the objective is if

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.030 
mean by playing the objective is if
