 come here and it was your turn to come 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.140
 This restaurant's kitchen is a 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 new concept so much in Mexico I think 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 that many places in the world is 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.300
 originating from hermosillo sonora is 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.699
 made by people from mexico and the menu then 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.589
 has saucers as if 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.019
 you were eating your house if you really 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.210
 that is very rich besides this I want 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.550
 tell them the place is called comics and 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.400
 it's so amazing on the menu he does not know 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.159
 where to go or is it all delicious 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.820
 you absolutely crave all 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.710
 cocktails at the bar or you when 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 you come here add 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.119
 I have to talk I think that as everything 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.159
 the big boy 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.470
 I got to the restaurant I took the pictures 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.300
 I loved it 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.130
 and it came back to me as attention 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.470
 to work in a restaurant and more 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.660
 that a restaurant is coming and you feel 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.120
 with a box of giant toys and 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.030
 see them all kinds of dolls of the 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.980
 comics and you can come take the picture not 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.540
 there are those who do not enter here do not go out with a 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.310
 photo of the restaurant and I want me to 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.600
 tell is a little bit adrián when 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.810
 have you we loved you you found yourself in the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.070
 kitchen what thing you changed me where 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.550
 where are you going 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.270
 from a gastronomic point of view 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.539
 look, I think 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.579
 like every chef there is never anything 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.090
 dish or nothing is perfect 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.280
 then it has cost us work the power 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.170
 standardize the recipes we have 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.040
 restaurants in different places of the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.080
 republic and from here sometimes a 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.970
 place from one delegation to another change 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 the tastes imagine how they change of a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.030
 place to another 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.030
 then that is the problem of the 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.379
 ingredients the problem good problems 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.660
 if there are no different ingredients in 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.030
 Everywhere we try to have meat 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.840
 for our hamburgers that is 100% 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.299
 of beef and 100% Sonoran then the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.610
 rival comes from sonora 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.250
 Mexican is Mexican, the meat is 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.510
 mexicana the chain and we are mexican

 grow 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.549
 gastronomically is to innovate not so much 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.989
 visually with everything we have the 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.840
