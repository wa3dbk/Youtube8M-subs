00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 Good here now I just want to emphasize one 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:19.590
 thing the use of the powder guard is this is mine 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:22.279
 my old man and he was already 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.279
 committed 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:40.020
 So you got it right and here we have a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:43.020
 focus on the wine camera and if you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.219
 buy a great neighbor of small 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.030
 parts on the free market was one that 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 eraser 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.520
 one of them to do service already had 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.690
 changed the invitation earlier and the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.390
 market is not so good 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 the one that used only the regulating 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.430
 angle here with the ide that is with 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.860
 39 and I'll still see what the ideal time is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.710
 here they go over the rubber 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.710
 that the dust guard without any problem 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 ok ok 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.830
 Good, now I got the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 guard powder 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:35.930
 I will tell you here installed a little 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.180
 This is the purpose of 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.570
 to come here for that part that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:48.329
 also just cause clutch and the old 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:53.520
 only hand she already gave a kick I go 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.369
 test the car over a time not 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.770
 Will you be able to take a test today? 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.369
 I have to adjust the height of the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.610
 pedal and butterfly, I'll do it from here 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.770
 little one thing that is important 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 which for sure the owner of bingo 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:20.910
 size mostly just do not know 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.960
 to say if there was something like that in 84 56 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.520
 in the case of itamar 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.940
 all have this part that is the catalyst 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:36.000
 of coal 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:38.580
 this piece she gets a little bit 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.060
 Okay, the question is this if you 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.390
 want to have Chinese success in the clutch or 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.560
 remember here in this part and 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.350
 Move it 's just a screw up two 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.570
 hoses released quiet province gives 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.390
 a general on it out just a little 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.430
 Too bad here is important to take 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.430
 That's it until after you buy it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.730
 connect the ways that will not stay the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 fuckin 'gas stink I think 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.640
 It is here that there is a return of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.340
 carburettor and eventually 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.410
 accumulating the droplets of gasoline here 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.900
 well there have been maintenance 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.590
 It will not so it was not was was 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.590
 changed 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.459
 I suggest it was leaking oil is over 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.920
 accumulating a little dirt here 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.120
 My next step is now 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.680
 activity in this activity is to regulate the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.620
 attention here pedal there in butterfly 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.690
 clutch car that places the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.860
 system gets motivated one thing 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.390
 only when 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.739
 placing this invitation 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.140
 the cable inside the cabin on the pedalboard 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:00.620
 he will get caught by a hook like that 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:02.940
 right in this case is if you care 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.250
 push the car back 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.549
 He'll let it go so keep it always. 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 cable tensioned to the back cover of the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.610
 car always anything to do is 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.590
 hold the end of the cable and 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.109
 back or else he will go out there 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.450
 front you will have to mount everything from 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.250
 new 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.230
 to re- rent my helper the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.460
 camera and a half just arrived and was 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.050
 eating something in there is still 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.890
 I'll post a video still to 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.980
 conclude that here only gives with coal 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.880
 place here more here a little bit 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.340
 return 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:51.220
 Look at this yellow hose or the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:58.110
 tube means runs runs from 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:02.380
 accelerator and the harmony of the 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:06.340
 return of gasoline confirms that this 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.380
 even the tone of gasoline which 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.450
 happens this morning 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.380
 She goes straight with my car to the 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.410
 chapel 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.650
 He goes up there and goes through the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:23.590
 hole of the chapel will get there in the engine 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:27.900
 Okay, I took advantage and I changed the dustpan 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:33.670
 from the tip of the area can see up here 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:41.410
 I put the folding in the door at the door. 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:45.750
 the old rubber there and put it 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:50.200
 this will bring benefit or even 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:58.090
 a match played the good match of 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:06:06.840
 oppression from here to here I have the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:06.840
 flow well free hakim said the 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:19.240
 g7 the cable here because I have the 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:21.130
 engine out while looking good now 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.120
 this will be the last sequence of this 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.060
 alive 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.580
 we finish here this service and civilians 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.970
 What purpose does it show that beauty was 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.070
 here to review every pedal in the 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.170
 notification part 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.220
 weighed check quality cable 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.810
 accelerator 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.240
 everything is right, building is regular 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.010
 you can not test it yet because of the 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.320
 car motor is not running 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:51.970
 still okay but our goal that was 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:55.540
 Reached, we change back to me, we change. 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:58.330
 back then the conduit ok 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.420
 I returned to the guard after the cable 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.620
 accelerator and the clutch cable will 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:08.260
 It's very nice, I know when I have 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:10.360
 Pressing to send a message has a 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.730
 Channel of Bernardo that my camera man 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.620

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.760
 business so anyone who wants to access my 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.570
