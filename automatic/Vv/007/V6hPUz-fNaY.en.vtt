00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello friends today we are going to make a 

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:15.910
 wooden crossbow but first let's go to 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.910
 see its power of destruction 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.940
 good to do it and that is like 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.650
 this is a prototype that I have made 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.080
 before and how it has worked very well 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.410
 nothing we are going to make another 8 sticks of 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.070
 these ice cream a saw a rubber 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.410
 elastic a skewer office clip 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.270
 to make the arrows that we will cut it 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.510
 custom made hot silicone gun 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.420
 and practically that's all, so the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 first step is to join two sticks of these 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.430
 of ice cream for this will be let's say the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.910
 main body of the crossbow to which 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.440
 we will have to cut the area this curve 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.640
 to make it flat 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.920
 then there will be united what the arch is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.690
 bow of the crossbow but good this already 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.660
 we will do it a bit later now let's go 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 to focus on the mango we unite of this 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.080
 form has to be angled so that 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.899
 be ergonomic and we can take it 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.180
 easily and comfortably later 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:18.040
 fill with two more that is for 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.470
 fill the interior hollow of the handle 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.780
 all this with hot silicone that binds 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.140
 very very well kisses and the height is already 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.100
 matched and now we close with the fourth 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:33.280
 the fourth madrid or ice cream stick 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 ok we have our handle made and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.479
 now we will cut to size we take it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.720
 we see that it is comfortable and more or less than 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.420
 over a little bit there we will cut to be 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.450
 soft wood with the saw then 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.600
 will cut phenomenal vale is already perfect 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.740
 the next step prepare the arch of the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 crossbow 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.369
 there we have some hard indie 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.369
 place the rubber band 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.110
 that using the saw as nothing 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.500
 we will make super easy and nothing very fast 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.179
 well we have now we have to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.830
 squared it in the middle more or less to eye 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.910
 you do not need and measure or anything because they go 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.610
 to be little the wood because to eye is 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.100
 easy to place it in the center we make sure 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.460
 Well, this area is going to have a lot 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.340
 tension when stretching the rubber and you have to 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.460
 be quite firm good this is the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.010
 office clamp and have good you 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.750
 we have to remove a puppy like 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.940
 we have seen but it has a salient is 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.709
 that outgoing we have to cut it out the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.580
 wood so it will be well and fair 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.920
 tightly attached to the main body 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.730
 You see we have made a cleft already enters 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.180
 okay so more hot silicone 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.190
 we paste and well then we have our 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.350
 firing device now we have to 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.660
 do the arrow guide good 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.070
 We cut the circular part of the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.440
 sticks and more or less a pair of fingers 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.290
 so no need to eye 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.960
 an exact measurement possibly so that 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.470
 the arrow has a good guide we cut 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.650
 a couple of pieces of wood and the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.400
 we will stick letting a 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.549
 little up 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.130
 and being born as a channel is worth only 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:28.720
 remains to put the elastic 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.410
 we put the two notches in both and already 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.540
 this is our wooden crossbow 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.959
 with ice cream sticks 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.670
 now let's prepare the arrows good 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.379
 as the brochette is quite long 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.299
 we have to cut it with scissors or 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.299
 with the same saw could be done 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.760
 in the back to fit 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.020
 well in the rubber and it does not come out 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.020
 we return to make a small indentation 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.000
 here I already have four or five prepared 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.740
 and you have to make a notch because 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.380
 we know what is going to get hooked 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.480
 with the office clamp and so I do not know 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.340
 I'll let you look at it so you can see what 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.490
 I mean, you see, it's pretty firm 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.110
 and then nothing because now simply subtracts 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.080
 do the test 01 well we have both 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.100
 we are going to do shooting tests in our 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.100
 shooting range we go there 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.669
 long distances so you can see that 

00:04:34.929 --> 00:04:38.669
 It has scope and power 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.289
 very well because it has been nailed until the 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.020
 wood and that is wood with wood 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.229
 so you can see that this is dangerous and 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.629
 simply accompanied by a greater 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.639
 age you can make it clear to the right 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.250
 you can see the figaro cat that is 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.069
 sleeping well I hope that I have you 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.780
 liked and nothing a greeting until the week 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.780
 what comes next
