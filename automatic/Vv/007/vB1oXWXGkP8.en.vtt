00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 he soon flávio augusto pereira this 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 professor at the university of são paulo 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.620
 studying paranormal phenomena and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.719
 ufology for more than 40 years for 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 Night got away talking how did the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 people can be sure that these 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 phenomena happen because a lot of people 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.830
 can say that he sees of but in fact can 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.289
 be an imagination and even those of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.859
 A lie like you said it before. 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.660
 the program starts in fact is the science 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.820
 is based on the study of phenomena 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.070
 later the scientist will 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 to elaborate an explanation a hypothesis one 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.700
 shocking theory walked this will depend 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.250
 has been looking for more than 50 years 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 the young people frequent the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.360
 our biosphere in the occasion of peace or 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.789
 war or war then it is natural that 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.520
 always come up because it messes with the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.469
 collective unconscious the game you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.609
 admit that there are beings here 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.810
 extraterrestrials 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.350
 the extradimensional ones visiting us who 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
 knows if they are policing us and maybe doing 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.650
 scientific experiments 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.840
 Now you spoke in peace time in 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.090
 times of war 50 years ago was the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.650
 World War II, so it 's me. 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.810
 I always say that ufology 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.580
 started militarized because when you judge 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 to know more is that we see these movies 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.509
 of the Second War and a bombing of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.380
 England was that of a house in a row 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.450
 for up to 345 luminous balls that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.820
 followed the moods and the gunners 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.820
 who were in the cause of these subway planes 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.299
 I would then look at the barge now 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.700
 happened a curious fact 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.149
 both attributed to an enemy the possession of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.600
 a secret weapon that is why 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.189
 appointed a commission and short also 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.130
 so this is not a joke because 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.730
 pilots of warplane 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 are highly differentiated people there 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.380
 Rita now has appointed him a commission. 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.530
 now in brazil also had a commission 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.600
 which began in 58 that you did part up 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.420
 God was president of this committee. 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.480
 because this commission was established in 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.460
 50 because here in Brazil during that 57 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.150
 was the year of the opening of our era 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.160
 space with the two powers the bone 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.330
 Russians the Soviets of October and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:36.930
 November while there were over 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.960
 20 cases in Brazil two airplanes 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.120
 freighters from a large company 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.520
 were followed by discs 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.530
 almost a fire on board a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.160
 the plane returned from the Great 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.320
 south 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.600
 my case of the explosion of a disc in 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.110
 What are these fragments? 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.050
 here exactly with pure magnesium marcia 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.740
 pure magnesium is something impossible 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.930
 there are these products today and the more 57 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.290
 now this book here also clashes 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.630
 by jacques wagner and also talks about a 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 appearance of flying saucers 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.790
 would have to be even injured by 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.490
 explosions as well and that it would be an 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.350
 would be in the bay of the sun in one of the 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.570
 stop the belém the sun also know that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.090
 if so this case you refer 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:29.640
 is much more recent is 84 88 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 Northeast Brazil was object northeast 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.050
 spreading north to stop was the subject of 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.110
 a violent search on a spindle for the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.640
 works and at least I have news of 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:48.870
 10 with pitons that is not a clash 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:53.360
 thus are indirect consequences of a 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.680
 of an apparatus whose components 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.730
 technological know-how and never again 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.230
 this book here that I'm going to show now 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.400
 shows that they also think the pig 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.370
 Could not explain it here it's kind of you. 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.459
 it has no censorship that none 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 none is a smart program that the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.729
 in case the bozízio this boy that you 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.109
 they saw to the right he is he passed away there 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:24.050
 little time is and was not a farmer of 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.449
 mine if this happened and 57 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.479
 also that year in which the 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.300
 disc in batuba he was taken after 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.150
 several days on which a red object 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.250
 I traveled the night of his farm and owns 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.770
 a farm his brother other people 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.139
 they also saw one more night he 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.750
 was taken now the disk will have 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.100
 sexual relations with an alien who 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.919
 seems a human who probably 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.919
 it must have been a human pre- or almost a 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.289
 because he has relationships now that 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.490
 she at the end pointed to the net 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:04.820
 hence detail that concentrate on all this 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:11.450
 this is alien pointed to the belly 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.599
 her company pittoni so if this 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.229
 the same thing happens and everything indicates that 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:20.000
 shows the intelligence of these girls 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.190
 nelson the fact of building a machine 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.500
 like the one that arrives here nobody knows 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.800
 where can be of others your comments 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.630
 can be of other dimensions knows but is 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.000
 The strangest thing about it is the 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.590
 physical similarity because it is 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.060
 She looks like a woman on the land 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.310
 discretion because it is 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.530
 although this was done here on the basis of 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.610
 reconstitution by a friend painter 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.070
 English 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.750
 in the reconstitution we have now we go 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.300
 elaborate a little on top of this gesture 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.970
 her to point at the belly is as if 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.949
 I already received it as if she 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.979
 had even hinted that it could 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.090
 being pregnant we will certainly have 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.720
 surely it may have been really 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.840
 This may make it clear that 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.630
 we can see a race of means 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.010
 Earthlings emails animism look that's 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.270
 from me said the young man 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.130
 I want to do here and this is perfectly 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.680
 possible because we are doing 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.610
 now in laboratories blends of g 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.810
 of plant with people know more I found of 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.000
 experience out there 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:24.620
 so it is not extraordinary that our 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.840
 dna can be combined with a dna 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.479
 strange this is perfectly possible 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.240
 But you can only say that now because 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:36.020
 ten years ago would be very difficult 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.470
 you defend a theory where there was 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.509
 a combination of dna 's so different 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.220
 That's it today, it's an asshole face. 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.770
 So, shall we not? 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.960
 mutants here on earth can be can be 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.340
 chance to thank you for your 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.340
 presence in an interview here in our
