00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.940 
and if you look this plant already grew
a<00:01:39.470> lot<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:41.540> lot<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.750> have<00:01:43.049> been<00:01:43.229> dosing<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.799> with

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
a lot a lot I have been dosing it with

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
a lot a lot I have been dosing it with
some<00:01:44.100> fertilizer<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.689> root<00:01:45.930> tabs<00:01:46.229> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
there I think I might change the grab

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.020 
there I think I might change the grab
hold<00:01:49.409> off<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.860> fluorite<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:50.909> gonna

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
hold off to fluorite because I'm gonna

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.800 
hold off to fluorite because I'm gonna
change<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> gravel<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.049> 38<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.040> might<00:01:53.280> just

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
change the gravel my 38 so I might just

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.569 
change the gravel my 38 so I might just
switch<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> fluorite<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:59.399> yeah

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
switch this over to fluorite the yeah

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.249 
switch this over to fluorite the yeah
