00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
thought that was going to happen to a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540 
thought that was going to happen to a
thought<00:00:37.230> mood<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.620> gonna<00:00:37.770> come<00:00:37.980> back<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:38.309> some

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
thought mood was gonna come back at some

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.220 
thought mood was gonna come back at some
form<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.239> manner<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.660> thought<00:00:39.930> he<00:00:40.050> wasn't

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
form or manner I thought he wasn't

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
form or manner I thought he wasn't
permanently<00:00:41.190> done<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.820> he's<00:00:41.940> gonna<00:00:42.030> break

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
permanently done but he's gonna break

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580 
permanently done but he's gonna break
out<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> sander<00:00:43.079> something<00:00:43.350> since<00:00:43.500> he

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
out of the sander something since he

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
out of the sander something since he
never<00:00:43.770> finished<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.100> he<00:00:44.190> said<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.360> yeah<00:00:45.629> we

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
never finished what he said so yeah we

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
never finished what he said so yeah we
found<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.260> he's<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.039> wasn't<00:00:47.340> done

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
found out that he's actually wasn't done

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.630 
found out that he's actually wasn't done
and<00:00:47.700> actually<00:00:47.820> Kabuto<00:00:48.710> I've<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:50.039> him<00:00:50.219> split

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and actually Kabuto I've had him split

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
and actually Kabuto I've had him split
in<00:00:50.789> two<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.449> guess<00:00:51.600> he<00:00:51.780> has<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> clone<00:00:52.199> where

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
in two and I guess he has a clone where

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.500 
in two and I guess he has a clone where
you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> split<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.890> two<00:00:53.399> halves<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.180> guess

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you can split in two halves and I guess

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
you can split in two halves and I guess
there<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> faster<00:00:55.649> juicer<00:00:55.949> than

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
there it's like a faster juicer than

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
there it's like a faster juicer than
just<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.340> regular<00:00:56.489> shadow<00:00:56.940> clone<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:58.109> only<00:00:58.379> has

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just a regular shadow clone but only has

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.380 
just a regular shadow clone but only has
it<00:00:58.770> only<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.160> half<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> power<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.270> he

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it only has half the power but he

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.510 
it only has half the power but he
normally<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.800> nice<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> bad<00:01:02.340> thing

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
normally has so is nice the bad thing

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.130 
normally has so is nice the bad thing
about<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.940> though<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.149> faster<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.690> kind

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
about even though it's faster it's kind

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950 
about even though it's faster it's kind
of<00:01:04.199> weaker<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> sense<00:01:04.920> too<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.479> we

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
of weaker in a sense too but you know we

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.380 
of weaker in a sense too but you know we
know<00:01:07.110> move<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.920> supposed<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.340> summon<00:01:08.760> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
must be heading somewhere he's probably

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.670 
must be heading somewhere he's probably
not<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.720> run<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> sauce<00:04:10.230> curry<00:04:10.440> now

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.810 
killer bees with him and I'm like killer
bee<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.709> probably<00:04:13.980> gonna<00:04:14.160> get<00:04:14.340> knocked<00:04:14.549> off

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.820 
bee is probably gonna get knocked off
first<00:04:15.180> make<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.959> think<00:04:16.169> killer<00:04:16.380> bees<00:04:16.620> really

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
first make I think killer bees really

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.009 
first make I think killer bees really
gonna<00:04:16.950> die<00:04:17.130> probably<00:04:17.489> timid<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:18.000> I'm<00:04:18.720> like

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
gonna die probably timid are I'm like

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.630 
gonna die probably timid are I'm like
which<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.380> makes<00:04:19.560> sense<00:04:19.739> because<00:04:19.950> when<00:04:20.280> naruto

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
which it makes sense because when naruto

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.949 
which it makes sense because when naruto
and<00:04:20.790> sasuke<00:04:20.880> fights<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:21.570> probably<00:04:21.840> just

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
and sasuke fights it's probably just

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.750 
and sasuke fights it's probably just
going<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.169> be<00:04:22.289> them<00:04:22.470> around<00:04:22.770> maybe<00:04:23.490> somebody

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
going to be them around maybe somebody

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.670 
going to be them around maybe somebody
may<00:04:24.030> walk<00:04:24.270> up<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.570> wash<00:04:25.020> your<00:04:25.050> fight<00:04:25.470> but

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
may walk up and wash your fight but

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.900 
may walk up and wash your fight but
killer<00:04:25.890> bee<00:04:26.160> you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
killer bee you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.640 
killer bee you
won't<00:04:27.210> be<00:04:27.360> there<00:04:27.540> to<00:04:27.660> try<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.870> help<00:04:28.050> Naruto<00:04:28.380> or

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
won't be there to try to help Naruto or

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.680 
won't be there to try to help Naruto or
whatnot<00:04:28.920> so<00:04:29.490> you<00:04:29.910> know<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.030> mean<00:04:30.150> are<00:04:30.390> chopped<00:04:30.570> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
whatnot so you know I mean are chopped I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.630 
whatnot so you know I mean are chopped I
wouldn't<00:04:31.050> want<00:04:31.260> killaby<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.980> help<00:04:32.160> him<00:04:32.280> anyway

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
wouldn't want killaby to help him anyway

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.920 
wouldn't want killaby to help him anyway
he<00:04:32.760> probably<00:04:32.940> try<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.300> keep<00:04:33.450> them<00:04:33.540> out<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.720> it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
he probably try to keep them out of it

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.770 
he probably try to keep them out of it
but<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:35.040> just<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.150> feeling<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.480> you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
but I just have the feeling that you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.540 
but I just have the feeling that you
know<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:37.110> makes<00:04:37.290> sense<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.710> badar<00:04:38.160> then<00:04:38.460> the

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
know it makes sense for badar then the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.470 
know it makes sense for badar then the
fight<00:04:38.730> mode<00:04:38.880> are<00:04:39.000> right<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:39.300> they're

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
fight mode are right now they're

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.900 
fight mode are right now they're
probably<00:04:39.600> going<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.050> lose<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:41.130> know<00:04:41.250> or<00:04:41.460> maybe

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
probably going to lose you know or maybe

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.160 
probably going to lose you know or maybe
