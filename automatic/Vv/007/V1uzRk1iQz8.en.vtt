00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.580
 hello good there are people from youtube 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.049
 well I come to bring you a new tutorial 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:14.440
 at the request of a friend that has 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.930
 commented that it has spoiled the 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.410
 lens of the wii and that if there is any other 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.929
 way to play 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:28.669
 backups and good so there is a system 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:33.500
 ok now I'm going to explain is with 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.360
 this program is worth the wd fs manager 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.320
 this what it does is record our 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.199
 games in our memories usb is worth 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.800
 and well let's go to let's start what 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.320
 first thing they have to do is 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 without opening the program insert our 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.850
 usb worth remember to remove the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.570
 information if they have a previous or 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 save it somewhere else because there are all 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.340
 that format all the memories are 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.460
 format so that they can 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.850
 if they do not fight they are not going to be able or not 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 they will be able to use it in good agreement 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.340
 Well, let's start once inserted 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.480
 the usb what we do is that we give to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 format 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.580
 this will erase all the information you 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.850
 we give yes 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.940
 Now what we do now is worth 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.150
 this is important to see where we have 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.760
 put our pendrive and see what is or 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.250
 what unit has our pc assigned to 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.800
 usb that can do it this way 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.010
 they go to team 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.890
 South said that you have and see here what 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.530
 blessed removable because we already know that the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.660
 that you have to format in the unit faith not 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.320
 give it to me and the cee is worth it then 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.320
 we give to load 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.620
 continue and then explore and here we already 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 we go where we have our 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.390
 games 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.650
 previously downloaded is worth me in my 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.250
 case for example is men in black 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.250
 OK 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.780
 I open it and I open it again 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.720
 and now we are going to go to that window there 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.450
 good times this is taboo you see that I've 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.610
 is 4gb but there are times in 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.519
 a king of 4 gigs take us two games 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.489
 It is worth if it is 8, of course 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:29.680
 It's worth according to the weight but then we go 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.489
 so let's go back to explore to see if 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.489
 take the other one 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.700
 what is the transformers and we open it 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.660
 we open again 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.440
 Well, yes, he takes me because not if 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.970
 to put it comes to us here at all 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 it is not convenient that they do it is worth it but 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.239
 if it does not reach the end if it does not arrive 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.950
 So far , it does not happen, it does not happen 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.739
 nothing huh 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.050
 so now what we are going to do 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.420
 is 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.900
 add to the unit 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.840
 and what I'm going to do is use the 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.690
 video because it takes one takes a while 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.690
 ok and then and then we continue 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.530
 Well , it's a bit short 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:32.440
 It's good to leave, they have to know that 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.140
 to be able to play on the web using usb 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.950
 Well, they have to have man a 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.830
 channel is valid and then any 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.980
 program to load usb is like the usb 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.920
 final gx loader 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.550
 there are several of them I'm going anyway 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 leave the link of this program in 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.230
 the description of the video is good 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.260
 we will see that it analyzes added input 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.640
 is to the unit completed accept this 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.030
 tells us what 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.300
 that are well spent is worth and here 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.150
 we already have them in our good usb 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.560
 nothing and what we are going to do is 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:19.239
 close the program is worth extracting the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.239
 pendrive securely 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.010
 and nothing that 's all remember remember 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.010
 what 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:39.480
 they have mostly man or chanel 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:43.470
 louis zabel or allergy x 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.710
 and put the usb on the left side 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.360
 if the u and have it standing is worth in the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.340
 left most side has two slots 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.670
 well on the left side because yes 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.880
 they put it on the right side they are not going to 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:00.350
 to be able to play either through the usb voucher 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.230
 Well, nothing has been everything, I hope 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.560
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:13.610
