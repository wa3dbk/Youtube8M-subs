00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello girls we find ourselves 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 today in a brand new 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.009
 topic heading to the table and I'm going 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 to show you my famous recipe 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.359
 chocolate fondants without oven it's 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.490
 really a practical recipe for 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 students like me what we need 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:29.789
 a bowl opaline lice a spoon 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.949
 fork a knife a measuring cup and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.460
 mugs but before this account about 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.820
 6000 about the ingredients 200 g of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 half- salted butter 200 g sugar one 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.510
 tablespoon of flour 2 100 g of 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.350
 pastry chocolate and 5th first of all I 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 but 200 g pastry chocolate 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 here is my technique in accelerated to 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.910
 not have full back you see that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.980
 it's really a very simple technique 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.770
 once that is done I pour 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.720
 Chocolate mecahers in a salad bowl 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.000
 I enjoy my knife and my butter 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.530
 half salt using the words do the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.690
 g fittings on my tablet 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.910
 I cut 200 g of butter that I 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.740
 add to the salad bowl 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.180
 then I deserved at the microphone for 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160
 about two minutes 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.290
 the goal being that the two ingredients 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.050
 do after it's up to you to see the time 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.550
 while butter and chocolate if 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.830
 the train to melt in the microwave 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.080
 I'm going to cry mugs I take so 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.570
 a knob of butter in a bowl 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.369
 and I really want to turn building 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.259
 so you can see results 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.729
 I then did the same thing for 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.350
 every piece of furniture and of course here it's in 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.850
 accelerated once the ingredients 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.790
 make the game make a seamless mix 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.000
 I take my measuring cup and 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.159
 that my sugar lebel 200 g of sugar that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.960
 I add to the salad bowl and then 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.759
 I mix everything you have to do 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.600
 be careful that this is really a 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.610
 homogeneous mixture 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400
 I go back then a tablespoon 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.229
 of flour as you will have understood it 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.750
 must have a really good time 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.490
 mix he does not want to see any part 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.399
 white I had then broken my 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.140
 good belts the box is a little bit 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.630
 nasty with me for the video 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.900
 finally good once they simple little sound 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 do I mix again you have to 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.350
 really really mix that well 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.319
 this time because have trace of them 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.960
 when we judge cake it's the fear of 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.180
 all 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.170
 once truly homogeneous mixture 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.660
 will fill the mastiffs 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.670
 so yes you see I'm not very 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.130
 gifted to do it in addition there are plenty of 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.750
 sugar on the bridge work finally brief I 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.070
 am really more if not for all the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.410
 world it's really easy and you 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.880
 put pialat after in your mug and 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.410
 we continue like that for them if I 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.990
 then take marine for really 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.700
 to finish the fla you really have to respect 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.110
 one-third chocolate because otherwise 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.030
 pass a car then it will exceed 2 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.070
 everywhere so here is the result 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.200
 my chocolate is made after about a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.520
 minute in the microwave has to be it 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.080
 still less than you will see that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.510
 will go up and then it will fall again 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.220
 quietly and then it's over we did not 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.700
 really do not need oven just 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.350
 Put them 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.360
 is about six minutes in the microwave 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.940
 here are the girls the video is over 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.350

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.480

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.480
