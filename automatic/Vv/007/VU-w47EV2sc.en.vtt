00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
without all the sodium we're going to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.790 
without all the sodium we're going to
cook<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.539> for<00:01:44.750> about<00:01:44.810> five<00:01:45.259> minutes<00:01:45.530> until

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
vegetables start to concentrate so some

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.240 
vegetables start to concentrate so some
of<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.140> liquid<00:01:54.289> has<00:01:54.530> cooked<00:01:54.770> off<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
flavors have started to concentrate so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.719

you want to bring that right back up on
high<00:02:12.310> to<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> boil<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.680> get<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.860> simmering

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
high to a boil and get that simmering

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.660 
high to a boil and get that simmering
really<00:02:16.790> nicely<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.510> cooking<00:02:18.440> for<00:02:18.650> about<00:02:18.829> 12

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
really nicely and cooking for about 12

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.550 
really nicely and cooking for about 12
minutes<00:02:19.820> until<00:02:20.540> most<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.019> liquid<00:02:21.079> has

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
minutes until most of the liquid has

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.470 
minutes until most of the liquid has
been<00:02:21.860> absorbed<00:02:22.040> by<00:02:22.579> the<00:02:22.700> barley<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> most<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
been absorbed by the barley so most of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.050 
been absorbed by the barley so most of
the<00:02:26.540> liquid<00:02:26.720> is<00:02:26.989> absorbed<00:02:27.170> now<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.519> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
the liquid is absorbed now and the the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.060 
the liquid is absorbed now and the the
barley<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.140> starting<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.650> stick<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
barley is starting to stick to the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.470 
barley is starting to stick to the
bottom<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.459> pan<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:31.700> we're<00:02:32.150> going<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.329> add

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
bottom of the pan so we're going to add

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.420 
bottom of the pan so we're going to add
the<00:02:32.780> rest<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> milk<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.680> other<00:02:33.829> two<00:02:34.160> cups

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the rest of the milk the other two cups

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.170 
the rest of the milk the other two cups
of<00:02:34.579> skim<00:02:34.820> milk

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.009 

stir<00:02:41.109> that<00:02:41.349> in<00:02:41.379> get<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.099> simmering<00:02:42.519> again

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
stir that in get it simmering again

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.209 
stir that in get it simmering again
don't<00:02:44.019> worry<00:02:44.260> about<00:02:44.379> it<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:44.980> milk

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.219 
don't worry about it if the milk

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.280 
don't worry about it if the milk
separates<00:02:45.819> while<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.269> cooking<00:02:46.450> as<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
separates while it's cooking as the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.130 
separates while it's cooking as the
barley<00:02:47.969> gives<00:02:48.969> off<00:02:49.180> starch<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:49.959> thicken

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
barley gives off starch it will thicken

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.920 
barley gives off starch it will thicken
it<00:02:50.349> right<00:02:50.560> up<00:02:50.769> and<00:02:51.180> make<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.329> nice<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.510> creamy

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it right up and make it nice and creamy

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.130 
it right up and make it nice and creamy
again<00:02:53.969> okay<00:02:54.969> so<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.269> second<00:02:55.629> batch<00:02:55.719> of<00:02:55.750> liquid

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
again okay so the second batch of liquid

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
again okay so the second batch of liquid
has<00:02:56.290> now<00:02:56.409> been<00:02:56.620> absorbed<00:02:57.159> so<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.180> last<00:02:58.359> thing

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
has now been absorbed so the last thing

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.050 
has now been absorbed so the last thing
we<00:02:58.750> really<00:02:58.959> have<00:02:59.079> to<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.799> just<00:02:59.829> add<00:03:00.519> our

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
we really have to do is just add our

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.520 
we really have to do is just add our
seasonings<00:03:01.629> so<00:03:02.469> the<00:03:03.099> recipe<00:03:03.459> calls<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:04.200> up<00:03:05.200> to

three<00:03:06.280> quarters<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.819> teaspoon<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.750> salt<00:03:08.349> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280
