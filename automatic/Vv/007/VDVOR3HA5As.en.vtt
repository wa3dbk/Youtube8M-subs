 welcome to mega home this time 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.700
 I'm in a new tutorial on how 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.550
 download and install the map to 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.890
 minecraft tiny 2 this created map 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.680
 by fidel Kripper and Playing 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.059
 wikileks ibi stacks first thing 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.670
 we have to do to download these 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.390
 guys is to go to someone who will be in 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.390
 the description 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.220
 that I have it directly copied is 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.120
 a mediafire link that will take us to 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.129
 downloading this map well before 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.020
 start downloading what served 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.150
 tutorial wanted to wish or happy holidays 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.730
 we are almost almost at Christmas 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.830
 done today is poinsettia upload this video 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.080
 today if on Christmas Eve tomorrow would rise and the 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.120
 specialty and I hope that it is 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.610
 all UFOs passing very well and that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.160
 I bring you many many many gifts 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.200
 be in the life or in here in Spain 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.470
 in kings normally now we give 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.410
 here click where you put download we see 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.100
 that weighs 11 with 24 mb / d not much the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.840
 true 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.300
 in fact the download I think lasts three 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.330
 minutes here three minutes 26 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.330
 seconds 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.719
 for mobile 8 minutes and 22 seconds but 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.000
 I do not think I analyze download mobile 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.340
 We wait for the action to install 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.960
 start the download that will take less than 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 what it puts as we see we put a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.369
 minute as much and I 'm going to cancel it 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.310
 because I already have it here homies in 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.520
 the desk 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.649
 this would be the face what has been 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.479
 the winrar file we give right click 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.130
 as we all know we hope to be 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.750
 load us because the oven goes a little 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.650
 slower than usual because I'm 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.010
 recording extract here 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.780
 and start extracting and once we extract 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.820
 the file will leave us this folder that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.830
 It is the map itself and as we all know 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.510
 we go here to the windows 7 button of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.000
 windows 7 and we look in the bar 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.250
 look for the redundancy or in the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.410
 away from here where it puts run if 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.580
 has windows xp in my case has in my 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.190
 case that in windows who has to 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.410
 put the windows + r button and we 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.010
 this will come out of here we put percent 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.600
 app data percent we will accept and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.790
 We wait for the folder to open 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.140
 roaming in case I think if they have 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.820
 windows 7 you have to open the socket 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 normally the red folder men and the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.600
 open and they look for you here in the folder 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.840
 point minecraft in my case this is the 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.600
 first we open it and go to the folder 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.430
 that puts 6 that are maps preside over it as 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.610
 beautiful I already have the tiny you 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.959
 obviously you will not have it and 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.120
 we just take the folder 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.299
 we cut the copy we drag 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.680
 I dragged him and he tells me if here what if 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.690
 I want to replace the living files 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.099
 could I have this is very fast and already 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.080
 I would be all zombie I hope you have them 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.290
 liked life favorites and subscribe if 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.379

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.030
 your site that leaves dislike before 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.560
 doing so I invite you to put in the 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.110
