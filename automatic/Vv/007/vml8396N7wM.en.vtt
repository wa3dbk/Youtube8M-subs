 she rose in big ponds predatory 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.230
 fish almost always shifts from local 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.200
 all parking she adheres 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.340
 cluster of white to a small fish usually 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.650
 bream or white bream 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.180
 but there are places where predatory fish 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.179
 stays until ice up 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.880
 this koryazhnik koryazhnik fish does not leave 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.489
 even if feed fish goes out in the deaf 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.559
 snags we will find a predator to do 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.019
 amendment that snags happen residential and 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.420
 non - living veins in koryazhnik ah fish find 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.100
 all year 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.989
 there are such snags that are very beautiful 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.870
 look at the echo sounder but for some reason 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.670
 never predatory fish such 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.280
 places you need to know and no longer pay on 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.110
 them attention most often predator can 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.770
 detect in the old snags of snags 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.289
 who are 20 or 30 years old is a snare 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.370
 which remained at flooding 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.730
 reservoirs 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.979
 or is located on the beds of some medium 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.990
 or small rivers coastal fallen 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.600
 trees which crowns which lies in 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.850
 water or whose roots are in water 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.670
 very rarely attracts a predator 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.439
 Apparently some matter 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.720
 chemicals that are released 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.150
 water then rotting wood on large 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.250
 reservoirs especially on large 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.079
 marine reservoirs predatory fish not 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.509
 always manages to find quickly 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.509
 most often it turns out to be tied to 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.420
 we put business to lay let is-a or just 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.150
 clusters fry there are places where the predatory 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.360
 fish there is always this old proven 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.820
 Koryazhnike in them fish keeps spring in 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.990
 they have a fish in the summer they hold it 8 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.049
 until freezing 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.960
 most often a working snag in which 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.799
 you can count on jig fish 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.710
 located at depths not exceeding 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.909
 10-12 meters is some kind of flat fee 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.439
 either the fall and 9 eight meter depth 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.840
 have wax reservoir rich 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.539
 my snags there waxes you vault in 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.579
 which snags are worth their weight in gold such places 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.739
 very local if lucky 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.079
 you can find such a point on it successfully 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.850
 fishing for many years 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.130
 find koryazhnik on an unfamiliar pond 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.019
 great luck has to be done here 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.380
 amendment if it's a snag too 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.030
 great luck in this little big to less often 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.730
 the fish is quite smeared 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.490
 try it is necessary to find a compact 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.700
 local koryazhnik on which you can 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.140
 perform two three max 4 sets 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.960
 and boats on the Rybinsk reservoir 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.270
 many people know kilometer york 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.350
 perimeter snags it has a length 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.360
 several kilometers 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.730
 Naturally in such a snags very 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.580
 difficult to find points with predatory fish therefore 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.960
 there is a popular trolling catch 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.510
 spinning jig Viku need to find more 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.370
 compact local koryazhnik for 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.310
 spinning big luck will even 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.990
 find one local log so with 5 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.110
 meter flooded logs can 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 take two or three trophy pikes 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.540
 in spite of all the difficulties frequent losses 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.490
 lures cut and break the cord of fishing in 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.700
 koryazhnike can bring very serious 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.700
 a fish
