00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 there my friends here is worthy of marketing 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.870
 of sewing school and today I go 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.000
 to teach you step by step how to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 an organza skirt with satin ribbon 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 which is a luxury a cuteness and I'm sure 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 What are you going to love learning? 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.970
 to start you will need about 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.350
 of one meter of organza and make strips with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 about 25 26 centimeters and they have a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.349
 and 40 wide so we'll do it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.030
 strips with this length and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.860
 together with one another with a seam 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
 straight as you are seeing 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.649
 we will all need three 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.780
 meters of fabric with compliance in the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.420
 width to form a skirt well 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.250
 transit and to make the hem 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.180
 fold twice in the way that you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.739
 they see and make a very thin sheath 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.190
 neat to not say so 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.770
 this fabric at the end of the piece after 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.710
 in those three meters is ready 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.260
 It's time to put on the satin ribbon are 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.220
 two satin ribbons with 4 mm of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.650
 we'll sew one into the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 another in this way the less they 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 have been sewn but they will stay 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.840
 giving that special charm those 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 curves if they are too much sewn 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 they will not be so so with the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.159
 trim so good then you sew a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.890
 only two of them in this way at the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.740
 of the skirt is joining and passing its 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.409
 Straight stitching is what will leave skirt 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.520
 with all those twists and is a charm 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.189
 different 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 After we finish sewing 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.180
 all this satin ribbon and will pass 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.689
 to the top to where you will put the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.460
 elastic so I double once you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.360
 if you want to overclock this 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.189
 tip 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.460
 otherwise you can do so fold a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.689
 time and leaves enough space for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.969
 put on the elastic 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.909
 that way then you pass a 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.590
 stitching also the three meters wide 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.360
 of the skirt 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.009
 you see that it is a very wide skirt for 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 a bbb belt baby 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.140
 in the case of two years and this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.460
 and then by sewing the elastic 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.310
 elastic I did 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.370
 with exactly 46 centimeters wide 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.080
 by a waist of a two-year-old baby 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.930
 then you will also see the waist that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.170
 You'll wear it even if it's a child. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.450
 smaller or larger and elastic in all 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.950
 the area she will actually stay very 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.600
 reduced because imagine you go by 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.280
 three meters of skirt in 46 centimeters of 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.650
 of elastic and this I have a 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.830
 folding sheet to pass the seam now 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.980
 this way, it has joined elastic and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.010
 A seam passes, it makes backtracking. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.530
 to stay well really fast and 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.380
 finishing sewing the elastic to 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.140
 people are going now together the rest of the skirt 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.060
 last tip that we did not put together for 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.840
 that she gets well stitched day passes 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.580
 a straight stitching and finishing just and 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.620
 If you do not have overlock you can 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.230
 pass but displays zags which is what I 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.330
 I always do to finish it 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.230
 It's too much fun, you do in every 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.690
 stitching that I did not say to 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.030
 that it is well finished and the skirt stays 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.340
 so it's great for rehearsals 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.280
 photographic images of bbb for the 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.740
 birthday is very salable and very 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.260
 I'm sure that if you 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.880
 do you will love everything that you 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.620
 They need to learn how to sew you go. 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.330
 find in sewing school stitch 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.330
 custom made for you
