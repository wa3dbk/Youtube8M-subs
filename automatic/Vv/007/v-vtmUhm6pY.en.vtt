00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.920
 and then youtube people I'm linux brs 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.890
 I'm here for another comparative 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.280
 between tablets already made a comparison of the 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.769
 galaxy tab 3 with 210 pb now the galaxy 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.680
 tab 3 with the galaxy tab 2 staff 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.660
 let's go then the main 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.570
 The main feature is the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.220
 main characteristic is the change that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.640
 had been in the design as I had already said 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.740
 previously, and also the home button that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.289
 have not noticed and 2 and now have here 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.530
 following the trend of the galaxy note of 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:39.249
 line note and the shortcuts here from menu and 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.079
 back that you do not have here and 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.179
 it will probably be different here 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.780
 underneath customization below the 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.149
 android is so let's go tab 3 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.179
 it was announced now 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.579
 April we are on April 29 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.749
 while the other was announced in 2012 and 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.089
 2012 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:02.260
 tab 3 will be available from 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:06.880
 May of this year 2013 and another tab 2 was 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.370
 May 2012 staff or dimensions 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.200
 tab 2 is a bit bigger that had 3 and the 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:17.110
 The weight of the tabi 3 is much smaller which is 41 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.510
 grams almost nothing personal more if you 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.790
 spend some time there with him in his hand and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.500
 maybe I did not make any difference 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.080
 I think I might not do something 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.520
 difference but only because it already has 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.530
 evolved and has been lighter who 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.250
 knows the next come even lighter is 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.980
 folks 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 the technology of the displays one etf has another 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.790
 epls lcd 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.380
 all have both have bitante helmet 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.220
 16 million colors 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.980
 same resolution 640 for by 1024 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.909
 pixels 7 inches 170 pixels per 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.620
 inch is slightly below that of the 200 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.350
 I guess so 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.670
 Ok it could be more than 200 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.290
 pixels to have a little more 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.960
 quality in personal image 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.540
 both are multi touch and both have the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.510
 touchwiz technology the use of interface 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.330
 here is the xis here that is samsung personal 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.159
 they do not have alert type alerts for 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.569
 not receiving a cellphone connection because 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.780
 they are not 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.269
 3g they are will do only if I 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.040
 I forgot to mention that they do not have 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:27.010
 entrance to so and will not do 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:31.810
 network access is 2g while the ac or 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.239
 310 that finishes 2 he has exit for the auto 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.889

 tab 3 it has internal storage of 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.919
 8 and 16 and a gig 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.099

 or bluetooth 3.0 infrared port o 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.430
 pp tab or two here say that has not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.849
 my team one also has no doubt 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.919
 earlier said that there could be 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.409
 European or American eagle model I spoke 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.569
 and what if it has infrared port 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:36.519
 Probably that for Brazil does not see 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.239
 that red door to the resort is not 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.280
 it's personal 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:44.409
 both with usb 2.0 but here the staff it 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.790
 has a proprietary exit and the other 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.220
 usb side for you to connect to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.769
 computer probably will come the same 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.900
 but I hope it comes to micro usb 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.439
 for you because it is a market standard is 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.639
 folks 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:04:00.939

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:04.299
 3.15 megapixels have autofocus and flash 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.799
 while the other does not have self-focus on 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.469
 closing time more personal 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:12.430
 I did not find the photos I saw. 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:16.060
 led flash behind tabi 3 is going 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:21.180

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 Sorry I saw the other galaxy tab 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.690
 82.8 delete what I said personal 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.790
 It is probably good then comes what is 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.750
 written here that autofocus and flash come on 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.240
 check 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.060

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:43.030
 be smile detection both have film 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:46.510
 at 720p at 30 fps time 3d 1.3 megapixels 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.830
 while the other is v already only 10 and 480 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.340
 sorry, it 's personal 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.250
 the operating system the three tab already comes 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.479
 with jelly bean tab 2 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.520
 it comes with the 403 ics and also updates 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.360
 with it ready to be upgraded to 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.950
 4 1 bin the point where it is a tab 2 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.680
 texas instrument 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.770
 the 1ghz core chipset processor 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.500
 art and tab 3 does not specify the chipset 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:19.030
 or apo and only the graphics processor 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.910
 of alcohol and the power br is of tabi two 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:25.560
 personal touch is the gyro accelerometer 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.410
 even messages to the same 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.070
 browser has the difference that html speaks 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.039
 for the 3 and the html5 pro2 here personal more 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.729
 probably supports the html5 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:43.600
 galaxy tab 3 has no radio in the two 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.300
 gps is present in the top 3 and the tab 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.260
 two have the hats branches is a cooler term 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.680
 Java 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:56.530
 the top 3 in white and the white tab 2 is 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.710
 black and red and other functions 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.520
 here the other characteristics of the 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.090
 tablets 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.889
 both have battery of 4 million perez talks 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.660
 which is non-removable but probably 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.460
 also from this other 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.010
 also removable the battery 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.380
 okay so this was a summary around the 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.560
 comparative differences between the galaxy 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.800
 tab three seven inches will speak and 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.500
 samsung galaxy tab 27 inches too 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.050
 will talk and then samsung personal touch 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.090
