00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 [upbeat digital music] 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Music gets louder] DDD-dra-turn it up 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 This song is a number one hit 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
 There is a video for it 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.800
 But it's not ready yet 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 We had delays 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
 The set was damaged by rain 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
 The crew had food poisoning 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 And Micheal Bay was annoying 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
 A few jets fly by 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 And they write YOLO in the air 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.600
 And the cameo of Kevin Hart. (I'm in everything!) 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.500
 You know your eyes will burst 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.600
 When this masterpiece falls 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.200
 It will be a musical by Avatar 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.700
 But this is not the video 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 No no. It is only the text video 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.100
 Prepare when your brain explodes 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.340
 Braingasm. When you see the real video 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.500
 We are in da club 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
 There is a 'shorty' in the distance 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.300
 I wish that she could really see her 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
 But only words appear 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.040
 Hey, editor! (Yes, you!) You spelled that last word wrong 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 I don't like laziness 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 Now you are just mean 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.200
 [music continues] Hey, eh - what? Stop that! 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.800
 I don't even say all of that! That is Spanish! 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.480
 Can we continue with the song? 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.200
 I'm sorry, I'm giving you a bonus. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.700
 Don't confuse this, but there is a fan version of this song 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.080
 And that is illegal, so don't look at it 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.860
 This was made by me or actually by my editor 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.580
 Over there. I said your name. Are you happy now? 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.700
 It is the official video 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.900
 or actually the official text video 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.900
 The real video is really cool 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900
 Bare chicks and "hennesy" in the pool 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 Choreography, cinematography 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.800
 Instead of kinetic typography 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.800
 This is probably not the video you want 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 But we have the privilege of unlimited fonts 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.840
 We have: Cambria, Helvetica, Avenir Next Condensed Medium 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.700
 Papyrus and Lucida Grande; Comic Sans is my beat 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 Uh oh guys, I think my editor has stopped 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.700
 I just said Comic Sans and he quit 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.700
 Never mind dude, I'll do it myself 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 I am also an editor. I don't need your help. 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.600
 Everyone at home, follow me now. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500
 Here is a dance we do on the keyboard 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.700
 Type f, f, f. 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.500
 Type u, u, u. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.500
 Type n, n, n, 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.900
 That was fffuuuunnn. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.340
 Control C, control V, copy and paste. It's that easy 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.200
 Throw your fingers in the air just like you don't care 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 Then take them down, hard on command R. [end of rap] 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.300
 This is not the real video 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.500
 It's not even the song [music stops] 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.600
 The Key of Awesome 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 Hey everyone, it's Mark. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.100
 Thank you for watching the Key of Awesome 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.700
 I want to thank Freddie Cosmo for singing. 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.820
 Click the link in the description to look at the other Key of Awesomes, 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.520
 and see you later 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 I think I'll just have lunch 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.300
 You don't have to write that down, 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.200
 I just talk, I ... 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.520
 Stop typing, stop .... uh ... it's not fun. Can you stop that? 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.960
 HABALOOSHADADAJAYO 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.180
 HRRRSHWEHDEDAGAHYAYA 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.180
 (frrrt) lol
