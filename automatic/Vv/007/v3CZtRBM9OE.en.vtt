00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
ripple on the surface that just emanated

ripple on the surface that just emanated
seemingly<00:00:19.890> from<00:00:20.100> nowhere<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.820> came<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.300> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
seemingly from nowhere it came in like a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.240 
seemingly from nowhere it came in like a
soft<00:00:21.720> v-shape<00:00:22.880> and<00:00:24.230> i<00:00:25.230> missed<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.890> start<00:00:25.920> of

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
soft v-shape and i missed the start of

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.920 
soft v-shape and i missed the start of
it<00:00:26.310> because<00:00:26.580> i<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.789> filming<00:00:27.359> something<00:00:27.689> else

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
it because i was filming something else

zoom in accounts i'll see anything in
the<00:00:33.239> surface<00:00:33.690> there<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.170> can't<00:00:34.440> tell<00:00:34.590> whether

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the surface there I can't tell whether

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.069 
the surface there I can't tell whether
as<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> duck<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:36.420> could<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.840> large

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
as a duck and it could be some large

as a duck and it could be some large
fish<00:00:37.410> underneath<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> surface<00:00:38.629> it's<00:00:39.629> it's

really asked me to tell from this
distance<00:00:41.700> might<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.570> something<00:00:42.989> right<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
distance might be something right in a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.819 
distance might be something right in a
second<00:00:43.770> center<00:00:44.100> there<00:00:44.219> actually<00:00:45.710> yeah<00:00:46.710> I'm

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
second center there actually yeah I'm

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.639 
second center there actually yeah I'm
not<00:00:47.010> sure<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.530> did

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
not sure what that is at all and it did

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.760 
not sure what that is at all and it did
look<00:00:49.770> quite<00:00:49.950> impressive<00:00:50.430> first<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> all<00:00:51.770> but

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
look quite impressive first of all but

far left and what you can see here a
sort<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.690> subsurface<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:05.000> don't<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.060> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
sort of subsurface I don't how you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.990 
sort of subsurface I don't how you
describe<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.960> looks<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.260> generations

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
describe that it looks like generations

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
describe that it looks like generations
and<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.720> left<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.020> friend<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.439> break<00:01:10.680> in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and the left of friend just break in

and the left of friend just break in
here<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.750> similar<00:01:13.110> thing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
here there you can see the similar thing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.770 
here there you can see the similar thing
happening<00:01:13.770> um<00:01:16.070> it's<00:01:17.070> it's<00:01:18.110> quite<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> large<00:01:20.780> sub

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
happening um it's it's quite a large sub

you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.439> see<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.770> two<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.340> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you can see there's two kind of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.560 
you can see there's two kind of
striations<00:01:36.030> two<00:01:36.270> lines<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:37.040> subsurface

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
striations two lines of subsurface

ear something does break the surface
possibly<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> cormorant<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.630> fish<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.290> it

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
possibly a cormorant of fish but it

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.580 
possibly a cormorant of fish but it
seems<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> continuing<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.329> does<00:01:48.659> leave<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.560> a

seems to continuing it does leave like a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.660 
seems to continuing it does leave like a
large<00:01:49.920> wake<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.670> also<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.930> large<00:01:52.740> sub<00:01:53.130> surface

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

disturbance and judging by the size the
trees<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:58.189> in<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.430> could<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.759> about<00:01:59.969> 20

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270

trees there in that could be about 20
feet<00:02:00.420> long<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.829> even<00:02:02.130> longer<00:02:02.340> this

section<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.450> see<00:02:06.719> there<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.399> on

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
section you can see there but this on

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.029 
section you can see there but this on
the<00:02:09.479> left<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> most<00:02:10.500> interesting

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the left here is the most interesting

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.500 
the left here is the most interesting
part<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.300> can<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.660> something<00:02:12.959> leave

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
part because you can see something leave

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.660 
part because you can see something leave
surface<00:02:13.930> seemingly<00:02:14.860> something<00:02:15.189> small<00:02:15.489> but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
surface seemingly something small but

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.390 
surface seemingly something small but
then<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.480> leaves<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:17.170> large<00:02:17.590> sub<00:02:17.980> surface

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
then it leaves a large sub surface

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.660 
then it leaves a large sub surface
disturbance<00:02:18.879> saw<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:20.049> don't<00:02:21.040> know<00:02:21.129> if<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.310> isn't

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
disturbance saw I don't know if it isn't

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.049 
disturbance saw I don't know if it isn't
