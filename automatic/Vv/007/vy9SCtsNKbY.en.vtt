around kill enemies I don't know but I

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.189 
around kill enemies I don't know but I
think<00:05:16.129> that<00:05:16.159> we<00:05:16.310> really<00:05:16.339> call<00:05:16.669> idea<00:05:16.969> if<00:05:17.199> Zelda

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
think that we really call idea if Zelda

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.089 
think that we really call idea if Zelda
you<00:05:18.379> was<00:05:19.009> a<00:05:19.039> lot<00:05:19.219> like<00:05:19.310> Skyrim<00:05:20.889> from<00:05:21.889> what<00:05:22.009> we

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
you was a lot like Skyrim from what we

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.219 
you was a lot like Skyrim from what we
saw<00:05:22.310> at<00:05:22.580> e3<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:23.089> I'm<00:05:23.449> guessing<00:05:23.839> this<00:05:23.930> trailer

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
saw at e3 and I'm guessing this trailer

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.100 
saw at e3 and I'm guessing this trailer
that<00:05:24.409> we<00:05:24.469> just<00:05:24.589> saw<00:05:24.800> now<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:26.300> sort<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.870> looks

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
that we just saw now it sort of looks

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.749 
that we just saw now it sort of looks
like<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.529> art<00:05:27.680> style<00:05:28.009> is<00:05:28.310> a<00:05:28.370> cross<00:05:28.610> between

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
like the art style is a cross between

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.240 
like the art style is a cross between
Skyward<00:05:29.719> Sword<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:30.199> winwaker<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:31.069> you've<00:05:31.219> got

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
Skyward Sword in winwaker so you've got

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.269

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
really really nice from what we saw III

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.689 
really really nice from what we saw III
was<00:06:09.110> just<00:06:09.289> like<00:06:09.529> the<00:06:09.800> field<00:06:10.180> nice<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.599> light

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
was just like the field nice and light

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.279 
was just like the field nice and light
you<00:06:13.699> know<00:06:13.819> we<00:06:13.939> knew<00:06:14.089> that<00:06:14.120> it<00:06:14.629> was<00:06:14.719> a<00:06:14.750> massive

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
you know we knew that it was a massive

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.050 
you know we knew that it was a massive
world<00:06:15.529> and<00:06:15.889> then<00:06:16.159> we<00:06:16.250> just<00:06:16.279> like<00:06:16.550> an<00:06:16.699> enemy

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
world and then we just like an enemy

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.179 
world and then we just like an enemy
chasing<00:06:17.389> opponent<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:17.960> then<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.979> showing

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:19.189 
chasing opponent and then the showing

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:20.660 
chasing opponent and then the showing
off<00:06:19.339> like<00:06:19.399> a<00:06:19.520> little

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
off like a little

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.430 
off like a little
I<00:06:20.730> think<00:06:21.090> it<00:06:21.150> was<00:06:21.180> like<00:06:21.360> a<00:06:21.420> cutscene<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.170> wasn't

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
I think it was like a cutscene it wasn't

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.960 
I think it was like a cutscene it wasn't
a<00:06:22.470> pre-rendered<00:06:22.830> cutscenes<00:06:23.010> it<00:06:23.460> was<00:06:23.580> it<00:06:23.820> was

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
a pre-rendered cutscenes it was it was

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.730 
a pre-rendered cutscenes it was it was
running<00:06:24.300> on<00:06:24.390> the<00:06:24.510> wii<00:06:24.630> u<00:06:24.870> she<00:06:25.410> just<00:06:25.530> that<00:06:25.650> it

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
running on the wii u she just that it

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.990 
running on the wii u she just that it
was<00:06:25.800> sort<00:06:25.980> of<00:06:26.010> like<00:06:26.070> a<00:06:26.160> cutscene<00:06:26.610> where<00:06:26.790> link

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
was sort of like a cutscene where link

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.510 
was sort of like a cutscene where link
jumped<00:06:27.420> off<00:06:27.540> his<00:06:27.570> horse<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.290> then<00:06:28.530> shot<00:06:29.370> like

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
jumped off his horse and then shot like

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.370 
jumped off his horse and then shot like
a<00:06:29.610> futuristic<00:06:30.090> arrow<00:06:30.630> with<00:06:30.960> the<00:06:31.020> enemy<00:06:31.140> that

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
a futuristic arrow with the enemy that

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.060 
a futuristic arrow with the enemy that
was<00:06:31.560> awesome<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.280> really<00:06:32.940> liked<00:06:33.120> that<00:06:33.300> and

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.970 
mechanic now you can leap off the horse
and<00:06:38.640> then<00:06:38.760> like<00:06:38.910> float<00:06:39.270> in<00:06:39.450> slow-mo<00:06:39.900> so<00:06:40.740> that's

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:40.980 
and then like float in slow-mo so that's

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.570 
and then like float in slow-mo so that's
a<00:06:41.070> really<00:06:41.100> cool<00:06:41.430> idea<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:43.340> think<00:06:44.340> that's<00:06:44.430> it

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
a really cool idea I think that's it

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.040 
a really cool idea I think that's it
really<00:06:44.850> that's<00:06:45.210> that's<00:06:45.660> all<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:45.810> can<00:06:45.990> really

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
really that's that's all I can really

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.350
