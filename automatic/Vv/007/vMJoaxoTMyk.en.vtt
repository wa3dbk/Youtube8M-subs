that<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.199> has<00:00:28.380> something

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that I think and it's it has something

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
that I think and it's it has something
to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> lack<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.670> something<00:00:29.970> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
to do with the lack of something that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350 
then obviously whenever you go from
competitive<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:57.000> playing

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360

and<00:00:59.489> then<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.000> try<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.329> convert<00:01:01.050> yourself

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and then you try and convert yourself

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
and then you try and convert yourself
back<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> public<00:01:02.370> match<00:01:02.520> player<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.969> gets

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
back into a public match player it gets

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520 
back into a public match player it gets
really<00:01:03.270> difficult<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really difficult and because of that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.770 
really difficult and because of that
I've<00:01:05.129> been<00:01:05.430> playing<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.000> haven't<00:01:06.420> been<00:01:06.540> playing
