motherboard we had to go of course with

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
motherboard we had to go of course with
a<00:00:41.760> Haswell<00:00:42.270> motherboard<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
a Haswell motherboard but this is a

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.930 
a Haswell motherboard but this is a
great<00:00:43.530> board<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.250> affordable<00:00:44.550> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
this is a value build so we're starting

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
this is a value build so we're starting
off<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.009> something<00:01:29.310> very<00:01:29.610> simple<00:01:30.000> down<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
off with something very simple down the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
off with something very simple down the
road<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.170> add<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> more<00:01:31.439> hard<00:01:31.770> drives<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
road you can add in more hard drives and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
road you can add in more hard drives and
SSD<00:01:32.700> potentially<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.960> a

SSD potentially but for now you have a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590 
SSD potentially but for now you have a
relatively<00:01:34.470> fast<00:01:34.770> hard<00:01:35.159> drive<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:36.540> the

relatively fast hard drive and for the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
relatively fast hard drive and for the
psu<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.140> decided<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.740> psu<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
psu we decided to go with a psu that is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.420 
psu we decided to go with a psu that is
from<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> reliable<00:01:39.090> brand<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.930> 850<00:01:40.829> watts<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
from a reliable brand is 850 watts so it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
from a reliable brand is 850 watts so it
can<00:01:41.549> handle<00:01:41.729> sli<00:01:42.479> down<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> road<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.259> future

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
can handle sli down the road in future

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
can handle sli down the road in future
hard<00:01:43.860> drive<00:01:44.070> upgrades<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:45.450> bang

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hard drive upgrades it is a good bang

for<00:01:45.720> your<00:01:46.020> buck<00:01:46.079> psu<00:01:46.860> coming<00:01:47.250> 120<00:01:47.820> dollars<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
for your buck psu coming 120 dollars and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.730 
for your buck psu coming 120 dollars and

I think it is the right choice for the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.100 
I think it is the right choice for the
system<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.479> case<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.840> went<00:01:51.990> with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
system and for the case we went with

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.719 
system and for the case we went with
something<00:01:52.380> simple<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.280> simple

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
something simple this is just a simple

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
something simple this is just a simple
