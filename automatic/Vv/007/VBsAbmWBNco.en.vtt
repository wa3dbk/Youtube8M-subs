00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 welcome to the next tutorial i will 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.379
 name it as the second part of how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.389
 convert ps1 games to apk format and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 this time I will say some details for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.109
 make the game fast or make it work 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 those who do not start said that we started 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 first we turn the game like in the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 previous video and we had it as it says in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.350
 the video we installed the game and we passed 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.600
 data and we will do the following steps 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.400
 what we will do is apply a render 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.800
 for games that do not look good in the 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.230
 phone in this case I will work with 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 silent and observe how it looks 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.970
 success the game without making any of 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 this steps 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.010
 wow wow wow wow what are those stripes 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.200
 red and that white box that surrounds 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.480
 harry damn goku him and his disgusting 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.700
 tuto did not help at all the game looks 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 awful better I'll look for another video of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.330
 how to do this after another video 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 youtube pp tutorial but what mothers 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.670
 happens this looks the same rays better me 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.910
 I'll buy a ps x or a ps3 and I'll play it 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.950
 since no tutorial serves to hold 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.170
 my partner do not get upset here you're going 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 tip for this to work and do not look 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.700
 for other videos remember that this 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 method works with every game that 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.740
 see well more the twisted metal 4 or some 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.510
 of the twist in metal do not contain audio 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.940
 and with the render you can still see some 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.610
 yellow highlighters in some 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.550
 levels so I suggest playing that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.920
 with the emulator fps emulator good with 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.350
 some games but it's better to play it with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 that emulator the metal or less glass 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.450
 that you do not have an xperia and you have to 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.890
 play with your touch hahahahahaha 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.900
 continue with the video and follow the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.570
 steps so that it does not happen as in the 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.570
 last video 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.580
 number 1 we open for the first time the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.640
 game so that you create a folder in the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.680
 sd card remember just open it and try 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.229
 the game even if it looks bad and if it looks and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.970
 run perfect do not do these steps to 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.130
 unless you have a detail that 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.930
 want to fix after having 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.700
 open the game you close number 2 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.039
 we enter our archives archives of 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.160
 the memory card and we go to the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.260
 next route android data and 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.800
 we select the game folder that 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.050
 emulate mos in this case is silent in 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.690
 files content or forgiveness was not that 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.840
 we go back and select the folder of 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.820
 name uc &amp; c we open the following folder 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.040
 if there is one and we will get two 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.920
 text type files of which 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.870
 we will open the name preferences as well 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 that we open and show the values ​​of the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.000
 game of which we will modify the one 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.519
 has the name s &amp; w render so 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.220
 general is in false value we what 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.780
 we will modify the true value but 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.120
 written in English as well as I put it 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.610
 you write it and you save the document and 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.740
 you close your archivist and now as a child 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.220
 wanting to open his gift opens again 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.350
 your game and see how it will be or but what 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 hosts step now the game looks 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.550
 the disgusting ones do not come out anymore 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.590
 red stripes or white box 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.020
