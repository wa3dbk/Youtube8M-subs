that was released I think this past year
I<00:02:03.500> think<00:02:04.500> there's<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.830> more<00:02:05.040> content<00:02:05.610> with

I think there's just more content with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.770 
I think there's just more content with
it<00:02:05.970> but<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> don't<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> all<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> differences

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
it but I don't know all the differences

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.440 
it but I don't know all the differences
trying<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> focus<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.320> there<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.280> go<00:02:11.460> so

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
trying to focus here there we go so

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:30.800 
trying to focus here there we go so
finally<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.430> it's<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.850> an<00:02:30.000> empty<00:02:30.120> box<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
