00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.980 

when<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.790> were<00:01:32.880> talking<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.270> Huk<00:01:33.570> bolting

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
when we were talking about Huk bolting

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.230 
when we were talking about Huk bolting
as<00:01:34.140> opposed<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> tack<00:01:34.829> welds<00:01:35.280> Huk<00:01:35.790> bolts<00:01:36.150> are

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
as opposed to tack welds Huk bolts are

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.630 
as opposed to tack welds Huk bolts are
about<00:01:36.390> six<00:01:36.689> times<00:01:36.930> stronger<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.400> thing's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
about six times stronger so this thing's

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.800 
about six times stronger so this thing's
virtually<00:01:39.320> indestructible<00:01:40.400> to<00:01:41.400> move<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.390> panel

on this cab you'd have to drill out the
Huq<00:01:44.549> bolts<00:01:44.939> it'd<00:01:45.509> take<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> hours<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:47.040> thing

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Huq bolts it'd take you hours this thing

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
in a standard t8 so that's pretty

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.110 
in a standard t8 so that's pretty
impressive

mirrors this really helps with
visibility<00:04:31.720> if<00:04:31.990> you're<00:04:32.139> in<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.289> tight<00:04:32.500> spot

these daylight door mirrors increase
your<00:04:36.250> visibility<00:04:36.479> tremendously<00:04:37.479> so<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.139> can

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
your visibility tremendously so you can

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.100 
your visibility tremendously so you can
literally<00:04:38.590> see<00:04:39.000> six<00:04:40.000> or<00:04:40.120> eight<00:04:40.300> feet<00:04:40.330> off<00:04:40.810> to

the left here if you need it to so

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.950 
the left here if you need it to so
you're<00:04:42.760> not<00:04:42.849> knocking<00:04:43.060> into<00:04:43.479> things<00:04:43.659> breaking

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
you're not knocking into things breaking

hood it has a 20% slope here so your

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.820
