 Hello dear viewers dear 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.069
 subscribers especially dear subscribers 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.560
 youtube canal countryside 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.420
 who don't know about new videos 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.019
 signed soon subscribe 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.020
 Today I am showing the second video there too 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.420
 he has yes but heating only in 3 no 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
 it is very convenient that is possible 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.210
 adjust the temperature water have water 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.039
 it warms up and warms the greenhouse too 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.480
 the second greenhouse was going later than in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.939
 first, respectively, everything gradually 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 did many mistakes were taken into account such 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.010
 how did a very narrow passage was 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 inconvenient to go to the second type of person is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 Well done once if convenient for a nice 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.870
 can we pass the banality than yes 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.760
 rum with a box we look further that is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.430
 here here the flow was looking at the return 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.219
 one loop is made at the end of this loop 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.960
 an hour we will see you standing crane for crane 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 air release further use 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 I 'll show you right now 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.079
 while the system is empty and there 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.640
 I see nothing 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.370
 further look here is this 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.220
 air vent for exhaust 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.750
 water faucet for air release cap 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.570
 for the release of water from the greenhouse and flooding 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.130
 need for what is cold in winter we stay 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.799
 know when water freezes 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.470
 it expands and at the same time the pipes 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.450
 bursting that would not want of course 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 so in the winter as the greenhouse should we 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.409
 let the water out but trouble has trouble 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.409
 happened we saw a crack in the pipe 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.229
 although there was a system without water but turbo 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 a third cracked as the welder told us 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 which we have agreed that he will do 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.560
 we are not very good quality pipes 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.240
 how we acquired everything in one place in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.579
 one time respectively decided 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.259
 check all the other pipes because 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.930
 I did not want to be lied to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.479
 then when will there be a cucumber when here 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.040
 Suar to be worn for a while 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.160
 if the night stays in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.710
 a greenhouse without heating is too bad to be 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.110
 now we look only turned on 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.150
 pump that is like water in the system still 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.810
 not enough and so here is lazy slowly 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.910
 on typed when fully typed 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.100
 you can already close the tap and 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.260
 gradually and to be typed already higher 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.230
 top tube into the feed to completely 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.510
 the system is typed accordingly now 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.000
 we'll see it here passed 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.140
 some time about 15 minutes from the water already 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.290
 follows actively 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 air we do not see from the boldly close 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.690
 this crane and go next parent 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.940
 see here we see ourselves 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.100
 the process when the air goes this one 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.620
 nasty air that we don't need but we 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.920
 interferes with if the air in the greenhouse is in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.920
 heating will 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.940
 then the system will not work absolutely 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.720
 It will not work and will pipe cold 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.959
 we need a hot pipe to plant 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.790
 thank you for watching before 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.310
 new meetings subscribe to the channel 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.700
 thanks for putting your finger up all 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.700
 until
