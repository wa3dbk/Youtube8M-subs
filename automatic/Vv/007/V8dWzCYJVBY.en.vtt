through<00:05:28.270> every<00:05:28.600> time<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.290> use<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:29.950> tripod<00:05:30.460> in

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
through every time I use this tripod in

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.790 
through every time I use this tripod in
a<00:05:31.000> nasty<00:05:31.270> environment<00:05:31.900> now<00:05:32.440> I'm<00:05:32.530> working

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
a nasty environment now I'm working

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.160 
a nasty environment now I'm working
something<00:05:33.220> like<00:05:33.430> snow<00:05:33.730> or<00:05:33.940> fresh<00:05:34.180> water<00:05:34.210> not

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
something like snow or fresh water not

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.500 
something like snow or fresh water not
so<00:05:35.350> worried<00:05:35.560> about<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:36.070> salt<00:05:36.370> but<00:05:37.150> I'm<00:05:37.270> secure

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
so worried about the salt but I'm secure

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.210 
so worried about the salt but I'm secure
to<00:05:37.630> take<00:05:37.780> time<00:05:37.990> still<00:05:38.290> to<00:05:38.380> go<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.650> clean<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.100> up

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
to take time still to go and clean it up

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.390 
to take time still to go and clean it up
it's<00:05:39.910> still<00:05:40.150> very<00:05:40.390> important<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.810> clean<00:05:41.080> up

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
it's still very important to clean up

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.190 
it's still very important to clean up
last<00:05:42.400> thing<00:05:42.580> to<00:05:42.730> do<00:05:42.820> is<00:05:42.970> the<00:05:43.360> leg<00:05:43.600> extensions

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
last thing to do is the leg extensions

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.020 
last thing to do is the leg extensions
I'm<00:05:44.620> going<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.950> put<00:05:45.040> this<00:05:45.130> tripod<00:05:45.550> all<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.940> way

day<00:06:11.470> one<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:11.980> that's<00:06:12.550> why<00:06:12.700> I'm<00:06:12.790> still<00:06:13.030> working

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360

function<00:06:15.550> for<00:06:15.910> me<00:06:16.000> so<00:06:16.570> hopefully<00:06:16.660> helps<00:06:17.080> with

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
function for me so hopefully helps with

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.100 
function for me so hopefully helps with
your<00:06:17.470> basic<00:06:17.740> tripod<00:06:18.130> maintenance<00:06:19.110> simple
