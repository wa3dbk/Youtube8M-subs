00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello tankers broadcast feyglin kamik 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.200
 modeling is not easy 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.080
 like long hours digging into smaller ones 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.730
 Details but detailed 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.220
 modelka put on the table and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 I want to enjoy her appearance 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.820
 many and here we have waited 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.680
 in the summer of 2014, guys from heavy metal 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.470
 toyz released their first models 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.990
 armored vehicles by the way translated from 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.149
 English heavy metal means heavy 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.210
 metal and this is great for 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.000
 descriptions of their products really 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.820
 created by casting from tin models 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 get detailed brutal and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.110
 powerful and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.460
 exactly one of these models got to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.270
 I am in the hands of the crown of German tank building 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.879
 tiger-1 scale to 72 cool 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 metal cools the hand when touched 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.100
 600 grams of alua with a small size 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 give us the opportunity to feel 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 good quality stuff on the manufacturer's website 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.340
 presented a range of models 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.770
 there is not only the technique of different 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.229
 nations but also of different scale on 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.280
 today the choice is not great but already 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:22.200
 there are very worthy Soviet models 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.909
 t-34 85 kv-1s is-7 to also German 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 tiger 1 and lion 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 my choice fell on tiger-1 yet 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 This car was considered one of the most 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.079
 beautiful times of the second world war and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.780
 it was really interesting as far as 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.520
 guys with heavy metal toyz managed it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 pass in the model 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.310
 at first glance the packaging becomes 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.259
 it is clear that the tank itself is done for glory 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 located in a transparent blister on 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.899
 the background of the battle opens 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.310
 the manufacturer claims it works by 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.590
 wargaming licenses 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 what is the inscription on the box 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.319
 quickly release tigers from the packaging and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.869
 Now we can enjoy its external 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.360
 I got the most complete view 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.190
 equipment in which there is itself 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.140
 tank and stand for him 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.890
 also made of metal 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.299
 the tank is already fully assembled and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.940
 the only rotating element in 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.010
 tank is a tower summing up 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.470
 I want to say that the world of tanks 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.280
 exists for more than 4 years 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.590
 the game is overgrown with many fans and very 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.230
 nice that thanks to these guys from 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.269
 heavy metal. these fans now have 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.480
 opportunity to get a decent 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.950
 products and with you there was a fake lincoln and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 see you on the battlefield
