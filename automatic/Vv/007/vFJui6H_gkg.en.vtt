knife and you kind of tease them out
like<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:02.240> in<00:02:03.240> fact<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.869> spoon

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
like so in fact actually that spoon

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.390 
like so in fact actually that spoon
would<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.470> good<00:02:04.619> too<00:02:04.740> or<00:02:04.950> sometimes<00:02:05.250> I'll<00:02:05.369> just

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
would be good too or sometimes I'll just

little<00:02:06.780> bit<00:02:06.900> gross<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:08.070> pretty<00:02:08.250> quick

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
little bit gross but it's pretty quick

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.850

there just to release it and then you

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.490 
there just to release it and then you
just<00:03:36.610> go<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.880> with<00:03:37.000> your<00:03:37.120> fingers<00:03:37.510> you're

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
just go in with your fingers you're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.940 
just go in with your fingers you're
going<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.709> find<00:03:39.010> where<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.700> spine<00:03:40.030> is<00:03:40.950> just

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
going to find where the spine is just

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.309 
going to find where the spine is just
right<00:03:42.130> in<00:03:42.340> there<00:03:43.060> you're<00:03:43.930> going<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.079> use<00:03:44.200> the

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
right in there you're going to use the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.470 
right in there you're going to use the
head<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.709> kind<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.069> handle<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.910> hold<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.209> to

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
head as kind of a handle to hold on to

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.660 
head as kind of a handle to hold on to
basically<00:03:47.470> you're<00:03:47.650> just<00:03:47.799> kind<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:47.950> pulling

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
basically you're just kind of pulling

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.180 
basically you're just kind of pulling
the<00:03:48.910> bones<00:03:49.120> out<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.209> way<00:03:52.299> down<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.980> whole

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
the bones out all the way down the whole

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.809 
the bones out all the way down the whole
fish<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:55.329> wiggling<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.900> out<00:03:56.760> sometimes<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
fish just wiggling it out sometimes I

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:07.250 
fish just wiggling it out sometimes I
use<00:03:57.940> another<00:03:58.120> finger<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.630> get<00:03:58.720> in<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.019> but

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.520 

so<00:04:07.830> then<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> head<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:08.940> spine

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
so then you have the head and the spine

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.670 
so then you have the head and the spine
and<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:10.590> have<00:04:10.910> filleted<00:04:11.910> sardine<00:04:12.750> some

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
and you have filleted sardine some

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.319 
and you have filleted sardine some
people<00:04:13.950> will<00:04:16.100> cut<00:04:17.100> off<00:04:17.250> these<00:04:17.459> rib<00:04:17.700> bones<00:04:17.940> here

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
people will cut off these rib bones here

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.640 
people will cut off these rib bones here
