00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.230 

one<00:05:14.199> of<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.440> best<00:05:14.710> things<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.550> could<00:05:15.729> ever<00:05:15.910> say

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
one of the best things I could ever say

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.960 
one of the best things I could ever say
that<00:05:17.050> we<00:05:17.199> need<00:05:17.440> as<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.800> downhill<00:05:18.190> skater<00:05:18.639> is<00:05:18.820> our

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
that we need as a downhill skater is our

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.999 
that we need as a downhill skater is our
gloves<00:05:19.240> because<00:05:20.050> without<00:05:20.229> that<00:05:20.440> we<00:05:20.650> wouldn't

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
gloves because without that we wouldn't

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.100 
gloves because without that we wouldn't
be<00:05:21.190> able<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.430> do<00:05:21.550> half<00:05:22.180> of<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.419> stuff<00:05:22.720> we<00:05:22.930> do

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
be able to do half of the stuff we do

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.870 
be able to do half of the stuff we do
unless<00:05:23.440> we're<00:05:23.680> like<00:05:23.800> standing<00:05:24.220> stand<00:05:24.759> up

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
unless we're like standing stand up

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.400 
unless we're like standing stand up
sliding<00:05:25.240> my<00:05:25.330> thumb<00:05:25.570> put<00:05:25.720> there<00:05:25.870> oh<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.139> stuff

but<00:05:27.370> without<00:05:27.699> those<00:05:27.880> gloves<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.449> would<00:05:29.139> be

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
but without those gloves it would be

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.040 
but without those gloves it would be
really<00:05:29.500> hard<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:30.669> cutting<00:05:31.030> word<00:05:31.210> on<00:05:31.630> the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
really hard the cutting word on the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.230 
really hard the cutting word on the
palms<00:05:32.320> it<00:05:32.770> basically<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.669> allows<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.120> to

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
palms it basically just allows you to

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.779 
palms it basically just allows you to
put<00:05:34.509> your<00:05:34.630> hands<00:05:34.960> down<00:05:35.020> and<00:05:35.740> basically<00:05:36.550> like

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
put your hands down and basically like

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.240 
put your hands down and basically like
if<00:05:37.509> you're<00:05:37.720> about<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.110> fall<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:38.860> couldn't

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
if you're about to fall and you couldn't

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.100 
if you're about to fall and you couldn't
put<00:05:39.699> your<00:05:39.820> hands<00:05:40.090> on<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.360> know<00:05:40.479> you'd<00:05:40.660> get

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
put your hands on you know you'd get

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.920 
put your hands on you know you'd get
really<00:05:41.410> hurt<00:05:41.560> but<00:05:42.310> if<00:05:42.430> you<00:05:42.550> can<00:05:42.729> be<00:05:43.210> agile<00:05:43.660> and

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
really hurt but if you can be agile and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.710 
really hurt but if you can be agile and
put<00:05:44.050> your<00:05:44.139> hand<00:05:44.350> down<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.889> can<00:05:45.580> save<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:46.000> and

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
put your hand down it can save you and

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.060 
put your hand down it can save you and
that's<00:05:46.900> definitely<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.440> good<00:05:47.500> thing<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:47.949> know

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
that's definitely a good thing you know

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.719 
that's definitely a good thing you know
less<00:05:48.430> blood

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
less blood

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.730 
less blood
I<00:05:48.970> think<00:05:49.690> if<00:05:49.750> you<00:05:49.870> keep<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.169> in<00:05:50.289> within<00:05:50.500> your

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
I think if you keep it in within your

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.680 
I think if you keep it in within your
limits<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.130> within<00:05:51.340> your<00:05:51.520> boundaries<00:05:51.880> then

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
limits and within your boundaries then

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.420 
limits and within your boundaries then
it<00:05:52.870> can<00:05:53.020> be<00:05:53.139> pretty<00:05:53.350> safe<00:05:53.530> if<00:05:54.100> you're<00:05:54.280> riding

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
it can be pretty safe if you're riding

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.770 
it can be pretty safe if you're riding
outside<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:54.970> your<00:05:55.030> boundaries<00:05:55.449> that's<00:05:55.600> when

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
outside of your boundaries that's when

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:18.749 
outside of your boundaries that's when
you<00:05:55.840> start<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.229> hit<00:05:56.320> cars<00:05:56.560> and<00:05:56.770> fly<00:05:56.889> off<00:05:56.949> roads

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:45.290 

we<00:06:19.749> are

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.340
