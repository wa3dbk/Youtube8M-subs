00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.330
 hi friends of pÃ©rez marc today 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.640
 we will talk about the umÃ­a 1320 the factory 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.469
 economical from nokia now microsoft for 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.940
 understand a little we'll talk about the term 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.419
 fable that is the combination between a 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.360
 tablet and smart here at 1,320 does honor 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:23.350
 to the name with 6 inches you're at a 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.000
 resolution of 1280 x 720 hd not full hd 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.040
 that although it is not the latest trend in 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.410
 screens gets along very well with the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.870
 hardware and software that it brings but yes 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.360
 under the sun there are times that we go to 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.880
 renege with what is the lcd screen 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.040
 that handles with pixels are going to 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.860
 notice in the heart of the team is a 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.920
 snapdragon processor dual core to 1.7 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.649
 gigahertz next to a gb of ram 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 this combination has it not that there 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.710
 enough time apparently the system does not 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 demands so much and gets along very well with this 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.380
 hardware that we do not need anymore in this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.700
 case then future generations I know 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.759
 that will come with better ones 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.650
 processors since the lumia 1320 already 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.470
 has good time in the market 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.480
 of system arrives with windows 8 with the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.430
 lighting update that is the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.140
 last in this case depending on the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.080
 operator will arrive at this update 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.760
 Not all of them are arriving, but 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.100
 It's very good because it improves what it is 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.380
 performance and clean errors that before 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.570
 ends of previous versions 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.880
 windows 8 has improved windows phone more 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.530
 well it has improved over time and has 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.650
 added many things that users 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.080
 they are already getting used to the change 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.710
 as well as all the tablets to love 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 tablet and a 3400 megamedia battery 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.800
 that on paper tells us the brand that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.800
 It's two days long but like me 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.350
 I am a good heavy user is using 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.560
 and he has given me a day and a half or a day 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.630
 and some hours but really if you have 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.180
 that duration so one like me that 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.090
 tends to be on facebook page manager 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.890
 twitter telegram or some occasional game 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.950
 how is spiderman ultimen I'm 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.200
 playing and has rendered me very well in this 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.620
 look I think buyers will 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030
 take advantage very well when you have them 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.860
 people who use it will love it 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.350
 that lasts so much in my opinion has 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.180
 liked minecraft enough did not want 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.260
 forget about the camera and this time we 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.060
 put a sensor equal to lumia 625 of 5 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.880
 megapixels in which the camera 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.010
 main and de gea the frontal that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.840
 It seems they could be a little more but 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.260
 I think this is the point that is not 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.900
 attractive of 1,320 is not a supplement 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.090
 rather the camera is not something strong 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 however as far as the photos are 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.489
 clear in good light and applications like 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.650
 nokia camera or lumia self and columbia 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.799
 panorama and more than the one that has taken 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.450
 Nokia brand and good now Microsoft 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.870
 they enhance the photos but that yes still 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.780
 we have that in low light is where we are going to 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.049
 lose a little bit the eye sharpness that you 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.780
 clarified that it is not its strong point and it is not a 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.450
 camera signed by carl zeiss or is pure 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.849
 view so how did it repeat its moment 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.460
 this comes to be a complement to 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.130
 affable 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.950
 and if we get to his strong point of this 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.610
 equipment that is consumption with content 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 multimedia 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.210
 if that is with your multimedia the most 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.040
 strong that the lumia 1320 can have is 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.850
 consume multimedia we can see 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.550
 films 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.410
 we can play surf listen music 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:38.170
 games and play content explore and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.710
 the battery life allows us to do 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.930
 all that with a tablet size 6 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.150
 inches and that's the strongest point 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.000
 so that we can acquire it and that we 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.340
 like it and in conditions I can say that 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.440
 your best points are the battery and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.010
 size on the screen clarifying that the 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.130
 resolution not because as I told you is hd and 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.890
 no full hd and cons points are 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.260
 its size given that for community to 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.180
 portability or manage it sometimes is a 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.060
 little complicated I will tell you my 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.700
 experience take you on a micro 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 blue runner with so many people gives me 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.890
 very afraid that he falls out of my pants 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.930
 so I can venture to tell you 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.580
 which is an excellent option for 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.560
 those who want to enjoy a lot 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.980
 content that has good autonomy 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.110
 so it's already in your choice and I want 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.940
 tell them not to forget to give you the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.960
 of our video and subscribe to our 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.960
