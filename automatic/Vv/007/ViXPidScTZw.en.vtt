really the sky's the limit

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.910 
really the sky's the limit
do<00:02:06.689> they<00:02:06.840> make<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.290> many<00:02:07.469> different<00:02:07.770> pieces

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
do they make so many different pieces

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
well what does this have to do with

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.210 
well what does this have to do with
technology<00:02:48.140> Shannon<00:02:48.710> well<00:02:48.830> then<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> next

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
technology Shannon well then the next

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.640 
technology Shannon well then the next
step<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.790> once<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> child<00:02:51.200> starting

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
step up once you have a child starting

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.690 
step up once you have a child starting
to<00:02:51.740> build<00:02:51.890> things<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.370> they<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.580> little

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
to build things when they get a little

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.340 
to build things when they get a little
bit<00:02:52.940> older<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:54.410> are<00:02:55.420> different<00:02:56.420> apps<00:02:56.660> that

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
bit older there are different apps that

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.560 
bit older there are different apps that
you<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.530> build<00:02:58.100> things<00:02:58.400> with<00:02:58.580> Legos<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
you can build things with Legos and

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.930 
you can build things with Legos and
there<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.230> even<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.950> program<00:03:01.490> that<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.910> can

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
there is even a program that you can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.510 
there is even a program that you can
download<00:03:02.270> for<00:03:02.570> free<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.350> computer<00:03:03.830> where
