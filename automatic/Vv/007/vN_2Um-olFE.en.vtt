00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 I greet my friends here is what they are 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.070
 since today we have a combat-with 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:13.889
 the panther once again on the map 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 prokhorov there we have an open card 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.910
 Back on stage eight and that's it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.039
 problem of all mediums of the 17 level think 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.230
 So I come emotionally 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.660
 above average more often than 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 other tanks in higher history that 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.640
 problem had the 40 and kv 310 and and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.420
 and so all stages seven mediums 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.539
 I have the problem of one like me 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.879
 I can judge my feelings here 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:54.149
 still half stock sees dr 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.570
 no problem the cannon is whether the l 100th 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.570
 and thus very well armed for animals 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.479
 Eight absolutely no problem very good 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.570
 penetrate properties of this cannon 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:17.270
 is the highest penetration on level 7 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.270
 under the middle armor of the panda 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 and as a meaner than typical 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.759
 middle I drive to the sky that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 is the position of the output of 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.110
 Take the bucket under fire or the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 village or rent 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.409
 important is that there support 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.740
 will have support there and here 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.140
 support has that is important me 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.299
 already see the first opponent 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.040
 so cash in on the first hit of 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.470
 of course he shoots me too 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.509
 people will not stop if you 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.040
 you will be shot at in 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.590
 to bring safety that was now one 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.210
 my mistake 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 but he should not do it that way 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.909
 but he tries you he fell in 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.360
 to bring security 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.910
 So I try again 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 education can do the tiger 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.330
 again sees cotton or ally 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.730
 actually and I'll try 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.460
 shoot down but go too late 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.920
 we see our ally drives 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.910
 alone before with a tank the none 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 armor has also makes it useful for 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:35.790
 750 and therefore interfere as well them 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.670
 alone slowly I'm not trying 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.120
 closer to that and we are a hair care 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.000
 she does not try to run away 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.840
 that must be right in the middle of me 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.250
 you see a t 43 so from the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.080
 Chambers in pretty safe under 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.080
 take a shot and I do too 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.450
 I see his tail is still stocker 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.760
 But that does not matter at all 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.080
 actually revolves around a bit 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.670
 prances at the stone 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.410
 maybe he does his business 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.930
 does his business on stone 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.260
 that does not matter to me 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:23.000
 panther cannon does after him 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.000
 pain made pain 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.220
 he does not see me mocking 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.350
 or else and not just need 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.730
 still reduce 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.760
 that's the best course, the best 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.860
 case for the band because also stays out of the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.530
 Staying away is easy 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.049
 banter advantage should be beneficial 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.920
 but not so far away from happening 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:56.940
 because it is not a tower after all 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.570
 loose mountain railways but they are medium 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.769
 a medium tank of more or 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.600
 We have less agility 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.690
 See the allies are over the mountain 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.340
 about under the avenue they need 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.450
 still support there yet 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.220
 somehow defense is left of 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.400
 our side are only two serious 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.889
 panzer dar 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.479
 and of course you have to do that as well 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.840
 point where you intervene and support 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:32.949
 he says 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:35.020
 There are three of four and there are 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.720
 him only in pairs so I try there too 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.259
 They are still supporting stage eight 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.229
 opponents left a prototype the 28 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:47.380
 prototype shows only a tip of 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.970
 I meet his chain 450 meters 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.169
 of course no problem 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:59.530
 and he is super bashing over 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.539
 brings with our heavy have the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.539
 apparently to generate problems in 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.120
 and one will have it from the back 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.370
 had made 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:18.449
 I help them cope with this 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:22.389
 c ap sees me shoot and hit 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:27.430
 the same critical damage does not hurt 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:30.970
 is broken because right is yes who is 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:35.199
 left one such artillery and one 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.449
 Rhino and here in the south now 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.510
 the book is booked with a heap 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.099
 Of course I have to do that too 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.090
 you start right away 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:48.310
 to do so aggressively before eight and 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.710
 do not wait until somebody misses me 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.330
 stay behind here but the 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.840
 The food then dies very much 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.310
 fast 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:59.909
 therefore you should go to several tanks 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.669
 ancestors just to do the damage 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:05.169
 to record distributed 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.090
 two shot totally two shows for me 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.280
 everyone has two more kp but we all 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.470
 both are still alive that is in the 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.740
 things do not feel like that anymore 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:22.090
 but for that has lodged in the enemy 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:28.990
 and the friendly ally shoots 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:32.470
 in the side and thus destroyed 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.360
 no chance yes and therefore that is 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.500
 endangered we'll take a look 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.449
 result of 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:44.289
 aha stage one I have for this 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:48.310
 compliant gets struggled from level 8 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:52.060
 Stage seven tanks first place 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:57.400
 experience second place damage 3 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:58.650
 graduation at least 1517 assistant 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.330
 damage 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.509
 who says that turned a bad one 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.979
 Panzer is yes people I hope this 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.349
 you liked the video 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:11.490
 He will check in again soon 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:11.490
 Goodbye
