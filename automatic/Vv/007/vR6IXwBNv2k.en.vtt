00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 salute to all with you the horseman in one of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 of my past issues I told them 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 the story of the birth of the comic now I 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.389
 I want to tell you about the next 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 the development of comics I will try 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.469
 tell you about the era in the comics so 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.139
 called gold silver bronze 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.390
 and as I think everyone knows that the comics 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.000
 originally from the United States and their subjects were originally 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.630
 very closely related to the present history 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.519
 by position 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
 This country should say that in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.160
 America comics are not immediately acquired 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.900
 look familiar to us 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 started as i told in the past 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 video comics printed in newspapers 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.050
 therefore the most significant impetus for development 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.620
 was their transfer to separate magazines this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 and got busy 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.469
 publishing house of affairs 1929 they released 16 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 page four-color periodically 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.379
 published magazines printed on 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.329
 newsprint 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.430
 performed on the same principle as 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.100
 printed in advance in newspapers with strepes and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.370
 were called just fanis then eastern 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.160
 color printing in 1933 began to produce 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.710
 fanis he leeks they became 8 page but 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.899
 already sold in color they became worse 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.579
 and in order to somehow shove the product 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.439
 on packages of various household and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.330
 household products began to print 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.409
 coupons you could get 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.150
 comics for free 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.799
 then in the same thirty third year 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 sales agents 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.509
 Maxwell Games and Harry Building EU and 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.509
 color countries merged with the publisher 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.299
 Affairs and released 36 page book 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.280
 spanish frames and konovalov comics yota 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.939
 historians and called the first real 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.500
 american comic book and then in 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:30.360
 1938 probably happened the most 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.150
 significant event in the world of comics 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
 a series of action comics Odessa appears 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.130
 superman is an event and is the beginning 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 the so-called golden age of comics 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.450
 Superman waited a huge success and on the wave 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 his popularity was invented by others 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 colorful characters are worth 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.640
 batman and robin flash wonder woman 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.380
 Green light 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.659
 aquaman is just the tip of the iceberg 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 consisting of characters of all stripes 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.640
 for the whole golden age that lasted 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.890
 about 18 years old was invented about 400 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600
 characters and many did not live to see our 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.790
 of time 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.009
 you say the first issue of action comics 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.049
 superman has a large collectible 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.860
 significance is now completely preserved 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.930
 few copies of 50100 so in 2008 one of 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.050
 copies were sold at auction comic con 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.209
 from for 1 million dollars 2010 other 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.250
 a copy was sold at the same auction for 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.930
 one and a half million dollars by the owner 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.480
 one of the copies was Nicolas Cage himself 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.400
 by the way ketch is an ardent fan and 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.010
 owners of a vast collection 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.470
 comics he even called his son to a 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.850
 l n is the krypton superman name so 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 back to the copy of the first comic 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.430
 superman is not 2000, the cage stole her 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.050
 found only in 11 years some 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.950
 way confirmed that it was exactly 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.019
 his copy 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
 and then this comic was sold on the same 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.370
 auction for 2 million 160 thousand 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.769
 dollars as far as I know it 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.110
 the largest amount in history given 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.400
 for a copy of the comic book so back to 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.560
 golden age to the word 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.690
 history of superman and other cult for 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.370
 us now characters in thirties 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.049
 were not the most popular 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.450
 the sales leader was so magical 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.370
 the character as captain marvel by force he 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.019
 very much like superman but at the same 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.090
 time is completely different 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.730
 characters in terms of the nature of the source 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.290
 strength and indeed his own age 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
 20 years has also gained popularity 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.030
 plastic man well or plastikman 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.280
 as you like, I think you are familiar with him 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.290
 abilities but all these superhero 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 the stories were no match for and 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.430
 to popular at that time stories about 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.769
 rabbit buck bath duckling Donald 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.510
 Mickey Mouse and Tarzan other children 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.760
 thirties reluctantly but still 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 started taking new unaccustomed 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.420
 superhero product story 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.670
 superheroes at the time were sent 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.920
 on some educational and agitating 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.019
 goals fought superhero mostly with 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.269
 gangsters unclean thugs on 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.980
 hands businessmen and so on 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.470
 say they fought pretty hard 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.329
 for example the aforementioned superman was not 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.220
 so keepers of morality as it is now 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.410
 then he could easily mess his hands and 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 absolutely not worried about causing them 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.640
 the fortieth world covered the second 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.530
 world war and at this time comics 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.810
 got a good rise in popularity 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.030
 sales jumped up and caused 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.859
 served as the pages of the comic super 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.290
 heroes began to fight with the axis countries 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.400
 aggressive alliance of 3 powerful powers 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.829
 Germany and 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.930
 Ali and Japan, people wanted to see light 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.799
 victory of good over evil and saw her on 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.449
 these pages 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.160
 This was especially clearly shown in 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.810
 comics about captain and america and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.970
 wonder women who should have been 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.860
 cause waves of patriotism with asterisks 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.259
 on their costumes after a while 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.600
 after the end of the second world began 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.110
 nuclear race between usa and ussr 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.460
 The first were the United States on July 16, 45 they successfully 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.979
 conducted a test of nuclear weapons 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.990
 sweat pants and then were notorious and 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.479
 bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.180
 United States realizing that with such a weapon becomes 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.310
 the master state of affairs had some 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.500
 pressure on the ussr and thought that we 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.250
 atomic bombs will be no earlier than 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.010
 mid 50 but already 1 January 52 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.470
 in the USSR there were 35 atomic bombs that 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.449
 constituted a threat to the us war theme 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.760
 atoms was incredibly popular and 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.680
 of course found in comics 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.930
 for example thunder atomic 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.760
 I am a given person historians of the time 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.199
 believe that children's characters helped 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.759
 loosen the fuck of young readers 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.560
 regarding prospects 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.539
 atomic war and of course u 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.210
 American comic book heroes have appeared 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.039
 new villains krasin communist and 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.900
 the onset of peacetime begins 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.060
 sunset of the golden age after the war 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.280
 the popularity of the comics has subsided somewhat and 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.090
 saw this authors have introduced more genre 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.490
 fiction 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.690
 particular horror and crime it in 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.849
 some sort of cause 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.830
 start a moral campaign against 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:35.300
 comic books they were accused of being 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.340
 are the perpetrators of the nursery 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.680
 crime but the biggest cause 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.870
 served as a psychologist Fredrik tops which 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.210
 was the main opponent of the comics he was 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.800
 wildly against the horror genre and comics 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.960
 believed that they bring up in children 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.909
 cruelty crime desire 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.130
 try drugs and and so on 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.260
 by the way it was he who saw in on guys 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.860
 the honor of batman and robin homosexual 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.570
 subtext 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.389
 he even wrote a book on this topic 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.610
 seduction of kin dreams seduction is not visible 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.169
 which had a good commercial 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.000
 success and was considered a kind 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.770
 the best seller of that time is all this 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.599
 the movement has led to the publishing house 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.460
 the comics were supposed to take some 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.199
 code that severely limited 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.570
 action superheroes no cruelty 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:17.030
 no killings for a 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.430
 no blood no bared no 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.260
 drug and so on in general comics 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.270
 totally sterilized history 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.400
 superheroes criticized not only time 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.680
 we have an ardent opponent of comics was 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.370
 Chukovsky need he persuaded a lot of things 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.710
 not bad 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.480
 For example, here are some quotes in these 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.910
 magazines just do what they cut 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.980
 shred shoot strangle poison 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.200
 cripple it as people dump them on 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.790
 all the way from the train of planes or drags 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.830
 imprisoned on an electric chair 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.450
 well, or here it is advanced teachers with 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.550
 melancholy indicate that the American 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.130
 schoolchildren are reading now is not mark tvena not 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.120

 stealing diamonds with the help and 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.500
 sleeping pills and penguin's adventures 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.120
 famous thief committing their 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.430
 raids and theft exclusively by 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.530
 birds own on the same facts and 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.620
 relied frederick tops such pressure 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.180
 on the comic was not the best way 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.250
 sterile monophonic plots seemed 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.990
 just ridiculous in comparison with color 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.030
 thirties forties proper therefore 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.340
 the decline and the end of the golden age has come 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.710
