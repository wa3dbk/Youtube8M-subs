00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
front by just put that behind for a now
this<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> would<00:01:05.640> look<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this is what it would look like but it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.490 
this is what it would look like but it
doesn't<00:01:06.780> always<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> club<00:01:07.350> nintendo

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
doesn't always have the club nintendo

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.590 
doesn't always have the club nintendo
thing<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.640> just<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.450> look

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
thing right there it just was just look

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.020 
thing right there it just was just look
for<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> code<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.250> bother<00:01:11.490> using<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
for the code don't bother using this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
for the code don't bother using this
i've<00:01:12.270> already<00:01:12.659> used<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> while

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
i've already used it so this is a while

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.499 
i've already used it so this is a while
left<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.780> i<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:18.119> knives<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
left back i use this so this knives are

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.200 
left back i use this so this knives are
inside<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.439> that's<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.970> calm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
inside of it but that's very not calm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
inside of it but that's very not calm
and<00:01:21.420> usually<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.100> always<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.430> us

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
and usually so it doesn't always have us

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
and usually so it doesn't always have us
remember<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.720> look<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.049> code<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
remember that so this look for code just

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.730 
remember that so this look for code just
looks<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:27.150> looks<00:01:27.299> like<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:28.560> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
looks like this looks like that this is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.560 
looks like this looks like that this is
pin<00:01:28.979> number<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.520> those<00:01:29.909> really<00:01:30.150> care<00:01:30.329> so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
pin number on it those really care so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.030 
pin number on it those really care so
