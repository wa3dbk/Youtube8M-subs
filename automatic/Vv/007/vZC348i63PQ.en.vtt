00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 so hello and welcome back 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.560
 to 1 9 dna and I should start here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.570
 to kill on amrum if caught and 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 get directly to special blog 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.070
 yes and I want to talk in this video it 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 clearly my current situation with 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 face cam and audio editing not there 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 only time but also a normal one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.590
 videos for many of you have 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.340
 I want the round face 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.510
 also in the pvp videos and make 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 so that's be practical here 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.880
 Survey video and song at the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.460
 vote in the crytek will not be here 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.020
 as shit here now a link in the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.149
 description give to a straw poll 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.770
 or 2 strobls my god 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.500
 and these two straw poll are once 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.410
 for the audio editing if my 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.079
 should sound like this or so that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.219
 now been two examples 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.180
 I always think I have a bit 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.489
 understands longer than that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 Maybe it's not quite what it is 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:11.659
 blog there and the other one is just that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 fans should be as basic as now or 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.320
 square where about find better and 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.820
 the third is whether the finding so 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 It should be from the position I am 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.580
 better damn or or again 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.340
 as before 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.590
 again speed age what action blogs 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.750
 really great many but I'm through 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.160
 the bad round normal round where 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.010
 I'm not just much better 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.690
 why yes and that's why I wanted 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.980
 just fast dna and then claps 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 namely that wins in kickboxing 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:53.020
 It was already worth it though 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.020
 really shit 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.110
 So only a very short round I have 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.020
 that can do and that was it 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.300
 actually already I was the only halt 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.590
 say votes on is 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.270
 decision it is mine 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.120
 youtube-channel but of course I want 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.010
 also know what you like the most 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.650
 so think about it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.850
 and on saturday he will be with one 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.410
 wanted to wait for vote yet another video 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.060
 where i skype ex-players where the 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.980
 fans know so where is the fans no 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.180
 Reason is and where I have the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.350
 audio editing used 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.730
 that is, if you are not sure 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.080
 what you should do then look 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.490
 first follow the skytrax and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.380
 After that, for example, from Friday to 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.880
 compare and soul back into the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.590
 whole video is and then you can here 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.690
 vote in the link below 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.310
 i will do that one day or maybe 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.060
 Run the whole weekend and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.459
 then I'll know that then 1 so 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.459
 the results judge me as 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.660
 that's over and I think that was it 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.230
 actually with the video with the short one 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.760
 video already watching the other videos 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.380

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.330
