why a second look fusion works has come
out<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.430> new<00:00:20.580> add-on<00:00:21.000> component<00:00:21.930> for

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
out with a new add-on component for

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
out with a new add-on component for
their<00:00:22.350> raw<00:00:22.619> case<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:24.029> worth

protection<00:01:08.640> well<00:01:09.510> fusion<00:01:10.380> works<00:01:10.650> as

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
protection well fusion works as

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
protection well fusion works as
obviously<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.330> know<00:01:12.450> listen<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> the

that<00:01:16.380> are<00:01:16.409> meant<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.939> Don<00:01:18.390> components<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that are meant to be a Don components to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.590 
that are meant to be a Don components to
the<00:01:19.380> raw<00:01:19.530> case<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.369> turn<00:01:20.640> protect<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the raw case and in turn protect the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
the raw case and in turn protect the
sides<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.400> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
sides so you can see they have kind of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.130 
sides so you can see they have kind of
adhesive<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.299> i<00:01:24.330> haven't<00:01:24.750> remove<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
adhesive back i haven't remove the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
adhesive back i haven't remove the
adhesive<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:26.189> when<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> they'll

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
adhesive but when i do that they'll

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
adhesive but when i do that they'll
stick<00:01:28.020> right<00:01:28.290> into<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.920> sides<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> case

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
stick right into the sides of the case

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.100 
stick right into the sides of the case
like<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.650> one<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.130> side<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.110> then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
like so one on one side like that then

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.920 
like so one on one side like that then
the<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> other<00:01:34.979> side<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.210> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the other on the other side like so so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.600 
the other on the other side like so so
obviously<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.470> still<00:01:37.680> leaves<00:01:37.860> room<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
obviously it's still leaves room for the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.300 
obviously it's still leaves room for the
volume<00:01:39.509> buttons<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.079> vibrate<00:01:40.470> switch<00:01:40.650> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
volume buttons and vibrate switch so

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.620 
volume buttons and vibrate switch so
we'll<00:01:41.460> get<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> all<00:01:41.820> installed<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.509> i'll<00:01:42.570> show

sophisticated sleek looking but one of
the<00:02:12.760> big<00:02:12.910> complaints<00:02:13.330> about<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.720> was<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.170> open

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
the big complaints about it was the open

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.070 
the big complaints about it was the open
sides<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.190> that's<00:02:15.610> where<00:02:15.820> these<00:02:16.080> polymer

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
sides and that's where these polymer

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200 
sides and that's where these polymer
side<00:02:17.350> pieces<00:02:17.680> come<00:02:18.070> into<00:02:18.340> play<00:02:18.580> they're<00:02:19.090> not

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
know reception issues nothing like that

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.550 
know reception issues nothing like that
so<00:02:27.670> when<00:02:27.790> you<00:02:27.880> want<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.090> install<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.600> we'll

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
so when you want to install it we'll

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.390 
so when you want to install it we'll
just<00:02:29.740> peel<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:30.070> plastic<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:32.130> stick<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.160> on

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
just peel is plastic off and stick it on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.450 
just peel is plastic off and stick it on
like<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.480> fits<00:02:35.350> right<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:35.800> groove<00:02:36.040> quite

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
like so fits right in the groove quite

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.240 
like so fits right in the groove quite
nicely<00:02:36.720> sticks<00:02:37.720> right<00:02:37.960> in<00:02:38.170> place<00:02:38.500> let's<00:02:39.160> do

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
nicely sticks right in place let's do

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.530 
nicely sticks right in place let's do
the<00:02:39.370> same<00:02:39.580> thing<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.940> other<00:02:40.000> side<00:02:40.150> with

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
the same thing on the other side with

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.410 
the same thing on the other side with
the<00:02:40.660> bigger<00:02:40.990> one<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.790> want<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.850> make<00:02:42.970> sure<00:02:43.000> we

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
the bigger one I want to make sure we

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the bigger one I want to make sure we
get<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.600> kind<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.870> all<00:02:44.020> going<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.350> same

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
get it kind of all going in the same

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.040 
get it kind of all going in the same
direction<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:45.160> guess<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:46.240> raw<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.630> facing

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
direction I guess so the raw is facing

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.750 
direction I guess so the raw is facing
that<00:02:47.170> way<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.410> we'll<00:02:47.710> do<00:02:47.830> fusion<00:02:48.100> works<00:02:48.340> facing

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
that way so we'll do fusion works facing

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.940 
that way so we'll do fusion works facing
the<00:02:48.850> same<00:02:49.060> way<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.540> then<00:02:50.140> just<00:02:50.290> lay<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.590> in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
the same way and then just lay that in

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.140 
the same way and then just lay that in
like<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.140> voila<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:53.860> we<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.250> a<00:02:54.610> fully

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
like so and voila now we have a fully

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.450 
like so and voila now we have a fully
encapsulated<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:56.500> know<00:02:56.650> case<00:02:56.890> except<00:02:57.340> of
