 Before doing so, you must believe it 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.530
 even knowing that you will not be able to continue fighting, if you have an opportunity 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 This can mean the difference between losing and winning.

 to make something real. 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.800
