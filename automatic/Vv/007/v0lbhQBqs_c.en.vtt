the zbox model you get there will be

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
the zbox model you get there will be
different<00:00:40.260> set<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.800> requirements<00:00:41.150> for<00:00:42.150> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
different set of requirements for the

two I have the zboost Z personal and Z

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.010 
two I have the zboost Z personal and Z
pocket<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.950> setup<00:00:47.220> was<00:00:47.340> quite<00:00:47.820> minimal<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
pocket the setup was quite minimal so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
pocket the setup was quite minimal so
let's<00:00:49.230> start<00:00:49.470> with<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> easy<00:00:50.070> personal

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
let's start with the easy personal

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
let's start with the easy personal
you're<00:00:51.330> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.540> simply<00:00:51.930> place<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.559> Z<00:00:52.830> boost

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you're going to simply place the Z boost

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
you're going to simply place the Z boost
in<00:00:53.400> a<00:00:53.580> window<00:00:53.970> using<00:00:54.570> these<00:00:54.900> suction<00:00:55.290> cups

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
in a window using these suction cups

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.160 
in a window using these suction cups
where<00:00:56.580> you<00:00:56.670> receive<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.239> least<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.870> bar<00:00:58.140> of

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
service now the reason for this is that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.619 
service now the reason for this is that
these<00:01:01.020> ebooks<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.800> not<00:01:01.980> create<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.550> signal<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
these ebooks does not create a signal so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
these ebooks does not create a signal so
you<00:01:03.690> must<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.170> some<00:01:04.500> service<00:01:04.980> where<00:01:05.250> you

you must have some service where you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000 
you must have some service where you
