00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.890
 hello everyone I know I learned everything 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.650
 new video sets a video tutorial 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.610
 to teach you how to share games 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.650
 lcs movies music finally content in 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.820
 playstation 4 because the truth is a 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.440
 little different than what it was in 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.870
 playstation 3 and many you have given 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.720
 account since they have changed the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.390
 terms of use conditions in order already I 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.520
 you understand not that now it 's different 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.050
 and well now they are a couple of steps more 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.820
 what needs to be done takes a little more 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.460
 of time but it's still pretty 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.829
 easy so good here I come to you 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.100
 explain how to do it step by step 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.110
 we started first of all you must have a 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.850
 very clear thing is that in playstation3 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.610
 each game is associated 2 playstation 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.259
 different to what I mean with this that 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.940
 imagine that I have a call of duty 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.040
 on but of the film we understand with that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.509
 pretty well known you since I was 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.490
 I can share it for example to Juan 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.800
 but the battlefield I do not have why 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.110
 necessarily share with juan no 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.820
 what I can share with another person 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.950
 bat the end would not have juan but if the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590
 call of duty this in playstation 4 no 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.570
 it happens here every account itself for example 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.970
 by mine of predictor or killer 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 go is associated with 2 playstation is a 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.690
 principal or a secondary in which 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.420
 they differ in the privileges that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.220
 you have in each one that is my account 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.039
 credit if I want to share the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.750
 games with juan I have imagines good 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.850
 in this case should have the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.730
 main playstation 4 should have 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.250
 Juan and the secondary I already 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.700
 I will explain this and I will explain to you 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.320
 what consequences does this have that 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.470
 We can only share games with 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.540
 a person and it is the truth a bitch the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.080
 Truth is a bitch but what 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.000
 there is 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.030
 so if you are going to share the games 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.350
 have it quite clear and what was going 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.060
 before what differences are there between 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.210
 main playstation and playstation 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.310
 secondary the main difference is 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.920
 that accuracy in precision 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.360
 main we can play the game that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.830
 We want to share for example in call 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.110
 of duty on all accounts that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.080
 let's have in that play station however 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.050
 in high school because not if the game 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.430
 has my credit account can only 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.560
 play that game in the account of 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.080
 predictor in the rest of accounts 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.760
 it's going to be blocked so that's in 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.820
 reality the most important privilege the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.950
 rest is that the main precision 4 does not 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.510
 you can play with life I think to me 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.130
 I do not think it's a big restriction and the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.680
 true a couple of other chops but 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.360
 come on, it does not matter 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.610
 so good uy sorry 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.790
 and well after clarifying this 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.020
 let's start with the tutorial itself 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.790
 Well, now we start with the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.530
 tutorial proper the first 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 step just as with application 3 is 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.940
 that if our friend wants to give us his 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.590
 games because he has to give us his 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.080
 email and password to enter 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.760
 your account if we want to give you 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.440
 we give you our email and 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.170
 password this is like in the previous 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970
 generation in the event that he wants 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.860
 give him in his games then the second step 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.800
 is that he in this case has to be him 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.310
 is going into your account go to the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.990
 Settings tab psn activate as you 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.350
 playstation 4 main and in the 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.380
 deactivates and we activate it in 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.959
 this case in your account this in what 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.480
 Well, as I said before, it's in 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.370
 this case can only Luis Miguel play 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.070
 your games in your account in the account 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.989
 Luis Miguel and we, in all of them 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.870
 the case that we want to give 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.130
 our games we deactivate in 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.100
 our playstation 4 account 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.690
 main and he activates it easier the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.070
 account that buys the games always 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.540
 you have to have the playstation 4 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.969
 main disabled 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.909
 and the one that receives the games activated like this 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:04:01.640
 it's even easier and then we download 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.040
 games and in theory is already follows 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.010
 being quite easy is just that couple of 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.519
 steps more in settings and ready a problem 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.200
 that people usually have is that this is 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.329
 a game for example bought by Luis 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.250
 Miguel, I, in my account, sometimes 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.199
 comes out next to start a padlock that 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.209
 it puts me I do not know what roll licenses and 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.470
 come on, he will not let me in as he 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.440
 fix the truth is that it is very easy 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.750
 we go to your account we initiate session 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.310
 I always start well in friends and 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.380
 after having the account started 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.090
 five or ten seconds then it's taken away 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970
 the padlock we go back to our account and 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.400
 ready it's already to me it always comes out 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.139
 I turn on the play to the best eight of each 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.509
 ten times I do not know why it comes out but the 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.060
 true the solution is quite easy as well 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.710
 that you should not have any problems and 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.500
 nothing this is all this is how it is 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.990
 share the games and subscribe 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.990
 to not miss any video and goodbye
