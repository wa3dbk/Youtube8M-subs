00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.070
 Today we will look for an answer to fresh 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:11.110
 the question is what is more interesting andare the gate or a 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.410
 miss ontario 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.680
 ancient good interesting to all 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.960
 famous knife obispo svezhak on the market 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.450
 global manufacturers of knives 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.100
 this is a fresh knife made specifically for 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.670
 order to topple 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.070
 Antalya just consider everything 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.880
 black coated knives 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 what's the first that 2 for it to be 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.700
 and you know better and I have a little heat 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.460
 specially took black blades for another 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.090
 to show everyone 1 more 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.540
 I gave 3 breaking at this knife 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.170
 now the logo is a letter about rectangles 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.600
 and the old new triangle went to 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.309
 past life now on the rim looks 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.350
 so packing as knives goes standard 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.930
 cardboard box 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.220
 here is the new antari logo 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 black white and red design now these 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 boxes there is a texture of honeycombs pictured 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.740
 alone asana as a vespa's 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.409
 standard logo there are these skulls and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.650
 our two crossed but they weigh 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.930
 about the same shipping cost 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.610
 equally so 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 knives it seems even consider this 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 key differences 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.890
 hangar two dies him planned 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.940
 good comfortable perfectly operated 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.450
 obispo has a lining with one hand 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.869
 bared on one side only 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:56.090
 lock frames this is a thick plate 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:59.369
 is and the lock in this our 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:04.369
 concrete this knife has imagined 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.930
 face 4 positions here and here 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.950
 absolutely clearly can be hung on the left 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.489
 right side 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.400
 screw down screw up as you like 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:18.720
 left-handed get out no matter knives comfortable 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.410
 This and on blade this this knife has 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.220
 groove about houses is very correct 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.430
 blade build 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.910
 fine knife cuts good thin carts 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.410
 both have absolutely razor sharpness 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.320
 with able to have boxes and shapes 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.640
 blades theoretically the same weight at 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.010
 they are about 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 the only thing you want to mention 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.980
 worth a little more I like to talk 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 fool steady tip here 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.810
 climbing much more than 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.570
 Ontario 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.930
 This can be seen when picking other loads 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.090
 Aliska will behave better 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.970
 out of the box for these knives 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.700
 have a great wood here this knife only 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.739
 that he will not bring anything and I took 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.739
 lessons usual a4 sheet folded 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.400
 how shall we take a diamond 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.920
 and miss will cut no worse 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.800
 feeling like something through them 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.560
 with the same good hands in 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.910
 Russian winters I would probably 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.160
 preferred andorra 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.890
 because it 's still warmer 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.170
 the grip here is a lot of metal I didn't like 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.540
 Give me cold knives 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.060
 almost no love the hilt was 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.420
 either with wood or plastic or with 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.440
 clear composite materials 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 iron is not your maximum 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.590
 questions arising of course on reliability 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.569
 Castle ontario view thin liner 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.170
 almost half a millimeter even 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.569
 less 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.090
 here are all those two and a half 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.690
 adequate frame that hold the blade 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.459
 very tight they both 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 fits securely but still thickness 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.410
 decides why it seems to me that vespa 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:17.019
 with shock loads straightness ring 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.470
 will feel a little healthier than 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.510
 Ontario basically feeling a bit more 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.789
 hard more reliable knife 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.360
 although I repeat ontario all the same and 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:32.140
 habits and warmer for me personally 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.960
 A little more convenient to buy your own volcano wallpaper 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:38.260
 knives will consider separate here she is a little 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.660
 deeper here it is less deep to someone 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.640
 plus someone in him in his hand lies in 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.550
 Basically, this stage is excellent in my hand. 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.490
 repeat here pomona familiar 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.900
 also very 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.840
 well, there is a dark hole 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.870
 absolutely on both knives can be decorated 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.889
 your knife make it more convenient to make it 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.880
 interest not at is about that 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.949
 It is absolutely the place and some difficulties with 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.139
 transition from one to another our you are not 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:19.960
 feel in principle they are very very 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:22.610
 similar to cliff all on both knives 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.870
 principle stick out of pocket they will 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.780
 exactly the same 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.360
 The only thing is that she does not sleep a little bit 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.990
 thicker and smaller more volume in order 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.720
 to adequately climb thick 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.960
 pants either on thick yarn over army 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.699
 Bundeswehr Pskov as you see they 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.970
 another way is done officially 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:47.150
 named a little more interesting notches under 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.970
 thumb and in ontario and bring out 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.000
 worn and made in the same places 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:56.539
 have a slightly different fact here are bigger 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.370
 a little easier to work in a glove here 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:05.030
 lower all the same probably under the head and 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:08.120
 enough for this cucumber are very similar to 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.849
 same sit and work probably 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:16.969
 behave exactly as they should 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.960
 good reliable beautiful new besides 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.330
 everything else 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.460
 will fly to heat with one thing to create 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.830
 teams randall in them laid and 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.740
 city functionality and readiness 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.920
 out-of-the -way along the knives of their survival 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.520
 hardly name him 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.150
 it but also the reliability and functionality on at 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.650
 height 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:41.070
 calling i would go either with sandals or with 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.490
 Odessa and even better with them good wallpaper 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.420
 knives 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.420
 I sincerely recommend
