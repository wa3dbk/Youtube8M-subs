would start with so we'll make our

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.830 
would start with so we'll make our
square<00:04:57.440> knot<00:04:57.650> by<00:04:58.400> turning<00:04:58.910> right<00:04:59.240> over<00:04:59.630> left

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
America and that's the standard that we

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.259 
America and that's the standard that we
go<00:06:16.149> by<00:06:16.419> some<00:06:17.050> people<00:06:17.439> do<00:06:18.159> put<00:06:18.429> the<00:06:18.579> pin<00:06:18.819> down

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:19.269 
go by some people do put the pin down

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:21.239 
go by some people do put the pin down
here<00:06:19.839> because<00:06:20.079> it<00:06:20.499> might<00:06:20.679> be<00:06:20.860> a<00:06:20.889> little<00:06:21.069> bit

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:21.249 
here because it might be a little bit

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.719 
here because it might be a little bit
easier<00:06:21.699> but<00:06:22.269> the<00:06:22.479> correct<00:06:23.099> traditional<00:06:24.099> way

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
easier but the correct traditional way

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.759 
easier but the correct traditional way
of<00:06:24.759> doing<00:06:25.269> that<00:06:25.419> is<00:06:25.599> to<00:06:25.629> run<00:06:26.019> the<00:06:26.169> pin<00:06:26.409> through

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:26.769 
of doing that is to run the pin through

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:31.139 
of doing that is to run the pin through
the<00:06:27.399> knot<00:06:27.639> now<00:06:28.449> I<00:06:28.479> will<00:06:28.989> take<00:06:29.879> my<00:06:30.879> little
