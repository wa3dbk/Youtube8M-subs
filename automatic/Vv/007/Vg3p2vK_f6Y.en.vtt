00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
in and then there's just something

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.920 
in and then there's just something
special<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:48.820> amazing<00:00:49.120> about<00:00:49.540> winning<00:00:49.840> an

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.110 

question<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.170> from<00:00:54.380> mark<00:00:54.650> he<00:00:55.489> says<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:55.940> he

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
question is from mark he says that he

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.540 
question is from mark he says that he
can't<00:00:56.360> see<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:56.960> he<00:00:57.079> counts<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.440> stroke<00:00:57.739> how<00:00:58.340> many

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
can't see so he counts a stroke how many

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.450 
can't see so he counts a stroke how many
strokes<00:00:58.850> do<00:00:59.030> I<00:00:59.120> take<00:00:59.360> pro<00:00:59.600> 25<00:01:00.050> meters<00:01:00.470> for<00:01:01.340> me

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
strokes do I take pro 25 meters for me

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.000 
strokes do I take pro 25 meters for me
it's<00:01:01.640> quite<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:01.910> good<00:01:02.330> gauge<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.600> how<00:01:03.320> things

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
it's quite a good gauge of how things

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.910 
it's quite a good gauge of how things
are<00:01:04.190> going<00:01:04.400> in<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.519> pool<00:01:04.699> so<00:01:04.910> I<00:01:04.940> take

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
are going in the pool so I take

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.260 
are going in the pool so I take
roundabout<00:01:06.920> on<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.130> really<00:01:07.580> good<00:01:07.850> session<00:01:08.150> a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
roundabout on a really good session a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.109 
roundabout on a really good session a
good<00:01:08.420> day<00:01:08.570> about<00:01:09.110> 19<00:01:09.590> strokes<00:01:09.890> per<00:01:10.160> 25<00:01:10.640> meters

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
good day about 19 strokes per 25 meters

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.180 
good day about 19 strokes per 25 meters
and<00:01:11.390> if<00:01:12.170> we're<00:01:12.350> doing<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.590> hard<00:01:12.800> set<00:01:13.070> it's

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
and if we're doing a hard set it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.530 
and if we're doing a hard set it's
really<00:01:13.430> important<00:01:13.850> for<00:01:13.880> us<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.090> try<00:01:14.390> and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
really important for us to try and

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.120 
really important for us to try and
maintain<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:15.229> so<00:01:15.500> making<00:01:15.740> sure<00:01:15.890> we're<00:01:16.100> not

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
maintain that so making sure we're not

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.530 
maintain that so making sure we're not
doing<00:01:16.430> too<00:01:16.580> many<00:01:16.700> more<00:01:16.970> strokes<00:01:17.270> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
doing too many more strokes and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.630 
doing too many more strokes and
shortening<00:01:18.200> our<00:01:18.320> strokes<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:18.920> we<00:01:19.400> try<00:01:19.580> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
shortening our strokes so we try and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.749 
shortening our strokes so we try and
train<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.240> race<00:01:20.479> at<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.470> same<00:01:21.860> number<00:01:22.610> of

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
train and race at the same number of

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.130 
train and race at the same number of
stroke<00:01:23.060> rates<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.630> same<00:01:23.840> number<00:01:24.080> of

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
stroke rates and the same number of

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.530 
stroke rates and the same number of
stroke<00:01:24.320> count<00:01:24.500> perlin

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
stroke count perlin

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.320 
stroke count perlin
at<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.650> next<00:01:27.770> one<00:01:27.980> is<00:01:28.160> from<00:01:28.190> Samuel<00:01:28.790> whose<00:01:29.090> age

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
at the next one is from Samuel whose age

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.080 
at the next one is from Samuel whose age
nine<00:01:29.980> what's<00:01:30.980> the<00:01:31.130> farthest<00:01:31.580> ever<00:01:31.850> strong

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
nine what's the farthest ever strong

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.270 
nine what's the farthest ever strong
without<00:01:32.210> stopping<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.990> guess<00:01:33.410> in<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.710> race<00:01:33.950> is

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
without stopping I guess in a race is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.850 
without stopping I guess in a race is
probably<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.700> first<00:01:34.880> row<00:01:35.060> 10<00:01:35.330> k<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.650> most

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
probably the first row 10 k is the most

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.040 
probably the first row 10 k is the most
awesome<00:01:37.160> without<00:01:37.400> stopping<00:01:37.850> ever<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:38.870> I<00:01:38.900> have

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
awesome without stopping ever but I have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.660 
awesome without stopping ever but I have
done<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.260> swimming<00:01:39.590> session<00:01:39.920> before<00:01:40.070> in<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
done a swimming session before in the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.850 
done a swimming session before in the
pool<00:01:40.880> where<00:01:41.660> there<00:01:42.290> was<00:01:42.410> not<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.620> lot<00:01:42.710> of

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
pool where there was not a lot of

pool where there was not a lot of
stopping<00:01:43.220> involved<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:43.970> involved<00:01:44.360> doing

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
stopping involved and it involved doing

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.740 
stopping involved and it involved doing
18<00:01:45.170> 800<00:01:45.950> meters<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.880> whole<00:01:47.030> session<00:01:47.270> in

18 800 meters and the whole session in

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.540 
18 800 meters and the whole session in
total<00:01:48.229> was<00:01:48.410> fourteen<00:01:48.890> thousand<00:01:49.280> four<00:01:49.520> hundred

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550
