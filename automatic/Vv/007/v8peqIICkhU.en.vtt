or vitamin or potion for eternal youth

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
or vitamin or potion for eternal youth
is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.520 

I<00:01:11.429> mean<00:01:13.850> personally<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.619> think<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:16.979> be

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
I mean personally I think we should be

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
I mean personally I think we should be
celebrating<00:01:19.530> other<00:01:20.009> things<00:01:20.280> instead<00:01:20.609> I<00:01:21.179> think

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
celebrating other things instead I think

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.740 
celebrating other things instead I think
man<00:01:22.079> as<00:01:22.319> a<00:01:23.780> creature<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.289> far<00:01:25.619> too<00:01:25.649> egocentric

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
man as a creature is far too egocentric

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.480 
man as a creature is far too egocentric
in<00:01:27.750> its<00:01:28.020> nature<00:01:28.319> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:31.009> perhaps<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.340> we

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
in its nature I think perhaps if we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
in its nature I think perhaps if we
could<00:01:32.670> learn<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> look<00:01:33.380> beyond<00:01:34.380> ourselves<00:01:35.000> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
could learn to look beyond ourselves a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.940 
could learn to look beyond ourselves a
little<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.509> than<00:01:37.289> we<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:38.009> learn<00:01:38.219> that

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
little more than we would learn that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.349 
little more than we would learn that
there's<00:01:40.950> perhaps<00:01:41.159> other<00:01:41.579> things<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.240> are

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
there's perhaps other things that are

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.850 
there's perhaps other things that are
more<00:01:42.509> beautiful<00:01:43.020> than<00:01:43.380> man<00:01:43.709> is<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.179> think

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
more beautiful than man is and I think

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.149 
more beautiful than man is and I think
you<00:01:46.860> know<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.340> could<00:01:48.560> telescope<00:01:49.560> down<00:01:49.829> to

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
you know that could telescope down to

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.449 
you know that could telescope down to
the<00:01:50.250> whole<00:01:50.459> idea<00:01:50.819> that<00:01:51.829> there's<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.009> much<00:01:53.159> more

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
the whole idea that there's so much more

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:58.789 
the whole idea that there's so much more
to<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.670> person<00:01:53.939> than<00:01:54.860> what<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:57.799> there's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
to a person than what you see there's

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.029 
to a person than what you see there's
their<00:01:59.099> voice<00:01:59.310> as<00:01:59.729> well<00:01:59.759> as<00:02:00.509> who<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.679> you

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
their voice as well as who they are you

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.300 
their voice as well as who they are you
know<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.780> few<00:02:04.079> people<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.679> seems<00:02:04.890> will

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
know and so few people it seems will

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.999 
know and so few people it seems will
take<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.729> time<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.299> reach<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.500> scratch

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
take the time to reach down and scratch

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
take the time to reach down and scratch
below<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.549> superficial<00:02:09.539> surface<00:02:10.079> to<00:02:10.229> find

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
below that superficial surface to find

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.069 
below that superficial surface to find
what's<00:02:10.709> really<00:02:11.009> underneath<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
what's really underneath and I think the

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.470 
what's really underneath and I think the
same<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.530> said<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.890> our<00:02:14.160> worldview<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.299> be

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
same can be said of our worldview to be

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.460 
same can be said of our worldview to be
honest<00:02:15.810> as<00:02:17.000> human<00:02:18.000> beings<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.750> general<00:02:18.810> we're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
honest as human beings in general we're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.830 
honest as human beings in general we're
quite<00:02:19.680> selfish<00:02:20.220> we're<00:02:20.639> quite<00:02:20.910> self-centered

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
quite selfish we're quite self-centered

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.650 
quite selfish we're quite self-centered
and<00:02:22.139> if<00:02:23.069> we<00:02:23.250> could<00:02:23.459> learn<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.970> look<00:02:24.150> beyond

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
and if we could learn to look beyond

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.770 
and if we could learn to look beyond
ourselves<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:26.519> look<00:02:26.700> beyond<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> mirror<00:02:27.450> if

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
ourselves to look beyond the mirror if

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.800 
ourselves to look beyond the mirror if
you<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:29.090> think<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.180> world<00:02:30.450> would<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
you like I think this world would be a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.760 
you like I think this world would be a
lot<00:02:31.019> nicer<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.489> place
