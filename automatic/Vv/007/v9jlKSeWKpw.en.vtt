00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
playing this that probably have a few

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.250 
playing this that probably have a few
times<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:10.190> can<00:02:10.399> hope<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:10.789> yeah<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.750> deck<00:02:12.170> i

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
times I can hope so yeah the deck i

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.420 
times I can hope so yeah the deck i
think<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.530> really<00:02:12.709> well<00:02:12.830> positioned<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> beat

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
think is really well positioned to beat

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.839 
think is really well positioned to beat
zombies<00:02:13.819> dover<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.900> pod<00:02:15.560> variants<00:02:16.250> because

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
zombies dover and pod variants because

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.339 
zombies dover and pod variants because

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
gunshots snags and then bonfires on top

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.520 
gunshots snags and then bonfires on top
of<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.540> really<00:02:20.780> hard<00:02:20.959> for<00:02:21.049> anyone<00:02:21.380> to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
people actually see it to have to think

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.720 
people actually see it to have to think
of<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.079> public<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.220> have<00:02:46.250> in
