competing<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.700> each<00:00:47.789> other<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> while<00:00:48.510> we

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
competing with each other for a while we

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
competing with each other for a while we
get<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.079> how<00:00:49.230> they<00:00:49.350> became<00:00:49.710> friends

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
get to see how they became friends

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
get to see how they became friends
because<00:00:50.250> at<00:00:50.370> first<00:00:50.550> they're<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.149> enemies

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because at first they're kind of enemies

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.939 
because at first they're kind of enemies
but<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.870> also<00:00:52.020> some<00:00:52.260> underlying<00:00:52.649> themes

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
but there's also some underlying themes

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.260 
but there's also some underlying themes
in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.160> movie<00:00:53.370> where<00:00:53.489> Mike<00:00:53.699> isn't<00:00:53.969> sure<00:00:54.149> if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
in the movie where Mike isn't sure if

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.119 
in the movie where Mike isn't sure if
he's<00:00:54.420> scary<00:00:54.750> enough<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> Sulley<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> big

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
he's scary enough and Sulley is the big

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
he's scary enough and Sulley is the big
scary<00:00:56.550> beast<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> everyone<00:00:57.570> loves<00:00:57.809> him<00:00:57.989> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
scary beast and everyone loves him but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
scary beast and everyone loves him but
he<00:00:58.530> doesn't<00:00:58.680> had<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> smarts<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.489> Mike<00:00:59.789> has

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
he doesn't had the smarts that Mike has

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
he doesn't had the smarts that Mike has
and<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.480> had<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> learn<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and so they had to kind of learn how to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.070 
and so they had to kind of learn how to
work<00:01:01.890> together<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.579> make<00:01:03.030> their<00:01:03.270> team<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
work together and make their team be the

the planet for these people now I saw

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.190 
the planet for these people now I saw
monsters<00:01:15.119> Inc<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.780> came<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
monsters Inc when it first came out and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.390 
monsters Inc when it first came out and
I<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.560> enjoyed<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.220> never

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I really enjoyed it but it was never

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
I really enjoyed it but it was never
really<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> played<00:01:18.689> over

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
really like the one that I played over

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.749 
really like the one that I played over
and<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.350> again<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.710> Toy<00:01:19.950> Story<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.369> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and over again like Toy Story was I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
and over again like Toy Story was I
still<00:01:21.000> enjoyed<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> film<00:01:21.600> though<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
still enjoyed the film though and so I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.300 
still enjoyed the film though and so I
was<00:01:22.229> looking<00:01:22.500> forward<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.979> where<00:01:23.130> these

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
was looking forward to see where these

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.859 
was looking forward to see where these
characters<00:01:23.729> were<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.479> even<00:01:24.780> though

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
characters were going to go even though

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.760 
characters were going to go even though
they<00:01:25.020> weren't<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> go

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
they weren't really going to go

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
they weren't really going to go
someplace<00:01:26.070> because<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> prequel<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
someplace because this is a prequel and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
someplace because this is a prequel and

string of mediocrity lately and I think
this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> good<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> kind<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> turn<00:01:49.229> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
this is a good way to kind of turn it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
this is a good way to kind of turn it
around<00:01:49.439> because<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
around because it's something that

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
around because it's something that
appeals<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.560> Pixar<00:01:52.950> fans<00:01:53.159> because

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
they were going for that and they made

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.990 
they were going for that and they made
the<00:02:46.590> film<00:02:46.799> fun<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.160> entertaining<00:02:47.549> and<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:47.910> was

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the film fun and entertaining and it was

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.370 
the film fun and entertaining and it was
cool<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.180> see<00:02:48.299> how<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.569> characters<00:02:49.079> came

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
cool to see how the characters came

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.990 
cool to see how the characters came
together<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.069> was<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> little<00:02:50.459> bit<00:02:50.640> cliched

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
together but it was a little bit cliched

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.370 
together but it was a little bit cliched
I<00:02:51.209> feel<00:02:51.360> like<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:51.630> unnecessary<00:02:52.170> at<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
I feel like it's unnecessary at this

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.690 
I feel like it's unnecessary at this
point<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.739> me<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.890> tell<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.280> Pixar's
