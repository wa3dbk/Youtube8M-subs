00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:07.819
[Dr. Marilyn Huestis Speaking]

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.580
We've wanted to study the
effects of cannabis on driving.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.949
We approached the Office of Drug
Control Policy or ONDCP, to help fund this

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.390
important
project considering especially what is going

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
on in our
country now changing rules on cannabis.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.180
NHTSA, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.890
had built this incredible technology
to study the effects of drugs on driving.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.309
And NHTSA and ONDCP, worked with
NIDA to conduct the very first

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.359
ever study of an illicit drug in the
National Advanced Driving Simulator. This

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.870
is a very
important collaboration to look at the effects

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.379
of cannabis with
and without alcohol on driving and we hope

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.749
that this can educate
the public these effects.

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.200
So one of our first findings is the effect
of cannabis on standard

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.280
deviation of lateral position or weaving within
the lane, and we've shown that cannabis increases

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.390
that weaving in the lane and that alcohol
also increases that movement within the lane

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.920
and when you put them together, which is the
most common co-occurence of drugs and drivers,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.920
you see that the additive affect of both of
those drugs on driving performance and that's

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.960
a public health and safety issue.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.880
Also because we had measurements of the cannabis
before and after the drive, all the time after

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.789
they smoked we also have the alcohol measurements
we were able to develop a model, that would

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:59.630
tell us what the concentration of THC-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
that's the main psychoactive ingredient in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.960
cannabis, what concentration of THC, would
equate with certain important levels of alcohol.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.260
Like .08 percent, which is the legal limit
in the United States and we found that 13.1

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:25.450
micrograms per liter of THC produces the same
affects on the SDLP, as .08 percent of alcohol.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.849
Another very critical factor though, is these
are the measurements of THC in the blood at

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:38.680
the time of driving and unfortunately it takes
a number of hours, usually somewhere

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.090
2 to 4 hours after a policeman stops someone
for impaired driving, or perhaps after the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.530
accident before we get the blood and THC decreases
very rapidly so the amount during the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.019
drive of between 8.2 and 13.1 micrograms per
liter by the time you

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.230
collect the sample, can be much lower maybe
around one or two micrograms per liter.
