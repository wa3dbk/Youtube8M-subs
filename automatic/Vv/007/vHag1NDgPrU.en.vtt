00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.320
 hello how are you good in this video les 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.680
 I will teach how to download 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.630
 components on your pc that are not that 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.000
 are missing such as a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.419
 dll file but it looks like a square that 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.489
 says that we imagine that we want to open 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:36.530
 a game and it tells you that it can not be opened 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:38.480
 for a file of 3 jp point dl the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.620
 dll files are essential in a 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.870
 machine 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.629
 sometimes they get lost are deleted or by 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.760
 some reason most times when 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.530
 it is formatted but I do not know very well about 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.929
 it so let's move on to how 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.460
 recover those files so what 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.629
 first thing we're going to do is go to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.219
 link that I will leave in the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.910
 description of the video that is the page 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.010
 official to download dll files us 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.120
 we go 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.899
 Internet 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.899
 we stick 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.950
 i 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.340
 and very well once we are inside 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.540
 this page here will not appear on 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.970
 to write the name of the file that 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.270
 we need in this case I'm 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.560
 helping a friend to solve this 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 problem problem 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.600
 who is now 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.950
 he told me that the file he is missing 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.780
 it's called collation and 4 point of ll 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.430
 then what we are going to do 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.430
 is to put that name like this 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 but 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.340

 I think that we 4 dl here appears and we're going 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.560
 let's look and it appears here this is 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 to download not us where we 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.640
 will begin to download the zip file 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.740
 well I'm going to pause the video about 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.050
 seconds to finish the download 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.990
 good once it has been downloaded 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 this we are going to take to the desk 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.140
 here we'll give right click and 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.800
 extract here 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.660
 this is not going to appear that says lm but 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.110
 they are not other faults because he now what 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.230
 I'm going to explain this file well 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.980
 they have here they are going to take it they have to 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.330
 go on local disk computer windows 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.950
 and here you have to go where it says 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:12.930

 attend move three fingers and you're done and 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.870
 this case if you have windows 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.569
 if you have windows not windows if 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.930
 not if they have a 64-bit version of them 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.969
 this folder is going to appear 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.920
 it's called s &amp; s wow 64 and they're going to have 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:39.980

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.560
 good again they will have to send 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 which has to put the components 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.690
 list once they have stuck that is 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.200
 then with any program with 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.330
 any of which you lack 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.410
 they just have to put the name 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.110
 download it and do the steps that I just 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.700
 to do if they have to know that if you have 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.030

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.800
