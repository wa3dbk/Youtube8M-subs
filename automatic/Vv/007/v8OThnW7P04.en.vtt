00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello girls and welcome to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.879
 us star kat today there is a something 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.770
 Another video because my hair is still 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.150
 that asked now if i will not do it again 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 I can show how I feel about my hair 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 Phones and since the moment so nice 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
 I thought his do that also makes and 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.590
 which of course will soon be changed 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.970
 and that's why I thought now is the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.070
 chance to show you this again 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.720
 This hairstyle and then we go 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 Of course I want to be first 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 my hair too dry with one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.490
 towel that means that no more 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.289
 they are and are very moist 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 of course, first dry and faster 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 second, easier to handle the I 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.030
 I already done it I take it off 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.950
 jacko that cake or any other 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.540
 and distribute that in the hair I take 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.000
 usually just a small drop 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 that is actually distributed in the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 hands and that comes through the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.250
 hair 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 it's best not all in the hair 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.329
 but he has so much in the way 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.829
 I try that is at short 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.960
 of course not always quite like that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.730
 just that they do not google it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
 also delicious next I use 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.049
 then bacon the noises of kevin and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.850
 Although spring likes to call itself 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189
 I'll start first with this amount the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 usually enough that defends 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.210
 finger again and then knead 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.470
 I'm so easy in the long no 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.659
 mainly natural where the hair 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.850
 but the longest are then to the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 But that's just the length of the page 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 start and then the pages go with it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 Of course, most product does not work 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 the country side but where it is 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 belongs to start filling already 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.360
 I use the proline 1500 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.670
 professional exactly me times with salis 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 I bought it before I started 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.110
 you may always tell me like me 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.149
 So for my long side is the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.890
 means, of course, the front and remains 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.420
 then I have the short side here 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.280
 not so short now 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.829
 it will come behind your ear afterwards 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
 that is, it will later become flat and that 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.979
 most important now is the crown here 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.869
 to find 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.950
 he must not sit too high with me 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.710
 because otherwise that looks at the right 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.149
 side funny and the allowed but also 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.979
 do not sit too low otherwise 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.200
 all the hair is falling here now 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.840
 short over there that's me again 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.179
 has to be there 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 I would say medium-term names 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.980
 where men's secretions 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.260
 So basically sit my garage corner there 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.030
 above that is the point where I am 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.590
 now the switch is about the same 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 which is again a bit later 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.709
 better and then I start filling 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.940
 I'll start with the shorter ones 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.440
 hair because of course also on 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.000
 Quickest drying and I as there 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.989
 first ran so that after 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.849
 not in any weird 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.739
 dry positions that is first 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.690
 behind the head and the sides of the head and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.690
 then i take care of the parting 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.269
 if it is reasonably dry now 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.099
 i go to the crest and she 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.450
 simply with your fingers to the hair 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.310
 left or right so I have one 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.629
 nice separation there if that 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.489
 is done I take care of the 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.319
 ponies and lead me to the face 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.319
 and you as a position as he 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.700
 should be after 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.739
 so if now the hair reasonably 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.890
 are dry and still a bit 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.040
 Residual moisture in it have indeed been of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.870
 it a round brush I suspect that the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.590
 has ceramic in there or any 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.120
 Type of heat conductive metal 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.130
 they had relatively small diameters 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.930
 that it works well with smaller rooster 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.260
 that means I 'm going in here right now 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.819
 and will then fill it down immediately 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.500
 so that I do not have such an outside wave here 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.690
 We love to do that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 around you can see that here already so easy 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.260
 that easily come to the outside and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.730
 Of course nobody wants that 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.290
 That's why I'll be here now 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.200
 I want to give it easier and lead 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.489
 No, I just do that relatively 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.410
 Inaccurate and just clean with the brush 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.090
 a bit slow with the drag 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.889
 fill it and then down 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.079
 and then I try to the back 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.250
 also because here you can see behind 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.510
 it is also relatively long 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.669
 Of course we have one too 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.380
 tendency to do this here and 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:57.150
 That's why I go in the back for a short time 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.150
 and then do that down 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.940
 we can see now has the ticketing 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.640
 rushing from kevin murphy the full because 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.930
 my hair is really well worked 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.030
 got pretty full 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.890
 Of course, that did not change that way at the side 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.150
 That's why I'll be here for a moment 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.790
 take the brush 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.910
 try all this down a bit 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:28.300
 Brush here and then it will come soon 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.130
 After that, it's simply interesting 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
 already come down relatively well 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.280
 I'm going to do that a little bit now 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.740
 the front is not so much on 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.690
 claps again everything look smooth and 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.460
 then I'll go right with hands still 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.180
 times through hp gaal already seen that one 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.889
 that knead very well now 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.050
 These kevin make feedback little 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.000
 rushing this procedure a very good 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:55.479
 grip and very nice body 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.430
 got and what I now before 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.840
 have told the side with the 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 find crest 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.060
 that's exactly what this is called 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.970
 which now work over on their own 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.560
 are probably the unifying better 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.300
 this page saw the pony's partie 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.700
 I prefer to sit here now mostly 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.680
 just a little bit down that me 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.690
 not such a high standing or have 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.940
 you do not see the hair like that now 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.680
 still a bit to define or on 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.930
 I use this page to tame 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.900
 Well the shop waves are massive 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.340
 but wanda does not do that 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.970
 Dries like a gel I had you 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.539
 in a product video already tell 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.820
 I just distribute it a bit 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:41.130
 in the hands and do not try now 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.130
 to go for it but quite easily 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.610
 and of course you have to be careful 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.290
 by making it so smooth when you do 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.970
 because it is so over it then sees that 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.540
 very laid out and we want that 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.430
 Not 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.360
 but it's mostly about now 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.360
 flying hairs 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.699
 so should have been the one can 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.389
 of course, still with hairspray 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.320
 cramming 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.639
 I'm not doing so much just good 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.790
 maybe a little bit right now 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.260
 but sick and therefore because I mean 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.360
 always very happy to loose hair 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.610
 have concreted in themselves and not so firmly 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.070
 I just like to let that happen 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.330
 I can always enjoy full time there 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.310
 talk through and talk again 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.240
 that just keeps thinking that good 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.360
 education in it 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.199
 yes and that was my fill and styling 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.270
 routine 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.590
 I hope you like the video and 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.150
 if you still ask you be happy 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.070
 of course and in the comments 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.479
 You can find infos about all products 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.150
 as usual in the infobox below 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.590
 Give me thumbs up and follow me 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.090
 instagram and then we'll see each other 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.479
 hopefully in the next video until then 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.479
 bye
