howdy<00:00:15.100> today<00:00:16.100> I'm<00:00:16.460> looking<00:00:16.730> at<00:00:17.000> revenge<00:00:17.420> of

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
howdy today I'm looking at revenge of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.100 
howdy today I'm looking at revenge of
the<00:00:17.600> Fallen<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:18.380> now<00:00:19.270> this<00:00:20.270> is<00:00:20.330> a<00:00:20.480> recolor<00:00:20.990> of

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
the Fallen so now this is a recolor of

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.410 
the Fallen so now this is a recolor of
one<00:00:21.380> of<00:00:21.500> my<00:00:21.620> favorite<00:00:22.100> Scouts<00:00:22.990> depth-charge

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
one of my favorite Scouts depth-charge

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.570 
one of my favorite Scouts depth-charge
at<00:00:26.420> first<00:00:26.780> this<00:00:27.470> just<00:00:27.770> looks<00:00:27.980> like<00:00:28.100> a<00:00:28.220> black

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
at first this just looks like a black

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.480 
at first this just looks like a black
boat<00:00:28.910> with<00:00:29.090> red<00:00:29.330> windows<00:00:29.810> which<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.340> a

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
boat with red windows which it is in a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.170 
boat with red windows which it is in a
way<00:00:31.960> but<00:00:32.960> if<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.170> look<00:00:33.500> closely<00:00:36.640> it's<00:00:37.640> hard<00:00:38.000> to

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
way but if you look closely it's hard to

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.360 
way but if you look closely it's hard to
show<00:00:38.420> on<00:00:38.450> this<00:00:38.660> camera<00:00:39.170> but<00:00:39.410> there's<00:00:39.830> actually

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
show on this camera but there's actually

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.410 
show on this camera but there's actually
a<00:00:40.400> very<00:00:40.910> faint<00:00:41.450> camo<00:00:41.960> pattern<00:00:42.470> on<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.890> boat

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
a very faint camo pattern on the boat

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.970 
a very faint camo pattern on the boat
flat<00:00:44.420> black<00:00:44.720> mixed<00:00:45.230> with<00:00:45.410> plus<00:00:45.710> black

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
flat black mixed with plus black

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.250 
flat black mixed with plus black
markings<00:00:48.820> usually<00:00:49.820> color<00:00:50.450> schemes<00:00:50.840> like<00:00:50.960> this

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
markings usually color schemes like this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.040 
markings usually color schemes like this
a<00:00:51.470> rather<00:00:51.710> dull<00:00:52.239> but<00:00:53.239> this<00:00:53.420> one<00:00:53.660> is<00:00:53.840> rather

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
a rather dull but this one is rather

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.280 
a rather dull but this one is rather
clever<00:00:54.560> in<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.130> subtle<00:00:55.520> way<00:00:55.989> it's<00:00:56.989> also

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
clever in a subtle way it's also

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.690 
clever in a subtle way it's also
appropriate<00:00:57.980> for<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.250> stealth<00:00:58.610> boat<00:01:00.370> not<00:01:01.370> only

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
appropriate for a stealth boat not only

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.729 
appropriate for a stealth boat not only
that<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.360> actually<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:02.870> very<00:01:02.989> different

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
that it's actually a very different

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.010 
that it's actually a very different
pattern<00:01:03.920> compared<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.670> depth<00:01:04.909> charges<00:01:05.390> which

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
pattern compared to depth charges which

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960 
pattern compared to depth charges which
is<00:01:06.200> much<00:01:06.440> better<00:01:06.650> than<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.100> being<00:01:07.280> exactly<00:01:07.520> the

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
is much better than it being exactly the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.550 
is much better than it being exactly the
same<00:01:08.300> just<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.200> these<00:01:09.530> colors<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:12.110> official

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
same just in these colors the official

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.370 
same just in these colors the official
images<00:01:12.850> really<00:01:13.850> don't<00:01:14.360> do<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.870> mode<00:01:15.140> any

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
images really don't do this mode any

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.730 
images really don't do this mode any
justice<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.670> looks<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.180> lot<00:01:17.479> better<00:01:17.690> in<00:01:17.990> person

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
justice it looks a lot better in person

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.550 
justice it looks a lot better in person
oh<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:21.729> yeah<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.540> transformation<00:01:23.960> is

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
oh and yeah so the transformation is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:43.990 
oh and yeah so the transformation is
exactly<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.370> same<00:01:25.640> as<00:01:25.909> before

alien-like<00:02:13.190> features<00:02:13.730> such<00:02:14.240> as<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.720> legs

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
alien-like features such as the legs

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.560

it's<00:02:15.800> one<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.250> few<00:02:16.610> Scout<00:02:17.060> molds<00:02:17.510> that

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
it's one of the few Scout molds that

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.060 
it's one of the few Scout molds that
works<00:02:18.050> for<00:02:18.350> both<00:02:18.410> allegiances<00:02:20.440> he<00:02:21.440> also<00:02:21.650> has

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
works for both allegiances he also has

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.460 
works for both allegiances he also has
the<00:02:22.340> same<00:02:22.610> battle<00:02:23.240> mode<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.690> his<00:02:23.840> predecessor

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
the same battle mode as his predecessor

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.730 
the same battle mode as his predecessor
I<00:02:24.820> mean<00:02:25.820> I<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.720> don't<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:26.990> any<00:02:27.230> problems

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
I mean I really don't have any problems

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.310 
I mean I really don't have any problems
with<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.100> Rico<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.750> only<00:02:29.959> thing<00:02:30.140> I'd

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
with this Rico the only thing I'd

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.380 
with this Rico the only thing I'd
suggest<00:02:30.530> is<00:02:31.010> painting<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> inside<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
suggest is painting the inside of the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.920 
suggest is painting the inside of the
missile<00:02:32.750> pod<00:02:32.959> silver

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
missile pod silver

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
missile pod silver
don't<00:02:35.930> let<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> stock<00:02:36.500> images<00:02:36.920> fool<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.370> this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
don't let the stock images fool you this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.660 
don't let the stock images fool you this
is<00:02:38.180> actually<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.660> great<00:02:39.080> we<00:02:39.350> deco<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.400> have<00:02:40.580> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
is actually a great we deco and have a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.199 
is actually a great we deco and have a
great<00:02:40.910> mold<00:02:41.240> too<00:02:41.600> if<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:43.280> only<00:02:43.459> pick<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:43.910> one

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
great mold too if you only pick up one

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.060 
great mold too if you only pick up one
of<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> three<00:02:44.660> colors<00:02:45.200> without<00:02:45.620> having<00:02:45.950> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
of the three colors without having to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.640 
of the three colors without having to
worry<00:02:46.280> about<00:02:46.580> quality<00:02:46.850> control<00:02:47.470> make<00:02:48.470> it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
worry about quality control make it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
worry about quality control make it
sonar<00:02:49.690> you'll<00:02:50.690> see<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.080> mean<00:02:51.350> when<00:02:51.410> I
