00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190 

when<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.220> put<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.700> washing<00:01:44.120> liquid<00:01:44.510> in<00:01:44.780> I<00:01:44.960> put

when I put the washing liquid in I put

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.469 
when I put the washing liquid in I put
in<00:01:45.350> half<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.950> amount<00:01:46.160> I<00:01:46.310> usually<00:01:46.760> would<00:01:46.940> just

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
in half the amount I usually would just

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.610 
in half the amount I usually would just
because<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.810> don't<00:01:47.900> want<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.260> like<00:01:48.410> wash

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
because you don't want it to like wash

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.960 
because you don't want it to like wash
out<00:01:48.800> and<00:01:48.920> get<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> color<00:01:49.370> or<00:01:49.550> anything<00:01:49.729> like

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.350 
out and get the color or anything like
that<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.660> I<00:01:50.690> just<00:01:50.810> use<00:01:51.140> half<00:01:51.410> a<00:01:51.710> lid<00:01:51.920> of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
that so I just use half a lid of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:06.510 
that so I just use half a lid of
washings<00:01:53.360> liquid<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:54.770> know

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.029 

okay<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.579> when<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:08.229> put<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.379> washing<00:02:09.619> machine

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
okay so when I put the washing machine

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.280 
okay so when I put the washing machine
on<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.580> put<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.000> on<00:02:11.299> mine<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.540> thought<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:11.959> mixed

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
on I put it on mine I thought I mixed

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.690 
on I put it on mine I thought I mixed
low<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:12.709> because<00:02:12.950> that's<00:02:13.160> kind<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.459> what<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
low just because that's kind of what it

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.000 
low just because that's kind of what it
is<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.180> then<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.840> always<00:02:15.230> make<00:02:15.590> sure<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.860> it's

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
is and then I always make sure that it's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.610 
is and then I always make sure that it's
on<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.280> lowest<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.870> temperature<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.500> it

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
on the lowest like temperature that it

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.170 
on the lowest like temperature that it
can<00:02:18.739> go<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.069> just<00:02:19.310> because<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.879> said<00:02:20.090> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
can go on just because like I said you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.030 
can go on just because like I said you
don't<00:02:20.239> want<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> wash<00:02:20.690> out<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.989> color<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
don't want to wash out the color and I

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.619 
don't want to wash out the color and I
also<00:02:22.250> make<00:02:22.580> sure<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.090> spinner<00:02:23.569> is<00:02:23.959> on

also make sure that the spinner is on

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.509 
also make sure that the spinner is on
like<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.660> medium<00:02:27.290> range<00:02:27.799> so<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.129> want<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> get

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
like a medium range so you want to get

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.890 
like a medium range so you want to get
the<00:02:28.580> dirt<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:28.879> but<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.180> don't<00:02:29.420> wash<00:02:29.780> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the dirt out but you don't wash the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.259 
the dirt out but you don't wash the
color<00:02:30.079> out<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.560> always<00:02:30.769> put<00:02:31.040> it<00:02:31.129> on<00:02:31.269> probably

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
color out so I always put it on probably

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.830 
color out so I always put it on probably
the<00:02:32.390> second<00:02:32.860> slowest<00:02:33.860> spin<00:02:34.579> that<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:35.030> if

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
the second slowest spin that I can if

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.910 
the second slowest spin that I can if
your<00:02:36.019> washing<00:02:36.260> machine<00:02:36.530> doesn't<00:02:36.650> have<00:02:36.799> these

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
your washing machine doesn't have these

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.100 
your washing machine doesn't have these
functions<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.790> whatever<00:02:38.120> like<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:38.989> just

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
functions and whatever like this is just

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.830 
functions and whatever like this is just
my<00:02:39.349> washing<00:02:39.769> machine<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:41.120> always<00:02:41.510> try<00:02:41.780> and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
my washing machine but always try and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080 
my washing machine but always try and
put<00:02:41.959> it<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.200> a<00:02:42.230> cold<00:02:42.680> temperature<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:44.060> a

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
put it on a cold temperature and on a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.270 
put it on a cold temperature and on a
slow<00:02:44.450> spin<00:02:45.019> cycle<00:02:45.470> because<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:46.010> don't<00:02:46.129> want

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
slow spin cycle because you don't want

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.250 
slow spin cycle because you don't want
to<00:02:46.400> wash<00:02:46.579> out<00:02:46.790> any<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.090> color<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:47.599> then<00:02:48.140> I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
to wash out any of the color and then I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.690 
to wash out any of the color and then I
just<00:02:48.470> press<00:02:48.650> Start<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:50.079> wait<00:02:51.079> for<00:02:51.410> 44<00:02:52.099> minutes

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.039 

and<00:02:54.969> I'm<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> different<00:02:55.299> shirt<00:02:55.659> but<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> had

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
when guys just finished washing and I'm

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.309 
when guys just finished washing and I'm
just<00:03:01.329> about<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.510> hang<00:03:01.689> it<00:03:01.840> out<00:03:01.930> but<00:03:02.109> I'm<00:03:02.170> gonna

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
just about to hang it out but I'm gonna

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.140 
just about to hang it out but I'm gonna
show<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.590> how<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.799> hang<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.040> out<00:03:03.250> because<00:03:03.909> I<00:03:04.090> do

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
show you how I hang it out because I do

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:23.959 
show you how I hang it out because I do
that<00:03:04.420> in<00:03:04.599> like<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.859> particular<00:03:05.859> way

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:23.969 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.190 

okay<00:03:24.969> I've<00:03:25.209> hung<00:03:25.480> my<00:03:25.719> summer<00:03:26.140> break<00:03:26.260> up<00:03:26.469> there

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.410 

and<00:03:29.379> I<00:03:29.650> always<00:03:29.950> hang<00:03:30.129> it<00:03:30.280> inside<00:03:30.939> out<00:03:31.389> just

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
and I always hang it inside out just

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.379 
and I always hang it inside out just
because<00:03:32.040> if<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.250> sun's<00:03:33.519> out<00:03:33.609> for<00:03:33.969> it<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.150> dry

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
because if the sun's out for it to dry

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.059 
because if the sun's out for it to dry
you<00:03:34.659> don't<00:03:34.780> want<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.079> Sun<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.319> like<00:03:35.709> bleach

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
you don't want the Sun to like bleach

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.179 
you don't want the Sun to like bleach
the<00:03:36.280> color<00:03:36.489> out<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.819> the<00:03:37.439> like<00:03:38.439> the<00:03:38.590> outside<00:03:39.010> of

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
the color out of the like the outside of

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.819 
the color out of the like the outside of
it<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.609> always<00:03:39.819> hang<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.329> inside

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
it so I always hang it with the inside

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.319 
it so I always hang it with the inside
outwards<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.519> if<00:03:42.639> it<00:03:42.790> does<00:03:42.909> bleach<00:03:43.150> in

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
outwards so that if it does bleach in

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.729 
outwards so that if it does bleach in
the<00:03:43.420> Sun<00:03:43.599> while<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:43.870> drying<00:03:44.109> it's<00:03:44.349> not<00:03:44.560> going

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
the Sun while it's drying it's not going

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.740 
the Sun while it's drying it's not going
to<00:03:44.799> you're<00:03:45.099> not<00:03:45.129> going<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> see<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.579> so<00:03:45.879> yeah<00:03:46.480> so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
to you're not going to see it so yeah so
