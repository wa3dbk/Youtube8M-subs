00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.229
 you won't need to hide in the shadows 3 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.909
 has been a long time 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.339
 true no mobile chat us you know why i am here 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.640

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
 terrasini 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.649
 you tried to insert your comb into the game 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.780
 Creatine was wiped out 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.310
 at your hand I imagine later it is perhaps you should ask 4 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.450
 this is for you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.610
 it must be so humiliating for roofs 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.670
 come to my door 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.170
 no 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810
 rt 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.100
 they are of obvious advantage 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.800
 really amazing that the great sea that succumbs to the power of the chef 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.640
 like a vampire like 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.310
 after all these years you're still so arrogant 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 you think you've come up with a very smart plan 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 you do not know anything 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.470
 you have read the signs but you have not understood the meaning 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.670
 you think you are that fool the prophecy of the vampires the descendant 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.440
 of balance and think that now you have the key to making the come true 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.810
 your destiny 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.870
 but your messianic disappointments have blinded you to the true nature of guarantee 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.900
 you have no idea what is unleashed 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.320
 there was a time when you could have listened to the wise advice that you have 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.310
 have been offered now the bank has clouded your mind 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990
 you can find out for yourself 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.190
 the truth 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 you will need it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.119
 maybe you'll come back when I'm gone 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:19.079
 but up to that moment you will have to deal with more important things than pursuing me 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.999
 perhaps 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.139
 at the next meeting 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.629
