00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.050
 that is the robot all children 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.359
 in which 2 2-liter anniversaries lodge 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:12.529
 Jonas Buch i and Claudius Simin are just getting him started 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.329
 a platter 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.519
 Treichel has been able to recognize alternatives 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.890
 These are powered by electric motors Edith Rabenstein cylinders 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.239
 for that throws us that content 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.649
 It's not supposed to be a rescue robot being with the new cameras or searching for meaning 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.079
 Spilling houses can bring Photo Nolte is Rahel should later 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.730
 He might also get away with manipulators to get away from people 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.700
 needs or 3 percent 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.630
 he turns and turns euro 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.630
 the source of inspiration for the Swiss researchers is currently the most powerful one 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.290
 four-legged robot called Big Dogs he comes from the robot forge Boston 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.150
 Dynamics his legs are hydraulically powered 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.240
 the energy for this is provided by a 15 hp and louder go-kart engines 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.280
 so that the client of up to 35 degrees steep hill and that with additional 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.330
 baggage 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.980
 Viktor ever American ground forces in difficult cases 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.680
 Accompany his development clearly with secrecy 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.960
 the rector of the State Secretary Peter Struck is certainly one of the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.460
 the most impressive machines that are currently in this field 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 Walker Botta with a hatchet 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.670
 he is very robust 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 It can be through relatively difficult terrain DomstraÃŸe itself information 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 can give the balance they have already mandated 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 and also in the bus and Straumann also the test should very good custom so 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.310
 Ranger 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.650
 an example 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650
 here Big Dog goes over 1 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.190
 Zooming tree roots permanently monitor its location and guide it as needed 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.189
 Corrections to the club 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.550
 The robot also has force sensors in its feet 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.310
 which the fans discounters feel 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 so it is practically identical 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.600
 and he can also parry powerful blows I have 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.430
 m answered why that is the moment in which the robot is in the area of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.680
 Legs need the most speed we have our board if you want 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.050
 even people who have slipped or are pushed it must be their foot 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.170
 quickly changed and put off a man from Europe that you can see here 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.939
 very nice 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.589
 who does it all at the shortest time she cares for that 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:36.579
 Interest the balance is not working 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 the tragic joint damage makes these fast leg movements first 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:41.859
 possible 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.949
 On those you sit with the home team 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.809
 but why not a four-legged friend 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:51.949
 four-legged robot four-legged robots have the advantage that stability 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:52.849
 easier 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.059
 they can hold four legs on the ground three times 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.889
 you can carry loads and robberies is more difficult in Haiti 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.009
 the command 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.969
 he is unmarried, she burnt down in early July over hill and dale or 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.399
 climb over big rocks we need more in the legs in addition 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:10.269
 Also ours 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.249
 we sit 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.419
 in the current prototype, for example, there are top encounters 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.459
 still rising 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.259
 with his new band technology mix active election campaign regulation 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.729
 the researchers have solved the problem 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:31.209
 that I am now actively regulated on this force force regulation 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.319
 causes the whole virus bug falls the Fortis Sa because you have 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.389
 seen that one could need this feud law to run in the terrain 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.489
 the procedure 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.959
 That's why we put on a threesome already completed that one now 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.449
 Even from the very top down, Empire stepped on that is no problem 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.899
 that can not be done a thousand times and the band can not break the party 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:58.019
 Oct the robot control is a big challenge 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.049
 Viktor Krist partially autonomous 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.229
 the access through his foolish behind makes that possible 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.939
 Reader in the head of Viktor Orban and a reflective vest of the leader 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.969
 The robot of the Swiss researchers is also to become autonomous 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.629
 the Hochries expert in this field 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:23.770
 in the 2 intensively followed the course of another investigation of the children's village 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.770
 here pictures of his experiments 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.139
 Who gives cats big words a digital terrain map 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.349
 due to which he travels a scree line crossing third runs 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.349
 or take over a division 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:44.769
 we have algorithms looking at the congregation and looking for a good position 

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:46.960
 search to put the foot down 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.790
 The opposition rejected the approach according to certain criteria 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.620
 The cost situation is selected and it will force you to make provision 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.970
 the idea that the robot will trigger this in the future on the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.669
 Place also in Hamburg will in this case have the map here 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.460
 delivered 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.200
 Sparrowhawk at our wide will be Aniston robots and the crisis numbers up 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.900
 the rest of the terrain get to know the card creating the stunt for this 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.779
 Things also make use of the reason that Opel 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:15.830
 they are free 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.500
 Karen Szola IQ of off-road as well as weather 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.419
 who such a robot drives increase disaster areas really suitable 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.860
 Rochat to Dessau according to rooms give historians huge areas 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.050
 are uninsured 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.569
 and also the big construction machines but not just access but it is 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.620
 a reason why you go with people and dogs in the final one 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.090
 is for them dangerous Mars tends to shift chairman Karl teams 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.909
 If it is too dangerous now, everything tends to be around 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:48.879
 You would like to send in a rock concert because it is less serious 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.879
 To promote robots as a human life one is armed 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.159
 Pfister robot accompanied first rescue box 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.499
 More years are likely to pass 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.959
 the decisive factor will be the industry to please four-legged friends
