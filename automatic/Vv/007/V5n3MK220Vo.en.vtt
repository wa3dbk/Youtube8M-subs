00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello how about very good friends at all 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.490
 I hope you are very well in this video 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'm going to talk about what is the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 stress the cortisol how it increases how 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.740
 decreases the effect they have on the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.289
 metabolism so I hope that what 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.949
 Check your liking I thank you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 their likes but mainly stress 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.609
 they are taken as a state of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.939
 mental fatigue and is produced due 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.029
 to constant wear either physical or 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.830
 mind that he is producing the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.059
 body cortisol is a hormone 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.059
 produced by the glands 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.670
 adrenal glands that have enough 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.700
 effects on what is the metabolism the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.050
 Cortisol promotes neon glucose 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.860
 genesis that is the increase of glycogen to 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.290
 starting from lipids proteins 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.540
 glycogen is very important because it is 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.760
 an energy reserve an excess of this 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.980
 may cause 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.109
 that blood sugar levels 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.180
 increase the levels of 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.970
 Cortisol causes tissue breakdown 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.580
 muscle because stress and the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 wear that you are being 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.340
 causing the body gives a signal of 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.049
 need for amino acids and glucose and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.000
 a momentary increase in the levels of 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.280
 cortisol causes said 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 muscle tissue wear said 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.100
 degradation imagine if we 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.070
 we maintain a quite stressful state 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.860
 high what you are going to carry is a state 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 good what it's going to take is an increase 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 of cortisol and if we stay in a 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.330
 quite high state of cortisol is going 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.670
 to lead to further degradation of what 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.800
 that is being muscle tissue but 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 nothing to tissue degradation 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.380
 muscle but that will take us higher 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.240
 irritability greater depression between 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.310
 many other factors, both physical and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.380
 mental the cortisol has moments 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.250
 during the day it has peaks of 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.200
 activity either very high and very low 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.720
 for example is what is the cycle 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.970
 circadian 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.380
 based on this circadian cycle tells us 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.640
 that at night when sleeping 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.590
 our cortisol levels is 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 relatively down during our 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.380
 first hours of sleep but after 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.030
 wake up during the next hours 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.400
 after awakening our explain of 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.640
 cortisol are quite high in 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.170
 recent studies showed that at 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.510
 moment 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.989
 to train cortisol levels 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.880
 then increases during the follow-up 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.010
 of training is decreasing the 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.880
 cortisol at normal levels but 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.620
 after 40 from 40 to 45 minutes the 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.930
 cortisol peaks again come back to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.239
 upload which 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.939
 you will have heard that you do not have to train 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.640
 for more than 45 minutes wise 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.060
 words and it's really proven that 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.219
 cortisol after 45 minutes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.650
 increases its state of activity which 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.629
 is going to be in a negative effect if 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.180
 we want to gain muscle mass 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.730
 especially if our diet is not the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.310
 adequate so take into consideration 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.439
 that's a pretty important point if 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.239
 what they want is to gain muscle mass 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.280
 good as general conclusions a 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.220
 increased stress 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.080
 causes an increase in cortisol in the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.630
 moment of increasing cortisol goes to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.300
 promote tissue degradation 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.880
 muscle a way to control what 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.890
 is the stress to be able to be able to 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.830
 control what cortisol is 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.900
 Minimum sleep a minimum of hours 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.819
 recommended that are 8 hours 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.030
 recommended, of course, it's not the same 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.190
 2000 to rest but it is recommended to 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.100
 anyway sleep at least those 8 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.959
 hours avoid consumption avoid the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.260
 excess consumption of beverages 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.959
 energizers and avoid consuming what 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.209
 what is aspartame aspartame is 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.760
 proven that it increases the production of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.330
 compressor whereby the degradation of 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.790
 tissues 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.280
 another point is to eat amino acids 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.440
 essentials and carbohydrates after 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.780
 training practice activities 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.600
 relaxation that is meditation and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.220
 practice yoga etcetera so I hope 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.870
 take into consideration the points 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.350
 that I just commented with a brief 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.890
 video of what stress is like and how 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.510
 has a negative effect on what is 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.710
 this our mass growth 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.319
 muscular 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.660
 so I hope you take it into account if 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.539
 they liked they liked the video les 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.280
 He ordered a little hand up if they think that 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.539
 can help someone else to know 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.639
 a little more about stress and 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.250
 cortisol asked them to share it 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.630
 here below you know you can subscribe and 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.630
 see you in the next saw
