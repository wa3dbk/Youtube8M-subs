00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
might have to start slow in order to

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.870 
might have to start slow in order to
just<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.900> control<00:01:43.650> of<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.610> work<00:01:44.760> your

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
way up in speed that might start a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.840 
way up in speed that might start a
something<00:01:58.620> started<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.920> sound<00:01:59.220> familiar

into a huge traffic jam with the way the
sticking<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.160> designed<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.660> flip

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
sticking is designed so you have to flip

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.120 
sticking is designed so you have to flip
everything<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:37.560> you're<00:02:37.620> going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.830> go<00:02:37.920> this

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
everything if you're going to go this

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.190 
everything if you're going to go this
way<00:02:38.190> instead<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:39.420> starting<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.050> right

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
way instead of starting with the right

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.460 
way instead of starting with the right
hand<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.680> going<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:41.250> left<00:02:41.580> right<00:02:41.850> left

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
hand and going right left right left

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.420 
hand and going right left right left
we'd<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> start<00:02:43.830> with<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.040> left<00:02:44.250> hand

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
we'd have to start with the left hand

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.050 
we'd have to start with the left hand
left<00:02:45.150> right<00:02:45.540> left<00:02:45.570> right<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:47.880> would<00:02:47.940> look

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
left right left right that would look

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.940 
left right left right that would look
like<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.620 

now<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.400> run<00:02:56.550> into<00:02:56.760> trouble<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.360> want<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
now you run into trouble if you want to

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.449 
now you run into trouble if you want to
go<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.050> forth<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.370> to

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
go back and forth because you have to

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.259 
go back and forth because you have to
switch<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.680> good<00:03:01.950> helpful<00:03:02.730> chops

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
switch so a really good helpful chops

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.720 
switch so a really good helpful chops
building<00:03:03.900> variation<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:04.980> exercise<00:03:05.250> is

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
building variation of this exercise is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.229 
building variation of this exercise is
to<00:03:06.390> not<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:07.190> two<00:03:08.190> different<00:03:08.370> hands<00:03:08.910> for<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
to not do two different hands for the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.120 
to not do two different hands for the
quarter<00:03:09.540> notes<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.530> eighth<00:03:10.650> notes<00:03:10.920> are

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
quarter notes so the eighth notes are

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.410 
quarter notes so the eighth notes are
right<00:03:11.790> left

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
right left

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.699 
right left
but<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.989> quarter<00:03:13.230> notes<00:03:13.380> will<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.650> be

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
but then the quarter notes will just be

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.580 
but then the quarter notes will just be
right<00:03:13.739> right<00:03:15.800> one<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.010> two<00:03:17.489> three<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:19.110> sets

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
right right one and two three that sets

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.900 
right right one and two three that sets
you<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:20.010> switch<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.489> over<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> left

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
you up to switch right over to the left

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
you up to switch right over to the left
hand<00:03:21.300> version<00:03:21.510> so<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.920> same

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
hand version so if you do that same

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.040 
hand version so if you do that same
permutation<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.480> where<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.660> go<00:03:24.690> left

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
permutation of it where you go left

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.009 
permutation of it where you go left
right<00:03:25.350> left<00:03:25.590> left<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.480> final<00:03:27.750> note<00:03:27.870> would

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
right left left and the final note would

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.289 
right left left and the final note would
be<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.140> left<00:03:28.380> instead<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.739> a<00:03:28.860> right<00:03:28.890> again<00:03:29.299> then

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
be a left instead of a right again then

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.060 
be a left instead of a right again then
you<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.570> go<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.900> forth<00:03:31.230> right

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
you can just go back and forth right

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.130 
you can just go back and forth right
left<00:03:32.310> right<00:03:32.400> right<00:03:32.790> left<00:03:33.239> right<00:03:33.570> left<00:03:33.690> left

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
left right right left right left left

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.789 
left right right left right left left
right<00:03:34.530> left<00:03:34.799> right<00:03:35.130> right<00:03:36.410> that<00:03:37.410> means<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
right left right right that means in the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.590 
right left right right that means in the
counting<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.280> would<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.489> one<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.970> two<00:03:39.209> three

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
counting it would be one and two three

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.150 
counting it would be one and two three
one<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.260> two<00:03:40.500> three

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
one and two three

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.040 
one and two three
if<00:03:41.640> you<00:03:41.730> look<00:03:41.880> closely<00:03:42.120> at<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.750> realize

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
if you look closely at that you realize

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.840 
if you look closely at that you realize
that<00:03:43.080> you're<00:03:43.319> hitting<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.890> same<00:03:44.160> hand<00:03:44.490> on

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
that you're hitting the same hand on

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.890 
that you're hitting the same hand on
all<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> quarter<00:03:45.420> notes<00:03:45.600> 1<00:03:46.290> &amp;<00:03:46.560> 2<00:03:46.770> 3<00:03:47.340> 1<00:03:47.880> into<00:03:48.390> 3

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
all the quarter notes 1 &amp; 2 3 1 into 3

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.720 
all the quarter notes 1 &amp; 2 3 1 into 3
so<00:03:49.170> when<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.440> fast<00:03:49.830> it's<00:03:50.400> kind<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.610> like

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so when you go fast it's kind of like

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.190 
so when you go fast it's kind of like
you're<00:03:50.880> playing<00:03:51.000> triple<00:03:51.300> strokes<00:03:51.660> or<00:03:52.080> they're

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
you're playing triple strokes or they're

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.340 
you're playing triple strokes or they're
called<00:03:52.350> a<00:03:52.410> French<00:03:52.650> roll<00:03:52.830> -<00:03:53.930> 3<00:03:54.930> strokes<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.260> each

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
called a French roll - 3 strokes on each

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.010 
called a French roll - 3 strokes on each
hand<00:03:55.620> that's<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.340> pretty<00:03:56.730> good<00:03:57.270> chops<00:03:57.600> building

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
hand that's a pretty good chops building

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.780 
hand that's a pretty good chops building
exercise<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:59.130> not<00:03:59.280> something<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.640> you'll

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
exercise it's not something that you'll

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.390 
exercise it's not something that you'll
ever<00:03:59.940> really<00:04:00.360> use<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> lot<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.740> like<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.190> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
ever really use a lot just like that and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.860 
ever really use a lot just like that and
you're<00:04:02.490> playing<00:04:02.730> nobody<00:04:03.390> sits<00:04:03.600> there<00:04:03.750> and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
you're playing nobody sits there and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.600 
you're playing nobody sits there and
does<00:04:04.050> three<00:04:04.560> strokes<00:04:04.740> at<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.980> time<00:04:05.190> over<00:04:05.490> and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
does three strokes at a time over and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.650 
does three strokes at a time over and
over<00:04:05.730> again<00:04:05.820> unless<00:04:06.030> they're<00:04:06.210> trying<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.450> show

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
over again unless they're trying to show

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.970 
over again unless they're trying to show
off<00:04:06.690> but<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.370> great<00:04:08.700> way<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.880> build<00:04:09.120> chops

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
off but it's a great way to build chops

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:25.540 
off but it's a great way to build chops
so<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.100> looks<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.430> this

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.800 

you<00:04:26.550> really<00:04:26.820> start<00:04:27.030> to<00:04:27.060> feel<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.540> one<00:04:27.720> in

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
you really start to feel that one in

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.510 
you really start to feel that one in
your<00:04:27.840> arms<00:04:28.320> more<00:04:28.890> so<00:04:29.010> than<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.220> other<00:04:29.370> one

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
your arms more so than the other one

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.740 
your arms more so than the other one
because<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:29.880> don't<00:04:30.030> get<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.150> break<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.630> just

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
because you don't get a break it's just

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.090 
because you don't get a break it's just
relentless<00:04:30.930> three<00:04:31.320> strokes<00:04:31.500> with<00:04:31.740> each<00:04:31.860> hand

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
relentless three strokes with each hand

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.140 
relentless three strokes with each hand
back<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.970> forth<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.740> anyway<00:04:35.580> that's<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.970> way<00:04:36.120> to

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
back and forth so anyway that's a way to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.720 
back and forth so anyway that's a way to
switch<00:04:36.660> from<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.560> right-handed<00:04:38.190> direction

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
switch from the right-handed direction

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.880 
switch from the right-handed direction
to<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.240> left-handed<00:04:39.720> direction<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.290> an

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
to the left-handed direction so an

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.360 
to the left-handed direction so an
exercise<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:41.580> came<00:04:41.640> up<00:04:41.820> with<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:42.690> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
exercise that I came up with is to do a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.510 
exercise that I came up with is to do a
right-handed

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
right-handed

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.940 
right-handed
Herta<00:04:45.000> on<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.330> on<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.140> drum<00:04:46.290> over<00:04:46.470> here<00:04:46.740> a

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
Herta on the on the drum over here a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.280 
Herta on the on the drum over here a
right-handed<00:04:47.670> hurted<00:04:47.970> here<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.420> right-handed

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
right-handed hurted here a right-handed

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.920 
right-handed hurted here a right-handed
her<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.560> here<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.160> then<00:04:50.910> do<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.690> triple

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
her to here and then do the triple

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.690 
her to here and then do the triple
stroke<00:04:52.200> permutation<00:04:52.980> which<00:04:53.280> changes

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
stroke permutation which changes

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.640 
stroke permutation which changes
directions<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.420> then<00:04:55.080> go<00:04:55.230> back<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.590> other

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
directions and then go back the other

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.830 
directions and then go back the other
way<00:04:55.850> do<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.970> triple<00:04:57.150> stroke<00:04:57.360> permutation

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
way do the triple stroke permutation

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.760 
way do the triple stroke permutation
over<00:04:57.960> here<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.230> can<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.380> kind<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.650> keep

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
over here and you can just kind of keep

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.440 
over here and you can just kind of keep
going<00:04:59.070> back<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.250> forth<00:04:59.460> that'll<00:05:00.270> look<00:05:00.390> like

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
going back and forth that'll look like

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:17.330 
going back and forth that'll look like
this<00:05:00.810> really<00:05:01.350> slowly<00:05:15.650> change<00:05:16.650> directions<00:05:17.220> I

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
this really slowly change directions I

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.080 
this really slowly change directions I
hope<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:18.650> when<00:05:19.650> you<00:05:19.740> speed<00:05:20.010> that<00:05:20.160> up<00:05:20.370> the

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
hope and when you speed that up the

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.180 
hope and when you speed that up the
exercise<00:05:21.300> suddenly<00:05:21.810> becomes<00:05:22.170> a<00:05:22.380> mobility

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
exercise suddenly becomes a mobility

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.910 
exercise suddenly becomes a mobility
around<00:05:23.700> the<00:05:23.820> drum<00:05:24.030> set<00:05:24.270> issue<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.230> not<00:05:25.320> just<00:05:25.380> a

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
around the drum set issue and not just a

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.830 
around the drum set issue and not just a
rudiment<00:05:26.340> chops<00:05:26.640> building<00:05:27.030> issue<00:05:27.210> if<00:05:27.660> you've

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
rudiment chops building issue if you've

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.450 
rudiment chops building issue if you've
got<00:05:27.960> more<00:05:28.170> Tom's<00:05:28.530> or<00:05:28.800> whatever<00:05:29.010> like<00:05:29.160> if<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.340> had

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
got more Tom's or whatever like if I had

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.920 
got more Tom's or whatever like if I had
another<00:05:29.610> floor<00:05:29.880> time<00:05:30.060> over<00:05:30.270> here<00:05:30.510> and<00:05:30.840> a

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
another floor time over here and a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.330 
another floor time over here and a
couple<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.200> rat<00:05:31.320> Tom's<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.800> could<00:05:32.070> just<00:05:32.220> go

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
couple of rat Tom's I could just go

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.590 
couple of rat Tom's I could just go
around<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:32.700> entire<00:05:32.730> drum<00:05:33.210> set<00:05:33.270> change

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
around the entire drum set change

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.480 
around the entire drum set change
directions<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.140> go<00:05:34.260> back<00:05:34.500> here's<00:05:35.400> what

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
directions and go back here's what

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:47.050 
directions and go back here's what
that'll<00:05:35.700> sound<00:05:35.850> like

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.850 

it's<00:05:48.060> just<00:05:48.419> a<00:05:48.599> Chops<00:05:49.020> building<00:05:49.409> rudiment<00:05:49.830> that

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
it's just a Chops building rudiment that

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.610 
it's just a Chops building rudiment that
sounds<00:05:50.430> pretty<00:05:50.580> cool<00:05:50.870> once<00:05:51.870> again<00:05:52.139> you<00:05:52.349> can't

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
sounds pretty cool once again you can't

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.860 
sounds pretty cool once again you can't
overuse<00:05:53.249> it<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:54.029> not<00:05:54.180> gonna<00:05:54.300> sound<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:54.629> cool

overuse it it's not gonna sound so cool

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.379 
overuse it it's not gonna sound so cool
anymore<00:05:55.189> it's<00:05:56.189> only<00:05:56.370> special<00:05:56.819> if<00:05:56.909> you<00:05:56.999> drop<00:05:57.210> it

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 
just want to bring that kind of rhythm

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.119 
just want to bring that kind of rhythm
into<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:06.180> picture<00:06:06.509> and<00:06:06.770> practice<00:06:07.770> putting<00:06:07.949> it

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
into the picture and practice putting it

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:10.309 
into the picture and practice putting it
in<00:06:08.249> there<00:06:08.569> practicing<00:06:09.569> it<00:06:09.749> on<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:10.020> on<00:06:10.169> its

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
in there practicing it on this on its

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.439 
in there practicing it on this on its
own<00:06:10.439> however<00:06:10.939> is<00:06:11.939> gonna<00:06:12.120> be<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.330> way<00:06:12.419> to

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
own however is gonna be the way to

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.730 
own however is gonna be the way to
really<00:06:12.719> build<00:06:12.870> those<00:06:13.080> chops<00:06:13.379> and<00:06:13.590> get

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
really build those chops and get

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.140 
really build those chops and get
additional<00:06:13.979> stick<00:06:14.400> control<00:06:14.729> which<00:06:14.909> is<00:06:14.939> why

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
additional stick control which is why

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.809 
additional stick control which is why
you<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.719> practice<00:06:16.080> rudiments<00:06:16.669> all<00:06:17.669> right

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
you you practice rudiments all right
