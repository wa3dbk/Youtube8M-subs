00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
great because it has nice stiff coils
section<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:38.250> helps<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.640> ripping<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
section which helps with ripping the

curve<00:01:42.900> is<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.470> more<00:01:43.619> flexible<00:01:44.100> feel

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
curve is a little bit more flexible feel

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.170 
curve is a little bit more flexible feel
great

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.830 

and<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.230> coloring<00:01:51.620> it<00:01:51.740> says<00:01:52.690> so<00:01:53.690> how

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
and then the coloring it says so how

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.960 
and then the coloring it says so how
would<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.170> judge<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.710> knife<00:01:54.980> first<00:01:55.460> as<00:01:55.730> many
