00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
underwater so continuing on I've been

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.780 
underwater so continuing on I've been

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
using this case for about three or four

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.390

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
because they just don't really provide

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.250 
because they just don't really provide
that<00:02:53.720> much<00:02:53.900> protection<00:02:54.290> for<00:02:54.650> me<00:02:55.090> but<00:02:56.090> it<00:02:56.900> being
