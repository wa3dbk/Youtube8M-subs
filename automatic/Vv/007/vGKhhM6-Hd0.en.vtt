00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.080
 Hi, people, barbecue, another video, I 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'm here to make a very warning 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 important to you that it is about our 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 channel is the following I was studying and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.720
 So I decided to watch a video and I ended up 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.060
 being in the video very important to give 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 malena 02 02 if you do not know go 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.320
 see her there makes very interesting games 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.879
 I kissed her and she was talking in a video. 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 basically that she needed the help 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.680
 of them to know the type of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.500
 video that they wanted the times of the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.330
 videos and the days of the videos so I go 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 give her a certain age because I 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.559
 I noticed that my channel is also 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 need this help because there are some 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 videos that get more alive than 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.920
 others and I wanted everyone to 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 I liked all of my videos because 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.140
 I do it with a lot of effort is the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.070
 a lot of my time editing and recording 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.960
 these videos 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.030
 So I thought everyone saw him. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.410
 the view is sometimes very 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.479
 different but there is one that has 100 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.340
 a thousand views I 've seen have one more 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830
 Of those who have only six thousand then there 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.259
 big difference then I'll do 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.160
 several polls down here equal to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.840
 Then there will be four skits left 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.090

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.800

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.680
 time 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.439

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.819
 I always put the ten and a half videos of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.609
 morning or Wednesday always stand 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.359
 It is ten thirty in the morning and Sunday 10 and 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.799
 mid-morning 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.859
 sometimes it varies a bit because in the 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.450
 internet instead of help normal but what 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.370

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.290
 to watch because I leave half past ten 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.250
 What do you have all day to watch? 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.189

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.829
 You see an hour like this, you understand. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.230
 and the last poll is of the video type 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.389

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.010
 I'll do it myself, I'll challenge myself with 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.470
 my friends 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.260
