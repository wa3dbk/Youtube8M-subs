00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I think north of the tower going offhand

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.650 
I think north of the tower going offhand
the<00:00:50.579> maps<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> beginning<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> video

the maps at the beginning of the video
but<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.860> should<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> two<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.120> three

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
but it should take you two or three

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.369 
but it should take you two or three
minutes<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.079> using<00:00:55.170> the

with<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:48.899> now<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:50.040> cut<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.970> cut<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
with me right now so I cut it I cut the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.760 
with me right now so I cut it I cut the
video<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> come<00:01:52.079> back<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> power

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
video and I come back through the power

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
video and I come back through the power
of<00:01:52.920> editing<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.700> come<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> second<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
of editing I come back in a second to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.749 
of editing I come back in a second to
you<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.439> an<00:01:55.560> hour<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.920> me<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.670> at

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
you it's more like an hour to me look at

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.179 
you it's more like an hour to me look at
some<00:01:56.880> reason<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> couldn't<00:01:57.299> find<00:01:57.479> alcohol

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
some reason I couldn't find alcohol

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.300 
some reason I couldn't find alcohol
frustrating<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.680> can<00:02:01.680> also<00:02:01.860> upgrade

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
frustrating but you can also upgrade

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.510 
frustrating but you can also upgrade
this<00:02:02.640> thing<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.409> put<00:02:04.409> upgrades<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.219> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this thing you can put upgrades on it to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
this thing you can put upgrades on it to
give<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:05.880> durability<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.659> don't<00:02:07.320> know<00:02:07.409> why

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
give it more durability I don't know why

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
give it more durability I don't know why
you<00:02:07.649> won't<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.069> more<00:02:08.220> power<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.959> durability

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you won't get more power but durability

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.479 
you won't get more power but durability
and<00:02:10.050> handling<00:02:10.530> would<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> great<00:02:11.160> thing<00:02:11.340> to

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and handling would be a great thing to

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.340 
and handling would be a great thing to
do<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.819> guess<00:02:12.510> giving<00:02:12.780> them<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.930> power

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
do I guess giving them a power

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.230 
do I guess giving them a power
be<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.010> for<00:02:14.220> bigger<00:02:14.550> bosses<00:02:15.030> like

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
be even like for bigger bosses like

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.030 
be even like for bigger bosses like
significant<00:02:15.840> game<00:02:16.080> bosses<00:02:16.350> maybe<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.830> don't

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
significant game bosses maybe I don't

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.590 
significant game bosses maybe I don't
know<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:20.100> weapon<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.430> pretty<00:02:20.940> fun<00:02:21.330> I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
know but the weapon is pretty fun I

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.290 
know but the weapon is pretty fun I
landed<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.230> few<00:02:22.350> skill<00:02:22.680> shots<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.670> I

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
landed a few skill shots with it and I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.150 
landed a few skill shots with it and I
kind<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.320> kept<00:02:25.500> them<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.680> here<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.010> guys

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
kind of kept them in here so you guys

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
kind of kept them in here so you guys
could<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.520> them<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.140> next<00:02:28.320> few

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
could see them but I just the next few

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.690 
could see them but I just the next few
minutes<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:28.770> me<00:02:28.980> running<00:02:29.250> around<00:02:29.340> with

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
minutes are just me running around with

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700 
minutes are just me running around with
the<00:02:29.850> thing<00:02:30.080> chopping<00:02:31.080> people<00:02:31.320> up<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> can

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
the thing chopping people up so you can

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.710 
the thing chopping people up so you can
get<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> good<00:02:31.950> idea<00:02:32.070> how<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.460> looks<00:02:32.670> but<00:02:33.300> so

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
get a good idea how it looks but so

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.360 
get a good idea how it looks but so
while<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> few<00:02:34.500> minutes<00:02:34.620> what

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
while I have you for a few minutes what

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
while I have you for a few minutes what
did<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.210> intro<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:37.380> some

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
did you think of the intro for some

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.440 
did you think of the intro for some
reason<00:02:37.980> when<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.550> gets<00:02:38.760> published<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.300> YouTube

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
reason when it gets published on YouTube

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.090 
reason when it gets published on YouTube
it<00:02:39.810> starts<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> become<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.380> pixelated<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
it starts to become really pixelated the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.010 
it starts to become really pixelated the
rest<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.310> videos<00:02:41.580> fine<00:02:41.850> but<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.720> intro

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
rest the videos fine but the intro

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.920 
rest the videos fine but the intro
itself<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.590> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.160> pixelated<00:02:44.820> it's<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
itself is kind of pixelated it's kind of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.390 
itself is kind of pixelated it's kind of
bumming<00:02:46.200> me<00:02:46.320> out<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.650> worked<00:02:46.920> really<00:02:47.070> hard<00:02:47.160> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
bumming me out I worked really hard that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.940 
bumming me out I worked really hard that
intro<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:48.360> meant<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.020> be<00:02:49.110> comedic<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.740> little

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
intro it's meant to be comedic a little

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.210 
intro it's meant to be comedic a little
bit<00:02:50.120> like<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.570> opening<00:02:52.380> scene<00:02:52.620> because

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
bit like that opening scene because

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
bit like that opening scene because
everybody's<00:02:53.820> talking<00:02:53.940> about<00:02:54.120> terrifying<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
