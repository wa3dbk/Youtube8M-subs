00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right so I crashed no big deal I'm

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.030 
all right so I crashed no big deal I'm
just<00:00:03.870> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> kind<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.319> go<00:00:04.529> through<00:00:04.830> here

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
just going to kind of go through here

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.500 
just going to kind of go through here
and<00:00:05.480> change<00:00:06.480> some<00:00:06.690> stuff<00:00:06.839> fast<00:00:07.740> rate<00:00:07.980> or<00:00:08.069> five

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
and change some stuff fast rate or five

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.070 
and change some stuff fast rate or five
go<00:00:09.510> over<00:00:09.690> here<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:09.960> color<00:00:10.290> fill<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.980> object<00:00:11.460> up

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
go over here to color fill the object up

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.509 
go over here to color fill the object up
blah<00:00:13.080> blah<00:00:13.259> blah<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.070> go

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
blah blah blah there we go

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.439 
blah blah blah there we go
and<00:00:15.179> maybe<00:00:15.420> fill<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.809> material<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.410> there

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
and maybe fill that material in there

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.490 
and maybe fill that material in there
okay<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:18.690> I'm<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.020> choose<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> flat

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
okay now I'm going to choose a flat

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.189 
okay now I'm going to choose a flat
brush<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.960> show<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.619> v's<00:00:22.890> are<00:00:24.199> okay

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
brush and show you what you v's are okay

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.589 
brush and show you what you v's are okay
by<00:00:25.590> default<00:00:26.250> what<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.789> doing<00:00:27.150> right<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
by default what I'm doing right here is

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.429 
by default what I'm doing right here is
poly<00:00:28.289> painting<00:00:28.740> onto<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.429> object<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> with

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
poly painting onto the object so with

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
poly painting onto the object so with
lazy<00:00:31.710> mouse<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> want<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> kind<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.180> show<00:00:33.360> you

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
lazy mouse on I want to kind of show you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.760 
lazy mouse on I want to kind of show you
what<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> difference<00:00:34.079> between<00:00:34.140> poly

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
what the difference between poly

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.400 
what the difference between poly
painting<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.780> corresponding<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> texture

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
painting is corresponding to texture

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.780 
painting is corresponding to texture
resolution<00:00:38.059> so<00:00:39.059> let's<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:40.200> take<00:00:40.680> red<00:00:41.460> for

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
resolution so let's just take red for

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.350 
resolution so let's just take red for
example<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:42.989> blue<00:00:43.820> click<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.969> drag<00:00:45.210> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
example now let's blue click and drag it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
example now let's blue click and drag it
across<00:00:45.860> okay<00:00:46.860> right<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.329> has<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
across okay right now this kind of has a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.590 
across okay right now this kind of has a
stair-stepping<00:00:49.350> approach<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.539> until<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
stair-stepping approach right until I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.310 
stair-stepping approach right until I
add<00:00:51.870> another<00:00:52.170> level<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.649> polygons<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.320> now

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
add another level of polygons and now

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.639 
add another level of polygons and now
start<00:00:55.710> painting<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> much

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
start painting on it you see a much

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.119 
start painting on it you see a much
smoother<00:00:59.160> line<00:00:59.480> so<00:01:00.480> poly<00:01:01.050> painting<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
smoother line so poly painting which is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.520 
smoother line so poly painting which is
down<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.699> by<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> way<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.290> poly

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
down here by the way if you see poly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.080 
down here by the way if you see poly
painting<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.010> down<00:01:05.159> by<00:01:05.339> default<00:01:05.700> places

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
painting it down by default places

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.510 
painting it down by default places
colorize<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> turn

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
colorize if it's not that's how you turn

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.480 
colorize if it's not that's how you turn
it<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:09.409> will<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.680> based<00:01:11.460> upon<00:01:11.700> poly<00:01:12.450> resolution

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
it on will is based upon poly resolution

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.890 
it on will is based upon poly resolution
now<00:01:14.689> texture<00:01:15.689> resolution<00:01:15.900> goes<00:01:16.560> much<00:01:17.250> higher

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
now texture resolution goes much higher

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.850 
now texture resolution goes much higher
than<00:01:18.900> poly<00:01:19.500> resolution<00:01:21.439> do<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> see<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
than poly resolution do you see the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
than poly resolution do you see the
difference<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.630> don't<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
difference I don't know it's one of

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
difference I don't know it's one of
those<00:01:25.439> things<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.920> yeah<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
those things that yeah you're going to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.429 
those things that yeah you're going to
see<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> difference<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> actually

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
see the difference if you actually

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.240 
see the difference if you actually
transfer<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.189> over<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.610> texture<00:01:30.030> uh<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
transfer it over to a texture uh if you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.280 
transfer it over to a texture uh if you
get<00:01:32.430> into<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.119> fine<00:01:33.299> stuff<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.170> going

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
get into really fine stuff you're going

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.870 
get into really fine stuff you're going
to<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> start<00:01:35.460> getting<00:01:35.700> into

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
to see it and if you start getting into

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
to see it and if you start getting into
projection<00:01:36.479> master<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.049> course<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.680> going

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
projection master of course you're going

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.469 
projection master of course you're going
to<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:41.700> everything

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to see it but for right now everything

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.469 
to see it but for right now everything
looks<00:01:42.659> also<00:01:42.899> crisp<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> clean<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
looks also crisp and clean now to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.050 
looks also crisp and clean now to
transfer<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> material<00:01:50.610> or

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
transfer or make this into a material or

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.330 
transfer or make this into a material or
texture<00:01:51.689> let's<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> look<00:01:52.920> at<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.220> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
texture let's kind of look at it this

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.749 
texture let's kind of look at it this
way<00:01:53.420> I'm<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.759> scribble

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
way I'm going to kind of just scribble

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.280 
way I'm going to kind of just scribble
on<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> ball<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.140> did

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
on the ball a little bit like I did

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.740 
on the ball a little bit like I did
before<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.579> time<00:01:59.820> I'm<00:02:00.000> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.630> on

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
before this time I'm going to put it on

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.649 
before this time I'm going to put it on
a<00:02:00.780> texture<00:02:01.350> show<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.250> difference<00:02:05.659> okay

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
a texture show you the difference okay

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.459 
a texture show you the difference okay
there<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.259> go

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
there we go

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.610 
there we go
I'll<00:02:07.710> look<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.190> area<00:02:08.429> right<00:02:08.789> here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.509 

okay<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.920> first<00:02:15.099> thing<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> needs<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:16.000> UVs

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
okay the first thing that needs is UVs

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.030 
okay the first thing that needs is UVs
now<00:02:18.519> your<00:02:18.790> UV<00:02:19.209> structure<00:02:19.810> should<00:02:20.290> always<00:02:20.620> kind

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
now your UV structure should always kind

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.119 
now your UV structure should always kind
of<00:02:21.129> match<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:22.120> overall<00:02:22.510> shape<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.799> shape

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
of match your overall shape this shape

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.610 
of match your overall shape this shape
actually<00:02:24.459> go<00:02:24.940> down<00:02:25.209> far<00:02:25.840> enough<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.200> become<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
actually go down far enough to become a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.650 
actually go down far enough to become a
square<00:02:27.750> okay<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.310> certainly<00:02:30.760> wouldn't<00:02:31.330> want

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
square okay so I certainly wouldn't want

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.039 
square okay so I certainly wouldn't want
to<00:02:31.840> make<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.110> v's<00:02:32.560> based<00:02:32.980> on<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> square<00:02:33.610> I

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
to make you v's based on a square I

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.740 
to make you v's based on a square I
would<00:02:35.049> want<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.379> make<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.739> V's<00:02:35.980> based<00:02:36.340> upon

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
would want to make you V's based upon

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.690 
would want to make you V's based upon
something<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.019> this<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.680> more<00:02:39.160> rounded<00:02:39.579> out

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
something like this a more rounded out

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.210 
something like this a more rounded out
shape<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.780> do<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.230> would<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.829> delete

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
shape to do that I would have to delete

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.580 
shape to do that I would have to delete
lower<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:44.280> then<00:02:45.280> go<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.579> to<00:02:45.640> UVs<00:02:46.239> and<00:02:46.540> I<00:02:47.410> can

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
lower and then go down to UVs and I can

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.559 
lower and then go down to UVs and I can
choose<00:02:47.860> what<00:02:48.280> kind<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.549> UV<00:02:48.879> structure<00:02:49.299> I<00:02:49.359> want

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
choose what kind of UV structure I want

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.910 
choose what kind of UV structure I want
I<00:02:49.780> want<00:02:50.049> 2048<00:02:50.799> UVs<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:53.260> kind<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.530> want<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.799> go

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I want 2048 UVs and I kind of want to go

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.890 
I want 2048 UVs and I kind of want to go
through<00:02:54.340> what<00:02:55.030> these<00:02:55.269> do<00:02:56.819> p<00:02:57.819> UV<00:02:57.940> tiles<00:02:58.569> will

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
through what these do p UV tiles will

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.250 
through what these do p UV tiles will
just<00:02:59.140> pack<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.220> Tau<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.819> UV<00:03:01.299> structure<00:03:01.840> over

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
just pack the Tau the UV structure over

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.280 
just pack the Tau the UV structure over
into<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:02.799> smallest<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.579> corners<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.290> utilize

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
into the smallest of corners and utilize

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.690 
into the smallest of corners and utilize
space<00:03:05.790> g<00:03:06.790> UV<00:03:06.940> s<00:03:07.239> well<00:03:08.230> do<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> opposite<00:03:09.129> it'll

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
space g UV s well do the opposite it'll

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780 
space g UV s well do the opposite it'll
actually<00:03:09.879> make<00:03:10.120> big<00:03:10.510> chunks<00:03:11.079> of<00:03:11.260> UVs<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.549> it's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
actually make big chunks of UVs so it's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.970 
actually make big chunks of UVs so it's
easier<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.269> kind<00:03:13.540> of<00:03:13.750> maybe<00:03:14.079> manipulate<00:03:14.859> them

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
easier to kind of maybe manipulate them

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.759 
easier to kind of maybe manipulate them

will use the full resolution so if you

your textures though they're going to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.659 
your textures though they're going to
look<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:45.720> somebody<00:03:46.720> took<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.440> puzzle<00:03:48.190> and

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
look like somebody took a puzzle and

with<00:03:50.859> a<00:03:50.889> dump<00:03:51.220> truck<00:03:51.579> alright<00:03:52.389> so<00:03:53.169> a<00:03:53.410> UV<00:03:54.010> tiles

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
with a dump truck alright so a UV tiles

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.780 
with a dump truck alright so a UV tiles
alright<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.290> now<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.799> have<00:03:56.829> a<00:03:57.010> UV<00:03:57.280> tiles

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
alright so now that I have a UV tiles

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.050 
alright so now that I have a UV tiles
what<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.000> want<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.299> do<00:03:58.419> is<00:03:58.660> choose<00:03:58.989> white<00:03:59.410> and<00:04:00.060> I

want<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.329> go<00:04:01.480> into<00:04:01.709> texture<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.889> choose<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.489> new

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
want to go into texture and choose a new

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.670 
want to go into texture and choose a new
resolution<00:04:04.180> for<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.629> texture<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.410> I<00:04:05.440> want

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
resolution for that texture so I want

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:19.650 
resolution for that texture so I want
2048<00:04:07.590> by<00:04:08.590> 2048<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:13.090> hit<00:04:13.389> new<00:04:14.160> oops

Mac sorry over here I have a new little

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.230 
Mac sorry over here I have a new little
palette<00:04:32.509> called<00:04:33.199> texture<00:04:33.770> map<00:04:33.949> and<00:04:34.160> I<00:04:35.060> can

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
palette called texture map and I can

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.409 
palette called texture map and I can
choose<00:04:35.479> that<00:04:35.509> texture<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.229> I<00:04:36.289> made<00:04:37.150> okay<00:04:38.150> by

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
choose that texture that I made okay by

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.999 
choose that texture that I made okay by
clicking<00:04:38.780> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.960> square<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.259> can<00:04:39.349> go<00:04:39.620> that<00:04:39.800> way

I<00:04:40.220> can<00:04:40.789> a<00:04:40.819> new<00:04:41.060> texture<00:04:41.449> there<00:04:41.720> too<00:04:41.990> that<00:04:42.229> works

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
I can a new texture there too that works

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.790 
I can a new texture there too that works
I<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:44.150> choose<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.599> here<00:04:44.990> because<00:04:45.289> I<00:04:45.620> can

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.070 
I just choose it here because I can
definitely<00:04:46.130> know<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:46.910> is<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.090> 2048<00:04:47.870> map

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
definitely know that that is a 2048 map

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.290 
definitely know that that is a 2048 map
and<00:04:48.380> if<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:49.009> mouse<00:04:49.250> over<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.789> can<00:04:50.030> see<00:04:50.150> the

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
and if I mouse over it you can see the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.570 
and if I mouse over it you can see the
little<00:04:50.509> tiny<00:04:50.720> numbers<00:04:51.289> in<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.530> corner<00:04:51.919> in<00:04:52.430> the

little tiny numbers in the corner in the
upper<00:04:52.880> right<00:04:53.060> hand<00:04:53.090> side<00:04:53.509> this<00:04:53.780> is<00:04:53.840> 2048<00:04:54.710> by

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
upper right hand side this is 2048 by

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.950 
upper right hand side this is 2048 by
2048<00:04:55.610> make<00:04:56.000> sure<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.419> says<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:58.900> okay<00:04:59.900> to

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
2048 make sure that says that okay to

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.110 
2048 make sure that says that okay to
transfer<00:05:00.889> everything<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.759> have<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.270> this<00:05:02.930> layer

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
transfer everything I have on this layer

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.730 
transfer everything I have on this layer
I'll<00:05:05.120> definitely<00:05:05.449> want<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.900> up<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.289> polygons

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
I'll definitely want to up the polygons

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.379 
I'll definitely want to up the polygons
that<00:05:07.090> way<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.120> have<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.389> resolution<00:05:08.780> and<00:05:10.389> then

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
that way I have the resolution and then

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.559 
that way I have the resolution and then
I<00:05:11.659> can<00:05:11.870> toggle<00:05:12.110> back<00:05:12.470> on<00:05:12.680> texture<00:05:13.159> and<00:05:13.340> hit<00:05:14.090> new

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
I can toggle back on texture and hit new

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.589 
I can toggle back on texture and hit new
from<00:05:14.990> poly<00:05:15.229> paint<00:05:16.840> there<00:05:17.840> we<00:05:17.960> go<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:19.449> you<00:05:20.449> can

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
from poly paint there we go and you can

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.070 
from poly paint there we go and you can
see<00:05:20.810> because<00:05:21.289> I've<00:05:21.560> chosen<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:22.190> UV<00:05:22.460> tiles<00:05:23.080> it's

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
see because I've chosen a UV tiles it's

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.180 
see because I've chosen a UV tiles it's
only<00:05:24.320> used<00:05:24.909> one<00:05:25.909> half<00:05:26.509> of<00:05:26.810> it<00:05:27.199> corresponding

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
only used one half of it corresponding

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.640 
only used one half of it corresponding
to<00:05:28.219> whatever<00:05:28.490> shape<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.210> had<00:05:29.449> so<00:05:30.320> I<00:05:30.380> add<00:05:30.620> a

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
to whatever shape I had so I add a

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.820 
to whatever shape I had so I add a
sphere<00:05:31.539> they<00:05:32.539> had<00:05:32.719> a<00:05:32.750> very<00:05:33.050> low<00:05:33.380> polygon

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
sphere they had a very low polygon

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.209 
sphere they had a very low polygon
structure<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:34.669> it's<00:05:35.659> used<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.440> tiles<00:05:37.009> up

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:37.219 
structure and it's used the tiles up

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.540 
structure and it's used the tiles up
here<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.940> utilize<00:05:38.570> only<00:05:38.870> one<00:05:39.349> half<00:05:39.740> of<00:05:39.979> this<00:05:40.190> UV

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
here to utilize only one half of this UV

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.430 
here to utilize only one half of this UV
map<00:05:40.789> for<00:05:41.389> people<00:05:41.690> that<00:05:41.780> are<00:05:41.900> lost<00:05:42.110> right<00:05:42.320> now

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
map for people that are lost right now

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.439 
map for people that are lost right now
trust<00:05:42.979> me<00:05:43.039> that<00:05:43.219> will<00:05:43.340> make<00:05:43.550> sense<00:05:43.849> later<00:05:44.090> on

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
trust me that will make sense later on

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.330 
trust me that will make sense later on
for<00:05:45.169> people<00:05:46.039> that<00:05:46.280> are<00:05:46.400> pros<00:05:46.759> yeah<00:05:47.690> that's

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
for people that are pros yeah that's

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.490 
for people that are pros yeah that's
ridiculous<00:05:49.340> right<00:05:49.669> so<00:05:50.449> if<00:05:50.930> you<00:05:51.199> go<00:05:51.319> in<00:05:51.469> here

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
ridiculous right so if you go in here

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.899 
ridiculous right so if you go in here
and<00:05:52.509> you<00:05:53.509> hit<00:05:53.659> delete<00:05:54.080> lower<00:05:54.490> you'll<00:05:55.490> see<00:05:55.699> that

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:55.909 
and you hit delete lower you'll see that

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.330 
and you hit delete lower you'll see that
when<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.240> do<00:05:56.360> make<00:05:56.750> new<00:05:57.590> UVs

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
when I do make new UVs

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.589 
when I do make new UVs
like<00:05:58.520> AV<00:05:59.120> tiles<00:05:59.360> now<00:05:59.949> and<00:06:00.949> change<00:06:01.280> over<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.759> the

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
like AV tiles now and change over to the

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.870 
like AV tiles now and change over to the
texture<00:06:04.060> then<00:06:05.060> up<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.509> polygons<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.729> then<00:06:07.729> go

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
texture then up the polygons and then go

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.850 
texture then up the polygons and then go
back<00:06:08.120> in<00:06:08.360> here<00:06:08.539> and<00:06:08.630> do<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.870> same<00:06:08.900> thing<00:06:09.440> new

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
back in here and do the same thing new

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.790 
back in here and do the same thing new
from<00:06:10.099> poly<00:06:10.310> paint<00:06:10.900> you<00:06:11.900> can<00:06:12.050> see<00:06:12.229> now<00:06:12.440> it's

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
from poly paint you can see now it's

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.860 
from poly paint you can see now it's
utilized<00:06:13.159> the<00:06:13.699> full<00:06:14.000> UV<00:06:14.509> space<00:06:14.840> so<00:06:15.740> be<00:06:16.009> careful

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
utilized the full UV space so be careful

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.839 
utilized the full UV space so be careful
kind<00:06:17.870> of<00:06:18.020> test<00:06:18.259> this<00:06:18.560> what<00:06:18.830> I<00:06:18.860> just<00:06:19.159> did<00:06:19.400> out<00:06:19.639> on

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
kind of test this what I just did out on

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.600 
kind of test this what I just did out on
your<00:06:20.060> model<00:06:20.479> to<00:06:21.110> see<00:06:21.380> what<00:06:21.740> level<00:06:22.069> looks

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
your model to see what level looks

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.939 
your model to see what level looks
better<00:06:22.849> with<00:06:23.180> your<00:06:23.360> AV<00:06:23.900> tiles<00:06:24.199> if<00:06:24.500> you<00:06:24.650> choose

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
better with your AV tiles if you choose

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.659 
better with your AV tiles if you choose
to<00:06:25.099> do<00:06:25.250> this<00:06:25.430> route<00:06:25.990> before<00:06:26.990> you<00:06:27.110> go<00:06:27.320> on<00:06:27.669> and

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
to do this route before you go on and

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.940 
to do this route before you go on and
you<00:06:28.699> can<00:06:28.940> see<00:06:29.120> now

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
you can see now

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.160 
you can see now
when<00:06:31.950> I<00:06:31.980> go<00:06:32.220> in<00:06:32.370> here<00:06:32.670> and<00:06:32.850> paint<00:06:33.720> you're<00:06:34.140> going

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
when I go in here and paint you're going

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.410 
when I go in here and paint you're going
to<00:06:34.350> see<00:06:34.470> something<00:06:34.680> that's<00:06:35.160> going<00:06:35.550> to<00:06:35.700> happen

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:38.420 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.090 

it's<00:06:39.420> not<00:06:39.600> going<00:06:39.960> to<00:06:40.110> show<00:06:40.290> up<00:06:41.570> why<00:06:42.570> because

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
it's not going to show up why because

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.190 
it's not going to show up why because
you<00:06:44.100> can't<00:06:44.400> paint<00:06:44.850> real-time<00:06:45.480> on<00:06:45.690> the<00:06:45.840> texture

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
you can't paint real-time on the texture

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.790 
you can't paint real-time on the texture
you<00:06:47.190> can<00:06:47.220> only<00:06:47.520> paint<00:06:47.970> real-time<00:06:48.810> on<00:06:49.110> the

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
you can only paint real-time on the

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.550 
you can only paint real-time on the
color<00:06:50.040> paint<00:06:50.400> or<00:06:50.640> the<00:06:50.700> colorized<00:06:51.630> version<00:06:52.350> of

color paint or the colorized version of
ZBrush<00:06:53.070> okay<00:06:54.030> so<00:06:54.870> with<00:06:55.170> texture<00:06:55.590> on<00:06:56.630> nothing

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
ZBrush okay so with texture on nothing

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:09.250 
ZBrush okay so with texture on nothing
zero<00:06:58.800> zip<00:06:59.640> okay<00:07:02.540> with<00:07:03.540> the<00:07:03.750> texture<00:07:04.110> off<00:07:08.000> zero

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
zero zip okay with the texture off zero

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:20.080 
zero zip okay with the texture off zero
zilch<00:07:10.490> nothing<00:07:15.410> this<00:07:16.410> one<00:07:16.650> off<00:07:17.660> there<00:07:18.660> we<00:07:18.930> go

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
zilch nothing this one off there we go

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.730 
zilch nothing this one off there we go
so<00:07:21.090> make<00:07:21.390> sure<00:07:21.420> it's<00:07:21.720> often<00:07:22.200> two<00:07:22.380> different

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
so make sure it's often two different

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:28.010 
so make sure it's often two different
spots<00:07:24.350> pretty<00:07:25.350> sweet<00:07:25.560> huh<00:07:26.270> okay<00:07:27.270> and<00:07:27.570> you<00:07:27.840> can

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 
spots pretty sweet huh okay and you can

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.590 
spots pretty sweet huh okay and you can
kind<00:07:28.440> of<00:07:28.500> get<00:07:28.650> the<00:07:28.770> difference<00:07:29.130> between

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:32.600 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.240 

people<00:07:33.600> that<00:07:33.780> do<00:07:33.930> that<00:07:34.170> and<00:07:34.500> they<00:07:34.890> figure<00:07:35.190> out

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 
people that do that and they figure out

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.520 
people that do that and they figure out
it's<00:07:35.580> not<00:07:35.730> drawing<00:07:36.060> on<00:07:36.360> it<00:07:36.510> until<00:07:36.690> they<00:07:37.350> turn

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530 
it's not drawing on it until they turn

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.880 
it's not drawing on it until they turn
the<00:07:37.650> texture<00:07:38.010> off<00:07:38.160> and<00:07:38.520> voila<00:07:39.210> it's<00:07:39.870> there<00:07:40.170> so

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:40.890 
the texture off and voila it's there so

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.490 
the texture off and voila it's there so
no<00:07:41.100> painting<00:07:41.460> real-time<00:07:41.820> on<00:07:42.030> textures<00:07:42.510> only

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
no painting real-time on textures only

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.950 
no painting real-time on textures only
the<00:07:43.680> actual<00:07:43.980> colorization<00:07:44.490> and<00:07:45.150> that's<00:07:45.780> how

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 
the actual colorization and that's how

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:48.980 
the actual colorization and that's how
to<00:07:46.020> switch<00:07:46.380> it<00:07:46.590> over<00:07:46.710> between<00:07:47.660> the<00:07:48.660> texture

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:48.990 
to switch it over between the texture

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.650 
to switch it over between the texture
and<00:07:49.350> if<00:07:49.980> I<00:07:50.100> just<00:07:50.310> do<00:07:50.460> the<00:07:50.610> poly<00:07:50.820> paint<00:07:51.120> it'll

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 
and if I just do the poly paint it'll

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.780 
and if I just do the poly paint it'll
switch<00:07:52.050> it<00:07:52.230> over<00:07:52.320> to<00:07:52.500> the<00:07:52.740> actual<00:07:53.430> texture

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:53.790 
switch it over to the actual texture

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.580 
switch it over to the actual texture
which<00:07:54.180> you<00:07:54.540> can<00:07:54.690> actually<00:07:54.840> put<00:07:55.230> into<00:07:55.410> a

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:55.590 
which you can actually put into a

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.720 
which you can actually put into a
third-party<00:07:56.190> application<00:07:57.290> all<00:07:58.290> right<00:07:58.730> that

00:07:59.720 --> 00:07:59.730 
third-party application all right that

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.160 
third-party application all right that
being<00:07:59.910> all<00:08:00.120> set<00:08:00.360> let's<00:08:00.630> go<00:08:00.810> onto<00:08:00.960> the<00:08:01.080> next

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.170 
being all set let's go onto the next

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.530 
being all set let's go onto the next
