of<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.150> noggin<00:03:01.510> line<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.989> an<00:03:02.410> excellent<00:03:02.680> way

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
of the noggin line is an excellent way

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.000 
of the noggin line is an excellent way
to<00:03:02.950> build<00:03:03.760> support<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.930> panel<00:03:05.349> eyes<00:03:05.590> wall

to build support on a panel eyes wall

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.009 
to build support on a panel eyes wall
and<00:03:06.700> you<00:03:06.790> can<00:03:06.940> see<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.390> nagging<00:03:07.870> line

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
and you can see that the nagging line

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.319 
and you can see that the nagging line
fits<00:03:08.380> as<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:09.190> cut-off<00:03:09.489> piece<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.910> track<00:03:10.120> right

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
fits as a cut-off piece of track right

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.970 
fits as a cut-off piece of track right
into<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.660> middle<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.170> panelized<00:03:11.680> wall

and the rivet holes are already punched

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.199 
and the rivet holes are already punched
into<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.709> steel<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.340> we<00:03:15.459> know<00:03:15.549> exactly<00:03:15.579> where

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
into the steel so we know exactly where

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.050 
into the steel so we know exactly where
to<00:03:16.810> put<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.079> noggin<00:03:17.410> line<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.880> of<00:03:18.970> the

to put the noggin line one of the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.729 
to put the noggin line one of the
advantages<00:03:19.359> of<00:03:19.690> using<00:03:19.810> super<00:03:20.290> high<00:03:20.410> strength

advantages of using super high strength

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.840 
advantages of using super high strength
steel<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:22.810> by<00:03:23.049> making<00:03:23.260> very<00:03:23.650> straight<00:03:24.069> studs

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.539 

as<00:04:01.840> you<00:04:02.840> can<00:04:02.989> see<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.409> trust<00:04:03.709> on<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.189> end<00:04:04.400> of

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
as you can see the trust on the end of

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.059 
as you can see the trust on the end of
the<00:04:04.640> building<00:04:04.819> is<00:04:05.030> double<00:04:05.540> trust<00:04:06.049> for<00:04:07.040> a

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
the building is double trust for a

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.839 
the building is double trust for a
durability<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.769> this<00:04:10.249> is<00:04:10.280> not<00:04:10.549> going<00:04:10.760> to

durability and this is not going to

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.440 
durability and this is not going to
fall<00:04:10.999> down<00:04:11.030> an<00:04:11.389> alien<00:04:11.599> type<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.049> storm<00:04:13.450> holes

for<00:04:14.719> screwing<00:04:15.019> in<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:16.070> screws<00:04:16.419> are<00:04:17.419> designed

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
for screwing in the screws are designed

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.390 
for screwing in the screws are designed
right<00:04:18.169> into<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:19.479> trusses<00:04:20.479> and<00:04:21.039> they<00:04:22.039> go<00:04:22.220> right

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
right into the trusses and they go right

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
in through the role former so we can

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.300 
in through the role former so we can
speed<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.410> process<00:04:24.560> up<00:04:24.979> during<00:04:25.220> the

speed the process up during the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.210 
speed the process up during the
installation<00:04:25.550> so<00:04:26.090> we're<00:04:26.210> not<00:04:26.949> running<00:04:27.949> holes

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220

cool<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.780> they<00:04:35.990> Greg<00:04:36.169> they<00:04:36.349> put<00:04:36.530> this<00:04:36.620> whole

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
cool and they Greg they put this whole

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.939 
cool and they Greg they put this whole
thing<00:04:36.830> together<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.400> like<00:04:37.550> 15<00:04:38.210> minutes<00:04:38.949> you

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
thing together in like 15 minutes you

thing together in like 15 minutes you
have<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.130> see<00:04:40.250> how<00:04:40.310> fast<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.669> can<00:04:40.729> put<00:04:40.910> together

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
have to see how fast I can put together

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.600 
have to see how fast I can put together
like<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.419> restaurant<00:04:41.900> building<00:04:43.000> unbelievable

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
in the track where to come down and we

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.719 
in the track where to come down and we
insert<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.229> studs<00:05:18.530> into<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.039> nagaland<00:05:19.460> for

insert the studs into the nagaland for

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:21.999 
insert the studs into the nagaland for
more<00:05:20.030> stability<00:05:20.320> now<00:05:21.320> something<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.949> lot

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
more stability now something that a lot

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.770 
more stability now something that a lot
of<00:05:22.159> guys<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.610> construction<00:05:23.090> like<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.360> do<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.630> go

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
of guys in construction like to do is go

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.110 
of guys in construction like to do is go
around<00:05:24.050> and<00:05:24.169> they'll<00:05:24.289> just<00:05:24.500> push<00:05:25.490> these<00:05:25.729> studs

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
around and they'll just push these studs

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.790 
around and they'll just push these studs
in<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.509> bend<00:05:26.720> them<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.050> push<00:05:27.470> them<00:05:27.500> back

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
in and bend them and push them back

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.740 
in and bend them and push them back
because<00:05:28.009> we<00:05:28.340> made<00:05:28.490> of<00:05:28.639> cheap<00:05:28.849> steel<00:05:29.090> these
