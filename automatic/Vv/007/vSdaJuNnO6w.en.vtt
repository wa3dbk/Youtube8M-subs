 Good, once we've done this. 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.260
 We'll have to get the block here and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.050
 to the back so you do not get 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.540

 people will pull the block to the ground has 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.910
 to be video because otherwise 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.829
 it works 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.350

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.329
 Pull to the floor let me show you 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.680

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.510
 I was a victim said toni 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.940
 After we do that, people 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.120
 You'll have to get a launcher and put 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.519
 he is ready here after we 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.250
 do it we'll put a block here 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.890
 on the side with a comparator put the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.650
 buyer that a redstone and a 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.350
 repeater good to repeat here people 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.000

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.900
 here he will launch the block is already 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.370
 working 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.290
 We just need to add one more logo. 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.959
 here on top of 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.569
 they are with islaine and now they are around here 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.950
 We're going to put three blocks, which is 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.870
 this from here 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.239
 Good, now we'll have to leave it alone. 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.130
 this space is empty here and now in 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.160
 up we can have a step which 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.070
 this will do is after the item has 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.650
 that he's going to send a signal over here with 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.370
 the buyer who will hear the piston and will 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.240
 take him to the top so it's basically 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.729
 that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.650
 Good, now I'm going to go to this side of the world. 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.009

 Good thing I can pull the rubber and 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.389
 Remember, you have to be like this. 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.139
 in this direction because otherwise it will not 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.880
 to function 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.680
 and for you to put a 3 whooper 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.289
 other you have to stay tight shift 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.949
 because otherwise you will get access to 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.560

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.720
 I'll put the meat and we'll see it here. 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.789
 underneath is happening 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.159
 Good here, it's baking the meat, it's like 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:43.400
 then you can see them coming here and 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:46.520

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.199
 That's where you can do it. 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:03.050
 A lot of things in your world go away but only
