00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
added for zombies so I kind of took that

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.099 
added for zombies so I kind of took that
as<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.399> yes<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:22.000> does<00:01:22.210> relate<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.750> zombies

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
as a yes this does relate to zombies

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.620 
as a yes this does relate to zombies
this<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.770> not<00:01:23.890> some<00:01:24.189> just<00:01:24.399> random<00:01:24.729> glare<00:01:25.030> but

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
this is not some just random glare but

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.389 
this is not some just random glare but
anyway<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:25.960> noticed<00:01:26.439> that<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:26.680> light<00:01:26.920> doesn't

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
anyway I noticed that this light doesn't

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.279 
anyway I noticed that this light doesn't
exactly<00:01:27.670> look<00:01:28.030> like<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.359> mystery<00:01:28.719> box<00:01:28.929> glow

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
exactly look like the mystery box glow

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.840 
exactly look like the mystery box glow
that<00:01:29.409> we're<00:01:29.560> used<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.130> I'm<00:01:30.460> talking<00:01:30.609> about

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
that we're used to and I'm talking about

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.969 
that we're used to and I'm talking about
the<00:01:31.090> color<00:01:31.329> in<00:01:31.869> every<00:01:32.320> single<00:01:32.530> previous

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
the color in every single previous

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.039 
the color in every single previous
zombies<00:01:33.340> map<00:01:33.520> beside<00:01:33.850> shi<00:01:34.090> no<00:01:34.240> numa<00:01:34.270> this

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
zombies map beside shi no numa this

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.560 
zombies map beside shi no numa this
light<00:01:35.259> has<00:01:35.469> always<00:01:35.950> been<00:01:36.130> blue<00:01:36.399> and<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.820> me<00:01:36.969> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
light has always been blue and to me the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.330 
light has always been blue and to me the
one<00:01:37.689> in<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.899> snapshot<00:01:38.469> looks<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.890> little<00:01:39.159> more

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
one in the snapshot looks a little more

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.459 
one in the snapshot looks a little more
pinkish<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:39.969> I<00:01:40.149> thought<00:01:40.929> you<00:01:40.990> know<00:01:41.109> maybe<00:01:41.289> I'm

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
pinkish so I thought you know maybe I'm

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:42.989 
pinkish so I thought you know maybe I'm
color<00:01:41.710> blind<00:01:41.770> or<00:01:42.100> something<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.670> asked

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
color blind or something and I asked

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:44.550 
color blind or something and I asked
some<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.149> my<00:01:43.240> Twitter<00:01:43.600> followers<00:01:43.810> and<00:01:44.320> how

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
some of my Twitter followers and how

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.139 
some of my Twitter followers and how
these<00:01:44.740> are<00:01:44.979> most<00:01:45.189> of<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.399> answers<00:01:45.549> that<00:01:45.759> I<00:01:45.909> got

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
these are most of the answers that I got

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.940 
these are most of the answers that I got
I'm<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.689> few<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.109> answers<00:01:47.409> but<00:01:47.560> most<00:01:47.799> of

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
I'm a few of the answers but most of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'm a few of the answers but most of
them<00:01:48.039> were<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.369> same<00:01:48.579> as<00:01:48.609> these<00:01:48.999> a<00:01:49.240> lot<00:01:49.749> of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
them were the same as these a lot of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.999 
them were the same as these a lot of
people<00:01:49.960> really<00:01:50.200> think<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.649> it's<00:01:50.770> kind<00:01:50.979> of

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
people really think that it's kind of

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.919 
people really think that it's kind of
purplish<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.700> if<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.090> wasn't<00:01:52.450> enough<00:01:52.630> I

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
purplish and if that wasn't enough I

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:54.300 
purplish and if that wasn't enough I
kind<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.229> took<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.409> time<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.829> compare<00:01:54.100> this

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
kind of took the time to compare this

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.309 
kind of took the time to compare this
light<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.240> ones<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.719> original<00:01:55.869> black

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
light to the ones in the original black

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.809 
light to the ones in the original black
ops<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.770> you<00:01:57.039> can<00:01:57.189> really<00:01:57.399> tell<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.700> difference

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
ops and you can really tell a difference

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.489 
ops and you can really tell a difference
you<00:01:58.179> know<00:01:58.240> it<00:01:58.420> seems<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.719> be<00:01:58.749> that<00:01:58.990> color<00:01:59.259> and

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
you know it seems to be that color and

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.109 
you know it seems to be that color and
that<00:01:59.829> color<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.340> figured<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:00.850> know<00:02:00.939> that's

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
that color so I figured you know that's

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.969 
that color so I figured you know that's
kind<00:02:01.359> of<00:02:01.420> weird<00:02:01.569> kind<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:01.960> odd<00:02:02.140> maybe<00:02:02.710> that

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
kind of weird kind of odd maybe that

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.739 
kind of weird kind of odd maybe that
means<00:02:03.159> something<00:02:03.340> maybe<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.390> means<00:02:04.539> that

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
means something maybe it means that

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.059 
means something maybe it means that
there<00:02:04.869> could<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.020> different<00:02:05.229> variations<00:02:05.950> of

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
there could be different variations of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.980 
there could be different variations of
the<00:02:06.219> mystery<00:02:06.549> box<00:02:06.729> you<00:02:06.999> know<00:02:07.030> I'm<00:02:07.390> imagine<00:02:07.929> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
the mystery box you know I'm imagine the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.150 
the mystery box you know I'm imagine the
original<00:02:08.440> one<00:02:08.530> with<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.770> guns<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
original one with the guns and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.740 
original one with the guns and
everything<00:02:09.250> having<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.880> normal<00:02:10.240> blue<00:02:10.450> glow

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
everything having the normal blue glow

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.510 
everything having the normal blue glow
and<00:02:10.930> being<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.410> location<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.100> map<00:02:12.280> and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and being in one location in the map and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.740 
and being in one location in the map and
maybe<00:02:12.970> another<00:02:13.210> one<00:02:13.420> with

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
maybe another one with

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.630 
maybe another one with
streaks<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.230> machines<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.400> yellow

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
streaks and machines in a with a yellow

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.370 
streaks and machines in a with a yellow
glow<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.030> know<00:02:16.210> I'll<00:02:16.570> probably<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> little

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
glow you know I'll probably be a little

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.380 
glow you know I'll probably be a little
more<00:02:17.560> expensive<00:02:17.860> but<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
more expensive but I think that this the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.390 
more expensive but I think that this the
you<00:02:19.570> know<00:02:19.690> it'd<00:02:19.840> be<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:19.990> decent<00:02:20.410> idea<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:21.310> would

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
you know it'd be a decent idea it would

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.650 
you know it'd be a decent idea it would
definitely<00:02:21.550> switch<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.060> up<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> know<00:02:22.630> I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
definitely switch it up and you know I

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.240 
definitely switch it up and you know I
know<00:02:22.840> this<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.200> just<00:02:23.230> some<00:02:23.530> random<00:02:23.680> prediction

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
know this is just some random prediction

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.070 
know this is just some random prediction
but<00:02:24.670> why<00:02:24.790> not<00:02:25.000> make<00:02:25.210> predictions<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.870> this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
but why not make predictions like this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.270 
but why not make predictions like this
you<00:02:26.410> know<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.710> have<00:02:26.860> much<00:02:26.980> information
