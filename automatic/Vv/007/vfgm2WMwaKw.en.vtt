00:00:01.664 --> 00:00:04.284
 Love advertising? So you've come to the right place. I am Gouri Alfie, 

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:06.415
 And I'll teach you how to be real advertisers, 

00:00:06.575 --> 00:00:07.903
 In 300 simple lessons. 

00:00:08.103 --> 00:00:09.828
 Some? less. in less. 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.628
 Our theme today is the future of advertising. 

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:21.534
 The future of advertising! 

00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.286
 We are now supposed to talk about the future of advertising. 

00:00:26.677 --> 00:00:30.586
 How would you prefer to do that? Now, that means we'll wait, here, 

00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:32.488
 How many years, and we'll see what happens? 

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:34.502
 or... 

00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:38.799
 Just talk about it, theoretically? - I think we'll wait. 

00:00:38.918 --> 00:00:39.908
 OK. 

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:45.258
 In our days, high and tall women are the ideal, 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.665
 But what do you think will be the ideal of beauty in the future? 

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.285
 Wai, can you think of that for a second? -Probably. -OK. 

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.556
 If we think about it long enough, we will reach the future, 

00:00:58.365 --> 00:00:59.526
 Then we'll see for ourselves. 

00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.282
 It is both mechanical and organic, 

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:07.799
 And this is because of global warming. Or there will be an ice age, 

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:09.888
 Then she's ready with the fur, 

00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:13.163
 Or the glaciers will melt, and then, I mean ... 

00:01:13.332 --> 00:01:15.278
 It is suitable for all seasons. - This is suitable for all seasons. 

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:20.666
 In the future, what other names would join Glickman Netler Samsonov, 

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:23.005
 And would it be easy to pronounce them? 

00:01:23.865 --> 00:01:24.617
 No. 

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:26.925
 That's our thing. 

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:29.509
 For us, every name has to be more difficult than the previous one. 

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:33.268
 Is there any possibility that Mizrahi will join you? 

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:35.742
 Oh-ah. Do you know what it does there? 

00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:38.787
 Although it might be nice, let's say Glick ... 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 What are you doing now? Are you skipping to ...? 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.023
 I did not do anything. 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.127
 The Future of Advertising. 

00:01:54.298 --> 00:01:57.777
 The world goes to this place of 3D printers. -Yes. 

00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:01.714
 And in the future we can print everything. So why not publish, in fact, 

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.375
 Just 3D printers, because they do everything? 

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:10.631
 First of all, they do not do everything. - DNA? "Get close to that. 

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:12.041
 DNA is not a problem. DNA ... 

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:14.979
 So you tell me now that I can take my DNA, 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.583
 Put it in a 3D printer, then ... 

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:20.606
 You already know what I'm up to here. 

00:02:20.893 --> 00:02:22.685
 One-on-one action with yourself. 

00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.389
 There was someone like that in Germany who tried to do it. 

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:29.642
 Mengele? -or. 

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.859
 But ... I did not say anything. - With a 3D printer? 

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.983
 Why am I talking to you? I can talk now 

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:36.497
 With a 3D printer. 

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:38.282
 Hello to a 3D printer. 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.996
 Would you say that the human initiative is close to its full potential? 

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.861
 It's a bit strange that you should not work on paper. 

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.459
 Now there's Kat, and we're both with a beard. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.437
 Are you afraid they'll replace you in the future with a robot? 

00:02:54.964 --> 00:02:56.451
 I did not think about it anymore. 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:58.720
 I mean, let's say ... 

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:02.119
 If someone actually looks like you, but she's actually a robot ... 

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:04.576
 That, you will do whatever they ask you to do. I mean, 

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:07.085
 Anything your owner will ask you. 

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:12.857
 Also to be with another robot model. I mean, for advertising purposes, of course. 

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:16.292
 In short, were you prepared for a mad scientist to turn you around? 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.922
 The first robot model in history? 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:21.489
 Wait, no ... what? 

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:24.957
 Correct me if I'm wrong, but the stimuli around us are so big, 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.332
 And the attention and concentration disorders become common ... Is not it worthwhile to start addressing this audience? 

00:03:29.692 --> 00:03:31.889
 Of attention disorders and concentration? 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.495
 Today everyone with ADHD. - That, sorry ... 

00:03:34.663 --> 00:03:36.322
 I really did not understand what you were saying. 

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.705
 I just made an advertisement on this subject. 

00:03:39.888 --> 00:03:42.200
 When you really are ... 

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:44.562
 A crisp kitten. 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.627
 Air conditioners are fun. 

00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:48.676
 the color brown. 

00:03:48.835 --> 00:03:50.215
 Words of wisdom. 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.802
 Love Enter here product name? 

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:58.390
 One more thing: I'd love to put your glasses for a moment. 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:01.228
 please. - that at some point he will also see me looking through it. 

00:04:05.234 --> 00:04:06.212
 Okay, Glass. 

00:04:06.854 --> 00:04:08.326
 Finished an interview. 

00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:10.627
 Kill Yinon.
