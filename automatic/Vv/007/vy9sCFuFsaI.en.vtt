in the middle of the road and I'm out of
red<00:03:34.460> light<00:03:34.670> it'll<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.120> shut<00:03:35.420> off<00:03:35.570> my<00:03:36.040> car

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
red light it'll just shut off my car

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.830 
red light it'll just shut off my car
just<00:03:37.070> shut<00:03:37.430> off<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.910> uh<00:03:38.710> hoping<00:03:39.710> that<00:03:40.840> they'll

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
just shut off and uh hoping that they'll

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.910 
just shut off and uh hoping that they'll
just<00:03:42.110> start<00:03:42.830> back<00:03:42.980> up<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.430> hopefully<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.830> we

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
just start back up so hopefully so we

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.340 
just start back up so hopefully so we
got<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.510> turn<00:03:47.510> back<00:03:47.720> around<00:03:47.930> right<00:03:48.260> here

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
got it and turn back around right here

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.810 
got it and turn back around right here
make<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> u-turn<00:03:48.890> back<00:03:49.220> in<00:03:49.370> front<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.580> my<00:03:49.640> house

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
make a u-turn back in front of my house

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.060 
make a u-turn back in front of my house
and<00:03:50.810> he'll<00:03:50.990> probably<00:03:51.110> see<00:03:51.410> my<00:03:51.590> car's<00:03:51.800> going<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
and he'll probably see my car's going to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.370 
and he'll probably see my car's going to
shut<00:03:52.280> off<00:03:52.430> again<00:03:55.630> so<00:03:56.630> go<00:03:56.810> ahead<00:03:56.870> and<00:03:57.080> park

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
shut off again so go ahead and park

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.140 
shut off again so go ahead and park
right<00:03:57.620> in<00:03:57.740> the<00:03:57.800> middle<00:03:57.980> right<00:03:58.100> there<00:03:58.520> hit<00:03:59.120> the

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
right in the middle right there hit the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.010 
right in the middle right there hit the
curb<00:03:59.420> I'm<00:03:59.900> a<00:04:00.020> dumbass<00:04:00.260> because<00:04:00.740> I'll<00:04:01.250> only<00:04:02.020> not

open<00:04:14.939> this<00:04:15.150> head<00:04:15.360> right<00:04:15.390> here<00:04:28.160> that's<00:04:29.160> making

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
open this head right here that's making

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:40.490 
open this head right here that's making
a<00:04:29.669> weird<00:04:29.910> noise<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:31.740> is<00:04:36.740> now<00:04:37.940> okay<00:04:38.940> well<00:04:39.780> our

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
a weird noise that is now okay well our

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.570 
a weird noise that is now okay well our
circle<00:04:40.889> is

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.990 

I<00:04:46.970> bought<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.090> car<00:04:48.120> from<00:04:49.280> the<00:04:50.280> recirculation

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
I bought the car from the recirculation

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.529 
I bought the car from the recirculation
is<00:04:51.180> out<00:04:51.389> right<00:04:51.599> there<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:52.439> plug<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.979> into<00:04:53.129> the

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
is out right there you plug it into the

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.869 
is out right there you plug it into the
intake<00:04:54.539> she<00:04:54.990> closed<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.889> with<00:04:56.189> that<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.699> did

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
intake she closed it up with that I did

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.270 
intake she closed it up with that I did
 it<00:04:57.419> was<00:04:57.569> probably<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.169> there<00:04:59.069> like<00:04:59.189> a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
 it was probably like a there like a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.869 
 it was probably like a there like a
Listerine<00:04:59.789> cap<00:05:00.169> with<00:05:01.169> glue<00:05:01.469> around<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:02.159> so<00:05:02.729> it

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
Listerine cap with glue around it so it

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.290 
Listerine cap with glue around it so it
wasn't<00:05:03.060> second<00:05:03.449> any<00:05:03.599> more<00:05:03.780> air<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.139> now<00:05:04.289> my

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
wasn't second any more air so now my

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.459 
wasn't second any more air so now my
intake<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.479> mean<00:05:06.629> my<00:05:06.719> bluff<00:05:06.960> Elvis<00:05:07.319> and

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469 
intake I mean my bluff Elvis and

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.429 
intake I mean my bluff Elvis and
recirculated<00:05:08.449> once<00:05:09.449> I<00:05:09.539> get<00:05:09.689> my<00:05:09.810> new<00:05:09.960> I'm<00:05:10.289> gonna

00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:10.439 
recirculated once I get my new I'm gonna

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.980 
recirculated once I get my new I'm gonna
get<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> short<00:05:10.740> RAM<00:05:10.889> intake<00:05:11.189> hopefully<00:05:11.990> pretty

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
get a short RAM intake hopefully pretty

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.529 
get a short RAM intake hopefully pretty
soon<00:05:13.110> if<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:14.129> don't<00:05:14.759> use<00:05:14.879> all<00:05:15.000> my<00:05:15.090> money<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.419> fix

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
maybe it's my clutch that's the reason

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.950 
maybe it's my clutch that's the reason
why<00:05:25.889> my<00:05:25.919> gears<00:05:26.400> aren't<00:05:26.580> catching<00:05:26.789> you<00:05:27.629> know<00:05:27.780> if

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
why my gears aren't catching you know if
