00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
offer plenty protection because it does

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.510 
offer plenty protection because it does

but not too much that it bothers you

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
but not too much that it bothers you
because<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.280> safely<00:00:41.760> survive<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.450> drop

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
because this will safely survive a drop

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
because this will safely survive a drop
and<00:00:44.149> throw<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.360> fine<00:00:45.629> because<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and throw it be fine because all the

itself<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.469> probably<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> thickest<00:00:50.640> part<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
itself is probably the thickest part the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.670

like the shoe and all around the edges

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.170 
like the shoe and all around the edges
is<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.170> tough<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.559> well<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.610> case<00:00:56.850> has<00:00:57.149> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
problem very easily headphone jack is

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.980 
problem very easily headphone jack is
very<00:01:10.100> accessible<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.760> home<00:01:11.970> button<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.630> kind

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
very accessible the home button is kind

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810 
very accessible the home button is kind
of<00:01:13.110> sunken<00:01:13.500> into<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> case<00:01:14.130> but<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> not

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
of sunken into the case but it's not

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
of sunken into the case but it's not
exactly<00:01:15.119> hard<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> reach<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> does<00:01:16.409> feel

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
exactly hard to reach and it does feel

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
exactly hard to reach and it does feel
natural<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.740> switch<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.040> vibrates<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
natural the switch for vibrates as you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
natural the switch for vibrates as you
notice<00:01:21.780> there<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.140> larger<00:01:22.710> gap<00:01:22.890> that's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
notice there is a larger gap that's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.580 
notice there is a larger gap that's
because<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> AT&amp;T<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.750> it's<00:01:25.229> slightly

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
because for the AT&amp;T one it's slightly

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
because for the AT&amp;T one it's slightly
higher<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.250> they<00:01:26.490> factored<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.210> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
higher up so they factored into that so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
higher up so they factored into that so
it<00:01:27.479> works<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.780> both<00:01:27.960> AT&amp;T<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.860> verizon

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it works with both AT&amp;T and verizon

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
it works with both AT&amp;T and verizon
phones<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.119> two<00:01:30.299> volume<00:01:30.750> buttons<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.320> very

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
phones the two volume buttons are very

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
phones the two volume buttons are very
easily<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.310> press<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.540> no<00:01:33.659> problems<00:01:34.049> there

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
easily to press I have no problems there

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319
