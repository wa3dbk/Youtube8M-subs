00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 this is located in the saxon loan 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.270
 between torgau and oschatz there was on 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.519
 weekend the second run to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.200
 German Enduro Championship about 300 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.639
 drivers attached their cross machines 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 the start including the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.870
 title defender Markus transport of sachse 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 has been one of the top drivers for years and years 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.070
 also wanted to be home game necessarily 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.960
 win 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.470
 They master their machines in all 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.050
 lay 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.930
 what the terrain gives is taken 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 and also something on it extra 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 difficulties so it cracks right 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.380
 yes you have to stop exactly women it is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.149
 really only now are ideal 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.469
 track which is grippy if you are one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.140
 bit out you get too much it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.920
 all depends on the smooth floor going 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 stop seconds 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.899
 About 250 kilometers off - road through 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 in it heide marcus swept the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.000
 defending champion with a bad one 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 begin 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 after the prologue he was only fifth 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.750
 on the piste but the top left 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.030
 best times follow and took over the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.590
 tip of the Erzgebirger came in 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 duel with the brandenburger dennis 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.359
 Schröter of the season opener before two 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.659
 Schröter had won weeks now 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.880
 second position behind marcus swept in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.340
 quarry of elvis is rock hard 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.869
 to the point here comes the chase field 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.689
 ever faltering 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.830
 somehow it goes on and on, too 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.560
 if it goes completely wrong 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.870
 derrick görner from adac saxony has become 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.900
 at position three pushed the enduro 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.210
 talent is good over cliffs and edges 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.590
 The driver's perspective shows what it is 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.840
 do not get too wild do it all 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.610
 to rest and a bit of technology 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.140
 so emotionally the whole thing always 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.350
 Wild does not even do that 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.240
 emergency help rule everything on 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.160
 fixed by mud holes provide for 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.230
 the next traffic jam wheels turn 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:57.470
 this is it for some drivers without 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:59.210
 help not to tackle further for the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.729
 Top driver but there is only the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.100
 ideal line marcus sweeping holds place one 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.110
 but it stays close only five seconds 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.700
 separate him from pursuer dennis 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.850
 Schröter who does not shake off 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.040
 lets the two sixdays make pilots 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.170
 the race among themselves from markus kia 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 wins the second run in dahlen 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.890
 german championship before dennis 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 Schröter Derrick Görner drives as 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 third on the podium
