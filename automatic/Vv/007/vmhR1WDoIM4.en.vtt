00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:13.209
Every year, on these beautiful Mexican beaches
in Oaxaca a magical natural event takes place.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:19.710
Baby Olive Ridley turtles pop out of the sand
and waddle towards the ocean in there thousands.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700
It is truly a marvelous sight.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.460
The Olive Ridley Turtle is the smallest species
of sea turtle and in the wild they can live

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.800
up to 50 years.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.890
They are also omnivores, meaning that alongside
eating algae and seaweed they also eat jellyfish,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.350
crabs and shrimp.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.680
Although they are widely considered the most
abundant of the marine turtles, this wasn’t

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.190
always the case.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.360
In the 1970s and '80s, Olive Ridley turtles
were harvested to the brink of extinction.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.760
The meat and eggs were sold as food, whilst
the shells were sold as accessories in the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.850
impoverished region.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.980
Turtle was the second highest selling industry
after shrimp.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.070
But in 1990 this custom was made illegal and
the Mexican government has orchestrated a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.530
remarkable comeback for the sea creatures.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.399
They have established conservation areas and
are paying local residents to protect turtle

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.840
nests.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.649
The Olive Ridley has one of the most extraordinary
nesting habits in the natural world.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.590
Large groups of turtles gather off shore of
nesting beaches.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.959
Then, all at once, vast numbers of turtles
come ashore and nest in what is known as an

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.469
"arribada", which is Spanish for “arrival”

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:41.549
The female turtles lay their eggs on 120 beaches
in Mexico and turtle can lay 100 eggs each.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.709
And after 45 days, thousands of the baby turtles
hatch.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:52.119
But the start of a turtle’s life is dangerous,
as these vulnerable creatures are killed by

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:59.899
natural predators and despite it being illegal,
human hunters seeking their meat and eggs.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.689
These turtles have made it to the water, but
unfortunately only 2% of these turtles will

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:05.729
make it to adulthood.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.479
But, the good news is that the numbers of
Olive Ridley turtles is rising – let’s

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.000
keep up the good work and support turtle conservation
all over the world.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.810
