sections<00:01:50.479> like<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.869> where<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.170> have<00:01:51.320> to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
sections like this where you have to

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.190 
sections like this where you have to
well<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:53.060> from<00:01:53.270> side<00:01:53.540> to<00:01:53.750> side<00:01:53.780> nawlage

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
well go from side to side nawlage

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.719

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
trying to advance higher so that's

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.700 
trying to advance higher so that's
pretty<00:01:59.270> much<00:01:59.420> all<00:01:59.539> you've<00:01:59.689> got<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.810> do<00:02:00.020> go<00:02:00.439> as<00:02:00.680> a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
pretty much all you've got to do go as a

thought<00:02:02.780> about<00:02:02.899> it

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
thought about it

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.989

hit them all and well grabbed on the
wall<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.540> instead<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.120> that

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
wall and instead you don't so that that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.970 
wall and instead you don't so that that
is<00:02:40.690> something<00:02:40.989> good<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> bit<00:02:41.769> where<00:02:41.950> we

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
is something good to be a bit where we

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.979 
is something good to be a bit where we
offer<00:02:42.280> i<00:02:42.400> don't<00:02:42.640> know<00:02:42.819> maybe<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:43.329> my<00:02:43.569> TV

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
offer i don't know maybe it's just my TV

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.900 
offer i don't know maybe it's just my TV
maybe<00:02:44.379> it's<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.709> CHD<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.489> keep<00:02:45.730> hearing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
maybe it's a CHD like I keep hearing

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.630 
maybe it's a CHD like I keep hearing
about<00:02:46.120> boards<00:02:47.049> I<00:02:47.379> don't<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.010> is<00:02:48.160> because

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
about boards I don't think it is because

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.970 
about boards I don't think it is because
well<00:02:49.420> I've<00:02:49.569> led<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> game<00:02:50.110> elsewhere<00:02:50.680> on

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
well I've led the game elsewhere on

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.759 
well I've led the game elsewhere on
other<00:02:51.760> TVs<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.569> just<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.470> see<00:02:53.650> I'm<00:02:53.739> really

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
other TVs and it just to see I'm really

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.819 
other TVs and it just to see I'm really
so<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.629> policy<00:02:56.109> is<00:02:56.200> something<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.530> be<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.650> bit

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
so the policy is something to be a bit

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.589 
so the policy is something to be a bit
worried<00:02:57.040> about<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:57.609> it's<00:02:57.730> not<00:02:57.910> nothing<00:02:58.269> that

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
worried about what it's not nothing that

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.330 
worried about what it's not nothing that
ruins<00:02:59.019> our<00:02:59.170> game<00:02:59.319> or<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.680> fact<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.069> it's<00:03:00.250> just

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
ruins our game or in fact that it's just

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
ruins our game or in fact that it's just
a<00:03:00.609> small<00:03:00.970> hindrance<00:03:02.310> earlier<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.519> saw<00:03:03.819> us
