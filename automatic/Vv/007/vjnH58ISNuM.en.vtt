00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
nineteen to twenty two percent so I was

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.350 
nineteen to twenty two percent so I was
a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.259> shall<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.399> all<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.759> sháá<00:01:29.940> VLT

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
a little shall we in all the sháá VLT

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590 
a little shall we in all the sháá VLT
lon<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> days<00:01:31.850> shall<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.420> the

guess<00:01:37.860> it's<00:01:38.039> all<00:01:38.160> right<00:01:38.630> trainers<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.780> people

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
guess it's all right trainers and people

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.800 
guess it's all right trainers and people
told<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.410> that<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:41.220> sixth<00:01:41.670> bag<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:42.210> show<00:01:42.509> if

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
told me that my sixth bag will show if

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.650 
told me that my sixth bag will show if
I'm<00:01:43.110> down<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.619> ten<00:01:44.009> percent<00:01:44.429> body<00:01:44.610> fat<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
I'm down to ten percent body fat and I

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.760 
I'm down to ten percent body fat and I
think<00:01:45.929> that's<00:01:46.470> pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.009> evil<00:01:48.770> maybe

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
think that's pretty much it evil maybe

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.790 
think that's pretty much it evil maybe
