putting them in I knew they were gonna
be<00:00:39.090> thick<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> didn't<00:00:39.809> know<00:00:39.899> how<00:00:40.020> thick

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
they were gonna be and after they were

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.660 
they were gonna be and after they were
in<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:43.200> hurt<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.680> um<00:00:44.610> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in it was just really hurt and um I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
in it was just really hurt and um I
think<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.590> realized<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.760> them

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
think I realized that I could do them

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240 
think I realized that I could do them
better<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> could<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.710> them<00:00:49.860> smaller

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
better and that I could do them smaller

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
better and that I could do them smaller
and<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.750> decided<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and so that's what I decided to do and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750 
and so that's what I decided to do and
I'm<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.680> happy<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.100> pleased<00:00:53.489> with

braids they were braided at certain

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
braids they were braided at certain
points<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.070> made<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> point<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> twist

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
points but here I made a point to twist

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.550 
points but here I made a point to twist
at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> top<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:13.020> braid<00:01:13.260> all<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.439> way

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
at the top and then braid all the way

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
at the top and then braid all the way
down<00:01:13.970> and<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.420> hundred<00:01:15.750> percent

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
down and that's a hundred percent

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
down and that's a hundred percent
because<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.619> wanted<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:16.950> hair<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.310> more

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
because I just wanted my hair to be more

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
because I just wanted my hair to be more
on<00:01:17.790> hidden<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.420> feel<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.900> wrapped<00:01:19.200> my

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
on hidden I feel like when I wrapped my

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.480 
on hidden I feel like when I wrapped my
hair<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:20.040> um<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.270> yaki<00:01:21.750> after<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.979> put<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
hair with um the yaki after I put the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.270 
hair with um the yaki after I put the
yarn<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.350> noticed<00:01:25.350> immediately<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.070> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
yarn in I noticed immediately that I

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
yarn in I noticed immediately that I
could<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:27.000> certain<00:01:27.270> spots<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:28.020> seeing<00:01:28.200> my

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
could in certain spots I was seeing my

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.219 
could in certain spots I was seeing my
hair<00:01:28.590> poking<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.850> remembered<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.020> for

it<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.479> gonna<00:01:48.659> head<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.290> know

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it is like I'm gonna head now I know

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
it is like I'm gonna head now I know
that<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> hair<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:51.270> applied<00:01:51.930> yet<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that the hair is not not applied yet and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.039 
that the hair is not not applied yet and
that<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:52.890> yarn<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.810> feel

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
that this is just yarn but I just I feel

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
that this is just yarn but I just I feel
infinitely<00:01:55.740> better<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.430> even<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
infinitely better about this even when I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.429 
infinitely better about this even when I
had<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> yarn<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.110> daunting

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
had the yarn in it was really daunting

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.380 
had the yarn in it was really daunting
when<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.100> trying<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> put<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.149> took

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
when I was trying to put it up it took

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
when I was trying to put it up it took
forever<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.930> put<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.040> yarn

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
forever to put it up when I was in yarn

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.789 
forever to put it up when I was in yarn
I'm<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.119> first<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> now<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.649> much

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
I'm the first time and now it's so much

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
I'm the first time and now it's so much
easier<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.460> feel<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
easier and I feel like it's because of

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.119 
easier and I feel like it's because of
the<00:02:06.540> yarn<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> use<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> use<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.469> bulkier<00:02:07.920> yarn

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the yarn I use I use the bulkier yarn

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.449 
the yarn I use I use the bulkier yarn
last<00:02:08.489> time<00:02:08.729> because<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.599> wasn't<00:02:09.750> sure

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
last time because I really wasn't sure

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.699 
last time because I really wasn't sure
about<00:02:11.780> how<00:02:12.780> much<00:02:12.959> yarn<00:02:13.140> out

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
about how much yarn out

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
about how much yarn out
we<00:02:13.890> need<00:02:14.129> till<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.489> give<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.969> desired<00:02:15.299> effect

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
we need till I give it a desired effect

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.000 
we need till I give it a desired effect
and<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.109> didn't<00:02:16.290> even<00:02:16.349> know<00:02:16.500> what<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> desired

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and I didn't even know what the desired

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.380 
and I didn't even know what the desired
effect<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.579> about<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.879> be<00:02:17.969> you<00:02:18.269> know<00:02:18.359> I

22<00:05:06.180> packs<00:05:06.449> of<00:05:06.660> hair<00:05:06.690> at<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.289> dollar<00:05:07.500> 50<00:05:07.919> apiece

22 packs of hair at a dollar 50 apiece

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.180 
22 packs of hair at a dollar 50 apiece
and<00:05:08.699> I'm<00:05:09.330> just<00:05:09.479> really<00:05:09.660> hoping<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:11.009> works

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
and I'm just really hoping that it works

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.150 
and I'm just really hoping that it works
out<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.389> have<00:05:12.539> enough<00:05:12.780> hair<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.860> cover

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
out and I have enough hair to cover

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.550 
out and I have enough hair to cover
these<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:14.789> last<00:05:15.060> time<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.300> had<00:05:15.560> probably

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
these because last time I had probably

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.070 
these because last time I had probably
like<00:05:16.800> half<00:05:17.250> half<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.479> number<00:05:18.780> but<00:05:18.930> they<00:05:19.020> were

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
like half half the number but they were

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.689 
like half half the number but they were
bigger<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:19.650> I'm<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.860> hoping<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.190> like<00:05:20.490> with

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
bigger so I'm just hoping that like with

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.499 
bigger so I'm just hoping that like with
them<00:05:20.849> being<00:05:21.030> smaller

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
them being smaller

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.290 
them being smaller
um<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:22.590> me<00:05:22.860> having<00:05:23.130> your<00:05:23.340> hair<00:05:23.610> for<00:05:23.820> insurance
