now on to the coin making technique I'll

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
now on to the coin making technique I'll
firstly<00:01:25.740> explain<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.280> technique<00:01:26.670> works

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
firstly explain it the technique works

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.399

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
then I will show you how to use it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.140 
then I will show you how to use it
correctly<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.579> players<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.030> do

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
correctly and what kind of players to do

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
correctly and what kind of players to do
with<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.290> look<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.500> some

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
with and then we can look at some

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.590 
with and then we can look at some
examples<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.369> players<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.759> position<00:01:33.240> cards<00:01:33.509> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
examples of players and position cards I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
examples of players and position cards I
picked<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.930> earlier<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.439> hopefully<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.189> can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
picked up earlier and hopefully we can

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.780 
picked up earlier and hopefully we can
sell<00:01:35.520> them<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> profit<00:01:37.280> ok<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
sell them on for a profit ok so the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.819 
sell them on for a profit ok so the
technique<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.329> quite<00:01:39.600> simple<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
technique is quite simple like in the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.100 
technique is quite simple like in the
last<00:01:40.950> episode<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.909> will<00:01:42.329> focus<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.810> players

the particular formation for example as

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
the particular formation for example as
you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.840> we've<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> search<00:01:58.649> criteria

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
for kaka up on the screen and we'll go

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.069 
for kaka up on the screen and we'll go
with<00:02:01.619> 433<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.909> instead<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.420> choosing<00:02:03.600> them<00:02:03.930> as

with 433 but instead of choosing them as
a<00:02:04.140> central<00:02:04.770> mid<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.340> will<00:02:05.460> choose<00:02:05.729> central

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
a central mid we will choose central

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
a central mid we will choose central
attacking<00:02:06.450> mid<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.320> reason<00:02:07.740> we<00:02:07.829> choose<00:02:08.069> this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
attacking mid the reason we choose this

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
attacking mid the reason we choose this
is<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:08.970> many<00:02:09.119> people<00:02:09.599> will<00:02:09.869> be

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
is because not many people will be

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
is because not many people will be
searching<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.739> position<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.310> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
searching this position for this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.580 
searching this position for this
formation<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.420> hopefully<00:02:13.080> we'll<00:02:13.230> pick<00:02:13.410> up<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
formation and hopefully we'll pick up a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.850 
formation and hopefully we'll pick up a
few

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
few

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980

use this on any position right across
the<00:02:37.320> midfield<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.280> works<00:02:38.490> best<00:02:38.760> on<00:02:38.940> right

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
the midfield so it works best on right

popular center midfielders now these are
just<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.450> few<00:02:57.480> examples<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:58.320> positions<00:02:58.830> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
just a few examples of positions and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.100 
just a few examples of positions and
formations<00:02:59.670> but<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.209> find<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:00.660> give<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110
