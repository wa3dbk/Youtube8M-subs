00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 the beauty people make a video here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.769
 just to show which key you 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.679
 exchange you change the steering wheel only 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 The steering wheel is missing the meriva coast then 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.330
 Oh I took it here and I will not show it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.470
 Because it took forever for me to take this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.180
 business 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 then I'll make a video how it's loose 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.760
 But you see those cloves here. 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
 they are the locks that loosen the air bag 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 here o 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 then this steering wheel has this base that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 It's the handle itself, you see. 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.960
 then it has this basis and this unit 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 here that will fit there is what gives the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
 horn horn also does not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 in my case my car has not berg it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.170
 I did I left off but you have 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 to inflate the personnel with airbag 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 Any adjustments typically a one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.199
 Lord who side the contact but in truth 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.440
 that I did I went there and bought this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.629
 air bag here 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.850
 although mine did not get in a hurry 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.479
 good serve for gas test that was about 400 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 with 300 and little in that bag that is the berg 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.180
 She gets the cap on you to drop it has two 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.790
 here behind the wheel one of those 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.939
 side another side sets the key 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.439
 crack in this hole here and force that 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 hang here 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 perhaps it reinforces that's what loose 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.140
 steering wheel let this one out in the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 screw case right 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 this key is the chest and her measure is 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.640
 this is 2020 here is the torque 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.640
 c20 out because you got out it's 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.490
 This one is here to fit and has the touches 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.159
 that it is so that fits in the female 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:53.340
 from here to touches and 20 here is only you 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 pull ratchet to do the loosening here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 Can you get the wheel out? 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 I'm making this video because I 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.140
 I'll put it on my meriva just like 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 test 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.090
 the steering wheel of the cruise the steering wheel of the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.530
 cruise and with the commands 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.970
 many told me you can not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 put the cross here 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.270
 I have them both anyway I'm stubborn even 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.400
 I will put here to see if it even 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 Then I can make another video and if it's only for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.660
 show which key loosens the steering wheel 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.490
 de meriva corsa believes that montana 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.330
 also does not have a mountain but it's all 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.460
 same line 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:34.120
 then I thought you would change it to 20 and 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.720
 20 top box and 20 beauty 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.720
