the<00:02:25.070> LEDs<00:02:25.670> appeal<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.750> us<00:02:26.930> is<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.560> light

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the LEDs appeal to us is the light

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
the LEDs appeal to us is the light
output<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.940> low<00:02:29.180> character<00:02:29.450> which<00:02:29.990> means<00:02:30.230> we

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
output the low character which means we

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.690 
output the low character which means we
can<00:02:30.440> still<00:02:30.860> run<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> lights<00:02:31.430> while

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
can still run all the lights while
