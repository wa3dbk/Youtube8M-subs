00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.100
 New tutorial talk here is how 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.299
 Return to ronda lg 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400
 so you have to get in the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.030
 module now the insurance that the volume button 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.230
 up and from there you connect your cable 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.970
 usb on your computer on your g2 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 So this method is here for anyone 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 back to play igg 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 removed roth 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.630
 who wants to install the kat kit that still 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 You're there on a li-bin day. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 It does not fit any of those here 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.820
 in my case I have to talk about the theater 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.960
 so I want to remove the last one 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.180
 rg prowl 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 so there you will need to download 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.030
 the files with the description that are the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.219
 lg drives 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.460
 the application to install and set up 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 then you are the drives on your pc is 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.899
 compact the folder should open here 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.510
 the application the lg tools open you go 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.350
 leave this option scdma and diaby and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.090
 here you will select yesterday the of bin 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 laden then you select which one you 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
 will want here in my case I'm here and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.609
 I want to stay here so normal that it's for 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 who is already with d'ale jequié only 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.670
 reinstall and have acs for who's with 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.760
 ruth or who has the bad show is 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.799
 back to lg selecting the start goes 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 open this touch screen 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.009
 Then you hope to open the discussion here. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 it will read the information from your 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.650
 smartphone 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.439
 takes a while to fully bloom the ipê 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.320
 is faster but it will appear in the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.450
 window is said that the connection was not 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.000
 possible with your agency's is normal already 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.930
 that the offline lg method blocked the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
 online method 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.869
 but here in g2 starts installing 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.030
 usually as you are seeing there 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.310
 this process and recalled the four 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 minutes but I'm seeing you caught 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.969
 a video is faster 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.429
 so go and report there 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.920
 what version do you have with you is the 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.920
 version you are installing, remembering that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.689
 that message that in red is the 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.270
 title you saw at the beginning of the video 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.729
 it disappears after you install the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.729
 application does a cleanup for you 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.890
 so when it ends here in the pc 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.860
 It's still going to continue the same way there. 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.590
 That screen shows here for you. 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.000
 he goes on to say that the connection is not 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.340
 was possible but deep down there is 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.190
 installing sometimes happens when 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.269
 you have finished installing this 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.519
 error saying that the program stopped 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.459
 answer but no problem this 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.579
 because it has already installed in g2 so there is no 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.989
 problem in this you can come here to close 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.970
 So you can close the program yourself. 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.980
 You will not need it all the more. 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.280
 interaction you make now will-there the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.629
 your two do not be close there come the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.430
 your smartphone 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.530
 hence the first bush it will take 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.940
 a little over here in the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.650
 my case I am accelerating video is more 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.660
 fast 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.280
 so I hope it will fall on the screen 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.290
 configuration is already in a language 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.430
 Portuguese pre-selected jacaúna 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.980
 Brazilian 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.560
 then you will set your password is 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.540
 2 do your google account so I go 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
 skip everything here as it interests me 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.019
 but then you set up your can be the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.819
 name there the smartphone should ask you 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.410
 configured in the code that also popular 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.470
 but then you set your normal 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.860
 choose the end only buttons 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.620
 Then you will enter the street and ask for 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.810
 to install is the LG application 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.680
 so this is good for who is going to transfer 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.420
 files you mark box iboc delay 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.860
 a little and also all accelerated in the 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.720
 four minutes to install the application 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.410
 do not finish 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.440
 you just go back to the home screen at 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.930
 close the windows the tips that appear 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.190
 and there is the standard lg round I go 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.240
 show you 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.400
 in the settings in my case I was 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.470
 here but you can install alibi 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.240
 You can come back from one to the other. 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.530
 it only shows that version 4.4 with 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.600
 two are not there 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.150
 This is the lg wave for anyone 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.430
 remove ruth this process for who is 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.500
 still does not want to wait for the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.880
 everyone at the carrier is the same process 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.920
 you get what you want already in the description 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.390
 install and for those already 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 conquered the world my case was with 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.790
 acm 11 and I came back here quietly 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.590
 for honda cg then same profession and 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.269
 remembering that you liked the video, not 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.590
 forget I did not like it because it helps 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.330
