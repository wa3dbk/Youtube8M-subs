hi<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:01.650> for<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:01.920> video<00:00:02.220> we'll<00:00:02.460> talk<00:00:02.639> about

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hi so for this video we'll talk about

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.440 
hi so for this video we'll talk about
another<00:00:03.149> genetic<00:00:03.689> pattern<00:00:04.370> okay<00:00:05.450> cool

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
another genetic pattern okay cool

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.930 
another genetic pattern okay cool
dominance<00:00:12.049> okay<00:00:13.219> codominance<00:00:14.219> just<00:00:14.820> like

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
dominance okay codominance just like

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.420 
dominance okay codominance just like
incomplete<00:00:15.509> dominance<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:16.430> another

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
incomplete dominance is another

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.590 
incomplete dominance is another
variation<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.150> heredity<00:00:19.430> now<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:21.270> want

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
variation of a heredity now I just want

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.849 
variation of a heredity now I just want
to<00:00:21.660> point<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> code<00:00:22.170> dominance<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
to point out the code dominance and

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.410 
to point out the code dominance and
incomplete<00:00:23.279> dominance<00:00:23.400> are<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:24.119> similar

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
incomplete dominance are very similar

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.259 
incomplete dominance are very similar
very<00:00:24.779> same<00:00:25.140> there<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.490> small<00:00:26.939> slight

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
very same there it's just a small slight

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
very same there it's just a small slight
difference<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.470> definition<00:00:29.330> okay<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.390> i'm

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
difference in the definition okay so i'm

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.319 
difference in the definition okay so i'm
going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.769> show<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.160> example<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:33.120> street

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
going to show you an example the street

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
going to show you an example the street

create the blonde brown spot on the

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.249 
create the blonde brown spot on the
computer<00:01:12.550> so<00:01:13.550> i<00:01:13.580> have<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.330> blue<00:01:14.659> spotted<00:01:14.990> cat

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
computer so i have a blue spotted cat

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.810 
computer so i have a blue spotted cat
instead<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.710> brown<00:01:15.860> instead<00:01:16.190> of<00:01:16.759> black

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
instead of brown instead of black

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.430 
instead of brown instead of black
because<00:01:17.270> i<00:01:17.330> can't<00:01:17.509> use<00:01:17.690> black<00:01:17.990> color<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
because i can't use black color and a

if<00:02:02.740> I<00:02:02.859> talking<00:02:03.310> about<00:02:03.429> incomplete<00:02:03.789> dominance

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
if I talking about incomplete dominance

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.940 
if I talking about incomplete dominance
I'll<00:02:04.179> think<00:02:04.390> about<00:02:04.450> purple<00:02:05.409> spots<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.920> know

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
I'll think about purple spots you know

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.070 
I'll think about purple spots you know
mix<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.369> red<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.640> blue<00:02:06.789> but<00:02:07.750> they<00:02:07.810> don't<00:02:07.990> have

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
mix of red and blue but they don't have

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.289 
mix of red and blue but they don't have
it<00:02:08.319> in<00:02:08.379> this<00:02:08.440> case<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:10.000> they<00:02:10.119> don't

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
it in this case and because they don't

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.660 
it in this case and because they don't
have<00:02:10.360> it<00:02:10.599> it's<00:02:11.290> a<00:02:11.379> situation<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.769> codominance

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
have it it's a situation of codominance

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.339 
have it it's a situation of codominance
when<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.209> two<00:02:13.720> different<00:02:13.959> colored

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
when you have two different colored

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
all done for you guys once again now in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.089 
all done for you guys once again now in
the<00:02:34.599> last<00:02:34.780> video<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.049> forgot<00:02:35.379> one<00:02:36.069> crucial

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
the last video I forgot one crucial

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.280 
the last video I forgot one crucial
element<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.180> guys<00:02:37.420> always<00:02:37.720> must<00:02:38.109> do

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
element that you guys always must do

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.990 
element that you guys always must do
when<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.650> do<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.799> final<00:02:39.040> score<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.609> define

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
when you do a final score is to define

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.610 
when you do a final score is to define
your<00:02:40.900> alleles<00:02:41.310> okay<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.609> i<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.849> cebu<00:02:43.510> CB<00:02:44.379> as

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
your alleles okay so i have cebu CB as

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.770 
your alleles okay so i have cebu CB as

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.199 
blue spotted cats CR as red spotted all
right<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:51.130> an<00:02:51.370> incomplete<00:02:52.060> dominance

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
right just like an incomplete dominance

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.750 
right just like an incomplete dominance
if<00:02:52.599> i<00:02:52.690> mix<00:02:52.900> two<00:02:53.139> heroes<00:02:53.440> i<00:02:53.560> guess<00:02:53.769> i'll<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
if i mix two heroes i guess i'll get the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.780 
if i mix two heroes i guess i'll get the
same<00:02:55.349> results<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.560> got<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.130> genotype<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.549> very

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
same results I got the genotype is very

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.789 
same results I got the genotype is very
similar<00:02:58.049> but<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.109> phenotype<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.650> little

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
similar but a phenotype is a little

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.819 
similar but a phenotype is a little
difference<00:03:00.130> having<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.430> purple<00:03:01.709> excuse<00:03:02.709> me

difference having a purple excuse me
purple<00:03:03.459> spotted<00:03:03.880> cat<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.359> got<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> kind<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> blue

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
purple spotted cat I got a kind of blue

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.940 
purple spotted cat I got a kind of blue
and<00:03:06.069> red<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.870> I'll<00:03:07.870> see<00:03:08.109> how<00:03:08.260> red<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.769> blue

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
and red and I'll see how red and on blue

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.430 
and red and I'll see how red and on blue
one<00:03:09.160> individually<00:03:09.910> but<00:03:10.510> i'd<00:03:10.780> offer<00:03:10.989> perp<00:03:11.260> one

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
one individually but i'd offer perp one

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.900 
one individually but i'd offer perp one
I<00:03:11.590> don't<00:03:11.739> have<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:12.269> blended<00:03:14.489> blended<00:03:15.489> phenotype

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
I don't have a blended blended phenotype

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.129 
I don't have a blended blended phenotype
between<00:03:16.660> red<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:16.959> blue<00:03:17.970> okay<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.720> very<00:03:19.959> very

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
between red and blue okay so very very

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.690 
between red and blue okay so very very
important<00:03:20.769> to<00:03:20.799> know<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:20.980> that's<00:03:21.489> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
important to know that that's the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.270 
important to know that that's the
crucial<00:03:22.060> difference<00:03:22.750> between<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.410> kodama

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
crucial difference between a kodama

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.360 
crucial difference between a kodama
Cinco<00:03:24.700> Dominus<00:03:25.500> codominance<00:03:26.500> have<00:03:27.069> both

Cinco Dominus codominance have both

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.789 
Cinco Dominus codominance have both

probably<00:03:34.690> better<00:03:34.840> word<00:03:35.049> here<00:03:35.230> because<00:03:35.410> it

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
probably better word here because it

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.699 
probably better word here because it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
anyhow I was also point out that violet

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.950 
anyhow I was also point out that violet
right<00:03:48.590> for<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.890> alleles<00:03:49.300> it's<00:03:50.300> best<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.810> write

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
encode ominous genetic patterns because

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.700 
encode ominous genetic patterns because
there<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.060> no<00:03:59.180> recessive<00:03:59.690> going<00:04:00.080> on<00:04:00.200> both<00:04:00.530> of

them are expressed at the same time so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.450 
them are expressed at the same time so
there's<00:04:03.170> no<00:04:03.260> lower<00:04:03.650> case<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:03.950> capitalized

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
and to help alleviate the confusion

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.660 
and to help alleviate the confusion
between<00:04:08.120> having<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.510> SE<00:04:09.110> R<00:04:09.380> by<00:04:10.190> itself<00:04:10.460> you<00:04:10.640> have

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
between having a SE R by itself you have

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.340 
between having a SE R by itself you have
a<00:04:10.790> capital<00:04:11.120> B<00:04:11.360> in<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.570> capital<00:04:11.900> R<00:04:11.990> we<00:04:12.170> very

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
a capital B in the capital R we very

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.660 
a capital B in the capital R we very
confusing<00:04:12.680> because<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.010> wouldn't<00:04:13.220> know<00:04:13.280> what

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
confusing because you wouldn't know what

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.430 
confusing because you wouldn't know what
I'm<00:04:13.760> talking<00:04:13.910> about<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:14.840> we<00:04:15.290> use<00:04:15.410> a

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
I'm talking about so we use a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.490 
I'm talking about so we use a
superscript<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:17.390> help<00:04:17.660> us<00:04:17.780> define<00:04:18.170> shoot<00:04:18.380> them

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
superscript to help us define shoot them

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.920 
superscript to help us define shoot them
so<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> superscript<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.000> would<00:04:20.090> we<00:04:20.180> be<00:04:20.420> four

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
so the superscript you would we be four

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.620 
so the superscript you would we be four
blue<00:04:21.110> and<00:04:21.950> R<00:04:22.130> for<00:04:22.160> red<00:04:23.230> okay<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.550> once<00:04:26.510> again

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
blue and R for red okay so once again

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.600 
blue and R for red okay so once again
the<00:04:26.870> reason<00:04:26.990> why<00:04:27.140> we<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:28.010> superscript

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
the reason why we have the superscript

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.900 
the reason why we have the superscript
is<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.940> not<00:04:29.420> confuse<00:04:29.690> with<00:04:30.140> the<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.580> colors

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
is to not confuse with the the colors

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.610 
is to not confuse with the the colors
and<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:32.750> just<00:04:32.900> uppercase<00:04:33.230> so<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:33.470> don't

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
and we just uppercase so we don't

and we just uppercase so we don't
confuse<00:04:33.860> yourself<00:04:33.980> with<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.340> recessive

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
confuse yourself with the recessive

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.020 
confuse yourself with the recessive
alleles<00:04:36.830> which<00:04:37.250> is<00:04:37.400> there<00:04:37.640> is<00:04:37.730> it<00:04:37.880> anything

alleles which is there is it anything

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.420 
alleles which is there is it anything
you<00:04:38.300> have<00:04:38.990> a<00:04:39.020> capital<00:04:39.620> one<00:04:39.740> slow<00:04:40.070> uppercase

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
you have a capital one slow uppercase

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.120 
you have a capital one slow uppercase
ones<00:04:40.900> because<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.080> demonstrates<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.710> both

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
ones because it demonstrates that both

ones because it demonstrates that both
alleles<00:04:43.520> are<00:04:43.990> are<00:04:46.690> expressed<00:04:48.010> okay<00:04:49.010> and

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
alleles are are expressed okay and

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.830 
alleles are are expressed okay and
that's<00:04:51.200> about<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.070> I'll<00:04:52.160> see<00:04:52.340> you<00:04:52.520> next
