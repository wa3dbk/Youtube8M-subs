00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
again and this last round that I um that

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.800 
again and this last round that I um that
right<00:02:26.230> here<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.800> always<00:02:27.430> rush<00:02:28.210> up<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.660> middle

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
right here I always rush up the middle

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.440 
right here I always rush up the middle
when<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.560> round<00:02:29.620> off<00:02:29.830> is<00:02:30.040> because<00:02:30.450> personally

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
when we round off is because personally

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.660 
when we round off is because personally
I<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.810> not<00:02:31.960> like<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.620> map<00:02:32.830> for<00:02:33.040> knifing<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
I do not like this map for knifing just

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
I do not like this map for knifing just
because<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.150> have<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.510> get<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.840> their<00:02:34.990> side

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
because you have to get to their side

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.080 
because you have to get to their side
and<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.560> almost<00:02:35.860> impossible<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.670> flank<00:02:36.910> them

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and it's almost impossible to flank them

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.870 
and it's almost impossible to flank them
because<00:02:37.870> everybody<00:02:38.380> goes<00:02:38.710> like<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.670> the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
because everybody goes like up the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.130 
because everybody goes like up the
middle<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> left<00:02:40.810> or<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.050> right

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
middle to the left or to the right

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.510 
middle to the left or to the right
there's<00:02:41.530> always<00:02:41.740> somebody<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
there's always somebody going a

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.360 
there's always somebody going a
different<00:02:42.700> way<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.600> know<00:02:43.750> what<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.170> always<00:02:44.710> go
