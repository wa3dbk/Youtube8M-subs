so<00:00:11.019> I<00:00:11.049> want<00:00:11.259> to<00:00:11.290> add<00:00:11.410> some<00:00:11.590> lighting<00:00:11.889> to<00:00:12.099> my

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:12.219 
so I want to add some lighting to my

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.250 
so I want to add some lighting to my
scene<00:00:12.580> I'm<00:00:13.209> going<00:00:13.240> to<00:00:13.389> put<00:00:13.480> an<00:00:13.570> omni<00:00:13.959> light<00:00:14.080> in

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
scene I'm going to put an omni light in

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.189 
scene I'm going to put an omni light in
and<00:00:14.530> I<00:00:15.369> click<00:00:15.639> on<00:00:15.789> my<00:00:15.969> lighting<00:00:16.750> button<00:00:16.990> here

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
and I click on my lighting button here

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.740 
and I click on my lighting button here
and<00:00:17.289> then<00:00:17.410> hit<00:00:17.560> Omni<00:00:17.950> and<00:00:18.849> Omni<00:00:19.450> light<00:00:19.570> it's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
and then hit Omni and Omni light it's

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.029 
and then hit Omni and Omni light it's
good<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:20.050> just<00:00:20.080> kind<00:00:20.470> of<00:00:20.500> throw<00:00:20.680> a<00:00:20.740> light<00:00:20.950> in

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
good to just kind of throw a light in

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.190 
good to just kind of throw a light in
all<00:00:21.130> directions<00:00:21.160> so<00:00:21.910> in<00:00:22.210> my<00:00:22.329> top<00:00:22.599> view<00:00:22.630> I'm

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
all directions so in my top view I'm

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.260 
all directions so in my top view I'm
going<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.439> left-click<00:00:23.680> in<00:00:23.980> there<00:00:24.189> and<00:00:24.369> that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
going to left-click in there and that

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.660 
going to left-click in there and that
locates<00:00:25.630> the<00:00:25.810> light<00:00:25.990> notice<00:00:26.920> it<00:00:27.130> defaults<00:00:27.609> to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
locates the light notice it defaults to

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.210 
locates the light notice it defaults to
the<00:00:27.760> floor<00:00:28.150> here<00:00:28.420> or<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.720> zero<00:00:29.019> elevation<00:00:29.320> so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
the floor here or the zero elevation so

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.009 
the floor here or the zero elevation so
in<00:00:30.310> my<00:00:30.400> front<00:00:30.759> view<00:00:30.849> I<00:00:31.210> just<00:00:31.539> have<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.779> move

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.019 
in my front view I just have to move

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.920 
in my front view I just have to move
that<00:00:32.230> light<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:32.890> put<00:00:33.580> it<00:00:33.670> up<00:00:33.790> towards<00:00:34.570> top<00:00:34.809> of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
that light and put it up towards top of

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.430 
that light and put it up towards top of
the<00:00:34.989> wall<00:00:35.170> there<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:37.600> light<00:00:37.870> again<00:00:38.290> just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
the wall there and this light again just

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.979 
the wall there and this light again just
throws<00:00:38.650> light<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:38.980> all<00:00:39.070> directions<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:40.780> I<00:00:40.839> go

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
throws light in all directions if I go

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.920 
throws light in all directions if I go
to<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.290> modify<00:00:41.829> panel<00:00:42.100> here<00:00:42.760> it's<00:00:43.750> quite<00:00:43.899> a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
to the modify panel here it's quite a

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
to the modify panel here it's quite a
few<00:00:44.140> settings<00:00:44.469> I<00:00:44.559> could<00:00:44.710> change<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.160> light

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
few settings I could change on a light

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.729 
few settings I could change on a light
for<00:00:46.780> an<00:00:46.840> omni<00:00:47.050> light<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.230> want<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.500> turn<00:00:47.590> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
for an omni light I want to turn the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.380 
for an omni light I want to turn the
shadows<00:00:48.160> on<00:00:48.340> and<00:00:48.670> I'm<00:00:48.789> going<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.940> use<00:00:49.090> rate

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
shadows on and I'm going to use rate

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.560 
shadows on and I'm going to use rate
rate<00:00:49.690> shadows<00:00:51.000> always<00:00:52.000> looks<00:00:52.149> more<00:00:52.329> realistic

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
rate shadows always looks more realistic

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.290 
rate shadows always looks more realistic
we<00:00:52.870> have<00:00:53.020> shadows<00:00:53.489> under<00:00:54.489> intensity<00:00:54.969> in<00:00:55.059> color

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
we have shadows under intensity in color

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.510 
we have shadows under intensity in color
here<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.690> multiplier<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.890> intensity<00:00:57.430> of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
here the multiplier is the intensity of

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.250 
here the multiplier is the intensity of
the<00:00:57.609> light<00:00:57.760> if<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.420> wanted<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.690> light<00:00:58.870> dimmer

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
the light if you wanted the light dimmer

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.720 
the light if you wanted the light dimmer
you<00:00:59.440> could<00:00:59.710> put<00:00:59.859> 0.5<00:01:00.309> or<00:01:00.579> 0.75<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:03.399> color

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
you could put 0.5 or 0.75 a little color

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.820 
you could put 0.5 or 0.75 a little color
sample<00:01:04.690> here<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:04.869> could<00:01:05.199> change<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.530> color<00:01:05.740> of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
sample here I could change the color of

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.609 
sample here I could change the color of
the<00:01:06.009> light<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.840> going<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.050> move<00:01:08.170> down<00:01:08.200> now<00:01:08.560> to

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
the light I'm going to move down now to

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.380 
the light I'm going to move down now to
the<00:01:09.009> shadow<00:01:09.310> parameters<00:01:09.970> I'm<00:01:10.210> going<00:01:10.330> to

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
the shadow parameters I'm going to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.590 
the shadow parameters I'm going to
change<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.660> density<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:11.259> about<00:01:11.679> 0.5<00:01:12.600> density

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
change the density to about 0.5 density

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.960 
change the density to about 0.5 density
of<00:01:13.690> 1<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.170> very<00:01:14.530> dark<00:01:14.860> shadow<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.759> I<00:01:15.790> usually

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
of 1 is a very dark shadow so I usually

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.390 
of 1 is a very dark shadow so I usually
take<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.390> density<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.470> lower<00:01:17.740> value<00:01:18.009> and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
take that density to a lower value and

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.550 
take that density to a lower value and
then<00:01:19.150> I'm<00:01:19.330> going<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.540> do<00:01:19.659> a<00:01:19.689> test<00:01:19.990> render<00:01:20.200> here

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
then I'm going to do a test render here

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.190 
then I'm going to do a test render here
so<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:21.460> just<00:01:21.700> clicked<00:01:22.000> on<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.270> render<00:01:22.659> icon

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
so I just clicked on the render icon

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.090 
so I just clicked on the render icon
there<00:01:23.740> teapot<00:01:25.409> just<00:01:26.409> make<00:01:26.590> sure<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.920> light

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
there teapot just make sure the light

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.090 
there teapot just make sure the light
looks<00:01:27.340> good<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:29.259> have<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.530> reposition<00:01:29.770> your

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
looks good you have to reposition your

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.590 
looks good you have to reposition your
lights<00:01:30.310> usually<00:01:30.549> several<00:01:31.000> times<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.479> really

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
lights usually several times to really

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.330 
lights usually several times to really
get<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> shadows<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.560> fall<00:01:32.920> where<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.130> want

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
get the shadows to fall where you want

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.980 
get the shadows to fall where you want
to<00:01:33.520> go

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
to go

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.179 
to go
notice<00:01:34.990> here<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.140> density<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> shadow<00:01:36.009> is

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
notice here the density of the shadow is

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.710 
notice here the density of the shadow is
still<00:01:36.460> pretty<00:01:36.790> high<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.000> don't<00:01:37.329> really<00:01:37.540> want

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
still pretty high I don't really want

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.560 
still pretty high I don't really want
that<00:01:37.810> sharp<00:01:38.409> or<00:01:38.649> that<00:01:38.799> dark<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.340> shadow<00:01:39.610> so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
that sharp or that dark of a shadow so

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.300 
that sharp or that dark of a shadow so
I'm<00:01:40.659> going<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.869> change<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.310> shadow

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
I'm going to change that shadow

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.639 
I'm going to change that shadow
parameter<00:01:42.850> density<00:01:43.299> to<00:01:43.509> be<00:01:43.840> a<00:01:43.990> lower<00:01:44.259> number

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
parameter density to be a lower number

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.210 
parameter density to be a lower number
so<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:46.450> going<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:46.659> change<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:48.130> a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
so I'm going to change that to just a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
so I'm going to change that to just a
point<00:01:48.490> 1<00:01:48.729> and<00:01:49.000> then<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:50.200> render<00:01:50.470> my<00:01:50.590> scene<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
point 1 and then we render my scene so

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.310 
point 1 and then we render my scene so
lighting<00:01:52.600> just<00:01:52.750> like<00:01:52.899> when<00:01:53.049> you're<00:01:53.170> applying

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
lighting just like when you're applying

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.530 
lighting just like when you're applying
materials<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.880> make<00:01:55.000> some<00:01:55.180> changes

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
materials you have to make some changes

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.300 
materials you have to make some changes
to<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.780> parameters<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.680> then<00:01:56.799> look<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.189> your

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
to the parameters and then look at your

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.560 
to the parameters and then look at your
render<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.790> see<00:01:57.909> if<00:01:58.030> it's<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.270> effect<00:01:58.509> that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
render and see if it's the effect that

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.990 
render and see if it's the effect that
you<00:01:58.750> wanted<00:01:59.250> onion<00:02:00.250> lights<00:02:00.430> don't<00:02:00.579> take<00:02:00.820> long

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
you wanted onion lights don't take long

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.520 
you wanted onion lights don't take long
to<00:02:01.180> render<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:01.719> they're<00:02:02.200> good<00:02:02.350> just

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
to render and they're good just

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.679 
to render and they're good just
all-purpose<00:02:03.100> lights<00:02:03.340> they<00:02:04.270> don't<00:02:04.420> do<00:02:04.540> any

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
all-purpose lights they don't do any

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.539 
all-purpose lights they don't do any
radiosity<00:02:05.049> calculations<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.250> they're<00:02:06.369> not<00:02:06.520> a

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
radiosity calculations so they're not a

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.580 
radiosity calculations so they're not a
real<00:02:06.700> advanced<00:02:07.119> type<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.570> light<00:02:07.780> but<00:02:08.440> they're

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
real advanced type of light but they're

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.900 
real advanced type of light but they're
good<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.100> give<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.250> general<00:02:09.700> lighting

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
good to just give you general lighting

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.960 
good to just give you general lighting
and<00:02:10.239> just<00:02:10.479> see<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:10.750> your<00:02:10.840> scene<00:02:11.079> looks<00:02:11.290> like

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and just see what your scene looks like

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.410 
and just see what your scene looks like
so<00:02:12.970> they're<00:02:13.120> good<00:02:13.390> first<00:02:13.720> step<00:02:13.930> for<00:02:14.200> lighting
