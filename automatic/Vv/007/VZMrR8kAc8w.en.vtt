00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.360
 there are two in this room 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.790
 abstract work cycles opposite on the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.239
 one side of the cycle with the title 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.579
 cage and opposite the six-part 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.800
 rhombs in the middle is a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.600
 glass sculpture whose reflections the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.930
 whole room again another 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.640
 dimension gives a particularly impressive 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
 are the reflections that these are the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.649
 arise in this glass sculpture if 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 one walks along her 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.780
 six-part cycle cage is as 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.440
 tribute to the composer john cage too 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.300
 understand 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.509
 john cage has like gerhard richter too 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.520
 by chance a big role was assigned in 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.080
 his compositions gerhard richter 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.119
 works by chance 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.679
 especially in his works he is with 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.440
 The rake creates the squeeze is like a 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:30.840
 large-sized spatula an acrylic glass 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.070
 plate on the surface of the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 canvas the colors together 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 Gerhard Richter works here 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.830
 Strongly by chance, as he gestures 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.539
 Although he can control it very well 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.720
 can not control what is on the 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.000
 Canvas happens like the colors 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 mix together 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.369
 the rate is one of himself 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.020
 designed instrument with that time 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.020
 The 80s starts to work 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.399
 on the opposite side of the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.619
 Cycle Cycle are six works too 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.110
 see who have a rhombic shape 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.650
 they were created in connection with 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.420
 a church the renzo piano in apulia 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.610
 built and became gerhard richter 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.560
 invited for this church life 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.970
 and the stigmatization of the sacred 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.970
 to represent Francis 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.250
 Gerhard Richter has a figurative 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.579
 representation can not realize and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.459
 instead has the abstract works 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.519
 painted as a counterpoint is in this 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.340
 hall to see a seascape 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.370
 from this series because the pieces from the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.500
 Sixties and in which 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.030
 Gerhard Richter in an almost abstract way 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.920
 The landscapes represented 19 72 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.829
 He made a trip to Greenland 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.319
 where he shot numerous photographs 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.090
 had him as a template for his 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.010
 seascapes for the paintings of his 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 have served seascapes
