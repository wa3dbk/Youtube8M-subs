you can see it has ftp info or ear and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.300 
you can see it has ftp info or ear and
it's<00:03:24.340> pretty<00:03:24.580> basic<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.920> pretty<00:03:27.069> good

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
it's pretty basic this is pretty good

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.449 
it's pretty basic this is pretty good
you<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.580> 500<00:03:28.569> 5000<00:03:29.290> megabytes<00:03:29.739> which<00:03:30.220> is

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
you get 500 5000 megabytes which is

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.540 
you get 500 5000 megabytes which is
basically<00:03:31.450> five<00:03:32.260> gigs<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.920> you<00:03:33.090> get<00:03:34.440> three

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
basically five gigs and you get three

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.640 
basically five gigs and you get three
hundred<00:03:36.550> thousand<00:03:37.030> megabytes<00:03:37.420> which<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.140> 300

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
hundred thousand megabytes which is 300

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.170 
hundred thousand megabytes which is 300
gigabytes<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:39.310> bandwidth<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> that's<00:03:42.850> kind<00:03:43.150> of

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
gigabytes of bandwidth so that's kind of

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.470 
gigabytes of bandwidth so that's kind of
cool<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:44.560> shore<00:03:44.829> number<00:03:45.100> URL<00:03:45.850> if<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.329> go

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
cool and the shore number URL if you go

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.350 
cool and the shore number URL if you go
onto<00:03:47.110> your<00:03:47.470> website<00:03:47.560> once<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.640> get<00:03:48.910> it<00:03:49.030> all<00:03:49.180> up

so<00:04:48.470> I<00:04:48.530> don't<00:04:48.710> need<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.160> do<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.810> it's

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
so I don't need to do that and it's

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.200 
so I don't need to do that and it's
going<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.710> in<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.490> cool<00:04:52.670> thing<00:04:52.850> about<00:04:52.880> that

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
going to in the cool thing about that

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.970 
going to in the cool thing about that
using<00:04:53.510> this<00:04:53.660> program<00:04:53.930> as<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.320> checks<00:04:54.740> all<00:04:54.950> the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
using this program as it checks all the

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.680 
using this program as it checks all the
differences<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.850> it<00:04:56.030> only<00:04:56.180> does<00:04:56.510> the

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
differences and it only does the

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.200 
differences and it only does the
differences<00:04:57.200> instead<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.770> reuploading<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.639> so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
differences instead of reuploading it so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.960 
differences instead of reuploading it so
that's<00:04:59.450> pretty<00:04:59.750> cool<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:01.370> you<00:05:01.430> can<00:05:01.760> go<00:05:01.880> ahead

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
they're the best I just think their

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:21.219 
they're the best I just think their
hands<00:06:18.080> on<00:06:18.260> this<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:19.270> if<00:06:20.270> you<00:06:20.479> guys<00:06:20.660> open<00:06:20.960> up<00:06:21.050> I

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
hands on this and if you guys open up I

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.260 
hands on this and if you guys open up I
lib<00:06:22.390> and<00:06:23.390> you<00:06:24.229> go<00:06:24.410> local<00:06:25.160> folder<00:06:25.789> you<00:06:25.970> change

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
lib and you go local folder you change

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.930 
lib and you go local folder you change
it<00:06:26.390> ftp<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.740> doesn't<00:06:28.130> work<00:06:28.250> it<00:06:28.490> has<00:06:28.669> never

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
it ftp this doesn't work it has never

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.760 
it ftp this doesn't work it has never
worked<00:06:29.090> for<00:06:29.510> me<00:06:29.570> so<00:06:30.520> I'll<00:06:31.520> see<00:06:31.760> it<00:06:32.660> says<00:06:32.930> it

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
worked for me so I'll see it says it

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.409 
worked for me so I'll see it says it
works<00:06:33.979> but<00:06:34.340> it<00:06:34.400> doesn't<00:06:34.880> I<00:06:35.000> don't<00:06:35.150> think<00:06:35.210> it

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
works but it doesn't I don't think it

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.380 
works but it doesn't I don't think it
works<00:06:35.630> so<00:06:36.080> I<00:06:36.320> would<00:06:36.860> just<00:06:37.039> use<00:06:37.490> this<00:06:37.789> program<00:06:38.060> I

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
works so I would just use this program I

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.719 
works so I would just use this program I
think<00:06:38.570> it's<00:06:38.660> a<00:06:38.750> lot<00:06:38.930> easier<00:06:39.729> more

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:40.729 
think it's a lot easier more
