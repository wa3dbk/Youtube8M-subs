00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740 
found a video online I'll show that you
could<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.579> use<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> really<00:02:27.180> fine<00:02:27.510> grit

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
could just use a really fine grit

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.199 
could just use a really fine grit
sandpaper<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:29.780> rub<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.319> bare<00:02:31.829> wood

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
sandpaper and rub that in to bare wood

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.110 
sandpaper and rub that in to bare wood
that's<00:02:33.209> exactly<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.810> idea<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.970> cut<00:02:35.970> little

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
stuck in some of the oil in there and

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.030 
stuck in some of the oil in there and
then<00:02:51.980> use<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.690> just<00:02:55.379> rub<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.680> right

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
then use that and just rub that right

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.960 
then use that and just rub that right
into<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.400> Fritz<00:02:57.680> just<00:02:58.680> rub<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.010> right<00:02:59.459> into

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
into the Fritz just rub that right into

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.920 
into the Fritz just rub that right into
