00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
I'm looking at flames that are about

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.300 
I'm looking at flames that are about
twice<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.019> height<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.650> school<00:03:22.920> building

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
twice the height of the school building

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.790 
twice the height of the school building
at<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.730> moment<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.690> looks<00:03:25.140> like<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> school

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
at the moment it looks like the school

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.520 
at the moment it looks like the school
building<00:03:26.100> itself<00:03:26.190> may<00:03:26.790> be<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.000> total<00:03:27.269> loss<00:03:27.600> from

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530

this angle we were literally standing in
the<00:03:32.100> parking<00:03:32.459> lot<00:03:32.610> they<00:03:33.390> were<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.780> matter

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
the parking lot they were just a matter

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.840 
the parking lot they were just a matter
of<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.230> minute<00:03:34.410> before<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> plane<00:03:35.400> went<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.730> the
