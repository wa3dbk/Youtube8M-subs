00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.990 
and she doesn't have her good vision
also<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.380> found<00:03:09.830> out<00:03:10.100> about<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.489> year<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.819> half

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
also I found out about a year and a half

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.910 
also I found out about a year and a half
ago<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.269> she<00:03:11.510> has<00:03:11.690> no<00:03:11.840> back<00:03:12.080> ankles<00:03:12.620> and
