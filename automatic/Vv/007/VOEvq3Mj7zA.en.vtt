course but I think it's a perfect

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480 
course but I think it's a perfect
situation<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.920> he's<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.189> ready<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
situation because if he's not ready to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.580 
situation because if he's not ready to
go<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:12.090> will<00:01:12.360> montgomery<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.290> let<00:01:13.470> him

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
Langford is already the Bears number two

Langford is already the Bears number two
running<00:01:24.360> back<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.930> much

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
running back I don't think was much

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
running back I don't think was much
question<00:01:25.350> about<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> think<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.310> too<00:01:26.340> he's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
question about that I think so too he's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
question about that I think so too he's
got<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.939> breakaway<00:01:27.330> speed<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.200> saw<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> little

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
got that breakaway speed we saw a little

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.899 
got that breakaway speed we saw a little
bit<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.770> today<00:01:28.979> we've<00:01:29.220> heard<00:01:29.400> John<00:01:29.640> Fox

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bit of that today we've heard John Fox

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
bit of that today we've heard John Fox
and<00:01:30.119> Ryan<00:01:30.299> pace<00:01:30.479> both<00:01:30.750> discuss<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.409> beyond

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and Ryan pace both discuss it beyond

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280 
and Ryan pace both discuss it beyond
that<00:01:32.189> he's<00:01:32.579> their<00:01:32.820> guy<00:01:33.060> Ka'Deem<00:01:33.630> Carey<00:01:33.720> isn't

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
that he's their guy Ka'Deem Carey isn't

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
that he's their guy Ka'Deem Carey isn't
sonorous<00:01:34.680> Perry<00:01:34.920> isn't<00:01:35.220> Jacquizz<00:01:35.490> Rodgers<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
sonorous Perry isn't Jacquizz Rodgers is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.219 
sonorous Perry isn't Jacquizz Rodgers is
but<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> believe<00:01:36.509> he's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.140> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
but I believe he's a little bit more of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
but I believe he's a little bit more of
a<00:01:37.290> specialty<00:01:37.680> role<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.310> talked<00:01:38.549> about

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
a specialty role they talked about

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.920 
a specialty role they talked about
Langford's<00:01:39.150> versatility<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.840> be

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
Langford's versatility don't be

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
Langford's versatility don't be
surprised<00:01:40.229> when<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.650> him<00:01:40.740> split<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
surprised when you see him split out in

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.230 
surprised when you see him split out in
the<00:01:41.340> formation<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:42.000> he<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.150> an

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the formation where he has an

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
the formation where he has an
opportunity<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> use<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> speed<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
opportunity to kind of use that speed in

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
opportunity to kind of use that speed in
space<00:01:44.579> he's<00:01:44.850> uh<00:01:44.880> he<00:01:45.210> looks<00:01:45.420> impressive<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
space he's uh he looks impressive and I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.300 
space he's uh he looks impressive and I
think<00:01:46.259> there<00:01:46.409> he's<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> role

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
think there he's going to have a role

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
think there he's going to have a role
right<00:01:47.549> away<00:01:47.759> Kevin<00:01:48.450> fifth<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.960> sixth<00:01:49.229> round

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
right away Kevin fifth and sixth round

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.899 
right away Kevin fifth and sixth round
picks<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.979> locks<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.670> football

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
picks are not locks to make football

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
picks are not locks to make football
teams<00:01:51.329> he<00:01:51.479> would<00:01:51.600> hope<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> Adrian<00:01:52.320> Amos<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
teams he would hope that Adrian Amos and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.130 
teams he would hope that Adrian Amos and
Te'o<00:01:52.890> Fallujah<00:01:53.490> are<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.689> fab<00:01:54.810> illusia

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
Te'o Fallujah are I think fab illusia

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.480 
Te'o Fallujah are I think fab illusia
probably<00:01:55.619> ends<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.860> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> practice<00:01:56.460> squad

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160 
probably ends up on the practice squad
it's<00:01:56.820> hard<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.270> where<00:01:57.420> Adrian<00:01:57.540> Amos<00:01:57.869> fits

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
it's hard to know where Adrian Amos fits

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
it's hard to know where Adrian Amos fits
right<00:01:58.320> now<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> he<00:01:58.979> may<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.549> cornerback

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
right now and he may be more cornerback

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
right now and he may be more cornerback
than<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> safety<00:02:00.630> yeah<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> they<00:02:01.350> love

on other players I think there's a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.390 
on other players I think there's a
