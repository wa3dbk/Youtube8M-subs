00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.650
 38 10120 the intermediate machine of the 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.130
 range tribe farmer mounts boys engines 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.800
 3600 four-cylinder 120 horses in 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.649
 this case a lot of total remission between 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.750
 be 4 interim without anyway of 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.570
 particulate filter or in any case of 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.610
 urea the peculiarity of this lies 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.100
 do it in the engine compartment of the hose e 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.739
 which allows us to have a radiator 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.110
 almost horizontal against the old 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.190
 vertical machine radiator 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.750
 previous deviation that gives the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.679
 possibility of mounting see it here 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.300
 under 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.949
 reversing the standard fan 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.859
 on the car as you see the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.179
 fan driven by hydraulic motor 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.360
 proportional speed regime 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:07.039
 regardless of the engine speed a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.390
 new power core air filter that 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.850
 significantly improves performance 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.560
 engine belongs to the old generation e 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.380
 as you can see the layout of the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.300
 comfortable oil filters then face 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.170
 engine hood that allows easy 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.170
 machine maintenance 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.899
 peculiarities of this machine and 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 the whole blackbird range is the construction 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.729
 of the axles which is an internal project 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.600
 developed over the years it is perfected in 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.030
 this version 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 you can see the advantage of having the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.840
 leveling of the machine frame 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.090
 really works in complete safety 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.950
 also on uneven terrain and also the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.740
 possibility of lateral translation 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.849
 of the frame to place a certain one 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.459
 height of the loads that must be 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.290
 millimetrically positioned in theirs 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.120
 correct location 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.220
 this is one of the combined peculiarities 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.140
 also made classa and reducers a 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.810
 waterfall that came to us to have the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.430
 higher ground clearance on the market 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.430
 act on these machines 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.990
 to the completely new layout 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.460
 inside the cabin corresponds 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.710
 also here a graphic review 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.000
 of the cabin first of all the new intake 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.130
 air for the air system 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.920
 conditioned than lateral compared to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.850
 old marchenko the outpost ur mind 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.130
 fundamental that has a blackbird project 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.050
 at the suspended cabin you see it at four 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.970
 tampons is a cabin that you want a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.280
 operation says tire amedeo 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.340
 short to fear it consists so much in the fact 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.650
 which has a parallelism system 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.600
 front and back that allows you 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.580
 to always have the cabin and that moves 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.470
 in a vertical position then one 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.080
 lateral oscillations in this 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.040
 night position the handbrake 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.230
 automatic that engages all the time 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.880
 that the stain is off or 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 manually by the operator with a 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.200
 button 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.450
 this system of them has been called dss 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.210
 which stands for boom spansion la 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.280
 suspension that allows you to work 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.410
 cushioning all the oscillations that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.160
 affect the machining arm dante 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.160
 typical in agriculture 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.109
 at the rear of the machine 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.310
 you see a very technical term culate 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.319
 lower than many others 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.609
 competition machines that has a 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.010
 big impact on visibility 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.930
 rear of the car a hook of 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.639
 towing a lot of position that allows 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.599
 attack all the weird tools in 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.519
 trade 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.280
 in addition to this it will be available soon 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.810
 a mechanical power take-off therefore with 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.340
 a power yield of 90 percent 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.320
 compared to the nominal power of the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.599
 engine and a series of plants 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.300
 braking then air oil to be able to 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.740
 connect trailers or barrels of any 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.740
 capacity up to 200 quintals
