00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
become Russia sure than that one that's

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.149 
become Russia sure than that one that's
really<00:05:38.659> avoiding<00:05:39.199> paying<00:05:39.470> tax<00:05:39.710> in<00:05:39.830> UK<00:05:40.039> which

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:40.159 
really avoiding paying tax in UK which

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.070 
really avoiding paying tax in UK which
is<00:05:40.280> much<00:05:40.490> higher<00:05:40.819> here<00:05:41.120> than<00:05:41.150> overseas<00:05:41.720> so
