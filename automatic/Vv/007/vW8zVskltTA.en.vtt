you're going to do a rosebud so get a
basic<00:00:10.080> shape<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.769> want<00:00:10.920> an<00:00:11.010> oval<00:00:11.309> for

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
basic shape in you want an oval for

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120 
basic shape in you want an oval for
where<00:00:11.580> your<00:00:11.730> buds<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.130> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
where your buds going to be and a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.599 
where your buds going to be and a
crooked<00:00:14.519> line<00:00:17.000> for<00:00:18.000> your<00:00:18.119> stem<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:20.160> bottom<00:00:20.460> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
crooked line for your stem the bottom of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.840 
crooked line for your stem the bottom of
Rose<00:00:20.939> where<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.869> meets<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> stem<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
Rose where it meets the stem is

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
Rose where it meets the stem is
essentially<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.060> starburst<00:00:24.859> if<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.039> were

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
essentially a starburst if you were

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700 
essentially a starburst if you were
looking<00:00:26.510> if<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.660> were<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> cut<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> Rose<00:00:28.410> off

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
looking if you were to cut the Rose off

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.349 
looking if you were to cut the Rose off
right<00:00:29.250> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.609> stem<00:00:29.820> cut<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> stem

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
right at the stem cut the stem

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.759 
right at the stem cut the stem
completely<00:00:30.810> off<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> look<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.560> from<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
completely off and look at it from the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.170 
completely off and look at it from the
bottom<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.669> would<00:00:32.730> actually<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
bottom you would actually see a

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.869 
bottom you would actually see a
starburst<00:00:33.750> something<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.680> long<00:00:35.399> thin

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
starburst something like this long thin

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
starburst something like this long thin
leaves<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.219> mind<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
leaves so with that in mind just do of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.540 
leaves so with that in mind just do of
course<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> be<00:00:44.160> looking<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
course we're going to be looking at it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.270 
course we're going to be looking at it
from<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> side<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.530> give<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.980> couple

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
from the side so you just give a couple

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.229 
from the side so you just give a couple
of<00:00:47.489> them<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.760> there<00:00:49.100> maybe<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.489> foreshortened

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of them in there maybe one foreshortened

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.650 
of them in there maybe one foreshortened
to<00:00:51.960> show<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.440> more<00:00:52.739> now<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.789> your<00:00:54.090> rosebud

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
to show there more now for your rosebud

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.380 
to show there more now for your rosebud
and<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> course<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> main<00:00:55.860> part<00:00:56.390> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and this of course is the main part you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.889 
and this of course is the main part you
want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:59.030> following<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.149> general<00:01:00.539> oval

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
want to do following your general oval

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.210 
want to do following your general oval
shape<00:01:02.629> basically<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.930> teardrop<00:01:04.470> shape<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.100> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
shape basically a teardrop shape that is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.350 
shape basically a teardrop shape that is
a<00:01:05.630> little<00:01:06.630> curved<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.830> angled<00:01:08.360> get

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a little curved and a little angled get

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.770 
a little curved and a little angled get
another<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.960> its<00:01:10.110> underneath<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:11.780> from

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
another one in its underneath that from

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.149 
another one in its underneath that from
there<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.970> make<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> curved<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:16.159> another

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
there you can make a curved one another

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.530 
there you can make a curved one another
curved<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:19.009> until<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:21.380> entire<00:01:22.380> rosebud

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
curved one until you have entire rosebud

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.070 
curved one until you have entire rosebud
get<00:01:24.540> some<00:01:24.750> shading<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.259> there

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.370 

or<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:31.830> doing<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.220> color<00:01:32.430> you'll

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
or if you're doing it in color you'll

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
or if you're doing it in color you'll
add<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.440> color<00:01:34.800> at<00:01:34.980> that<00:01:35.130> point<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.790> notice

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
add your color at that point you notice

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.690 
add your color at that point you notice
I<00:01:36.120> added<00:01:36.390> extra<00:01:36.510> lines<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.110> show<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
I added extra lines to show the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.070 
I added extra lines to show the
curvature<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.940> each<00:01:39.120> of<00:01:39.330> those<00:01:39.450> petals<00:01:42.080> your

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
curvature of each of those petals your

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.980 
curvature of each of those petals your
stems<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.650> basic<00:01:44.010> shape<00:01:44.750> with<00:01:45.750> little

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
stems just a basic shape with little

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.960 
stems just a basic shape with little
crooks<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.390> because<00:01:48.390> nature<00:01:48.860> natural
