00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.470
 our geek experience of the day 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.460
 and that we are questions you shower you eat yes 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:13.770
 but put there 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.730
 surely separated from 900 400 good 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.730
 let's talk 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:33.910
 I am just this one does not have two men and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.400
 a skirt where you are at five elevators 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.910
 separate women 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.810
 and men 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810
 we are going 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 now 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.760
 how is the capsule 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.530
 so 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.930
 and everything is marked 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.500
 as you can see very minimalist 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.400
 from this door are the showers 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 the water here is not something neutral it's water 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.970
 uses which Brazil 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.200
 of course next 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 competing banker 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.310
 a little bit of May 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.200
 of that little girl 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.310
 the bats 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.800
 also very technological 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.160
 Y 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.600
 basically this is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.940
 this is what it looks like to be here 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.940
 space to stretch me 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.459
 and the space 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.130
 it's like a futuristic roll 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.880
 whoever gets up early helps God but above 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.300
 everything to the early riser does not pay now 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.300
 capsule
