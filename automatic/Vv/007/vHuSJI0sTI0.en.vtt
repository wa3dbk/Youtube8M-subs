00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
fuchsia as well and as you can see it's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
fuchsia as well and as you can see it's
the<00:01:23.010> second<00:01:23.370> one<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:24.120> it's<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.960> bit

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the second one right here so it's a bit

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.710 
the second one right here so it's a bit
darker<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.400> still<00:01:26.700> quite<00:01:27.150> bright<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.480> would

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
darker but still quite bright I would

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.440 
darker but still quite bright I would
say<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.740> go<00:01:28.890> ahead<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.250> hand<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.580> that<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:30.000> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
say to go ahead and hand what that is as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.570 
say to go ahead and hand what that is as
Revlon's<00:01:30.960> lip<00:01:31.860> gloss<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.690> 180<00:01:33.690> pink<00:01:34.230> pop<00:01:34.580> and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
Revlon's lip gloss and 180 pink pop and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.420 
Revlon's lip gloss and 180 pink pop and
it<00:01:36.390> actually<00:01:36.570> matches<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.830> quite<00:01:38.160> well

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
it actually matches it quite well

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
it actually matches it quite well
it's<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.060> again<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:40.050> bright<00:01:40.680> pink<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.160> would

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's a again a very bright pink I would

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's a again a very bright pink I would
say<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.700> lipgloss<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.320> can't<00:01:43.530> go<00:01:43.650> wrong

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
say for lipgloss you just can't go wrong

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.750 
say for lipgloss you just can't go wrong
it's<00:01:44.040> pretty<00:01:44.280> much<00:01:46.400> like<00:01:47.400> that

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
it's pretty much like that

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.150 
it's pretty much like that
and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.120> think<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.660> was<00:01:48.810> about<00:01:48.930> 2/3<00:01:49.500> code<00:01:49.770> so

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
and I think that was about 2/3 code so

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.190 
and I think that was about 2/3 code so
it's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.640> bright<00:01:50.850> pink<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.240> well<00:01:51.420> again<00:01:51.750> most<00:01:52.020> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's a bright pink as well again most of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
it's a bright pink as well again most of
these<00:01:52.290> are<00:01:52.500> actually<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.160> find<00:01:53.580> bright<00:01:53.880> Pink's

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
these are actually I find bright Pink's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
these are actually I find bright Pink's
to<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.510> pretty<00:01:54.900> neutral<00:01:55.380> toned<00:01:55.650> they're<00:01:56.340> not

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to be pretty neutral toned they're not

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640 
to be pretty neutral toned they're not
some<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> baby<00:01:57.750> Pink's<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.230> can<00:01:58.380> tell<00:01:58.530> if

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
some of the baby Pink's you can tell if

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.980 
some of the baby Pink's you can tell if
they're<00:01:58.830> more<00:01:59.070> cool<00:01:59.640> tone<00:01:59.850> or<00:02:00.000> warm<00:02:00.210> toned<00:02:00.450> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
they're more cool tone or warm toned but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.720 
they're more cool tone or warm toned but
definitely<00:02:01.470> this<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.800> these<00:02:02.190> ones<00:02:02.460> are

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
definitely this one these ones are

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.020 
definitely this one these ones are
neutral<00:02:03.500> next<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.370> Jo<00:02:05.970> lip<00:02:06.540> gloss<00:02:06.780> in

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
and I think this is a limited edition

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.140 
and I think this is a limited edition
but<00:04:14.810> it's<00:04:14.960> actually<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:16.549> has<00:04:16.700> a<00:04:16.730> little<00:04:17.030> bit

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
but it's actually a it has a little bit

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.860 
but it's actually a it has a little bit

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
of red in it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.289 
of red in it
but<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.950> would<00:04:19.340> still<00:04:19.489> definitely<00:04:19.760> cost<00:04:20.090> fine

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
but I would still definitely cost fine

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.910
