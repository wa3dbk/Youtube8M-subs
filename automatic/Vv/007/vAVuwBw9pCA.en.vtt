00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
we do this type of training how is it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
we do this type of training how is it
beneficial<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> lizard<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> come<00:00:46.230> over

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
beneficial for a lizard to come over

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
beneficial for a lizard to come over
many<00:00:47.219> where<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.610> ask<00:00:47.789> him<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.450> touch<00:00:48.629> his

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
many where we ask him to to touch his

this is the largest lizard on planet

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.639 
this is the largest lizard on planet
Earth<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.329> day<00:00:57.510> Draco<00:00:57.989> has<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.260> potential

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
Earth so one day Draco has the potential

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.000 
Earth so one day Draco has the potential
to<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.940> ten<00:01:00.600> plus<00:01:01.199> feet<00:01:01.469> long<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> he

to get up to ten plus feet long and he
can<00:01:02.160> wait<00:01:02.399> -<00:01:02.850> maybe<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.510> 300<00:01:04.140> pounds<00:01:04.530> we

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
can wait - maybe even 300 pounds we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.719 
can wait - maybe even 300 pounds we
don't<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.860> how<00:01:05.010> big<00:01:05.189> he's<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.580> get

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
don't know how big he's going to get

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
don't know how big he's going to get
regardless<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:06.869> he's<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.020> full-grown<00:01:07.380> adult

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

we're<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.880> able<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> pick<00:01:09.360> him

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
we're not going to be able to pick him

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
we're not going to be able to pick him
up<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> carry<00:01:10.080> him<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> new<00:01:10.590> area<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.490> let's

say we have to shift them on his exhibit

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
say we have to shift them on his exhibit
it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.400> easier<00:01:14.850> than<00:01:14.939> having<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.270> mess

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it's a lot easier than having to mess

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.940 
it's a lot easier than having to mess
with<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> lizard<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> try<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> shove<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.860> in

with the lizard to try and shove them in
a<00:01:16.979> crate<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.750> tranquilize<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.930> ranking<00:01:19.229> like

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
a crate or tranquilize them ranking like

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
a crate or tranquilize them ranking like
that<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.710> all<00:01:19.860> Martian<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> wave
