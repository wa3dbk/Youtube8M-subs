thing about this mold maker it does pick

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.109 
thing about this mold maker it does pick
up<00:01:26.530> quite<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> bit<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.100> detail<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.940> does<00:01:28.090> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
up quite a bit of detail so it does a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.480 
up quite a bit of detail so it does a
very<00:01:28.210> good<00:01:28.539> job<00:01:28.660> of<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.899> it<00:01:29.680> claims<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.160> it

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
very good job of that it claims that it

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.070 
very good job of that it claims that it
makes<00:01:30.899> flexible<00:01:32.039> push<00:01:33.039> molds<00:01:33.520> which<00:01:34.330> is<00:01:34.539> at

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
makes flexible push molds which is at

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.109 
makes flexible push molds which is at
first<00:01:35.890> when<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.399> comes<00:01:36.550> out<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.789> oven<00:01:36.910> it's

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
first when it comes out of the oven it's

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.859 
first when it comes out of the oven it's
pretty<00:01:37.300> flexible<00:01:37.539> but<00:01:38.380> over<00:01:39.220> time<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:39.729> as<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
pretty flexible but over time it as you

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.359 
pretty flexible but over time it as you
can<00:01:41.020> see<00:01:41.170> like<00:01:41.259> I'm<00:01:41.410> squeezing<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.190> it's

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
can see like I'm squeezing this and it's

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.450 
can see like I'm squeezing this and it's
not<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:42.850> flexible<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:44.890> probably<00:01:45.160> wouldn't

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
not as flexible so I probably wouldn't

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.969 
not as flexible so I probably wouldn't
recommend<00:01:45.600> using<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:46.810> kind<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.140> mold<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.590> mean

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
recommend using this kind of mold I mean

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.279 
recommend using this kind of mold I mean
it<00:01:48.100> still<00:01:48.520> does<00:01:49.149> its<00:01:49.300> job<00:01:49.390> but<00:01:49.780> it's<00:01:49.899> if<00:01:50.140> you're

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
it still does its job but it's if you're

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.590 
it still does its job but it's if you're
looking<00:01:50.560> for<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> flexible<00:01:51.310> mold<00:01:51.550> this<00:01:52.360> is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
looking for a flexible mold this is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.050 
looking for a flexible mold this is
probably<00:01:53.110> not<00:01:53.200> your<00:01:53.289> best<00:01:53.380> option<00:01:53.849> this<00:01:54.849> is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
probably not your best option this is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.059

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
it kind of looks like clay it's pretty

it's<00:02:04.390> soft<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:05.020> very<00:02:05.319> easy<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.709> work

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
it's soft and it's very easy to work

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's soft and it's very easy to work
with

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
with

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.699 
with
so<00:02:06.819> just<00:02:07.450> like<00:02:07.569> any<00:02:07.690> mold<00:02:08.020> maker<00:02:08.200> all<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.560> got

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so just like any mold maker all you got

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.080 
so just like any mold maker all you got
to<00:02:08.800> do<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.340> kind<00:02:09.520> of<00:02:09.550> like<00:02:09.610> roll<00:02:09.849> this<00:02:09.940> up

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
to do is just kind of like roll this up

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.720 
to do is just kind of like roll this up
into<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.360> ball<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.899> then<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:12.190> take<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.580> object

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
into a ball and then you take the object

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.400 
into a ball and then you take the object
that<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> want<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.510> make<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> mold<00:02:13.959> out<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> and

that you want to make a mold out of and
you<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.800> push<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.670> remove<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
you just like push it in remove the

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.559 
you just like push it in remove the
object<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.770> want<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.280> take<00:02:18.569> this

condition so that's the one thing that's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.940 
condition so that's the one thing that's
very<00:02:59.300> good<00:02:59.630> about<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.020> as<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.890> mentioned

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
very good about this as I mentioned

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.100 
very good about this as I mentioned
before<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.640> cons<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.180> using<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.780> sculpey

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
before the cons of using the sculpey

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.020 
before the cons of using the sculpey
mold<00:03:03.320> maker<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:04.010> over<00:03:04.250> time<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.610> molds<00:03:04.880> will

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
mold maker that over time the molds will

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.520 
mold maker that over time the molds will
get<00:03:05.150> stiff<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.660> will<00:03:05.870> no<00:03:05.959> longer<00:03:06.140> be<00:03:06.380> as

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
get stiff and will no longer be as

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.070 
get stiff and will no longer be as
flexible<00:03:06.770> then<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.510> was<00:03:08.870> first

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
flexible then like when it was first

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.400 
flexible then like when it was first
made<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.620> will<00:03:10.190> compare<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.660> sculpey<00:03:12.200> mold

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
made I will compare the sculpey mold

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.610 
made I will compare the sculpey mold
maker<00:03:12.940> mold<00:03:13.940> which<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.140> right<00:03:15.320> here<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
maker mold which is this right here and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.020 
maker mold which is this right here and
a<00:03:16.610> mold<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.420> made<00:03:18.110> using<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.430> amazing<00:03:19.730> mold

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
a mold I made using the amazing mold

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.240 
a mold I made using the amazing mold
putty<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.980> one<00:03:22.130> with

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
putty and you can see that the one with

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.220 
putty and you can see that the one with
the<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.940> mold<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.570> I<00:03:23.600> made<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:23.959> amazing

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
the the mold that I made with amazing

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.710 
the the mold that I made with amazing
mold<00:03:24.470> putty<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:25.670> lot<00:03:25.850> flexible<00:03:26.360> because

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
mold putty it's a lot flexible because

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.430 
mold putty it's a lot flexible because
it's<00:03:27.050> almost<00:03:27.800> like<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.900> this<00:03:30.020> rubbery

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
it's almost like like this rubbery

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.979 
it's almost like like this rubbery
silicone<00:03:31.100> feel<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:33.820> then<00:03:34.820> compared<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.630> this

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
silicone feel and then compared to this

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.410 
silicone feel and then compared to this
one<00:03:36.290> made<00:03:36.890> out<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.370> skull<00:03:37.910> Pia<00:03:38.090> mold<00:03:38.239> maker

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
one made out of the skull Pia mold maker

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.190 
one made out of the skull Pia mold maker
it's<00:03:39.230> not<00:03:39.560> flexible<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.180> kind<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.450> hard

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
it's not flexible and it's kind of hard

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.979 
it's not flexible and it's kind of hard
to<00:03:42.320> like<00:03:43.280> push<00:03:43.519> around<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:44.360> if<00:03:44.570> you<00:03:44.660> do<00:03:44.780> push

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
to like push around and if you do push

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.240 
to like push around and if you do push
around<00:03:45.110> hard<00:03:45.350> enough<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.680> will<00:03:45.830> start<00:03:45.890> to

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
around hard enough it will start to

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.810 
around hard enough it will start to
crack<00:03:47.470> which<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.500> probably<00:03:49.400> not<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.580> good<00:03:49.760> thing

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
crack which is probably not a good thing

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.800 
crack which is probably not a good thing
so<00:03:52.030> that's<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.420> give<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> little

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
so that's just to give you a little

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.440 
so that's just to give you a little
comparison<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.650> an<00:03:54.709> idea<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.250> what<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.180> mold

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
comparison and an idea of what this mold
