off and the water stops falling from the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.330 
off and the water stops falling from the
ceiling<00:01:59.750> that's<00:02:00.750> pretty<00:02:00.990> much<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.619> visual

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
ceiling that's pretty much the visual

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.959 
ceiling that's pretty much the visual
aspects<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> saw<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.740> long<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.759> likes

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
aspects of it I saw how long he likes

you also have these cocoa beans that act

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.310 
you also have these cocoa beans that act
like<00:02:31.590> an<00:02:31.770> artificial<00:02:32.130> light<00:02:32.400> source

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
panic button here so in case you do get

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.290

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that button and opens up the doors now I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.530 
that button and opens up the doors now I
guess<00:02:58.860> um<00:02:59.190> if<00:02:59.459> he<00:02:59.730> were<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.090> build<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.390> he

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
guess um if he were to build this he

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.790 
guess um if he were to build this he
would<00:03:00.660> need<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> see<00:03:01.020> how<00:03:01.170> everything<00:03:01.590> works

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
would need to see how everything works

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.790 
would need to see how everything works
but<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.970> understand<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:03.810> Jeremy<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.739> probably

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
but I understand like Jeremy is probably

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.949 
but I understand like Jeremy is probably
ten<00:03:05.280> times<00:03:05.310> better<00:03:05.640> than<00:03:05.760> me<00:03:05.910> at<00:03:06.000> Redstone<00:03:06.390> so

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
ten times better than me at Redstone so

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.410 
ten times better than me at Redstone so
you<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.170> probably<00:03:07.530> come<00:03:07.920> back<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.580> much

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
you can probably come back this and much

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.110 
you can probably come back this and much
better<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.190> signals<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.880> travel

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
better so you have signals that travel

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.600 
better so you have signals that travel
down<00:03:12.450> from<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.750> pressure<00:03:12.959> plates<00:03:13.320> into<00:03:13.610> the

down from the pressure plates into the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.690 
down from the pressure plates into the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
zone is these redsnow inputs which

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.810 
zone is these redsnow inputs which
activate<00:03:18.299> these<00:03:21.920> how<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:22.980> Redstone<00:03:23.519> break

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
activate these how the Redstone break

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.780 
activate these how the Redstone break
OSS<00:03:24.480> matter<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:25.739> rom<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.310> sends<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.610> signal

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
OSS matter the rom it sends a signal

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.380 
OSS matter the rom it sends a signal

it goes into this post limiter I've

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.080 
it goes into this post limiter I've
designed<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.280> step<00:03:44.640> on<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.880> pulse

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.840 
remember now I'll i was gonna say i
never<00:04:01.470> got<00:04:01.769> used<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.190> t<00:04:02.370> flip<00:04:02.610> flop

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
never got used to the t flip flop

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.400 
never got used to the t flip flop
because<00:04:03.000> i<00:04:03.239> felt<00:04:03.450> it<00:04:03.540> was<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.930> little<00:04:03.989> stupid

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
because i felt it was a little stupid

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
because i felt it was a little stupid
that's<00:04:05.220> stupid<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:05.670> i<00:04:05.880> never<00:04:06.150> really<00:04:06.329> enjoyed

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
that's stupid but i never really enjoyed

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.810 
that's stupid but i never really enjoyed
that<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:07.380> i<00:04:07.410> use<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.799> post<00:04:08.100> limiter<00:04:08.430> for<00:04:08.670> this

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
that so i use a post limiter for this

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.449 
that so i use a post limiter for this
which<00:04:09.660> extends<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.410> piston<00:04:10.709> now<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.100> then<00:04:11.190> re

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
which extends to piston now and then re

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.560 
which extends to piston now and then re
extends<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:13.049> then<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.470> signal<00:04:13.799> from<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
extends it so then the signal from the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.789 
extends it so then the signal from the
block<00:04:15.570> in<00:04:15.720> front<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.019> repeater<00:04:16.289> it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
block in front of the repeater it

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.469 
block in front of the repeater it
travels<00:04:17.220> into<00:04:17.430> all<00:04:17.760> these<00:04:18.209> different

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
travels into all these different

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.860 
travels into all these different
circuits<00:04:18.989> here<00:04:19.229> which<00:04:19.950> go<00:04:20.310> into

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.200 

which<00:04:23.870> going<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.380> on<00:04:24.650> all<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.580> Pistons<00:04:26.060> out

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
which going to on all the Pistons out

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.170 
which going to on all the Pistons out
here<00:04:26.540> so<00:04:27.170> when<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.380> step<00:04:27.650> on<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:28.150> right<00:04:29.150> now

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
here so when you step on it right now

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.480 
here so when you step on it right now
there<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:29.750> no<00:04:29.900> signal<00:04:30.170> going<00:04:30.440> into<00:04:30.710> here<00:04:30.950> so

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
there is no signal going into here so

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.900 
there is no signal going into here so
there<00:04:31.700> on<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.330> Redstone<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.920> redstone<00:04:34.310> is<00:04:34.340> um

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
there on the Redstone the redstone is um

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.140 
there on the Redstone the redstone is um
well<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.750> redstone<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:37.220> inverted<00:04:37.700> here<00:04:38.000> so

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
well the redstone is it inverted here so

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.420 
well the redstone is it inverted here so
the<00:04:38.330> lights<00:04:38.510> turn<00:04:38.720> on<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.620> Pistons<00:04:40.070> aren't

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
the lights turn on the Pistons aren't

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.550 
the lights turn on the Pistons aren't
closed<00:04:40.880> so<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.420> light<00:04:41.570> water<00:04:41.840> can<00:04:42.020> flow<00:04:42.200> and

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
closed so the light water can flow and

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.830 
closed so the light water can flow and
the<00:04:43.100> rest<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.550> just<00:04:43.670> an<00:04:43.970> inverted<00:04:44.690> signal

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
the rest of it's just an inverted signal

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.340 
the rest of it's just an inverted signal
so<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.290> piston<00:04:45.620> door<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.860> open<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:47.350> that's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
so the piston door is open and that's

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.650 
so the piston door is open and that's
pretty<00:04:48.560> much<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.090> Redstone<00:04:50.090> aspect<00:04:50.540> behind

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
pretty much the Redstone aspect behind

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.200 
pretty much the Redstone aspect behind
it<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.010> guess<00:04:52.430> that's<00:04:52.580> pretty<00:04:52.730> much<00:04:52.970> all

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
it so I guess that's pretty much all

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.780 
it so I guess that's pretty much all
there<00:04:53.360> is<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.620> this<00:04:55.430> could<00:04:55.550> be<00:04:55.670> like

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
there is to it and this could be like

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.760 
there is to it and this could be like
connection<00:04:56.360> from<00:04:56.540> his<00:04:56.750> actual<00:04:57.140> base<00:04:57.470> I

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
connection from his actual base I

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.830 
connection from his actual base I
understand<00:04:58.730> I<00:04:58.820> kind<00:04:59.120> of<00:04:59.210> did<00:04:59.390> mess<00:04:59.540> up<00:04:59.570> the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
understand I kind of did mess up the

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.570 
understand I kind of did mess up the
design<00:05:00.170> i<00:05:00.200> put<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.590> potion<00:05:01.070> stand<00:05:01.400> on<00:05:01.520> the

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
design i put the potion stand on the

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.020 
design i put the potion stand on the
wrong<00:05:01.730> side<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.270> think<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.080> looks<00:05:03.230> pretty<00:05:03.320> well

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
wrong side I think it looks pretty well

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.790 
wrong side I think it looks pretty well
overall<00:05:05.740> but<00:05:06.740> close<00:05:06.920> this<00:05:07.100> up<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:08.590> that's<00:05:09.590> all

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
overall but close this up and that's all

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.010 
overall but close this up and that's all
I<00:05:09.830> really<00:05:10.040> is<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:10.640> bill<00:05:10.970> thank<00:05:11.780> you<00:05:11.870> guys
