00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.219
 following our tests concerning the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.900
 slidepad memup tablet avoids 785 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.910
 so here I was talking to you about the whole 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 part of technical characteristics of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 this tablet then already I got 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 you hear group but we have a format 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
 which strongly resembles that of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.789
 ipad in a 4/3 format and for the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.470
 it's really successful 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.300
 really a format that is very nice 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.560
 the tablet is in addition quite light and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.359
 very film so what allows the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.279
 take it easy in hand and power 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 for example to read a very very ebook 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.340
 easily so the screen as for him so 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.010
 it's a screen with a dali ps screen 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 makes 7.85 grows so it's pretty much 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.020
 identical to that of the ipad mini games 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.590
 that these same identical so after we have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.239
 a resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels a 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.829
 low compared to current standards 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 because we are not in full hd 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.879
 but very sincerely we want it done 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 largely the job what there is no 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.120
 problem on it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.960
 so we have a 4/3 format as I tell you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.640
 said we have also so in terms of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.729
 processors so it's a processor 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.939
 quad core they go rem cortex a7 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 which is clocked at 1.2 ghz guers and we have 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.630
 a gig of ram 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.750
 installed on the tablet a little disappointed 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.689
 on the only giga of ram the standards 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 maintenance could know 2 gigas of ram 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.040
 but hey very sincerely you see 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.530
 all of them really display it quickly 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 there is no major lag anyway on 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.720
 the android part so then i'm going 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.159
 to make you quickly see the little tour 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.159
 from the owner you see here there is 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.619
 absolutely nothing right there and that's the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.659
 good surprise we have a microsd spot 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.570
 which is right there that allows us to go 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.759
 up to 32 gigabytes of storage that's 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.009
 really an asset for this tablet 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.729
 touch here the volume more or less 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.259
 just there the button to see here there is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.490
 so you realize that we have 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.729
 still enough connectivity 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 complete here the 3.5mm jack for your 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.119
 headphones the c1 the micro usb input 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.320
 which allows to recharge the tablet but 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.170
 also as I told you all to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.060
 the time we can connect 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.239
 a usb key with the small adapter 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.040
 provided this is called a plug 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.980
 at the theater so that allows to take in 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.120
 has an external hard disk or 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.890
 a USB key 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.650
 we have a mini hdmi output so for 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.170
 connect your tablet to your vote 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.569
 TV screen right here so here we have a 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.480
 button beings wondering where to go 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.190
 found quite a bit and here is the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.660
 funky micro sensor and that lies 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.700
 just sweat to make the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.080
 videoconferencing 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.540
 so if I just go back there you see 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 we have a video sensor so it's a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.010
 0 3 megapixel sensor 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.519
 it's really very troublesome 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.690
 honestly and on the back you see the back 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.650
 is nice enough I think it's 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.900
 quite successful 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.269
 so here here you have the sensor of 2 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.680
 good megapixels come not flash but 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.250
 it's really a trouble one on there 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.739
 and then here just the little speaker 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.080
 which allows to have the music 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.880
 directly here we are so a 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.690
 tablet rather happiness good 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.299
 bill running under android 4.2.2 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.290
 so one of the very latest versions 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.350
 and what can I tell you 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.910
 else ah yes in terms of autonomy in 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.650
 terms of autonomy so in video playback 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.860
 so that's the two of the builders 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.400
 in video playback we are at 4 hours in 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.260
 audio playback at 12 o'clock and in use 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.910
 internet about four hours knowing 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.000
 that it's a 3600 battery 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.500
 milliamps which is installed so yes 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.120
 we turn we will say with a 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.440
 intensive use as we have been able to 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.330
 do is rotated around 7 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.040
 hours it may be a little fair but 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.230
 it's not a very very good tablet 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 expensive in terms of price then I tell you 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.340
 the good design is clearly a copy 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.660
 stick of the ipad mini but it's rather 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.640
 succeeded me I think it's rather 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420
 well done it's very nice taking in 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.340
 hand is very nice 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.050
 so that's all that was 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.960
 was technical specifications of this 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.960
