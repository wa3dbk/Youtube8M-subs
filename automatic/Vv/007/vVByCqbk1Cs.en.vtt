 give Jos Hessels a taste 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 it starts with the blanching of the boats sent for the rear 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.320
 momentarily 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.030
 if we 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.780
 and then in 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 boiling water 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.950
 sickly covered 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.230
 I had attracted 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 persons markwell green 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 and cut into small pieces 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.260
 the only vegetables in it 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 well then goes in doorne in the blender goes one 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.440
 generous teaspoon of salt generous teaspoons of sugar 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 about one and a half teaspoons

 red curry 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 the 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.850
 and that is work 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.010
 ns is to judge 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.230
 bÃ¶cker co vries has been located 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.230
 well that island 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.640
 He has forgotten we have to add it 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.920
 this season with very consistent to the gallows constantly that the k 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.729
 if you don't like the consistency of those cookies, you can go for two years 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.089
 london they become even more elastic 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:10.509
 well that's too late then 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
 lock 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.219
 scoop up beans within ground 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.659
 Fish sauce is to bend the certainty 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:38.859
 Which 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.859
 then you are strong telephony 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:46.259
 endless the countertop 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.919
 and on it 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.029
 there goes 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.779
 r the cookies and you have to determine that idiotic degree 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.719
 it's a little boy doing a little army if you're just hefty 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.719
 commotion also not the big spoon 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.659
 if those boxes are now kitchen vollido united again 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.169
 it doesn't want to have it all in your hands 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.109
 in addition 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.209
 in this way you can flatten them 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 sin says to touch 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.059
 falls frolic with kitchen foil 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:26.499
 but they try 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.029
 make the club 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.359
 actually these are a bit bigger than 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.359
 fish contour restaurants 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.269
 so if you already want a chic then you have to take it small 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.840
 and then you can each other with one and the working the steel wingsuit the bond 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.589
 can make 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.729
 this does not matter so much that it is about the texture in the taste 

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.259
 if they give me all the remaining classes 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.840
 the facts 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.650
 very hassle actually 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.289
 the mistake schoorel plan that it is handy and put your cnn 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.509
 on the lap in the fridge 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.499
 and there seems to be nothing in it and so it seems a bit 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.719
 So sort of stiffer than it would be easier to process and points 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.689
 to grab 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.469
 divide the three oil into the pan during leisure 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.610
 what you eat 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.509
 get archie oil 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.870
 that's what the fin said the oil 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.689
 but you can also take sunflower oil 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.159
 and there he has so let you represent think you do your best 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.819
 sentence sold 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.819
 that would be nice if this year 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.559
 then you put them 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:27.599
 on kitchen paper to get rid of the excess fat with as much as possible 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.479
 and then the sauce goes over and it's a shooter chili sauce that is everywhere too 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.499
 to get 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:48.039
 And these cookies that do not have to be Russian ex usually have them with 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.279
 the time you get there has also been estimated for a while on the moped 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.549
 fine in Zeeland
