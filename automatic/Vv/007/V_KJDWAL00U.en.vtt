00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.919 
yeah happy Monday what we have here is
my<00:00:10.440> original<00:00:11.210> exhaust<00:00:12.210> system<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.410> car<00:00:14.929> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
my original exhaust system on my car the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.349 
my original exhaust system on my car the
glass<00:00:16.170> plaque<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.250> was<00:00:17.400> nice<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:17.940> had<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> lot

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
glass plaque it was nice but had a lot

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.650 
glass plaque it was nice but had a lot
of<00:00:18.420> drone<00:00:19.160> and<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> being<00:00:20.640> sr5<00:00:21.270> there's

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
of drone and with it being sr5 there's

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.980 
of drone and with it being sr5 there's
no<00:00:21.840> resonator<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:26.599> now<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.779> one

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
no resonator and use this now at one

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
no resonator and use this now at one
point<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.680> taken<00:00:29.189> off<00:00:29.449> and<00:00:31.850> there

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
point this was taken off and there

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.400 
point this was taken off and there
wasn't<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:34.460> gasket<00:00:35.460> added<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:36.030> here<00:00:36.410> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
wasn't a gasket added back here so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
wasn't a gasket added back here so
that's<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:37.950> reason<00:00:38.550> why<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> was<00:00:39.090> leaking<00:00:39.450> cuz

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that's one reason why I was leaking cuz

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.860 
that's one reason why I was leaking cuz
I'm<00:00:40.500> gonna<00:00:40.590> use<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:44.870> probably

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I'm gonna use one of these probably

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.389 
I'm gonna use one of these probably
wondering<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> hell<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> currently<00:00:47.190> on

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
wondering what the hell is currently on

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.529 
wondering what the hell is currently on
the<00:00:47.579> car<00:00:47.789> well<00:00:48.450> let's<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.440> see<00:00:50.239> there's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> new

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the car well let's go see there's a new

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.619 
the car well let's go see there's a new
downpipe<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.739> crossover<00:00:53.309> pipe<00:00:53.539> there's<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
downpipe and crossover pipe there's a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.099 
downpipe and crossover pipe there's a
gap<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.649> there's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.090> real<00:00:57.109> gasket

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
gap here because there's a real gasket

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.510 
gap here because there's a real gasket
in<00:00:58.230> between<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.770> where<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.070> supposed<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
in between there where it's supposed to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.630 
in between there where it's supposed to
be<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:02.390> down<00:01:03.390> pipe<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> last<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.070> in

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
be and that down pipe is the last one in

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
be and that down pipe is the last one in
its<00:01:05.850> existence<00:01:06.360> Walker<00:01:06.900> no<00:01:07.170> longer<00:01:07.470> makes

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
its existence Walker no longer makes

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
its existence Walker no longer makes
them<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> can't<00:01:09.299> get<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> dealer

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
them you can't get them from the dealer

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.940 
them you can't get them from the dealer
either<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> last<00:01:11.700> one

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.280 

I<00:01:16.979> took<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> test<00:01:18.090> drive<00:01:18.150> yesterday<00:01:18.870> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
I took for a test drive yesterday the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.590 
I took for a test drive yesterday the
day<00:01:19.470> before<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> hear<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:22.380> first

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.780 

see<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:30.170> see<00:01:31.170> what's

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.710 

here's<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> t3<00:01:36.840> cat<00:01:37.680> delete<00:01:38.040> pipe<00:01:38.659> now<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
here's the t3 cat delete pipe now the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
here's the t3 cat delete pipe now the
sr5<00:01:42.440> catalytic<00:01:43.440> converter<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.950> longer<00:01:44.460> than

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
sr5 catalytic converter is longer than

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.800 
sr5 catalytic converter is longer than
the<00:01:44.790> GTS<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.869> want<00:01:46.050> to<00:01:46.140> use<00:01:46.320> GTS<00:01:47.810> catalog

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
the GTS so you want to use GTS catalog

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.529 
the GTS so you want to use GTS catalog
catback<00:01:49.619> exhaust<00:01:49.950> systems<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.270> get

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
catback exhaust systems you have to get

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.180 
catback exhaust systems you have to get
this<00:01:51.750> pipe<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.530> get<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.830> GTS<00:01:53.820> Catholic<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> her

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
this pipe or get a GTS Catholic to her

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.650 
this pipe or get a GTS Catholic to her
now<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:58.050> goes<00:01:58.289> into<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.630> quarter<00:02:00.630> inch

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
now it goes into a to a quarter inch

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.290 
now it goes into a to a quarter inch
pipe<00:02:01.340> or<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> resonator<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:05.250> goes<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.670> over

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
pipe or the resonator it goes up over

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:15.990 
pipe or the resonator it goes up over
the<00:02:06.690> axle

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.950 

and<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:18.070> goes<00:02:18.280> underneath<00:02:19.350> there<00:02:20.350> pops<00:02:20.740> out

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
and it goes underneath there pops out

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.190 
and it goes underneath there pops out
canister<00:02:22.960> style<00:02:23.140> muffler<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> ovx<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
canister style muffler this is a ovx you

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.520 
canister style muffler this is a ovx you
know<00:02:27.000> basically<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.150> blatant<00:02:28.780> copy<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.290> an<00:02:29.410> H

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
know basically a blatant copy of an H

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.850 
know basically a blatant copy of an H
gas<00:02:29.770> high<00:02:30.040> power<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> really<00:02:31.780> good<00:02:32.200> copy<00:02:32.650> of

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
gas high power but a really good copy of

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.070 
gas high power but a really good copy of
an<00:02:33.070> HKS<00:02:33.490> high-power<00:02:36.450> yeah<00:02:37.450> here's<00:02:37.810> how<00:02:37.960> it

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
an HKS high-power yeah here's how it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.860 
an HKS high-power yeah here's how it
looks<00:02:38.290> from<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.620> back<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.220> had<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> cut<00:02:40.360> my<00:02:42.870> tow

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
looks from the back I had to cut my tow

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.890 
looks from the back I had to cut my tow
hook<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.910> actually<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.330> like<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.660> way<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
hook but actually I like the way it

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.030 
hook but actually I like the way it
looks<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:49.030> how<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.300> I<00:02:50.290> like<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
looks I like how the I like the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.740 
looks I like how the I like the
characteristics<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.850> having<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.240> silencer

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
characteristics of having the silencer

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.990 
characteristics of having the silencer
which<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.410> something<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.190> H<00:02:54.310> gas<00:02:54.580> does<00:02:54.820> that

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
which is something the H gas does that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.960 
which is something the H gas does that
come<00:02:55.209> with<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.890> silencer<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> could<00:02:57.790> drive

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
come with with a silencer I could drive

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.460 
come with with a silencer I could drive
at<00:02:58.150> night<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:59.100> can<00:03:00.100> drive<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.820> have<00:03:01.660> my<00:03:01.810> music<00:03:02.110> on

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
at night I can drive it have my music on

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.560 
at night I can drive it have my music on
even<00:03:03.250> with<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.610> silencer<00:03:04.030> out<00:03:04.180> I<00:03:04.209> can<00:03:04.390> drive

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
even with the silencer out I can drive
