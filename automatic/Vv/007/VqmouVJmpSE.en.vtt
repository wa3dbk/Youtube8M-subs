construction of the vehicle and each one
of<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.170> seats<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.579> roll<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
of these seats can then roll out and be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.680 
of these seats can then roll out and be
replaced<00:00:59.719> with<00:01:00.719> either<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> scooter<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.739> a

motorized chair

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.380 
motorized chair
I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:05.400> don't<00:01:05.580> recommend<00:01:06.000> scooters

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I think they don't recommend scooters

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.320 
I think they don't recommend scooters
because<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> pointed<00:01:07.350> end<00:01:08.180> but<00:01:09.180> this

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
because it has a pointed end but this

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.710 
because it has a pointed end but this
chair<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.040> then<00:01:11.040> could<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.659> were

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
chair and then could be and if they were

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
chair and then could be and if they were
driving<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.799> say<00:01:14.010> how's<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> alive<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.000> one

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
driving let's say how's it alive for one

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.570 
driving let's say how's it alive for one
of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> kids<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.920> person<00:01:17.280> wanted

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of the kids and the other person wanted

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.359 
of the kids and the other person wanted
to<00:01:17.670> drive<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.409> suppose<00:01:19.409> they<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:19.860> always

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to drive I suppose they could always

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.030 
to drive I suppose they could always
take<00:01:21.330> with<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.049> trip<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
take with them on this trip one of the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.719 
take with them on this trip one of the
chairs<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.610> move<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> back<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:24.990> out<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.729> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
chairs to move it back in and out and in

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.630
