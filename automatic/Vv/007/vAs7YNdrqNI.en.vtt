 Want to build a team like this one?

 spent some 30 million and 35 million to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 set up this team and it worked hard 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.180
 for my opponents, people 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.659
 opponent we are going to play against

 Look at the team we face with this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.360
 Korean team 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.670
 nothing more nothing less than four 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.189
 tellin boxes he had modric 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.369

 And this team, I'm going to talk here to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.540
 I played you in 442 between relatives 2 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 guys, one thing I can not let 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.630
 to tell you in the very beginning is 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.520
 about a keeper of this Korean team 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.909
 practically he catches me 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.960
 very much limited but it is seeing 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.969
 sensational that goal of the team there 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.460
 Korean despite having having done 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.979
 this shit on the ball out and more 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.680
 keeper is spectacular 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.200
 he is everything was he very much remembers the pt already 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.270
 that not only is it nothing to do with 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.310
 Nothing happens, nothing else. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.190
 defense 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.920
 this amazing players are upset 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.890
 turn live and I'm not mistaken and the 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.170
 defender he who runs 91 93 if I do not 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 I'm wrong, you run too far, you'll run. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 and not to mention the attack that these 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.440
 two Koreans who are there are good 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.750
 they arrive there all the time in the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.060
 face of the goal giving a lot of work if you 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.150
 do you like to take that one? 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.800
 challenge with his friend and such or online 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.780

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.280

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.069
 be very nervous about losing to this 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 almost all silver time 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.290
 we only have one player k had gold is 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.750
 a bayer player leverkusen a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.170
 bundesliga player is a star 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.430
 Actually dodo is the star of this team. 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.130
 Korean is single box is is a gold that 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.940
 of this team and it really is the best 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.340
 player 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.720
 It's a shame he left me like I already 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.920
 I've spoken in other videos that you 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.840
 accompanies the position mmd in that fifa 15 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.120
 are not so active in the galera then 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.310
 people end up losing a player of 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.519
 great potential but you can also 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.400
 risk and put on the attack change the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.500
 little box from there to n ha and put it 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 on the attack is very successful too 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.450
 because he's different than I do 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.030
 I played here a little like the game I think 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.100

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.380

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.660

 for you to buy another defender and have 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.830
