00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
school buses but I realized that it

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.550 
school buses but I realized that it

really badass air filter for it check
that<00:03:38.959> out<00:03:39.609> yeah<00:03:40.609> see<00:03:41.680> 16<00:03:42.680> valves<00:03:43.340> right<00:03:43.519> there

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
that out yeah see 16 valves right there

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.229 
that out yeah see 16 valves right there
how<00:03:44.660> about<00:03:44.870> that<00:03:45.079> 16<00:03:46.040> of<00:03:46.220> them<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.489> there's

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
how about that 16 of them and there's

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.750 
how about that 16 of them and there's
only<00:03:47.329> four<00:03:47.660> spark<00:03:48.019> plugs<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.400> there's<00:03:49.579> only

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
only four spark plugs so there's only

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.479 
only four spark plugs so there's only
like<00:03:50.060> four<00:03:50.120> cylinders<00:03:50.959> so<00:03:51.889> there's<00:03:52.160> four

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
like four cylinders so there's four

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.580 
like four cylinders so there's four
valves<00:03:52.940> per<00:03:53.120> cylinder<00:03:53.150> that's<00:03:53.720> custom

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
valves per cylinder that's custom

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.090 
valves per cylinder that's custom
right<00:03:54.739> there

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
right there

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.509 
right there
so<00:03:55.790> it's<00:03:56.690> extra<00:03:57.230> fast<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.769> go<00:04:01.010> here's<00:04:01.370> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
so it's extra fast so you go here's the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.569 
so it's extra fast so you go here's the
dipstick<00:04:01.910> right<00:04:02.120> here<00:04:02.269> for<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.780> oil<00:04:02.980> see<00:04:03.980> it

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
dipstick right here for the oil see it

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.979 
dipstick right here for the oil see it
actually<00:04:04.970> doesn't<00:04:05.150> even<00:04:05.329> go<00:04:05.420> to<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.600> motor<00:04:05.810> it

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
actually doesn't even go to the motor it

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.330 
actually doesn't even go to the motor it
just<00:04:06.200> dip<00:04:06.440> straight<00:04:06.739> into<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> exhaust

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
just dip straight into the exhaust

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.599 
just dip straight into the exhaust
manifold<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.739> then<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.859> just<00:04:10.010> goes<00:04:10.220> into<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
manifold and then it just goes into the

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.670 
manifold and then it just goes into the
cylinder<00:04:11.180> and<00:04:11.359> then<00:04:11.600> goes<00:04:11.780> past<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.410> Rings

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
cylinder and then goes past the Rings

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.240 
cylinder and then goes past the Rings
and<00:04:13.100> goes<00:04:13.819> down<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:14.269> oil<00:04:14.480> pan<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.250> that's

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
and goes down in the oil pan and that's

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.979 
and goes down in the oil pan and that's
how<00:04:16.400> you<00:04:16.459> check<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.820> oil<00:04:16.850> on<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.930> that's

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
how you check the oil on it so that's

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.500 
how you check the oil on it so that's
pretty<00:04:18.289> sweet<00:04:18.560> right<00:04:18.829> custom<00:04:19.400> anyway<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.359> air

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
pretty sweet right custom anyway the air

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.880 
pretty sweet right custom anyway the air
filter<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:20.900> was<00:04:20.989> talking<00:04:21.260> about<00:04:21.320> I<00:04:21.470> got<00:04:21.709> from

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
filter I was talking about I got from

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.860 
filter I was talking about I got from
autozone<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.849> can't<00:04:23.090> see<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.479> because<00:04:23.570> it's<00:04:23.780> a

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
autozone you can't see it because it's a

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.890 
autozone you can't see it because it's a
it's<00:04:24.500> inside<00:04:24.919> of<00:04:25.070> this<00:04:25.159> box<00:04:25.520> right<00:04:25.849> here

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
it's inside of this box right here

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.040 
it's inside of this box right here
think<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.110> was<00:04:27.199> an<00:04:27.320> STP<00:04:28.009> or<00:04:28.520> something<00:04:28.940> or<00:04:29.180> I'm

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
think it was an STP or something or I'm

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.110 
think it was an STP or something or I'm
pretty<00:04:30.440> sure<00:04:30.620> it<00:04:30.710> wasn't<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:31.009> Fram<00:04:31.280> cuz<00:04:31.699> fram's

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
pretty sure it wasn't a Fram cuz fram's

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.700 
pretty sure it wasn't a Fram cuz fram's
aren't<00:04:32.419> any<00:04:32.630> good

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
aren't any good

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.400 
aren't any good
so<00:04:34.669> yeah<00:04:34.820> it's<00:04:35.000> custom<00:04:35.449> though<00:04:35.600> because<00:04:36.259> I

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
so yeah it's custom though because I

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.800 
so yeah it's custom though because I
bought<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.800> after<00:04:36.949> market<00:04:37.490> I<00:04:37.699> did<00:04:38.660> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
bought it after market I did the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.810 
bought it after market I did the
Eliminator<00:04:39.350> right<00:04:39.590> here<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.220> see<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.490> hose

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
Eliminator right here you see this hose

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.180 
Eliminator right here you see this hose
you<00:04:41.150> sound<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.199> this<00:04:42.320> plastic<00:04:42.860> thing<00:04:42.889> that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
you sound like this plastic thing that

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.499 
you sound like this plastic thing that
came<00:04:43.430> up<00:04:43.460> but<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.389> was<00:04:44.479> always<00:04:44.630> in<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.960> way<00:04:45.220> so

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
came up but it was always in the way so

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.960 
came up but it was always in the way so
that<00:04:47.509> had<00:04:47.750> to<00:04:47.780> go<00:04:47.990> for<00:04:48.440> sure<00:04:48.650> definitely<00:04:49.580> had

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
that had to go for sure definitely had

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.610 
that had to go for sure definitely had
to<00:04:50.060> go<00:04:51.880> you<00:04:52.880> know<00:04:53.000> I<00:04:53.030> usually<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:53.960> raced<00:04:54.380> this

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
to go you know I usually I raced this

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.950 
to go you know I usually I raced this
car<00:04:54.889> because<00:04:55.190> it's<00:04:55.400> really<00:04:55.639> fast<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.840> know

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
car because it's really fast so you know

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.230 
car because it's really fast so you know
I<00:04:59.990> mean<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.680> wanted<00:05:01.070> to<00:05:01.130> keep<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.550> fast<00:05:01.729> but<00:05:02.120> also

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
I mean I wanted to keep it fast but also

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020 
I mean I wanted to keep it fast but also
I<00:05:02.419> have<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.690> family<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.139> have<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.440> haul<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.820> had

I have a family I have to haul so I had

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.990 
I have a family I have to haul so I had
to<00:05:05.150> keep<00:05:05.360> my<00:05:05.510> whole<00:05:05.690> interior<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:07.850> know<00:05:07.970> I

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
to keep my whole interior you know I

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.560 
to keep my whole interior you know I
kept<00:05:08.690> all<00:05:08.900> my<00:05:08.960> seats<00:05:09.380> not<00:05:09.650> stuff<00:05:10.100> in<00:05:10.280> there<00:05:10.570> you

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
kept all my seats not stuff in there you

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.990 
kept all my seats not stuff in there you
know<00:05:11.690> normal<00:05:12.199> cuz<00:05:12.500> like<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:13.010> got<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.220> wife<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.910> I

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
know normal cuz like I got a wife and I

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.610 
know normal cuz like I got a wife and I
got<00:05:14.120> a<00:05:14.150> baby<00:05:14.449> and<00:05:14.960> he<00:05:15.080> has<00:05:15.199> to<00:05:15.350> ride<00:05:15.470> in<00:05:15.530> the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
got a baby and he has to ride in the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.520 
got a baby and he has to ride in the
back<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:17.210> guess<00:05:17.720> he<00:05:17.870> could<00:05:18.020> ride<00:05:18.169> in<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:18.349> front

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
back I guess he could ride in the front

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.100 
back I guess he could ride in the front
because<00:05:18.800> I<00:05:18.830> don't<00:05:19.010> have<00:05:19.070> airbags<00:05:19.430> but<00:05:20.080> but<00:05:21.080> I

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
because I don't have airbags but but I

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.279 
because I don't have airbags but but I
realized<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:21.680> importance<00:05:22.220> of<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:24.169> know

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
realized the importance of you know

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.140 
realized the importance of you know
keeping<00:05:24.710> this<00:05:24.860> thing<00:05:25.070> fast<00:05:25.340> method<00:05:25.789> I<00:05:25.820> need<00:05:26.030> to

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
keeping this thing fast method I need to

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.600 
keeping this thing fast method I need to
do<00:05:26.300> some<00:05:26.509> weight<00:05:26.690> reduction<00:05:27.229> to<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.710> since

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
do some weight reduction to it and since

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.370 
do some weight reduction to it and since
I<00:05:28.729> wanted<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.120> keep<00:05:29.300> my<00:05:29.479> interior<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.139> keeping

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
I wanted to keep my interior and keeping

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.219 
I wanted to keep my interior and keeping
a<00:05:30.470> nice<00:05:30.650> car<00:05:30.949> and<00:05:31.160> not<00:05:31.280> like<00:05:31.430> strip<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.970> out<00:05:32.229> I

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
a nice car and not like strip it out I

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.200 
a nice car and not like strip it out I
had<00:05:33.889> to<00:05:34.039> do<00:05:34.160> the<00:05:34.280> weight<00:05:34.430> reduction<00:05:34.910> so<00:05:35.060> let's

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
had to do the weight reduction so let's

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.110 
had to do the weight reduction so let's
see<00:05:35.360> this<00:05:35.510> is<00:05:35.630> what<00:05:35.720> I<00:05:35.750> did<00:05:35.960> right<00:05:36.080> here<00:05:37.120> see

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
see this is what I did right here see

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.070 
see this is what I did right here see
this<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:38.690> normally<00:05:39.229> has<00:05:39.349> a<00:05:39.380> cap<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:39.979> it<00:05:41.080> the

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
this this normally has a cap on it the

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.740 
this this normally has a cap on it the
valve<00:05:42.289> stem<00:05:42.560> cap<00:05:42.590> but<00:05:43.070> I<00:05:43.340> needed<00:05:44.240> to<00:05:44.330> find<00:05:44.570> a

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
valve stem cap but I needed to find a

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.560 
valve stem cap but I needed to find a
way<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:44.930> reduce<00:05:45.349> the<00:05:45.620> weight<00:05:45.800> of<00:05:45.949> the<00:05:46.039> car

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
way to reduce the weight of the car

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.779 
way to reduce the weight of the car
without<00:05:47.570> messing<00:05:48.020> with<00:05:48.199> the<00:05:48.349> interior<00:05:49.099> so<00:05:49.460> I

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
without messing with the interior so I

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.939 
without messing with the interior so I
just<00:05:50.360> I<00:05:50.510> took<00:05:50.570> that<00:05:50.900> cap<00:05:51.139> off<00:05:51.349> right<00:05:51.590> there<00:05:51.770> and

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
just I took that cap off right there and

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.399 
just I took that cap off right there and
that<00:05:52.789> saved<00:05:53.120> me<00:05:53.270> a<00:05:53.300> little<00:05:53.599> bit<00:05:53.900> of<00:05:54.020> weight<00:05:54.199> and

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
that saved me a little bit of weight and

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.370 
that saved me a little bit of weight and
also<00:05:55.250> I<00:05:55.460> think<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:56.030> wind<00:05:56.270> resistance<00:05:56.449> was<00:05:57.110> cut

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
also I think the wind resistance was cut

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.719 
also I think the wind resistance was cut
down<00:05:57.560> just<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:57.949> little<00:05:57.979> bit<00:05:58.190> now<00:05:58.400> because<00:05:58.610> it's

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
down just a little bit now because it's

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.490 
down just a little bit now because it's
round<00:05:59.030> as<00:05:59.270> before<00:05:59.599> it<00:05:59.720> kind<00:05:59.930> of<00:05:59.990> had<00:06:00.110> like<00:06:00.139> some

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
round as before it kind of had like some

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.469 
round as before it kind of had like some
edges<00:06:00.860> on<00:06:00.979> it<00:06:01.010> and<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.820> think<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.090> was<00:06:02.210> slowing

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
edges on it and I think it was slowing

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:03.820 
edges on it and I think it was slowing
me<00:06:02.630> down<00:06:02.659> holding<00:06:03.110> me<00:06:03.169> back<00:06:03.349> a<00:06:03.380> little<00:06:03.590> bit<00:06:03.770> so

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
me down holding me back a little bit so

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.839 
me down holding me back a little bit so
I<00:06:04.280> got<00:06:04.909> rid<00:06:05.060> of<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.180> and<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:07.310> know<00:06:07.430> it's<00:06:07.610> been

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:07.849 
I got rid of that and you know it's been

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.879 
I got rid of that and you know it's been
working<00:06:08.060> pretty<00:06:08.330> good<00:06:08.630> but<00:06:08.930> I've<00:06:09.680> been

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:11.439 
working pretty good but I've been
noticing<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.400> pulls<00:06:10.610> just<00:06:10.880> a<00:06:10.970> little<00:06:11.210> bit<00:06:11.330> now

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
noticing it pulls just a little bit now

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.670 
noticing it pulls just a little bit now
to<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.750> driver's<00:06:12.110> side<00:06:12.139> because<00:06:12.590> the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
to the driver's side because the

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.230 
to the driver's side because the
driver's<00:06:13.039> side<00:06:13.159> still<00:06:13.430> has<00:06:13.460> one<00:06:13.820> I<00:06:13.849> think<00:06:13.970> like

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
driver's side still has one I think like

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.180 
driver's side still has one I think like
the<00:06:14.360> wind<00:06:14.599> right<00:06:14.840> from<00:06:15.080> it<00:06:15.229> kind<00:06:15.409> of<00:06:15.470> like<00:06:15.590> so

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
the wind right from it kind of like so

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.890 
the wind right from it kind of like so
I'm<00:06:16.340> thinking<00:06:16.940> I'm<00:06:17.030> gonna<00:06:17.180> pull<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.690> one<00:06:17.840> off

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
I'm thinking I'm gonna pull that one off

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.320 
I'm thinking I'm gonna pull that one off
too<00:06:18.199> on<00:06:18.320> the<00:06:18.409> other<00:06:18.440> side<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:19.729> that<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.060> doesn't

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
too on the other side so that it doesn't

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.450 
too on the other side so that it doesn't
pull<00:06:20.510> any<00:06:20.690> more<00:06:20.870> and<00:06:21.110> it<00:06:21.260> should<00:06:21.500> be<00:06:21.620> like<00:06:21.919> you

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
pull any more and it should be like you

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.360 
pull any more and it should be like you
know<00:06:22.690> twice<00:06:23.690> as<00:06:23.960> fast<00:06:24.199> then<00:06:24.560> cuz<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:24.949> took<00:06:25.250> off

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
know twice as fast then cuz I took off

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.649
