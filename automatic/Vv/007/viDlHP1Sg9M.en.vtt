00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
find really annoying you have to press

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:02.370 
find really annoying you have to press
this<00:01:51.280> button<00:01:51.520> in<00:01:51.670> here<00:01:59.070> or<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.550> hate<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:01.450> open

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
this button in here or I hate this open

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
this button in here or I hate this open
up<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.619> end<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.970> click<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.300> big<00:02:04.510> red<00:02:04.660> button

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the reason I hate a big red button is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.140 
the reason I hate a big red button is
because<00:02:13.020> when<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.140> extend<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.650> screwdriver

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
because when you extend a screwdriver

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.729 
because when you extend a screwdriver
and<00:02:16.150> falls<00:02:16.450> open<00:02:17.610> like<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:19.560> absolutely<00:02:20.560> hate
