00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.410
 six out of ten users of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.389
 Transantiago reject transfers 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.640
 daily must do to 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 get to your destination place for it 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.119
 one of the first goals that is 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.550
 self-imposed transport ministry 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.919
 and telecommunications after renegotiating 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.410
 contracts with the companies was to begin 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.150
 to decrease them that's why to tell 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.890
 last Sunday the portfolio 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.500
 headed by pedro pablo errázuriz 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.750
 launched the first changes to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.780
 improve the routes and decrease 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.870
 500000 annual transshipments improving the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.910
 travel times it's about 17 improvements 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.650
 to transantiago tours that do not 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.170
 would have been possible with the ancients 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.790
 contracts because they privileged the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.010
 operation of companies in zones 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.810
 exclusive and not the comfort of 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.720
 people to make a quick trip and 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.480
 efficient the measure will benefit the 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.820
 communes of peñalolén maipú macul la 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.759
 florida pudahuel the cistern bridge 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
 tall grills and the mirror in 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.700
 definitively we are not thinking about the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.329
 saving system but the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.670
 quality of service all this efficiency 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.560
 point to better quality of service 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.329
 the cost should be similar 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.119
 not necessarily in cost but what 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:22.310
 relevant is that there is improvement of service 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.049
 and the contracts establish the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.539
 incorporation of additional buses by 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.610
 so if more buses are needed , 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.350
 they will incorporate the changes that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.649
 began to be implemented are the union 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.200
 of courses 106 and 431 that are 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.179
 merged into service 106 and that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.759
 will allow travel without transfers between 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.950
 macul and maipú through irarrázabal 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.530
 manuel montt providencia mall and 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.569
 little birds also constituting a 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.179
 travel alternative to line 1 of 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.490
 metro another function is the one that will join 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.670
 directly maipú and florida al 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.039
 merge the routes and 12 and h10 that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.530
 will create an alternative to travel from 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.869
 the plaza de maipú to the metro viewpoint 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.080
 vespucio avenue lo mirror great avenue 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.640
 the ovalle and departmental in that same 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.120
 line point the junctions of the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.380
 500 foot tours with j14 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.660
 corresponding to metropolitan buses 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.269
 that will eliminate transshipments between 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.549
 Peñalolén and Pudahuel Sur to generate a 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.680
 direct trip through greece mata mall 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.019
 general bonilla and avenue 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.689
 also as an option on surface to 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.810
 Metro line 1 other functions 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:32.510
 relevant are the 514 with the j 9 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.939
 that will connect macul and peñalolén with the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.129
 industrial sector of enea in pudahuel a 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.349
 through irarrázaval salvador santo 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.349
 domingo- las rejas and san pablo and the 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.389
 union of the routes and 5 and h 11 that 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.790
 joins the Plaza de Maipú with Plaza Oeste 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:49.219
 and the meter the ovalle circulating 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.769
 vespucio to that we must add the creation 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:54.379
 of four new tours and the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.239
 extension of six routes for 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.000
 benefit users of different 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.409
 communes of the city the important thing here 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.629
 is that there is a set of change very 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.489
 specific that improve conditions of 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.319
 transhipment that have been clearly 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.599
 identified as the need for part 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.219
 from the community that we managed to get them out 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.989
 as proposals from companies 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.639
 of transantiago validated by the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.079
 ministry and this a process that 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.450
 continue as the minister has stated 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.650
 probably going well in a new change 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.000
 in October 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.040
 at the beginning of next year again 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.669
 once we have implemented this 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.669
 set of modifications
