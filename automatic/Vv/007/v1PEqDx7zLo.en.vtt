00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.719
 manuel where are you from and what are you going to do 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:13.210
 game engine sound imitations 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.340
 engine sounds when you want 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.460
 let's start they had a car of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.460
 careers 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.840
 let's urinate on a good motorcycle 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.380
 apt that is fashionable now in addition to a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 formula 1 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.470
 or not 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.000
 why 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.860
 amara 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 let's remember the locomotive 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 ancient 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.080
 mom 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.700
 here there are many people making noise but 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.570
 nobody has done it like you for me 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.430
 yes it's true that yes 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.810
 here is taught is to teach us the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.750
 skill you have is to make noises 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.280
 but since you already know I like that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.500
 of the skill you have to make a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.880
 show I like and therefore 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.880
 I am not going to say anything 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.369
 many many trips I do not see a little 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 slow of this training something past 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.300
 I called and another said later now you 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.300
 what the fuck 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.650
 but now nothing nothing 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 the expense looks I think we ended up 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:17.040
 said vicious but above and acts 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.040
 noise that you know and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.420
 if I have 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.830
 do not act that the mosquito 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.830
 return the mosquito 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.250
 you are not heard and it gives you a sound 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.459
 but it is to be expected that it says is that the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.290
 asphalted because that's what starts 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.640
 begins with the view in science by the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.640
 same way of mallorca 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.860
 to tell me that it's not going to be because the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.270
 cancer is the best of the Rioja talks about 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.940
 savings of the rioja 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.980
 go to meet her better not from the river 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.510
 the best light and stick to the better one and 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.470
 a harley I passed you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.470
 and everything 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.320
 the entrance to the street 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.730
 that 's an indirect phonic life 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:39.760
 let's finish this until next time 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.760
 phase is worth
