00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.080
 Welcome to the audit tax 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.660
 tutorial about the new generation of 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.210
 Graphic damage capturing the 3d 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.269
 Graphics at 3d capture you can 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.230
 Looking at vehicle parts in 3D 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.810
 in addition to the improvements in 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.970
 zoom in and pan the 3d brings 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.250
 Mode the advantage that the vehicle parts 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.730
 still much finer resolved 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.560
 This makes them much easier to share 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.390
 identify and recognize this applies in the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.390
 special dimensions for smaller parts 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.270
 3d data is already available today 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.620
 Most 40 models available 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.020
 if on your system the newest 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.030
 program version is installed and you 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.950
 are unlocked for the 3d graphics 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.370
 they can hurt their next one 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.350
 same the 3d graphic capture and you 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.780
 will see it is so easy and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.590
 intuitively that you have no problems with it 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.880
 will have 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.880
 but see for yourself 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.740
 when calling the graphic damage 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.320
 first, you will see the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.880
 usual 2d presentation on you at 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.869
 needs later at any time sometimes 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 can switch 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.430
 this switch goes through a 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.810
 Just click on a new icon that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.270
 They are unique in the first 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.720
 need to add toolbar and that 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.280
 the following applies 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.850
 click on the tool old for 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.690
 the attitude and then on the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.190
 tab toolbar select 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.110
 left the category graphic zones off and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.520
 right here from the possible symbols 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.649
 the blue 3d own 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.469
 now the symbol still to the desired 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.759
 or just pull on the 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.759
 click yellow arrow downwards 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.830
 ok and the new icon to change 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.930
 between the 2d and the 3d illustration 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.930
 is now in the toolbar 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.220
 and it is now almost the 3d graphics 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.230
 photorealistic and very easy to 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.340
 serve 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.069
 Of course, that too is navigations 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.200
 vehicle now 3d you can as usual 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.300
 Jump directly to a vehicle without jumping 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.489
 in which you enter a zone of navigation 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.140
 Click in vehicle to external 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.970
 Vehicle zones can jump in 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.150
 put it on a zone in the outer shell 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.519
 graphic left click to internal 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.620
 if you have zones you can jump in 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.489
 which you share in a zone inside 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 click graphic 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.830
 that's the real area here 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.750
 pictograms also enable you here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.140
 rapid access to special zones 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.360
 such as painted parts rims 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.030
 equipment 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 I'll click on the rims now 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.620
 and they see the reality 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.230
 presentation facilitates the selection of 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.069
 right rim that marks yellow 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 the alu rim you see for comparison 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:09.400
 once again the 2d graphics you can now 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.650
 somewhere with the mouse in the graphic 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.430
 click and mouse in all sorts 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.959
 Turn directions so that they are the parts 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.790
 from any angle 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.600
 as an alternative to the mouse, you can choose the parts 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.230
 also up here over the arrows in all 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.450
 rotate possible directions 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.100
 put a click in the middle symbol 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.100
 restore the original presentation 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.140
 The advantage of rotating will be much more 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.180
 more evident in covert parts 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.560
 not to be seen from the outside to 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.560
 Example of the engine zone 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.209
 here again for comparison 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.209
 2d illustration 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:04.409
 I simply move the mouse around 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:05.969
 the complete zone to turn the 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.370
 present it too small 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.790
 then they either search for the zoom 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.120
 symbols plus and minus on the right 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.590
 side or even more comfortable if you are with 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.139
 work out a scream 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.400
 simply with the mouse wheel in the graphic 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:26.699
 click and zoom in or too 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.169
 again, the rotate out at all 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:33.389
 Of course, axes are also in 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:35.820
 healthy view possible if you 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.560
 hold down both mouse buttons 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.710
 Move the graphic to another position 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.030
 push something especially in the healthy 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.030
 presentation very practical 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.040
 and if she tries once 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.590
 twisted wrong to have rotated 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.480
 no problem just here in the middle 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.530
 click and they have that again 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.530
 original illustration 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.690
 they can still be isolated from some of them 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.280
 show everyone else 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.840
 if , for example, about the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.300
 scope of delivery of a part not sure 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.530
 are 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.310
 as an example, I take now here 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.759
 here the clip for the thermostat and 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.090
 This can be done simply by clicking this 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.710
 pose icons isolated 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.520
 here too the possibility is the part 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.150
 to turn 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:33.479
 in all directions the presentation still 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.050
 zoom in and just click on this 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:39.979
 symbol here on the right represents the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.979
 original representation restores 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.439
 Let's get to the colors for sure 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.269
 they noticed that the color 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.219
 marking of the parts still extended 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:49.999
 has been 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.149
 let's look at the example 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:54.639
 body behind apart colors 

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.139
 identify on the one hand 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.209
 material properties outside sheet metal parts 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.749
 are usually orange in sheet metal parts 

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:05.299
 gray plastic parts green all parts 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:09.549
 yellow very strong steel turns pink 

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:11.620
 illustrated fabric such as leather cork etc 

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:13.900
 ocher 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.000
 on the other serves the different 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.830
 Coloring also to the vehicle 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.260
 as realistic as possible 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.380
 for example with slices or here the 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.880
 red taillights or even around the 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.020
 parts visually more clearly from each other 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.030
 withdraw 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.130
 for example, at different 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.199
 layers here at the seats 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.570
 they will also realize that 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.760
 the color of a part sometimes dynamic 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:40.449
 changes when the example of a 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:44.169
 show it or choose it will 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:46.090
 gray it is captured it gets one 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.530
 red border or if you have a part 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.979
 select the ingredient of a 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:54.130
 Baumgruppe is like here for example 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.350
 sidewall then change the associated 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.090
 subassemblies share their color in turquoise 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.350
 on if they are not selected 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.949
 also renew some repairs 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:08.590
 partially or repair partially 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:13.810
 or cutting surfaces are highlighted in color 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:15.580
 in this case in yellow as far as a first 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.710
 Overview, we are sure you will 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.520
 advantages of 3d graphics soon not 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.110
 want to miss more 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.270
 and now we wish you a lot of fun 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.270
 try it until next time
