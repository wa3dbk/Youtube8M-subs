I knew that my my main bearing was was

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.230 
I knew that my my main bearing was was
being<00:00:19.410> toasted<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.369> decided<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.850> drive<00:00:21.060> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
being toasted and I decided to drive it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.870 
being toasted and I decided to drive it
anyway<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:22.070> basically<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.250> blow<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.670> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
anyway and basically it's blow it up I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
anyway and basically it's blow it up I
mean<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.390> an<00:00:24.480> extra<00:00:24.630> 20<00:00:24.990> minutes<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.470> out

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mean I got an extra 20 minutes or so out

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.890 
mean I got an extra 20 minutes or so out
of<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.789> classic<00:00:27.300> problem<00:00:27.510> that

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
of it but it's a classic problem that

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.439 
of it but it's a classic problem that
I've<00:00:28.050> seen<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> actual<00:00:30.179> tracks

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I've seen with with the actual tracks

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.139 
I've seen with with the actual tracks
and<00:00:30.689> slashes<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.940> cheese<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and slashes this is like the cheese it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
and slashes this is like the cheese it
looks<00:00:33.390> like<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> third<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.079> happened<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
looks like a third time it's happened to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.630 
looks like a third time it's happened to
where<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:36.329> burying<00:00:36.809> inside<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.770> basically

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
where the burying inside here basically

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420 
where the burying inside here basically
goes<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.200> bearing<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.070> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
goes out so the bearing that is on here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450 
goes out so the bearing that is on here
you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> bearing

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
you know this it's like this the bearing

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220 
you know this it's like this the bearing
will<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.300> actually<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.870> our<00:00:45.930> egos<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
will go out actually it's our egos I

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.700 
will go out actually it's our egos I
guess<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.280> bearing<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:48.600> go<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
guess the bearing will go out and it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
guess the bearing will go out and it
just<00:00:50.100> Wow<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> strip<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.270> whole<00:00:51.420> gear

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
just Wow and you strip your whole gear

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.029 
just Wow and you strip your whole gear
and<00:00:51.989> then<00:00:52.260> basically<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> bunch<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and then basically you get a bunch of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
and then basically you get a bunch of
stuff<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:53.460> stuck<00:00:53.789> inside<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
stuff all stuck inside of this it's a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
stuff all stuck inside of this it's a
classic<00:00:55.500> problem<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.890> I've<00:00:55.980> seen<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.610> I

get another I think it's like a pinion
gear<00:02:23.450> here<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:23.840> I<00:02:23.870> can't<00:02:24.170> stick<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
gear here because I can't stick the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.640 
gear here because I can't stick the
smaller<00:02:24.920> pinion<00:02:25.340> gear<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
smaller pinion gear with the with the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.330 
smaller pinion gear with the with the
Mamba<00:02:28.300> scx10<00:02:29.680> kit<00:02:30.680> here<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:31.100> it's<00:02:31.250> just

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
Mamba scx10 kit here because it's just
