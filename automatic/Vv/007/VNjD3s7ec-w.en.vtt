00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.549
 this is how to remove de vido from teaching this 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.950
 recipe that I used to simulate the 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.709
 primitive starbucks if you really 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.630
 they know exactly the same exactly 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.119
 equal value we know great 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.650
 and whoever is frets that he used for 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.360
 guy I forgot in when 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.980
 we started the video of showing you the cream 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.250
 use grab a normal plant 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.220
 these to put on and that is not me 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.629
 He forgets to teach you and nothing to tell you 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.379
 I love this drink is super 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.350
 refreshing and the recipe reaches for two 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.359
 big steps and three small ones I've 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.370
 made this drink that this one is dominating 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:47.530
 and they keep giving me and they're serious 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.420
 that you die would reach you have low 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 these little ones would reach for three 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.359
 of these 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.969
 three of these three or four that a 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.550
 pile but if you want less put less 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.940
 in fewer ingredients or save it for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.530
 later on to follow is super rich and if 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.710
 you want to learn with more fingers to follow 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.690
 seeing vale we're going to need two cups 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 of crushed ice three quarters cup 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.799
 of coffee 34 of milk cup three 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.899
 tablespoons of sugar two tablespoons of 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.119
 caramel and cream the coffee has to be 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.830
 double twice as strong as what 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.299
 do normally and if you do not want 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.530
 do it with liquid coffee you can also 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.119
 do it with normal coffee the dust 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 just make it stronger now 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.820
 simply what I am doing is 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.630
 putting the whole blender 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 and to liquefy 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.510
 will vary what you have done is put the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.610
 candy in a bag and the broken the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.770
 corner to be able to put the best and what 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.300
 I'm going to put in the glass and then when 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 I put the cream I'm going to put on top of 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.410
 the cream if you want to make a 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.110
 frappuccino moca instead of putting 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.120
 use caramel use the syrup 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.820
 chocolate and put it both in the coffee 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.940
 as in the top of the cream 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.940
 on top of the cream and it will taste great seriously 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.750
 do not tell me it does not look like your own 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.750
 chinese starbucks 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.890
 and it's already finished, this is the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.050
 center at the end I made some photos 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.760
 so you can see how it looks like a lot 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.290
 and if you are looking for but it is the recipe to leave me 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.290
 the comments a kiss or see you later
