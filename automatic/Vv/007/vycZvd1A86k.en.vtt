a<00:00:17.250> year<00:00:17.699> ago<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.710> couldn't<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.800> believed<00:00:20.070> that

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
a year ago I couldn't have believed that

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.779 
a year ago I couldn't have believed that
I<00:00:20.369> could<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.820> 3000<00:00:21.600> subs<00:00:22.550> partnership<00:00:23.550> and

I could have 3000 subs partnership and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.679 
I could have 3000 subs partnership and
just<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.840> wouldn't<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.740> imagined<00:00:26.279> that

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
just I wouldn't have imagined that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.089 
just I wouldn't have imagined that
everyone<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.930> liked<00:00:28.199> watching<00:00:28.800> all

everyone would have liked watching all
of<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.310> videos<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.910> much<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.800> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
of my videos this much so when I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.290 
of my videos this much so when I
realized<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.790> going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.090> getting

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
realized that I was going to be getting

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
realized that I was going to be getting
close<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.570> hitting<00:00:33.899> three<00:00:34.200> thousand<00:00:34.620> subs<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
close to hitting three thousand subs I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.280 
close to hitting three thousand subs I
knew<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> had<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.090> do<00:00:36.300> something<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:36.989> but

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
knew I had to do something for it but

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
knew I had to do something for it but
with<00:00:38.040> school<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.340> everything<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:39.000> on

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
with school and everything going on

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
with school and everything going on
right<00:00:39.149> now<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.870> had<00:00:40.140> no<00:00:40.170> idea<00:00:40.500> what<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
right now I really had no idea what I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
right now I really had no idea what I
should<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:42.149> still<00:00:42.600> working<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.020> my<00:00:43.200> master

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
should do I'm still working on my master

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
should do I'm still working on my master
set<00:00:43.800> did<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> that's<00:00:44.700> probably<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.570> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
set did and that's probably not going to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.360 
set did and that's probably not going to
be<00:00:45.690> done<00:00:45.960> until<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.469> few<00:00:46.800> weeks<00:00:46.860> after<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
be done until a few weeks after I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.619 
be done until a few weeks after I
graduate<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.360> mid-december

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
just really working on and it's just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.970 
just really working on and it's just
taking<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.590> there's<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
taking a lot of time because there's so

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.610 
taking a lot of time because there's so
many<00:00:56.100> cards<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:56.969> scanned<00:00:57.329> in

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
many cards that need to be scanned in

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.660 
many cards that need to be scanned in
before<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> had<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.100> completed<00:00:59.579> my

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
before I had actually completed my

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
before I had actually completed my
collection<00:01:00.149> though<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.539> had<00:01:00.750> started<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
collection though I had started kind of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.609 
collection though I had started kind of
planning<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.329> something<00:01:03.329> big<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
planning out something big to do that I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
planning out something big to do that I
thought<00:01:04.979> would<00:01:05.129> guarantee<00:01:05.400> me<00:01:05.760> getting<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
thought would guarantee me getting a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700 
thought would guarantee me getting a
partnership<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.170> didn't<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
partnership because I didn't think I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
partnership because I didn't think I
qualify<00:01:08.220> for<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.780> channel<00:01:10.140> had

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
qualify for it the way my channel had

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
qualify for it the way my channel had
stood<00:01:10.500> back<00:01:10.740> then<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.299> my<00:01:12.420> three<00:01:12.659> thousand

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
stood back then so for my three thousand

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
stood back then so for my three thousand
subscriber<00:01:13.500> video<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.920> thought<00:01:14.490> I'd<00:01:14.700> give<00:01:14.880> kind

later<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> spring<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:34.920> my

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
later in the spring so as you can see my

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.270 
later in the spring so as you can see my
background<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.560> non-existent<00:01:37.560> completely

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
background is non-existent completely

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.740 
background is non-existent completely
empty<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> booster<00:01:39.540> boxes<00:01:40.130> wrappers

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
empty all the booster boxes wrappers

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
empty all the booster boxes wrappers
everything<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.439> completely

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
everything that was up is completely

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.310 
everything that was up is completely
gone<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> what<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> back<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.020> desk

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
gone this is what the back of my desk

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.370 
gone this is what the back of my desk
looks<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.100> nothing<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
looks like with nothing on it and the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.139 
looks like with nothing on it and the
reason<00:01:49.740> why<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.119> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
reason why it's this way is so that I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
reason why it's this way is so that I
would<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.509> plenty<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.960> room<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.530> show<00:01:53.280> some

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
would have plenty of room to show some

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.190 
would have plenty of room to show some
of<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> things<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.149> I'll<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.509> doing<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
of the things that I'll be doing in the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.280
