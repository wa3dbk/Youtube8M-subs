 the few tribes live in me 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.650
 would make city dwellers jealous 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.490
 becomes the list of world heritage 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.990

 charity on the world heritage list 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.060
 to get 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.030
 that does not make your colony so special 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.450
 after 200 years ago there was a huge one 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.460
 poverty in the cities became French 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.560
 time to see where it can lead 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.990
 the storming of the bastille and the 1 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.520
 liters was then eliminated in the 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.080
 the netherlands sailors saw the hour of god 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.459
 we have to do something about that 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.310
 the society of 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.370

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.740
 from the cities a new future on it 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.090
 country indicate that began here 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.610
 in drenthe 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.780

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.400
 piece of Friesland 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.200
 but also in Flanders are two colony 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.000
 and founded 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.030
 what really makes it so special is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
 that there are here in a retirement home 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.360

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.750
 welfare state in the dutch for one 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.220
 Flanders already has 100 compulsory education 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.459
 years before the country was 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.950

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.900

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.190
 health insurance you did in the marsan 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.340
 you make a certain contribution to the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.880
 medical expenses 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.620

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.350
 to dream 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.120
 they came from short and moist cellars 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.880
 suddenly end up in a healthy one 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.980
 living environment and who's poor 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.760
