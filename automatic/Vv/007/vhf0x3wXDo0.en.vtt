00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.340
 our previous arsi blog.nl item was ringing 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.040
 flying the first person view with a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.200
 that Jay Phantom 2 with Rem us a 3 3d 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.140
 gimple and gopro hero 3 plus action 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.900
 camera in that video we also indicated that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.640
 anyone with a zenmuse h33t kindle and 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.739
 real pv system suffers from 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.170
 horizontal lines on the analog with 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.989
 look at picture or maybe last day 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.489
 more than the other but remains irritating 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.230
 Fortunately the video recording is 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.000
 just go well 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.550
 the zenmuse h33 blanket loaded 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.350
 gopro camera while flying on 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.260
 handy but it comes at the expense of 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.270
 your phantoms battery and therefore your flight time 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.399
 but it also turns out to be the culprit 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.800
 of those horizontal lines 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.450
 so embryos h3 3d gopro late circuit 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.479
 therefore causes visible malfunctions 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.960
 in your really buffy live image and there is one 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.970
 solution 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.270
 at least if you don't mind you 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.280
 his muse h33t gopro no longer late 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.750
 advantage that does not go with the costs 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.610
 for your phantom battery 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 disadvantage you have to make sure that your goPro 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.479
 we are always charged 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.729
 live with it 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.679
 what you do is get the mini next 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.470
 usb connectors from the zenmuse from the 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.060
 gopro hero 3 or hero 3 plus 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.610
 then release the black lock on the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.200
 mini usb connector plate up so you 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.470
 zen muse flat cable from it 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 mini usb it lets you loose then 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.830
 just need normal tape 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.229
 the tape this is then your send us a 3 3d 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.330
 flat cable with the 14 inside facing you 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.759
 so aim the excellent piece at the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.130
 right side of all those pins are the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.020
 left two the earth and the video signal 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.569
 so needed for the video out direction 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.979
 your ep video center 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.660
 what we do now is with a piece 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.310
 tape over the remaining 12 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.750
 pins so that only the first two 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.830
 pins bared on the left 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.390
 stay 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.520
 make sure you are really the first two 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.400
 pins completely bared and the rest 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 press down well tape well 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.450
 so that looks like this 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.959
 then put the flat cable back into it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.160
 mini usb board as if nothing happened 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.599
 is 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.640
 be more careful with the tape you 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.010
 therefore it also had to be thin tape 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.410
 are to fit well again 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.120
 mini usb plug back in the gopro and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.130
 when turning on your phantom you will 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.190
 notice that the gopro camera now no longer 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.140
 is charged by the zenmuse symbol 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.569
 but the real example image is just this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.730
 with horizontal stripes 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.959
 leave this without horizontal stripes 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.030
 gone 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.019
 okay of course it falls more on camera 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.700
 not very good to see 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.260
 naturally the camera picks up a lot 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.360
 LCD frequency flicker 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 display with us but believe us as we 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.920
 say that result to the naked eye 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.329
 is much better if we have a moment 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.650
 go back to what it was like for this one 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.420
 adjustment 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.549
 if you look closely you can see the horizontal 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.349
 lines tear across the screen 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.349
 visible from this angle 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.569
 the lower part of the screen 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.489
 instore and the lines are now gone and 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.190
 that blink what the camera sees 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.959
 the human eye is not as happy 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.239
 now fly first person view 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.130
 with better image if you want to go back to 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.810
 how it was and your copro with the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.430
 gimbal is loaded then you get it 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.870
 you just put away the tape again 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.120
 the lines will of course be again 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.340
 come back but once again finds the one 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.079
 it a bigger problem than the other 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150
 it is for the fp4 image through glasses 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.620
 difference is even more noticeable 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.230
 so we leave the tape nice 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.350
 we hope you like this tip 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.940
 have a lot of fp4 flight fun and subscribe
