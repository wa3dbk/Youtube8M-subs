in<00:00:03.810> today's<00:00:04.110> video<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> be

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
in today's video we're going to be

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.460 
in today's video we're going to be
talking<00:00:05.250> about<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.910> water<00:00:06.660> temperature<00:00:07.259> can

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
talking about how water temperature can

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.040 
talking about how water temperature can
have<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> big<00:00:08.670> impact<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.360> our<00:00:09.420> African

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
have a big impact on our African

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.709 
have a big impact on our African
cichlids<00:00:10.440> behavior<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.610> regards<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> breeding

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
cichlids behavior in regards to breeding

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.730 
cichlids behavior in regards to breeding
and<00:00:13.440> also<00:00:13.950> aggression<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.960> lot<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.080> people<00:00:16.500> have

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and also aggression a lot of people have

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.250 
and also aggression a lot of people have
been<00:00:17.160> asking<00:00:17.550> me<00:00:17.609> how's<00:00:18.119> your<00:00:18.150> tank<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:18.840> calm

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
been asking me how's your tank so calm

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.400 
been asking me how's your tank so calm
yes<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.460> selected<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:21.090> different<00:00:21.720> types<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
yes I have selected a different types of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.670 
yes I have selected a different types of
breeds<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.920> mbuna<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.789> basically<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.840> reduce

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
breeds of mbuna to basically to reduce

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
breeds of mbuna to basically to reduce
the<00:00:26.640> amount<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> aggression<00:00:27.390> as<00:00:27.510> much<00:00:27.660> as

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
the amount of aggression as much as

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.999 
the amount of aggression as much as
possible<00:00:28.519> but<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> little<00:00:29.910> trick<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> use

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
possible but the little trick that I use

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
possible but the little trick that I use
has<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.610> water<00:00:32.790> temperature<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.260> stay

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
has to do with water temperature so stay

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.350 
has to do with water temperature so stay
tuned<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> video<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.520> hopefully<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
tuned to the video and hopefully you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.520 
tuned to the video and hopefully you
might<00:00:36.540> learn<00:00:36.690> something<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.260> pick<00:00:37.410> up

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
might learn something to pick up

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
might learn something to pick up
something<00:00:37.739> along<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.120> might

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
something along the way that might

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.569 
something along the way that might
benefit<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.170> tank<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.739> what

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
benefit you in your tank so what

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.240 
benefit you in your tank so what
temperature<00:00:42.030> should<00:00:42.059> our<00:00:42.300> water<00:00:42.540> be

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
temperature should our water be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.080 
temperature should our water be
basically<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.399> need<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:44.789> into

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
basically you need to take into

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.779 
basically you need to take into
consideration<00:00:46.160> where<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> fish<00:00:47.489> should<00:00:47.610> come

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
consideration where the fish should come

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.990 
consideration where the fish should come
from<00:00:48.140> basically<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.070> tank<00:00:50.520> bred<00:00:50.760> or

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
from basically if they are tank bred or

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.779 
from basically if they are tank bred or
f1<00:00:51.539> or<00:00:51.780> wild<00:00:52.199> call<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.039> need<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.250> speak<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.670> the

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
f1 or wild call you need to speak to the

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.959 
f1 or wild call you need to speak to the
people<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.449> bred<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:56.250> also<00:00:56.460> give<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
people are bred them this also give you

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.130 
people are bred them this also give you
an<00:00:57.059> indication<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:57.870> sort<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
an indication of what sort of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
an indication of what sort of
temperature<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.829> tank<00:00:59.160> should<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.170> now

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
temperature your tank should be at now

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
temperature your tank should be at now
if<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.710> look<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.760> temperature<00:01:03.090> at

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
if you look at the the temperature at

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.960 
if you look at the the temperature at
Lake<00:01:03.870> Malawi<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.680> instance<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Lake Malawi for instance they have a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.690 
Lake Malawi for instance they have a
surface<00:01:06.360> temperature<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.990> between<00:01:07.700> 24

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
surface temperature of between 24

degrees Celsius to 29 degrees Celsius

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.789 
degrees Celsius to 29 degrees Celsius
for<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.299> purpose<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.930> video<00:01:13.290> I'll<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.710> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
for the purpose of this video I'll do it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
for the purpose of this video I'll do it
in<00:01:13.890> degrees<00:01:14.189> Celsius<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> screen

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
in degrees Celsius but on the screen

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
in degrees Celsius but on the screen
when<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:16.080> I'll<00:01:16.439> also<00:01:16.650> put<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> into

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
when I can I'll also put it into

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.249 
when I can I'll also put it into
Fahrenheit<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.420> help<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> people<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.170> are

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
Fahrenheit to help the people that are

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.320 
Fahrenheit to help the people that are
not<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.740> UK<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.520> people<00:01:20.970> who<00:01:21.060> use

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
not from the UK or people who use

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.530 
not from the UK or people who use
Fahrenheit<00:01:21.869> instead<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> degrees<00:01:22.590> Celsius

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
now a deeper depths in lake malawi

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.760 
now a deeper depths in lake malawi
the<00:01:26.580> temperature<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.240> drop<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.780> low<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.020> 20

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the temperature can drop to as low as 20

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.850 
the temperature can drop to as low as 20
degrees<00:01:28.799> celsius<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.470> most<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> watching

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
degrees celsius now most of you watching

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
degrees celsius now most of you watching
this<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.610> understand<00:01:33.259> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this will probably understand that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
this will probably understand that
higher<00:01:34.650> temperatures<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.460> our<00:01:35.610> aquarium<00:01:36.270> is

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
higher temperatures in our aquarium is

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.569 
higher temperatures in our aquarium is
going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> encourage<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> lot<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:38.040> aggression

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
going to encourage a lot more aggression

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.819 
going to encourage a lot more aggression
but<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.119> also<00:01:39.329> trigger<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.110> lot<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.530> breeding

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
but can also trigger a lot more breeding

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.950 
but can also trigger a lot more breeding
activity<00:01:41.369> basically<00:01:42.180> high<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
activity basically high in the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.870 
activity basically high in the
temperature<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.590> tank<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.490> speed<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
temperature of your tank will speed up

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.690 
temperature of your tank will speed up
the<00:01:44.909> metabolism<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> fish<00:01:46.159> this<00:01:47.159> result

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the metabolism of the fish this result

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.310 
the metabolism of the fish this result
in<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> bit<00:01:48.119> more<00:01:48.390> aggression<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> aquarium

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in a bit more aggression in the aquarium

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.999 
in a bit more aggression in the aquarium
but<00:01:50.009> also<00:01:50.189> hungry<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> fish<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.590> faster<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but also hungry a fish the faster that

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
but also hungry a fish the faster that
metabolism<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.240> fish

you<00:02:45.030> could<00:02:45.209> be<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.630> place<00:02:45.810> where<00:02:46.140> it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
you could be in a place where it's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.860 
you could be in a place where it's
freezing<00:02:46.800> all<00:02:47.010> year<00:02:47.250> round<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.720> take

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
freezing all year round so you just take

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.420 
freezing all year round so you just take
that<00:02:48.900> into<00:02:49.110> consideration<00:02:49.230> when<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.100> comes<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
that into consideration when it comes to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.810 
that into consideration when it comes to
adjusting<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.910> heating<00:02:51.239> on<00:02:51.480> your<00:02:51.870> tank<00:02:52.820> so

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
adjusting the heating on your tank so

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.160 
adjusting the heating on your tank so
other<00:02:54.239> things<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.720> take<00:02:54.900> into<00:02:55.080> consideration

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
other things to take into consideration

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.840 
other things to take into consideration
if<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.519> want<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.850> tank<00:02:57.150> full<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.850> breeding

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
if you want a tank full of breeding

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.940 
if you want a tank full of breeding
activity<00:03:00.390> you've<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.380> best<00:03:01.739> off

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
activity you've probably best off

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.860 
activity you've probably best off
increasing<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.550> temperature<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.269> tank

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
increasing the temperature of your tank

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.900 
increasing the temperature of your tank
ever<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.380> slightly<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.370> could<00:03:05.489> do<00:03:05.670> this

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
ever so slightly you could do this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.060 
ever so slightly you could do this
gradually<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.840> over<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> set<00:03:07.530> amount<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.860> time

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
gradually and over a set amount of time

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.759 
gradually and over a set amount of time
if<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.120> straight<00:03:09.930> away<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.350> increase<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
if you go straight away and increase the

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.350 
if you go straight away and increase the
temperature<00:03:11.100> say<00:03:11.430> about<00:03:11.700> 4<00:03:12.000> degrees<00:03:12.330> Celsius

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
temperature say about 4 degrees Celsius

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.229 
temperature say about 4 degrees Celsius
or<00:03:12.989> 5<00:03:13.200> degree<00:03:13.470> Celsius<00:03:13.680> overnight<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:15.000> could

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
or 5 degree Celsius overnight it could

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.990 
or 5 degree Celsius overnight it could
have<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> problem<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.470> your<00:03:16.650> tank<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> need

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
have a problem in your tank so you need

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.900 
have a problem in your tank so you need
to<00:03:18.180> set<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> temperature<00:03:18.930> slightly

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
to set the temperature slightly

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.160 
to set the temperature slightly
increments<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.120> monitor<00:03:21.570> your<00:03:21.660> fish<00:03:21.959> and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
increments and monitor your fish and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.640 
increments and monitor your fish and
behavior<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:24.150> in<00:03:24.329> previous<00:03:24.720> videos<00:03:25.049> just<00:03:25.350> for

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
behavior now in previous videos just for

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.539 
behavior now in previous videos just for

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
example my breeding tips video I talked

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.490 
example my breeding tips video I talked
about<00:03:29.700> doing<00:03:30.209> cold<00:03:30.570> water<00:03:30.750> water<00:03:31.049> changes

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
about doing cold water water changes

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.080 
about doing cold water water changes
that<00:03:31.739> sort<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.010> triggers<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> fish<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.820> breed

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that sort of triggers the fish to breed

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.240 
that sort of triggers the fish to breed
just<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.959> in<00:03:34.110> Lake<00:03:34.320> Malawi<00:03:34.620> through<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> dry

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
just like in Lake Malawi through the dry

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.000 
just like in Lake Malawi through the dry
periods<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.239> then<00:03:36.690> a<00:03:36.720> big<00:03:37.019> downpour<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> rain

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
periods and then a big downpour of rain

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.490 
periods and then a big downpour of rain
it<00:03:38.370> might<00:03:38.850> sort<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.329> lower<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.079> temperature

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
it might sort of lower the temperature

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.650 
it might sort of lower the temperature
ever<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.860> slightly<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.820> certain<00:03:42.209> depth<00:03:42.420> in<00:03:42.570> a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
ever so slightly to a certain depth in a

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.080 
ever so slightly to a certain depth in a
lake<00:03:42.950> but<00:03:43.950> another<00:03:44.400> thing<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:44.700> got<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.910> take

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
lake but another thing we got to take

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.509 
lake but another thing we got to take
into<00:03:45.450> into<00:03:46.019> consideration<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.829> these<00:03:47.250> fish

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
into into consideration is these fish

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.020 
into into consideration is these fish
are<00:03:47.820> in<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.269> confined<00:03:48.780> space<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:50.130> if<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.880> are

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
are in a confined space so if you are

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.640 
are in a confined space so if you are
increasing<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.630> temperature<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.410> you're

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
increasing the temperature and you're

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.160 
increasing the temperature and you're
increasing<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.130> aggression<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.730> fish

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
increasing the aggression in the fish

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.569 
increasing the aggression in the fish
you're<00:03:55.170> also<00:03:55.320> going<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> run<00:03:56.040> into<00:03:56.160> problems

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you're also going to run into problems

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.280 
you're also going to run into problems
that<00:03:56.730> these<00:03:56.820> fish<00:03:57.120> haven't<00:03:57.870> got<00:03:57.959> much<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.230> an

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
that these fish haven't got much of an

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.410 
that these fish haven't got much of an
area<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.920> get<00:03:59.070> away<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.970> taken<00:04:00.329> in

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
area to get away and taken in

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.240 
area to get away and taken in
consideration<00:04:00.570> again<00:04:01.290> about<00:04:01.650> how<00:04:01.799> hiding

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
consideration again about how hiding

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.020 
consideration again about how hiding
places<00:04:02.489> etc<00:04:03.209> etc<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:05.040> when<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.310> comes<00:04:05.579> to

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
places etc etc but when it comes to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.030 
places etc etc but when it comes to
having<00:04:06.690> more<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.200> platter<00:04:07.440> tank<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.890> more

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
having more of a platter tank a more

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.699 
having more of a platter tank a more
relaxed<00:04:08.340> tank<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.760> find<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.870> keeping<00:04:10.109> my<00:04:10.380> tank

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
relaxed tank I find that keeping my tank

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.390 
relaxed tank I find that keeping my tank
at<00:04:10.890> 24<00:04:11.280> degrees<00:04:11.670> Celsius<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:12.480> ample<00:04:13.410> as<00:04:14.190> you

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
at 24 degrees Celsius is ample as you

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.250 
at 24 degrees Celsius is ample as you
can<00:04:14.519> see<00:04:14.670> behind<00:04:14.820> me<00:04:15.150> yeah<00:04:15.690> they<00:04:15.900> will<00:04:16.019> chase

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
can see behind me yeah they will chase

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.380 
can see behind me yeah they will chase
each<00:04:16.470> other<00:04:16.650> there<00:04:16.890> is<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.010> few<00:04:17.280> fish<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:18.150> some

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
each other there is a few fish with some

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.479 
each other there is a few fish with some
fin<00:04:18.660> problems<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> moment<00:04:19.620> I<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> full

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
fin problems at the moment I have a full

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.180 
fin problems at the moment I have a full
up<00:04:20.609> bear<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> bonny<00:04:21.209> eye<00:04:21.500> female<00:04:22.500> with<00:04:22.950> some

up bear for a bonny eye female with some

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.830 
up bear for a bonny eye female with some
slight<00:04:23.490> damage<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.060> her<00:04:24.150> fin<00:04:24.360> now<00:04:24.539> but<00:04:24.750> I've

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
slight damage to her fin now but I've

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.490 
slight damage to her fin now but I've
treated<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.380> tank<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.860> she's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
treated the tank and she's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.900 
treated the tank and she's
the<00:04:26.680> mend<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.590> conclude<00:04:29.770> if<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.700> want<00:04:30.850> a

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
the mend so to conclude if you want a

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.970 
the mend so to conclude if you want a
nice<00:04:31.150> relaxed<00:04:31.720> tank<00:04:31.930> try<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.710> keep<00:04:32.800> the

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
nice relaxed tank try and keep the

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.100 
nice relaxed tank try and keep the
temperature<00:04:33.460> low<00:04:33.640> but<00:04:34.300> not<00:04:34.480> too<00:04:34.690> low<00:04:34.900> I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
temperature low but not too low I

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.320 
temperature low but not too low I
wouldn't<00:04:35.530> go<00:04:35.620> any<00:04:35.830> lower<00:04:36.040> than<00:04:36.220> 23<00:04:37.030> degrees

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
wouldn't go any lower than 23 degrees

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.860 
wouldn't go any lower than 23 degrees
Celsius

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
Celsius

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.800 
Celsius
remember<00:04:38.590> that's<00:04:38.740> over<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.550> long<00:04:40.000> period<00:04:40.570> you

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
remember that's over a long period you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.380 
remember that's over a long period you
reduce<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.380> temperature<00:04:41.820> ever<00:04:42.820> so<00:04:43.090> slightly

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
reduce the temperature ever so slightly

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.920 
reduce the temperature ever so slightly
and<00:04:43.770> gradually<00:04:44.770> monitor<00:04:45.700> your<00:04:45.850> tank<00:04:46.150> if<00:04:46.750> you

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and gradually monitor your tank if you

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.530 
and gradually monitor your tank if you
want<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.200> try<00:04:47.410> it<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.280> bit<00:04:48.490> higher<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:49.060> see<00:04:49.480> if

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
want to try it a bit higher and see if

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.580 
want to try it a bit higher and see if
you<00:04:49.600> can<00:04:49.750> trigger<00:04:49.930> some<00:04:50.110> more<00:04:50.260> breeding

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
you can trigger some more breeding

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.440 
you can trigger some more breeding
behavior<00:04:50.710> again<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:51.880> do<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.030> slowly

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
behavior again you do it slowly

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.870 
behavior again you do it slowly
gradually<00:04:53.110> over<00:04:53.500> time<00:04:53.530> monitoring<00:04:54.220> your<00:04:54.370> tank

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
gradually over time monitoring your tank

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.520 
gradually over time monitoring your tank
now<00:04:55.240> remember<00:04:55.690> when<00:04:55.870> you're<00:04:55.990> increasing<00:04:56.350> the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
now remember when you're increasing the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.380 
now remember when you're increasing the
temperature<00:04:56.830> of<00:04:57.070> your<00:04:57.190> tank<00:04:57.430> these<00:04:58.060> fish<00:04:58.300> are

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
temperature of your tank these fish are

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.180 
temperature of your tank these fish are
gonna<00:04:58.510> get<00:04:58.660> hungry<00:04:58.919> because<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.070> ho

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
gonna get hungry because the ho

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.310 
gonna get hungry because the ho
metabolism<00:05:00.820> rate<00:05:01.540> basically<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.080> going

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
metabolism rate basically is going

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.770 
metabolism rate basically is going
through<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.590> roof<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.580> take<00:05:03.790> that<00:05:03.880> aeration

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
through the roof so take that aeration

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.350 
through the roof so take that aeration
as<00:05:04.900> well<00:05:05.550> so<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.580> hope<00:05:06.700> this<00:05:06.820> video<00:05:06.970> is<00:05:07.210> being
