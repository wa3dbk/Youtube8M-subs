00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
like in basketball and the other runs

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.290 
like in basketball and the other runs
clear<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.700> coverage

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
clear of the coverage

now<00:00:41.140> let's<00:00:41.620> look<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.100> whiteboard<00:00:42.340> at<00:00:42.820> the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
now let's look on the whiteboard at the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.260 
now let's look on the whiteboard at the
technique<00:00:43.570> of<00:00:43.780> running<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:44.140> pick<00:00:44.350> play<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
technique of running a pick play the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.480 
technique of running a pick play the
concept<00:00:46.750> is<00:00:46.900> simple<00:00:47.230> have<00:00:47.650> one<00:00:48.010> receiver

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
concept is simple have one receiver

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.640 
concept is simple have one receiver
impede<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.390> defender<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.020> coverage<00:00:50.440> on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
impede the defender and coverage on

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.610 
impede the defender and coverage on
another<00:00:51.010> receiver<00:00:51.460> in<00:00:52.300> this<00:00:52.630> play<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.380> pick

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
another receiver in this play the pick

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.010 
another receiver in this play the pick
receiver<00:00:54.040> releases<00:00:54.820> first<00:00:55.090> bringing<00:00:55.900> the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
receiver releases first bringing the

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.170 
receiver releases first bringing the
coverage<00:00:56.410> with<00:00:56.650> him<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.400> intended<00:00:57.850> receiver

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
coverage with him the intended receiver

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.720 
coverage with him the intended receiver
delays<00:00:58.900> slightly<00:00:59.680> so<00:01:00.070> the<00:01:00.160> pick<00:01:00.370> receiver

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
delays slightly so the pick receiver

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.330 
delays slightly so the pick receiver
could<00:01:01.000> get<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.270> position<00:01:01.690> then<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.890> intended

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
could get in position then the intended

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.369 
could get in position then the intended
receiver<00:01:03.640> pulls<00:01:04.059> his<00:01:04.360> defender<00:01:04.839> into<00:01:05.080> the

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
receiver pulls his defender into the

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.170 
receiver pulls his defender into the
pick<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.950> runs<00:01:06.520> free

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
pick and runs free

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.270 
pick and runs free
some<00:01:09.020> cultures<00:01:09.350> call<00:01:09.470> this<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.710> rubber<00:01:10.040> out

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
some cultures call this a rubber out

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.060 
some cultures call this a rubber out
when<00:01:11.120> you<00:01:11.240> coach<00:01:11.510> this<00:01:11.810> remind<00:01:12.350> players<00:01:12.770> that

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
when you coach this remind players that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.650 
when you coach this remind players that
the<00:01:13.160> pick<00:01:13.340> receiver<00:01:13.700> cannot<00:01:14.150> block<00:01:14.450> the

the pick receiver cannot block the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.300 
the pick receiver cannot block the
defender<00:01:15.050> but<00:01:15.260> can<00:01:15.440> merely<00:01:15.650> complete<00:01:16.160> the

defender but can merely complete the

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
hook in the defenders path also any

hook in the defenders path also any
contact<00:01:19.940> must<00:01:20.330> seem<00:01:20.810> incidental<00:01:21.710> actually

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
contact must seem incidental actually

contact<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.060> not<00:01:23.090> required<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.780> make<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.020> work

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
contact is not required to make it work

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.020 
contact is not required to make it work
you<00:01:24.440> just<00:01:24.980> want<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.310> defender<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.760> go<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
you just want the defender to go the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.810 
you just want the defender to go the
long<00:01:26.270> way<00:01:26.300> around<00:01:26.660> your<00:01:27.140> route<00:01:27.310> but<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.790> sure

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
long way around your route but be sure

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.820 
long way around your route but be sure
to<00:01:29.210> sell<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.660> hook<00:01:29.840> with<00:01:30.110> hands<00:01:30.470> up<00:01:30.590> for<00:01:30.770> the

to sell the hook with hands up for the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.440 
to sell the hook with hands up for the
catch<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.280> eyes<00:01:31.760> locked<00:01:32.180> on<00:01:32.330> your
