yeah with this a average personally with

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.390 
yeah with this a average personally with
this<00:04:17.630> there's<00:04:18.140> no<00:04:18.200> debate<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:18.860> just<00:04:19.160> score

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
this there's no debate it's just score

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.910 
this there's no debate it's just score
here<00:04:19.730> you<00:04:19.760> go<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.270> agree<00:04:21.170> average<00:04:21.560> that's<00:04:21.770> all

here you go I agree average that's all
it<00:04:22.010> matters<00:04:22.130> but<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.490> lot<00:04:22.640> of<00:04:22.670> people<00:04:22.790> say

it matters but a lot of people say

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.430 
it matters but a lot of people say
you're<00:04:23.390> only<00:04:23.510> as<00:04:23.630> good<00:04:23.840> as<00:04:23.900> your<00:04:24.020> minimum

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
you're only as good as your minimum

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.030 
you're only as good as your minimum
right<00:04:25.400> now<00:04:26.270> we<00:04:26.330> have<00:04:26.540> a<00:04:26.570> couple<00:04:26.870> people

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
right now we have a couple people

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
comment that these new set series cards

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.500 
comment that these new set series cards
will<00:04:29.660> actually<00:04:30.080> boost<00:04:30.470> past<00:04:31.070> what<00:04:32.000> they<00:04:32.180> state

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
will actually boost past what they state

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.750 
will actually boost past what they state
and<00:04:33.080> price<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.500> i<00:04:33.560> right<00:04:33.710> no<00:04:34.220> that's<00:04:34.520> stupid

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
and price and i right no that's stupid

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.380 
and price and i right no that's stupid
but<00:04:35.620> you're<00:04:36.620> right<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:37.130> guys<00:04:37.370> are<00:04:37.550> right<00:04:37.730> um<00:04:38.300> i

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
but you're right you guys are right um i

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.570 
but you're right you guys are right um i
don't<00:04:38.960> like<00:04:39.140> admitting<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:39.680> because<00:04:40.040> you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
don't like admitting that because you

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.550 
don't like admitting that because you
know<00:04:40.670> i<00:04:40.700> got<00:04:41.000> my<00:04:41.120> face<00:04:41.330> but<00:04:41.930> if<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.140> look<00:04:42.320> down

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
know i got my face but if you look down

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.730 
know i got my face but if you look down
here<00:04:42.620> at<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.130> core<00:04:43.460> clock<00:04:43.670> says<00:04:44.330> rat<00:04:44.570> 250<00:04:45.500> or

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
here at the core clock says rat 250 or

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.370 
here at the core clock says rat 250 or
1215<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.800> it's<00:04:48.950> boosting<00:04:49.400> up<00:04:49.520> to<00:04:50.000> 12<00:04:50.660> 15<00:04:51.110> there

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
1215 so it's boosting up to 12 15 there

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.580 
1215 so it's boosting up to 12 15 there
what<00:04:51.770> about<00:04:52.010> higher

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
what about higher

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.040 
what about higher
what<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.310> frequency<00:04:54.000> says<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:54.960> only

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
what and the frequency says that only

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.270 
what and the frequency says that only
boosts<00:04:55.410> up<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.590> 10<00:04:55.830> 98<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.880> that's<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.870> know

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
boosts up to 10 98 so that's you know

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.130 
boosts up to 10 98 so that's you know
quite<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.340> bit<00:04:59.490> more<00:04:59.940> that's<00:05:00.510> that's<00:05:00.900> quite<00:05:01.110> a

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
quite a bit more that's that's quite a

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.740 
quite a bit more that's that's quite a
bit<00:05:01.350> more<00:05:01.590> so<00:05:02.250> yeah<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.120> guys<00:05:03.390> are<00:05:03.420> right

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
bit more so yeah you guys are right

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.150 
bit more so yeah you guys are right
that's<00:05:04.080> what<00:05:04.230> makes<00:05:04.380> overclocking<00:05:05.010> these

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that's what makes overclocking these

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.640 
that's what makes overclocking these
kind<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.670> difficult<00:05:06.090> yeah<00:05:06.510> we<00:05:07.200> just<00:05:07.320> went<00:05:07.500> for

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
kind of difficult yeah we just went for

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.930 
kind of difficult yeah we just went for
an<00:05:07.740> overcoat<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.100> run<00:05:08.340> right<00:05:08.460> before<00:05:08.790> this

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
an overcoat and run right before this

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.730 
an overcoat and run right before this
just<00:05:09.150> see<00:05:09.330> what<00:05:09.450> happened<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:09.960> we're<00:05:10.500> trying

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
just see what happened and we're trying

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.770 
just see what happened and we're trying
to<00:05:10.800> get<00:05:10.860> I<00:05:10.920> 1200<00:05:11.670> on<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.880> base<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.450> it's<00:05:12.630> going

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
to get I 1200 on the base and it's going

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.740 
to get I 1200 on the base and it's going
up<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.050> 14<00:05:13.530> /<00:05:14.190> 14<00:05:14.610> on<00:05:14.760> boosts<00:05:15.030> sometimes

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
up to 14 / 14 on boosts sometimes

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.740 
up to 14 / 14 on boosts sometimes
crashes<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:17.040> as<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.610> can<00:05:17.700> see<00:05:17.940> we<00:05:18.180> have<00:05:18.210> very

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
crashes so as you can see we have very

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.830 
crashes so as you can see we have very
little<00:05:19.050> cpu<00:05:19.770> bottlenecking<00:05:20.220> here<00:05:20.840> nothing

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
still a lot as consistent as Fermi's

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.180 
still a lot as consistent as Fermi's
were<00:05:29.910> but<00:05:30.300> doesn't<00:05:31.140> have<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.350> boost<00:05:31.590> problem

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.950 
were but doesn't have the boost problem
that's<00:05:32.430> what<00:05:32.730> I'm<00:05:33.030> gonna<00:05:33.180> call<00:05:33.420> it<00:05:33.540> a<00:05:33.600> problem

that's what I'm gonna call it a problem

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.330 
that's what I'm gonna call it a problem

looking at I feel pretty content with

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.070 
looking at I feel pretty content with
that<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:46.620> don't<00:05:46.860> yeah<00:05:47.010> i<00:05:47.220> mean<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:48.300> doesn't<00:05:48.780> seem

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
that I don't yeah i mean it doesn't seem

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.770 
that I don't yeah i mean it doesn't seem
like<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.560> big<00:05:50.040> enough<00:05:50.250> jump<00:05:50.760> to<00:05:51.120> me<00:05:51.300> my<00:05:51.600> book

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
like a a big enough jump to me my book

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.910 
like a a big enough jump to me my book
for<00:05:51.840> two<00:05:52.140> hundred<00:05:52.290> dollars<00:05:52.590> for<00:05:52.770> like<00:05:52.860> a

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
for two hundred dollars for like a

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.860

lightning<00:05:53.280> or<00:05:53.400> something<00:05:53.430> i<00:05:53.760> agree<00:05:54.150> i'd<00:05:54.570> have

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
lightning or something i agree i'd have

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.990 
lightning or something i agree i'd have
to<00:05:54.900> agree<00:05:55.050> on<00:05:55.200> that<00:05:55.530> but<00:05:55.770> i<00:05:56.370> think<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.640> pretty

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
to agree on that but i think that pretty

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.490 
to agree on that but i think that pretty
much<00:05:57.090> wraps<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.720> spit<00:05:57.930> up<00:05:58.020> let's<00:05:58.230> go<00:05:58.320> ahead<00:05:58.410> and

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
much wraps to spit up let's go ahead and

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.770 
much wraps to spit up let's go ahead and
move<00:05:58.620> on
