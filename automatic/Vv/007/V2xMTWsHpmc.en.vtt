00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.269
 I'll show you how it can be sealed 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.370
 wheel in traveling conditions before either 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.380
 went to glue the wheel 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 You will need here such eyes and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.100
 glue also we still like this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.019
 it is convenient to board something 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 wheel if you don't have just 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 use a screwdriver but if you're on 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.750

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.920

 prisu repair it to the forest on 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.219
 bike ride 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.780
 first let's take our 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.430
 bicycles turn upside down 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.120
 to make it easier to stick and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.120
 to rim the wheel 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.500
 I started let's take this thing and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.500
 we will wheel the wheel 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.930
 getting our camera out 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.140
 as you just noticed i got 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 I did not remove the camera from the wheel itself 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.050
 because I did not want to bother 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.640
 datomir nickname in the campaign you will not 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.320
 most key to cut off this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.910
 wheel after that when you got 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.860
 the camera from the wheel take the pump and 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.900
 Inflate this unit determinant ones 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.380
 your camera has been pierced here already found where 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.160
 punched cameras now take a match and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.160
 pull this camera down 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 if you are at home 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.560
 For skins, I budget the surface where 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.300
 you have a camera pierced but if you are 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.620
 is like and do not need to do that 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.840
 actually you will do it nothing 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.610
 after that when you cut the fat 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 surface we take a knife glue with this one 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.340
 Here's a set put on the camera where it is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340
 loss is broken 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.099
 Then he takes me with no glue to take our foot 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.200
 I am filming not the brilliant side now 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.270
 our foot glue here and we lay down on 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.270
 such a weight well or stifle grip 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.610
 if you are hiking you can 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.310
 put under a big heavy stone 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.380
 Now we are waiting for about 15 minutes guys 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.240

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.240

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.670

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.450
 a hole in our camera tray ourselves 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220
 stuck all they wanted that is done 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.940
 now let's insert the camera into the wheel and 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.940
 we will collect it 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.799
 now take and on to what is our wheel 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.299
 as you just saw i pumped up 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.129
 the wheel has gone about 20 minutes she is not 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.860
 let it down that means we are good 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.959

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.760
