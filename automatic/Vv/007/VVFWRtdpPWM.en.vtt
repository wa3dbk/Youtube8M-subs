00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
I finally finished mockingjay all in

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.970 
I finally finished mockingjay all in
quite<00:00:03.570> sure<00:00:03.840> how<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.259> gonna<00:00:04.500> end<00:00:04.770> I

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
quite sure how this is gonna end I

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.680 
quite sure how this is gonna end I
didn't<00:00:05.250> know<00:00:05.609> whether<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:06.029> was<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.480> be

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
didn't know whether it was going to be

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.310 
didn't know whether it was going to be
like<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.049> really<00:00:07.500> tragic<00:00:08.400> gory<00:00:09.059> ending<00:00:09.690> or<00:00:10.200> if

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
like a really tragic gory ending or if

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.870 
like a really tragic gory ending or if
it<00:00:10.440> was<00:00:10.500> going<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.740> be<00:00:10.830> like<00:00:11.010> when<00:00:11.070> I'm<00:00:11.340> really

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it was going to be like when I'm really

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.850 
it was going to be like when I'm really
boring<00:00:12.480> mushy<00:00:12.840> Hollywood<00:00:13.200> endings<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
boring mushy Hollywood endings and I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
boring mushy Hollywood endings and I
think<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.160> sort<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.389> did<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.660> well<00:00:15.780> in<00:00:15.929> fact

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
think it sort of did really well in fact

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.290 
think it sort of did really well in fact
it<00:00:16.410> wasn't<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.800> either<00:00:17.100> kind<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> really

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
it wasn't really either kind of really

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
it wasn't really either kind of really
showed<00:00:18.539> human<00:00:19.140> nature<00:00:19.680> sort<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> way

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
showed human nature sort of the way

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.220 
showed human nature sort of the way
people<00:00:20.699> acted<00:00:21.359> even<00:00:21.720> though<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.990> might<00:00:22.170> not

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
people acted even though we might not

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
people acted even though we might not
necessarily<00:00:22.769> want<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:23.939> would

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
necessarily want to think that we would

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.580 
necessarily want to think that we would
act<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.779> situation<00:00:24.840> we

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
act like that in that situation we

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.650 
act like that in that situation we
probably<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.400> thought<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> ending<00:00:27.599> was

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
probably would I thought the ending was

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.919 
probably would I thought the ending was
a<00:00:27.900> tiny<00:00:28.349> little<00:00:28.859> bit<00:00:29.369> predictable<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.480> little

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
a tiny little bit predictable a little

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
a tiny little bit predictable a little
bit<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.529> guess<00:00:31.830> halfway<00:00:32.099> through<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
bit I kind of guess halfway through that

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.950 
bit I kind of guess halfway through that
she<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.300> end<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.600> Peter<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
she was going to end up with Peter and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.650 
she was going to end up with Peter and
not<00:00:34.170> Gail<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.590> definitely<00:00:35.120> guest<00:00:36.120> halfway

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
not Gail I definitely guest halfway

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.920 
not Gail I definitely guest halfway
through<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:38.000> she<00:00:39.000> got<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> chance<00:00:39.510> she<00:00:39.809> would

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
through if she got the chance she would

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.459 
through if she got the chance she would
kill<00:00:40.260> her<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.370> drink<00:00:41.579> coin<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.750> snow<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
kill her first drink coin and not snow I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.069 
kill her first drink coin and not snow I
I<00:00:44.100> could<00:00:44.730> see<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.030> coming<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.450> mile<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.809> cuz

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I could see that coming a mile off cuz

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.490 
I could see that coming a mile off cuz
coins<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> psycho<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:48.180> evil<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.079> mean

coins just like a psycho to evil I mean
the<00:00:49.800> idea<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.280> starting<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.820> Hunger<00:00:51.210> Games

the idea of starting up the Hunger Games

harry<00:01:05.939> potter<00:01:06.270> ish<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.869> thought<00:01:07.560> Finnick<00:01:07.979> was

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
harry potter ish I thought Finnick was

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
harry potter ish I thought Finnick was
like<00:01:08.310> Lupin<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.090> says<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.540> he<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> died

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
like Lupin it says that he kind of died

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
like Lupin it says that he kind of died
and<00:01:10.500> let<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> child<00:01:10.950> behind<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.640> we'll<00:01:11.850> never

and let the child behind and we'll never

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.109 
and let the child behind and we'll never
get<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.390> his<00:01:12.510> child<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> their<00:01:14.580> minds<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
get to know his child so their minds of

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
get to know his child so their minds of
that<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.600> suffering<00:01:16.020> goes<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> on

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

reading<00:01:22.680> Harry<00:01:22.860> Potter<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.790> got<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> right

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
reading Harry Potter I got the right

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
reading Harry Potter I got the right
book<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:25.380> least<00:01:25.770> she<00:01:26.009> didn't<00:01:26.250> try<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.520> call

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
book at least she didn't try and call

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.840 
book at least she didn't try and call
the<00:01:26.790> child<00:01:27.030> primrose<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:28.020> oh<00:01:28.350> my<00:01:28.890> god<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.430> was

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the child primrose like oh my god I was

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
the child primrose like oh my god I was
just<00:01:30.000> waiting<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> never<00:01:31.049> came<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
just waiting for it and it never came I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
just waiting for it and it never came I
think<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> other<00:01:32.670> two<00:01:32.850> books<00:01:33.060> were

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
think I think the other two books were

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.929 
think I think the other two books were
stronger<00:01:34.020> maybe<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> first<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
stronger maybe I like the first one it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.289 
stronger maybe I like the first one it
just<00:01:36.060> got<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.450> idea<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.170> clever<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:38.490> not

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
just got the idea was so clever but not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969 
just got the idea was so clever but not
I<00:01:39.360> didn't<00:01:39.810> love<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> idea<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.920> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I didn't love this the idea of the
