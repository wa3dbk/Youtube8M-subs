online today and my channel was built on

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.029 
online today and my channel was built on
transformers<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> figured<00:00:25.500> it'd<00:00:25.619> be<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> cool

bunch<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> others<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.400> one<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> would<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.689> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
bunch of others on one that would I can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
bunch of others on one that would I can
honestly<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:14.250> Michael<00:01:14.670> Bay<00:01:14.790> bringing<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
honestly see Michael Bay bringing in a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
honestly see Michael Bay bringing in a
circuit<00:01:16.710> breaker<00:01:16.799> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.460> half

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
circuit breaker which is like half

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.460 
circuit breaker which is like half
transformer<00:01:18.600> half-human<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.439> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
transformer half-human it's like a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
transformer half-human it's like a
cyborg<00:01:19.979> character<00:01:20.900> but<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.080> think<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.880> think

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
cyborg character but I think I think

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
cyborg character but I think I think
that<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> characters<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.960> need

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that these are the characters that need

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.010 
that these are the characters that need
to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.530> brought<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.220> uh<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:27.479> transformers

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
we need the Dinobots vector prime

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.260 
we need the Dinobots vector prime
Unicron<00:01:37.110> come<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.729> only<00:01:38.909> makes<00:01:39.090> sense

come<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.619> raise<00:02:04.799> Megatron

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
come in to raise Megatron

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.070 
come in to raise Megatron
from<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.800> dead<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.310> you<00:02:08.210> know<00:02:08.390> transform<00:02:08.930> him

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
into Galvatron and it only makes sense

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.690 
into Galvatron and it only makes sense
and<00:02:11.480> Michael<00:02:11.810> Bay<00:02:11.960> he<00:02:12.800> denied<00:02:13.160> these<00:02:13.310> rumors
