 Today we will consider the most 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.050

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.550
 professional cosmetics holy land 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.550
 procedure begins with washing 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:58.559
 for this, I take funds suitable 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.640
 for this type of skin given 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.030
 drug contains 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.820
 Ichthyol which promote resorption 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 stagnant stains and renders 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.560
 anti-inflammatory effect besides 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.970
 it perfectly cleans the skin from superficial 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.970
 dirt and makeup 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.130
 now when skin is clean i will apply 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.800
 a special peeling as much as he is very soft and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.229
 gently peels off the top of the dead 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.790
 cells and promotes renewal 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:37.649
 epidermis evens out skin color and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.770
 relief gently holding the skin i 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.800
 roll peeling at this stage skin 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.930
 released from the upper stratum corneum 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.440
 which clogs pores are removed 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.950
 the tops of comedones ie black dots 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 and the skin is prepared for application 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:06.630
 subsequent drugs after rolling 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.970
 wash off peeling before applying the main 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.310
 serum peeling I will prepare the skin 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.310
 special warming lotion 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.470
 first 30 seconds 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.090
 the lotion causes a slight burning sensation which 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 replaced by a feeling of coolness 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.850
 lotion improves blood circulation in the skin 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.310
 thereby increasing absorbability 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.000
 the main peel to the same on this 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.740
 stage is the opening of the pores 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.500
 here we come to the main stages 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.200
 well-prepared skin treatments 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.290
 I am peeling serum which 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.989
 deep cleans pores apart from your 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.870
 deep cleansing peeling 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.480
 promotes skin regeneration strengthens 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.260
 vascular walls eliminates pigment 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 blemishes scars all this 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.770
 due to its rich composition 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.040
 peeling includes chamomile extract 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.010
 witch hazel green tea pomegranate figs and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.080
 grapes in the first 2-3 minutes peeling 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.930
 a little bit of a pinch then arises 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.190
 feeling of warmth on the skin 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.650
 15 minutes have passed wash off peeling now 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.019
 when grease plugs have dissolved 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.860
 I apply a special solution 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.890
 which has an oily structure it 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:39.650
 promotes better removal of comedones 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.730
 and the dispute is now not washing this solution 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.860
 I apply enzymatic peeling 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:53.230
 it has a very pleasant cheese smell 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.230
 as it contains cheeses 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.560
 dairy enzymes peeling works 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.489
 only in a wet environment so i will apply 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.489
 compress 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:25.830
 with this compress we will lie down for 10 minutes 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.830
 now remove the compress 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.000
 enzymatic peeling soothes the skin and 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.990
 removes redness 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.590
 now I roll the peel like the first 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.590
 ha smear 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:50.760
 at this stage mechanical 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:54.510
 removing grease plugs and spores 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.090
 at this stage the skin is already peeled pores 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.540
 pure left them only narrow down for 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:07.230
 This I put on a special mask which 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:11.250
 shrink pores and cleanse the skin and now 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:13.400
 lie down so 15-20 minutes now left 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.420
 wash off the mask and put the final 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:21.800
 lotions cream on this cleaning is over 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:28.370
 the completion of the procedure, apply lotion and 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:30.600
 final cream on this procedure 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.350
 ends and it lasted from us 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.560
 one and a half hours now let's ask 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:43.040
