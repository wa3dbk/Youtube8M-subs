00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.680
 for this chapter we are going to see together 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.719
 how to make a garment that girls 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.990
 sure at least once they will use 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.670
 which it is the college uniform in this case 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.740
 I did it doing up to the orb 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.900
 thematically it has a uniform of 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.509
 school with some modifications and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.759
 extra accessories no matter how you 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.590
 uniform the idea of ​​this chapter is that 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.489
 You can transform your mold to any 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.130
 design 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.470
 Let's start the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.570
 with a reference image nearby is my 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.550
 woman the design of the garment in this 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.010
 case the orb has combination of 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.810
 two colors of the shirt so what 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.330
 we will differentiate in the drawing both 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.950
 in front as back then you 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.500
 we put numbers to the parties that 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.300
 they make up the design and finally a 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.680
 the party is part to already have a 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.110
 idea of ​​how you are going to see teacher a 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.330
 mold and now what you feel lean a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.610
 mold on paper and carl heat once 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.800
 be ready, turn it into 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.140
 where the mold parts would start 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.790
 for example I do not get below my taste 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.590
 where I want the cut formed 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.170
 of the top piece and the other part 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.819
 of the mold and from that measure we draw 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 the way that in this case is like 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.670
 rounded 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 Now it's time to measure and pass the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.170
 measure of how far the space opens 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.090
 of the neck we mark it and we look for the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.220
 line always following as you consider 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.780
 to see the reference image now 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 it is the turn of the white stripe of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 mean we have to remember that the mold 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.070
 in the middle of what we are going to trace in 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.920
 the fabric then we will mark thinking 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.689
 in which then this piecita will be central and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.850
 will have double the width when grams 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.860
 on this side do not worry we're going to 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.110
 see in a little while when we have marked 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.000
 this line so we will have marked what 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.560
 which will be the red stripes so 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.679
 we will enumerate as we 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.569
 drawn not to be confused of the temple 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.310
 after that we are going to cut back so that 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.840
 then let's not lose ourselves to what 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.170
 corresponds is that each party cites the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.209
 mold and the same with the back we support 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.340
 the back mold that we finish and this 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.500
 I will support the cuts that they make 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.049
 the cut so that it is aligned what 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.850
 would be the red part after 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.350
 now we have our mold adapted 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.630
 let's see all the parts so that 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.519
 the we lose this piece bust 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.260
 we have in this mold that we will support with 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.600
 the fabric in half so that later we 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.310
 remain intact 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 then the two red stripes and cut 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.480
 twice the white part that is a 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.860
 small piece that when we cut with 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.980
 the hard fabric of the middle will remain 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.630
 the entire red part of the back that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.460
 we will also cut with the folded fabric 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.080
 in the middle so that it comes out whole 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.490
 then the mold cited from the part of 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.190
 up the skirt that I forgot here 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.140
 show now let's take the white cloth 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.880
 bent in two we affirm it with 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.470
 pins and we started to turn on the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.960
 molds that correspond to the parts 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.580
 white we mark everything around more or 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.380
 less than one centimeter of the mold with 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.780
 tailor's chalk to have margin for 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.390
 where we cut and cut now is the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.310
 turn of the red pieces is the same 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.470
 we support we undertake the molds we mark 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.210
 that we cut well here that everything 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 around we have enough margin of 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.770
 sewing now with sewing machine 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.360
 we can make zigzag points against 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.360
 edges so they do not fray 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.730
 realistic we're going to start putting the 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.130
 pieces together get more attached with the 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.990
 filler is in this case I chose to start by 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.540
 join the fringes that make up the part 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.190
 from under the food meet her and 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.240
 just there I put the top part 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.240
 to later count 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.430
 then we put her back and have 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.170
 careful in the part of the red stripe of 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.819
 the back and the front so that they remain 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.939
 well aligned and then only 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.829
 listen and ready soon I'll upload the 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.200
 second part where we will see the neck of 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.670
 sailor the mummies and let's reveal 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.099
 for the fairy tablet with a little tablecloth 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.349
 more complicated than the last time and so 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.909
 we will have our uniform ready if 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.500
 would have told me all for their beautiful 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.790
