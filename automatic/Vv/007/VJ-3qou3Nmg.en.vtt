00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
spawn them yourself but with that even

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.330 
spawn them yourself but with that even
when<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.430> die<00:01:08.610> they<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.909> drop<00:01:09.390> eggs<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.130> I

when they die they do drop eggs and I
will<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:12.200> TMI<00:01:13.200> which<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.580> TMI<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
will just use TMI which is not TMI but I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.510 
will just use TMI which is not TMI but I
will<00:01:16.320> quickly<00:01:16.500> bring<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
will quickly bring this up because I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
will quickly bring this up because I
want<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.820> spawn<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> few<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.600> these<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
want to spawn a few of these like

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.190 
want to spawn a few of these like
curling<00:01:19.439> groups<00:01:19.650> stacks<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.250> 16<00:01:20.580> apparently

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
curling groups stacks of 16 apparently

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.820
