really bad engine knock I was on

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.429 
really bad engine knock I was on
Interstate<00:00:19.289> 80<00:00:20.060> driving<00:00:21.199> started<00:00:22.199> hearing

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
Interstate 80 driving started hearing

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.279 
Interstate 80 driving started hearing
about<00:00:22.679> halfway<00:00:23.249> through<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.759> trip<00:00:24.109> 100<00:00:25.109> miles

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
about halfway through the trip 100 miles

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
about halfway through the trip 100 miles
later<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:26.069> I<00:00:26.579> was<00:00:27.539> ready<00:00:27.749> to<00:00:27.810> pull<00:00:27.989> off<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
later it's I was ready to pull off the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.339 
later it's I was ready to pull off the
road<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.679> was<00:00:28.919> getting<00:00:29.249> so<00:00:29.399> bad<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.539> got<00:00:31.319> on

road it was getting so bad so got on

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380 
road it was getting so bad so got on
line<00:00:31.649> started<00:00:32.189> reading<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:33.270> know

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
line started reading about you know

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.230 
line started reading about you know
piston<00:00:33.870> skirts<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> flexplate

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
piston skirts and you know the flexplate

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.080 
piston skirts and you know the flexplate
and<00:00:36.570> all<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.810> stuff<00:00:36.990> so<00:00:37.730> first<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
and all this stuff so first thing I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.330 
and all this stuff so first thing I
wanted<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.480> try<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.230> pull<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:40.800> oil<00:00:40.830> pan

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
wanted to try was to pull the oil pan

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 
wanted to try was to pull the oil pan
out<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:42.810> there<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.080> any<00:00:43.230> debris<00:00:43.590> down

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
out and see if there was any debris down

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
out and see if there was any debris down
there<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.820> think<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.480> would<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.750> pretty

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
there I think that would be a pretty

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.780 
there I think that would be a pretty
good<00:00:46.170> indication<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.310> the<00:00:47.430> piston

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
good indication that would be the piston

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.140 
good indication that would be the piston
skirt

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
skirt

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.970 
skirt

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so a couple hours into this now and I

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.250 
so a couple hours into this now and I
still<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.790> have<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.970> new<00:00:54.120> oil<00:00:54.150> pan<00:00:54.600> off<00:00:54.660> I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
still don't have a new oil pan off I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
still don't have a new oil pan off I
tell<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.280> before<00:00:57.150> I<00:00:57.420> am<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.980> doing<00:00:59.370> so

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
little pile over there I put them in the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.099 
little pile over there I put them in the
same<00:01:16.950> order<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.490> took<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.819> off<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:19.819> got

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
same order that I took them off I got

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.429 
same order that I took them off I got
the<00:01:22.109> oil<00:01:22.229> pan<00:01:23.509> nothing<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.810> holding<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.289> in

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the oil pan nothing really holding it in

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.819 
the oil pan nothing really holding it in
now<00:01:26.210> except<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.329> if<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.200> look<00:01:28.850> right<00:01:30.829> right

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
now except for if you look right right

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.870 
now except for if you look right right
here<00:01:32.340> you're<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.359> side<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.729> piece<00:01:35.729> of

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
here you're on the side of the piece of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.370 
here you're on the side of the piece of
the<00:01:35.969> transmission<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.020> even<00:01:37.200> really

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the transmission I'm not even really

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.379 
the transmission I'm not even really
sure<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> over<00:01:39.389> here<00:01:41.389> you're

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:42.389 
sure what that is and over here you're

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:50.149 
sure what that is and over here you're
right<00:01:42.719> on<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:46.279> exhaust<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.439> figured<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
right on the exhaust so I figured the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.069 
right on the exhaust so I figured the
only<00:01:50.219> way<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.819> this<00:01:50.969> oil<00:01:51.240> pan<00:01:51.539> out<00:01:51.569> of<00:01:51.779> here

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
only way to get this oil pan out of here

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.059 
only way to get this oil pan out of here
is<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.159> take<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.520> exhaust<00:01:53.939> off<00:01:54.709> which<00:01:55.709> is<00:01:55.889> up

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
is it take this exhaust off which is up

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:03.969 
is it take this exhaust off which is up
there<00:01:58.009> up<00:01:59.009> there<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.700> those<00:02:02.880> off

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
there up there to get those off

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.700 
there up there to get those off
so<00:02:04.670> I've<00:02:05.210> been<00:02:05.360> working<00:02:05.689> at<00:02:05.810> this<00:02:05.990> at<00:02:06.469> those

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
so I've been working at this at those

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.680 
so I've been working at this at those
couple<00:02:07.159> bolts<00:02:07.490> up<00:02:07.610> there<00:02:07.820> for<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> while

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
couple bolts up there for a while

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.600 
couple bolts up there for a while
pretty<00:02:09.679> sure<00:02:09.830> they're<00:02:10.009> 5/8<00:02:10.580> but<00:02:12.610> they're

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
pretty sure they're 5/8 but they're

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.430 
pretty sure they're 5/8 but they're
definitely<00:02:13.790> not<00:02:14.330> easy<00:02:14.629> to<00:02:14.959> get<00:02:15.200> off

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
definitely not easy to get off

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.070 
definitely not easy to get off
especially<00:02:16.099> from<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.459> bottom<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.120> top<00:02:17.690> I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
especially from the bottom and top I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.160 
especially from the bottom and top I
feel<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:19.069> only<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.390> harder<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.989> get<00:02:21.319> at

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
feel is only gonna be harder to get at

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.780 
feel is only gonna be harder to get at
right<00:02:24.170> now<00:02:24.470> going<00:02:24.920> through<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:25.340> head<00:02:25.550> I'm

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
right now going through my head I'm

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.440 
right now going through my head I'm
thinking<00:02:27.280> hell<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.489> taking<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:28.910> oil<00:02:29.180> pan

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
thinking hell with taking the oil pan

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.559 
thinking hell with taking the oil pan
off<00:02:29.720> let's<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:30.739> start<00:02:31.160> pulling<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.360> motor

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
off let's just start pulling the motor

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.380 
off let's just start pulling the motor
because<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.890> have<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.220> feeling<00:02:34.489> even<00:02:34.849> if<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.239> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
because I have a feeling even if it is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.360 
because I have a feeling even if it is
the<00:02:35.629> piston<00:02:35.989> skirt<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.590> gonna<00:02:36.769> be<00:02:36.950> easier<00:02:37.220> to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
the piston skirt it's gonna be easier to

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.479 
the piston skirt it's gonna be easier to
fix<00:02:37.610> with<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.180> motor<00:02:38.360> out<00:02:38.599> of<00:02:38.780> here<00:02:39.340> then<00:02:40.340> with

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
fix with the motor out of here then with

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.530 
fix with the motor out of here then with
the<00:02:40.580> motor<00:02:40.790> in<00:02:40.970> here<00:02:41.349> so<00:02:42.349> give<00:02:43.130> me<00:02:43.400> your

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the motor in here so give me your

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.970 
the motor in here so give me your
feedback<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.900> let<00:02:45.170> me<00:02:45.319> know<00:02:45.470> what<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.769> think
