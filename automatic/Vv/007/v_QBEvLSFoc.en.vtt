00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.290 

and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.350 

need<00:01:54.870> this<00:01:55.140> because<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.310> am<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.490> huge<00:01:56.970> fan<00:01:57.330> of

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
need this because I am a huge fan of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.550 
need this because I am a huge fan of
these<00:01:57.720> it's<00:01:58.710> Mandelbrot<00:02:00.860> which<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:03.560> basically

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
these it's Mandelbrot which is basically

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.030 
these it's Mandelbrot which is basically
a<00:02:05.270> computation<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.830> a<00:02:07.910> mathematical<00:02:09.920> form<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
a computation of a mathematical form of

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.970 
a computation of a mathematical form of
an<00:02:11.160> equation<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.820> suppose<00:02:12.440> they<00:02:13.440> don't<00:02:13.740> really

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
an equation I suppose they don't really

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.400 
an equation I suppose they don't really
remember<00:02:14.130> exactly<00:02:14.850> how<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> pronounce<00:02:15.420> or

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
remember exactly how to pronounce or

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.730 
remember exactly how to pronounce or
explain<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:18.690> basically<00:02:19.140> graphing

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
explain it but it's basically graphing

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.160 
explain it but it's basically graphing
an<00:02:19.890> equation<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.820> all<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> these<00:02:21.660> little

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
an equation so all of these little

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.660 
an equation so all of these little
swirls<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.040> stuff<00:02:24.170> are<00:02:25.170> graphing<00:02:25.740> something

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
swirls and stuff are graphing something

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.470 
swirls and stuff are graphing something
and<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.030> they<00:02:27.210> just<00:02:27.420> assigned<00:02:27.870> colors

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and then they just assigned colors

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.590 
and then they just assigned colors
according<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:30.930> mean<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.150> I<00:02:33.150> really

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
according to what they mean and I really

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.750 
according to what they mean and I really
really<00:02:33.780> really<00:02:34.110> love<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:37.190> I'm<00:02:38.190> making

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
really really love that one I'm making

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.410 
really really love that one I'm making
more<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.170> moment<00:02:41.540> just

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.819 

finished<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.129> don't<00:02:51.849> know<00:02:51.970> if<00:02:52.030> they're<00:02:52.829> hard

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
finished so I don't know if they're hard

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.580 
finished so I don't know if they're hard
enough<00:02:54.159> yet

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.500 

so<00:03:00.590> I<00:03:00.650> got<00:03:00.920> was<00:03:01.100> super<00:03:01.640> cute<00:03:01.880> it's<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.270> little

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
so I got was super cute it's a little

to<00:06:08.379> let<00:06:08.500> it<00:06:08.560> get<00:06:08.770> more<00:06:09.069> healthy<00:06:09.610> as<00:06:10.479> opposed<00:06:10.780> to

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
to let it get more healthy as opposed to

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.100 
to let it get more healthy as opposed to
bleaching<00:06:11.229> it<00:06:11.530> out<00:06:11.680> constantly<00:06:12.719> so<00:06:13.719> I'm<00:06:13.900> just

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
bleaching it out constantly so I'm just

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.689 
bleaching it out constantly so I'm just
going<00:06:14.259> to<00:06:14.349> let<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.560> stay<00:06:14.860> darker<00:06:15.250> for<00:06:15.490> a<00:06:15.520> while

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
going to let it stay darker for a while

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:17.700 
going to let it stay darker for a while
so<00:06:15.969> I<00:06:16.030> can<00:06:16.210> try<00:06:16.389> to<00:06:16.419> grow<00:06:16.780> it<00:06:16.930> back<00:06:16.960> out<00:06:17.379> because
