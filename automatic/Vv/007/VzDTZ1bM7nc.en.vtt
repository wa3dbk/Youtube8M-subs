resolutions but for shit's and gigs I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
resolutions but for shit's and gigs I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
thought I would just do it my new year's

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
thought I would just do it my new year's
resolution<00:01:35.070> honestly<00:01:35.640> though<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.119> stop

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
resolution honestly though is to stop

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.200 
resolution honestly though is to stop
being<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.110> perfect<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.950> mean<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.610> don't

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
being so perfect I mean like I don't

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.630 
being so perfect I mean like I don't
mean<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.509> sound<00:01:39.750> conceited<00:01:40.130> or<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.400> whatever

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
mean to sound conceited or like whatever

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.289 
mean to sound conceited or like whatever
but<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:44.130> really<00:01:44.369> hard<00:01:44.790> when<00:01:45.030> you're

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but like it's really hard when you're

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
but like it's really hard when you're
like<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.540> damn<00:01:46.110> perfect<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.950> compares

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
like this damn perfect and like compares

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.050 
like this damn perfect and like compares
himself<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.939> me<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:49.520> I'm<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.880> one

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
