00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
that these could be cute little button
dolls<00:01:40.110> for<00:01:40.409> trees<00:01:40.890> they<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.549> sit<00:01:41.790> in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
dolls for trees they can actually sit in

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.510 
dolls for trees they can actually sit in
the<00:01:41.880> tree<00:01:42.119> or<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:43.049> could<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:43.680> attach<00:01:44.130> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the tree or you could probably attach a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
the tree or you could probably attach a
little<00:01:45.149> ribbon<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.540> something<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.079> wanted

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
little ribbon or something if you wanted

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620 
little ribbon or something if you wanted
to<00:01:46.590> dangle<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.520> ornament<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
to dangle them like an ornament so I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
to dangle them like an ornament so I
thought<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.290> were<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.770> cute

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
thought they were just really cute

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
thought they were just really cute
pretty<00:01:50.880> they're<00:01:51.390> pretty<00:01:51.659> simple<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
pretty they're pretty simple but I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.160 
pretty they're pretty simple but I
remember<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> being<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.880> lot<00:01:54.210> faster<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
remember it being a lot faster of a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
remember it being a lot faster of a
process<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> made<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.430> before<00:01:56.579> so

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
process when I made them before so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.330 
process when I made them before so
definitely<00:01:57.810> add<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> practice<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
definitely add a practice but it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
definitely add a practice but it's
mostly<00:01:59.700> just<00:02:00.320> painting<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.439> hot<00:02:01.590> gluing<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
mostly just painting and hot gluing and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
mostly just painting and hot gluing and
you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.549> not<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> whole<00:02:03.060> lot<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.630> stuff

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you know not a whole lot of other stuff

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.670 
you know not a whole lot of other stuff
and<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> fabric<00:02:06.680> right

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.719 
and you can see this is a fabric right
here<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> little<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.640> of
