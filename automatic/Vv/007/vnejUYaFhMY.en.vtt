00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
you're going to focus on one length here

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.860 
you're going to focus on one length here
not<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> height<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> when<00:00:36.330> you<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.660> good

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
not the height so when you get this good

not the height so when you get this good
length<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.150> make<00:00:39.330> sure

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
length like this you want to make sure

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.030 
length like this you want to make sure
you<00:00:39.780> find<00:00:39.990> something<00:00:40.170> comfortable<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just kind of when you do a ollie you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
just kind of when you do a ollie you
just<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> straight<00:00:48.180> normal<00:00:48.750> alley<00:00:48.900> but

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
just do the straight normal alley but

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
just do the straight normal alley but
you<00:00:49.290> kind<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.560> to<00:00:49.710> push<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.040> board<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you kind of want to push your board have

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
you kind of want to push your board have
a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.330> bit<00:00:51.420> more<00:00:51.510> affordable<00:00:52.080> minimum

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
a little bit more affordable minimum

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
a little bit more affordable minimum
when<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> ollie<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.980> push<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.310> forward<00:00:53.340> more

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
when you ollie and push it forward more

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.570 
when you ollie and push it forward more
than<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.450> would<00:00:54.630> for<00:00:54.780> regular<00:00:55.080> ollie<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> if

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
than you would for regular ollie so if

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.770 
than you would for regular ollie so if
you<00:00:56.670> got<00:00:56.760> something<00:00:56.970> smaller<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you got something smaller like that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.870 
you got something smaller like that
little<00:00:57.960> 2x4<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.500> there<00:00:58.680> that's<00:00:59.160> good<00:00:59.340> it's

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
little 2x4 right there that's good it's

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
little 2x4 right there that's good it's
gonna<00:01:00.060> look<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:06.350> now<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.440> you<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
gonna look like this now if you can

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.630 
gonna look like this now if you can
notice<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> clip

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
notice in a clip

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300 
notice in a clip
I<00:01:08.670> did<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.240> push<00:01:09.690> my<00:01:09.870> board<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.440> farther

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I did actually push my board for farther

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.690 
I did actually push my board for farther
getting<00:01:11.820> many<00:01:12.030> more<00:01:12.090> length<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.409> ollie

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
getting many more length to the ollie

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.680 
getting many more length to the ollie
now<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> set<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.090> something<00:01:15.300> a<00:01:15.450> little

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
now when you set up something a little

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.660 
now when you set up something a little
farther<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.409> yourself<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:17.190> this<00:01:17.310> plank<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
farther for yourself like this plank of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.550 
farther for yourself like this plank of
wood<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.940> here<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.500> to

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wood I have here you really want to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.320 
wood I have here you really want to
focus<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.950> getting<00:01:20.159> more<00:01:20.400> speed<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
focus on getting more speed at it and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
focus on getting more speed at it and
really<00:01:21.840> being<00:01:22.050> comfortable<00:01:22.440> with<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.620> ollie

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
really being comfortable with your ollie

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
really being comfortable with your ollie
and<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.640> pushing<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.090> board<00:01:24.330> forward<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and really pushing your board forward to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.500 
and really pushing your board forward to
get<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> good<00:01:25.440> length<00:01:25.710> over<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> whole<00:01:26.220> thing

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
get the good length over the whole thing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.550 
get the good length over the whole thing
so<00:01:27.510> I'll<00:01:27.630> never<00:01:27.870> something<00:01:28.080> further<00:01:28.290> doesn't

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
so I'll never something further doesn't

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:40.859 
so I'll never something further doesn't
look<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.800> this

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.120 

so<00:01:41.869> if<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.049> can<00:01:42.170> notice<00:01:42.409> in<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.619> clip<00:01:42.859> I

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so if you can notice in the clip I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.520 
so if you can notice in the clip I
actually<00:01:43.490> did<00:01:43.819> push<00:01:44.149> my<00:01:44.329> board<00:01:44.539> foot<00:01:44.840> farther

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually did push my board foot farther

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.190 
actually did push my board foot farther
forward<00:01:45.979> with<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.219> speed<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:47.049> made<00:01:48.049> me

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
forward with the speed I have made me

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.749 
forward with the speed I have made me
the<00:01:48.560> ability<00:01:48.859> to<00:01:48.920> actually<00:01:49.069> clear<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.429> entire

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
the ability to actually clear the entire

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.539 
the ability to actually clear the entire
obstacle<00:01:50.359> no<00:01:50.840> problem<00:01:51.170> at<00:01:51.259> all<00:01:51.399> now<00:01:52.399> this

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
obstacle no problem at all now this

over like I said you don't have anything
too<00:01:56.149> tall<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:56.780> if<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:56.990> land<00:01:57.259> on<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.469> going

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
too tall because if you land on it going

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.649 
too tall because if you land on it going
out<00:01:58.219> fast<00:01:58.459> rate<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.670> speed<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.090> will<00:01:59.209> fall<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
out fast rate of speed you will fall and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.240

it<00:01:59.750> will<00:01:59.869> hurt<00:02:00.049> that's<00:02:00.740> why<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.069> just

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
it will hurt that's why it's just

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.589 
it will hurt that's why it's just
something<00:02:01.429> like<00:02:01.459> this<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:01.880> if<00:02:01.969> I<00:02:02.030> did<00:02:02.209> land<00:02:02.420> on

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
something like this so if I did land on

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.749 
something like this so if I did land on
