during<00:00:09.920> a<00:00:10.220> book

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
during a book

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.920 
during a book
Plus<00:00:11.080> knife<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:12.490> is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
Plus knife it is

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.100 
Plus knife it is
the<00:00:14.410> zero<00:00:15.160> to<00:00:15.270> Bo<00:00:16.650> 400<00:00:17.650> it's<00:00:18.430> a<00:00:18.460> fixed<00:00:18.730> blade

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
the zero to Bo 400 it's a fixed blade

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.210 
the zero to Bo 400 it's a fixed blade
it's<00:00:20.110> from<00:00:20.230> the<00:00:20.320> bokor<00:00:20.560> plus<00:00:20.740> spine<00:00:20.920> like<00:00:21.100> I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
it's from the bokor plus spine like I

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.999 
it's from the bokor plus spine like I
said<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.930> think<00:00:23.230> the<00:00:23.290> retail<00:00:23.590> price<00:00:23.830> on

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
said and I think the retail price on

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.480 
said and I think the retail price on
this<00:00:24.279> is<00:00:24.670> going<00:00:25.540> for<00:00:25.660> about<00:00:25.779> $65<00:00:26.500> 67<00:00:27.279> with<00:00:27.400> the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
this is going for about $65 67 with the

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.300 
this is going for about $65 67 with the
shipping<00:00:27.790> and<00:00:27.880> everything<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:29.470> a<00:00:29.590> smaller<00:00:29.890> a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
shipping and everything it's a smaller a

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.000 
shipping and everything it's a smaller a
smaller<00:00:30.520> fixed<00:00:31.149> blade<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.500> you<00:00:32.649> can<00:00:32.770> see<00:00:32.890> it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
smaller fixed blade as you can see it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.500 
smaller fixed blade as you can see it
comes<00:00:33.220> with<00:00:33.280> maybe<00:00:33.670> some<00:00:33.820> marks<00:00:34.090> on<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.300> blade

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
comes with maybe some marks on the blade

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.549 
comes with maybe some marks on the blade
I<00:00:34.750> don't<00:00:34.870> know<00:00:34.930> if<00:00:34.989> that's<00:00:35.140> from<00:00:35.200> being<00:00:35.440> in<00:00:35.500> the

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
I don't know if that's from being in the

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.620 
I don't know if that's from being in the
Kydex<00:00:35.770> sheath<00:00:35.980> or<00:00:36.340> shipping<00:00:36.579> or<00:00:36.790> whatnot<00:00:36.970> it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
Kydex sheath or shipping or whatnot it

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.660 
Kydex sheath or shipping or whatnot it
could<00:00:37.930> be<00:00:38.200> this<00:00:38.410> coating<00:00:38.829> is<00:00:39.040> kind<00:00:39.220> of<00:00:39.309> gray

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
could be this coating is kind of gray

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.610 
could be this coating is kind of gray
it's<00:00:40.239> not<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.390> bead<00:00:40.630> blast<00:00:40.870> coating<00:00:41.320> because<00:00:41.500> it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
it's not a bead blast coating because it

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.020 
it's not a bead blast coating because it
actually<00:00:41.860> has<00:00:42.160> some<00:00:43.149> sort<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.450> gray<00:00:45.030> overlay

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
light for this size of fix blade at four

light for this size of fix blade at four
ounces<00:00:53.829> it's<00:00:54.609> a<00:00:54.670> full<00:00:54.820> tang<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.320> handle

ounces it's a full tang and the handle
scales<00:00:56.890> are<00:00:57.519> just<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.910> little<00:00:58.149> bit<00:00:58.300> smaller

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
scales are just a little bit smaller

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.579 
scales are just a little bit smaller
than<00:00:59.769> the<00:00:59.949> actual<00:01:00.219> profile<00:01:00.699> of<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.030> blade

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
than the actual profile of the blade

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.490 
than the actual profile of the blade
this<00:01:02.589> is<00:01:03.300> probably<00:01:04.300> canvas<00:01:04.720> micarta<00:01:04.870> linen

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
this is probably canvas micarta linen

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.340 
this is probably canvas micarta linen
micarta<00:01:05.920> there<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.570> those<00:01:07.570> are<00:01:07.750> removable

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
micarta there and those are removable

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.010 
micarta there and those are removable
I<00:01:11.550> like<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.670> ergonomics<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:13.420> blade<00:01:13.659> it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
I like the ergonomics of this blade it

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.219 
I like the ergonomics of this blade it
fits<00:01:14.560> all<00:01:14.979> great<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.880> hand<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.750> handles<00:01:17.140> a

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
fits all great in the hand the handles a

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.340 
fits all great in the hand the handles a
little<00:01:17.350> short<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:19.150> my<00:01:19.300> hand<00:01:19.540> but<00:01:19.810> I<00:01:20.020> think

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
little short for my hand but I think

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.990 
little short for my hand but I think
that's<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:21.070> way<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.400> way<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.580> meant<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.880> be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
that's the way the way it's meant to be

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.720 
that's the way the way it's meant to be
kind<00:01:22.720> of<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:22.900> forward<00:01:23.230> facing<00:01:23.640> because<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
kind of that forward facing because the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.330 
kind of that forward facing because the
knife<00:01:24.880> has<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.270> bent<00:01:25.540> shape<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.140> way<00:01:26.410> when

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
knife has this bent shape this way when

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.940 
knife has this bent shape this way when
you<00:01:27.460> hold<00:01:27.730> it<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.470> puts<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.590> cutting<00:01:29.860> edge

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
you hold it it puts the cutting edge

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.580 
you hold it it puts the cutting edge
closer<00:01:30.390> closer<00:01:31.390> down<00:01:31.750> by<00:01:31.900> your<00:01:32.020> fingers<00:01:32.380> which

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
closer closer down by your fingers which

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.310 
closer closer down by your fingers which
is<00:01:32.620> nice

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
is nice

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880 
is nice
and<00:01:36.030> Kydex<00:01:37.030> sheath<00:01:37.120> folded<00:01:38.110> over<00:01:38.200> style<00:01:38.590> not

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
and Kydex sheath folded over style not

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.920 
and Kydex sheath folded over style not
my<00:01:39.070> first<00:01:39.340> choice<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.570> fine<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:41.860> as<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.780> can

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
my first choice it's fine but as you can

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.370 
my first choice it's fine but as you can
see<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:45.550> has<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.510> far<00:01:46.690> as<00:01:46.780> retention<00:01:47.230> goes

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
see it has it's as far as retention goes

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.470 
see it has it's as far as retention goes
it's<00:01:47.560> great<00:01:47.830> but<00:01:48.430> as<00:01:48.580> you<00:01:48.700> taking<00:01:49.000> it<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.210> it's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
it's great but as you taking it out it's

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.530 
it's great but as you taking it out it's
a<00:01:49.600> little<00:01:49.810> stiff<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.890> sheath<00:01:51.820> seems<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.300> ride

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
a little stiff the sheath seems to ride

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.950 
a little stiff the sheath seems to ride
right<00:01:52.990> here<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.410> knife<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.360> don't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
right here on the knife which I don't

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.710 
right here on the knife which I don't
know<00:01:56.020> for<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.290> price<00:01:56.440> at<00:01:56.830> $67<00:01:57.820> maybe<00:01:58.540> that's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
know for the price at $67 maybe that's

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.820 
know for the price at $67 maybe that's
what<00:01:58.810> you're<00:01:58.930> getting<00:01:59.140> what<00:01:59.680> you're<00:01:59.770> paying

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
what you're getting what you're paying

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.800 
what you're getting what you're paying
for<00:02:00.070> but<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.730> think<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.450> could<00:02:01.600> do<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:01.720> little

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
for but I think they could do a little

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.490 
for but I think they could do a little
better<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.140> that<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> pluses<00:02:04.030> economics

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
better on that so pluses economics

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.520 
better on that so pluses economics
drawbacks<00:02:06.370> maybe<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.850> craftsmanship<00:02:07.540> of<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
drawbacks maybe the craftsmanship of the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.119 
drawbacks maybe the craftsmanship of the
sheath<00:02:09.959> another<00:02:10.959> drawback<00:02:11.230> is<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.620> picture

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
sheath another drawback is the picture

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.270 
sheath another drawback is the picture
on<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.030> site<00:02:13.330> or<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:14.110> any<00:02:14.290> site<00:02:14.590> makes<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.099> look

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
on the site or on any site makes it look

I<00:02:16.599> don't<00:02:17.050> know<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.230> drawback<00:02:17.680> just<00:02:18.099> maybe

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
I don't know the drawback just maybe

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070 
I don't know the drawback just maybe
that's<00:02:18.730> why<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:18.819> made<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> video<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.900> looks

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
that's why I made the video it looks

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.899 
that's why I made the video it looks
straight<00:02:20.290> how<00:02:20.410> big<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.709> actually<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.819> a

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909
