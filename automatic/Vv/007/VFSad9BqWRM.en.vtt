hey guys dr. Josh axe here doctor of
functional<00:00:09.450> medicine<00:00:09.690> nutritionist<00:00:10.679> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
functional medicine nutritionist you

functional medicine nutritionist you
know<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> those<00:00:11.460> common<00:00:11.910> questions<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.389> get

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
know one of those common questions I get

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.499 
know one of those common questions I get
is<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:13.230> much<00:00:13.500> protein<00:00:13.950> should<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.940> consume<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is how much protein should I consume a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.390 
is how much protein should I consume a
day<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.590> protein<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.250> essential

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
day and you know protein is essential

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.870 
day and you know protein is essential
for<00:00:17.880> building<00:00:18.779> muscle<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.830> burning<00:00:20.160> fat<00:00:20.189> for

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
for building muscle for burning fat for

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.880 
for building muscle for burning fat for
supporting<00:00:21.300> metabolism<00:00:21.990> even<00:00:22.350> health<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
supporting metabolism even health of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
supporting metabolism even health of
certain<00:00:23.160> organs<00:00:23.640> like<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:24.390> thyroid<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
certain organs like your thyroid and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.740 
certain organs like your thyroid and
adrenal<00:00:25.289> glands<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.550> need<00:00:26.820> protein<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
adrenal glands and so we need protein to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
adrenal glands and so we need protein to
heal<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:29.039> healthy<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.880> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
heal and to be healthy and so in this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.099 
heal and to be healthy and so in this
video<00:00:30.210> I'm<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> share<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
video I'm going to share with you

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.580 
video I'm going to share with you
exactly<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:32.460> much<00:00:32.730> protein<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.809> need<00:00:34.320> per

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
exactly how much protein you need per

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
exactly how much protein you need per
day<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.040> answer<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> you're<00:00:35.940> asking<00:00:36.059> me

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
day and that answer is you're asking me

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.490 
day and that answer is you're asking me
that<00:00:36.360> question<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.870> much<00:00:36.989> protein<00:00:37.260> should

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that question how much protein should

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.010 
that question how much protein should
you<00:00:37.739> have<00:00:37.890> per<00:00:38.100> day<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.059> depends<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you have per day is it really depends on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
you have per day is it really depends on
what<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.410> health<00:00:40.620> goals<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.610> going

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
what your health goals are and I'm going

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
what your health goals are and I'm going
to<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:41.910> break<00:00:42.270> things<00:00:42.600> down<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:42.840> three

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
to really break things down into three

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.590 
to really break things down into three
categories<00:00:43.290> number<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.219> how<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.149> protein

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
categories number one how much protein

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.220 
categories number one how much protein
do<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> regular<00:00:46.530> basis<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
do you need on a regular basis to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.360 
do you need on a regular basis to
generally<00:00:49.230> heal<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:49.950> your<00:00:50.039> body<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
generally heal and for your body to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.299 
generally heal and for your body to
regenerate<00:00:50.760> number<00:00:51.600> two<00:00:51.870> how<00:00:52.500> much<00:00:52.649> protein

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
regenerate number two how much protein

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
regenerate number two how much protein
do<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.059> burn<00:00:54.239> fat<00:00:54.629> number<00:00:55.050> three<00:00:55.379> how

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
do you need to burn fat number three how

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920 
do you need to burn fat number three how
much<00:00:55.739> protein<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.489> need<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> burn<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
much protein do you need to burn to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.709 
much protein do you need to burn to
build<00:00:58.170> muscle<00:00:58.739> per<00:00:58.920> day<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.149> general

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
build muscle per day and so in general

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
build muscle per day and so in general
if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:00.989> want<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.500> general<00:01:02.190> health

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
if you just want to have general health

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.010 
if you just want to have general health
and<00:01:02.789> longevity<00:01:04.100> doing<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.339> 50<00:01:06.240> percent<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and longevity doing about 50 percent of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
and longevity doing about 50 percent of
your<00:01:07.260> body<00:01:07.470> weight<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.040> grams<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.729> protein<00:01:09.240> per

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
your body weight in grams of protein per

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.820 
your body weight in grams of protein per
day<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> about<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.170> want<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.530> let's<00:01:10.680> say

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
day is about what you want so let's say

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.570 
day is about what you want so let's say
you<00:01:10.890> weigh<00:01:11.570> 160<00:01:12.570> pounds<00:01:12.950> if<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.070> weigh<00:01:14.220> 160

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you weigh 160 pounds if you weigh 160

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.710 
you weigh 160 pounds if you weigh 160
pounds<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.240> you're<00:01:15.390> looking<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> be

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
pounds and you're looking to be

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.050 
pounds and you're looking to be
generally<00:01:16.229> healthy<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:17.220> I'd<00:01:17.310> recommend<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
generally healthy what I'd recommend is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600 
generally healthy what I'd recommend is
having<00:01:18.090> about<00:01:18.659> 80<00:01:18.930> grams<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.950> protein<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> day

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
having about 80 grams of protein a day

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.240 
having about 80 grams of protein a day
in<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.659> diet<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:22.650> eating<00:01:22.860> let's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
in your diet so if you're eating let's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.060 
in your diet so if you're eating let's
say<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:24.060> three<00:01:25.020> meals<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.439> day<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.009> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
say of three meals a day you're going to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.310 
say of three meals a day you're going to
be<00:01:26.130> getting<00:01:26.250> about<00:01:26.549> 25<00:01:26.790> grams<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.869> protein<00:01:28.290> per

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
be getting about 25 grams of protein per

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.319 
be getting about 25 grams of protein per
meal<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.520> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.729> really<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
meal and that's going to really get you

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
meal and that's going to really get you
to<00:01:30.450> where<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.560> terms<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
to where you need to be in terms of the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
to where you need to be in terms of the
amount<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.180> protein<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> need<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.079> diet

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
amount of protein you need in your diet

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.960 
amount of protein you need in your diet
now<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> second<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.549> let's<00:01:35.729> say<00:01:35.820> you're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
now the second one is let's say you're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
now the second one is let's say you're
trying<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.390> burn<00:01:36.659> fat<00:01:37.020> fast<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
trying to really burn fat fast and you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.440 
trying to really burn fat fast and you
want<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> body<00:01:38.640> fat<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
want to really get that body fat off in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.830 
want to really get that body fat off in
that<00:01:39.840> case<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.490> 0.7<00:01:41.490> grams<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.150> 0.75<00:01:42.810> grams

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that case about 0.7 grams to 0.75 grams

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.499 
that case about 0.7 grams to 0.75 grams
of<00:01:43.290> protein<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> day<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.040> ideal<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.759> overall

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
of protein a day is ideal for overall

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.030 
of protein a day is ideal for overall
burning<00:01:46.110> fat<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
burning fat because you're going to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.319 
burning fat because you're going to
replace<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> those<00:01:47.970> extra

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
replace some of those extra

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.810 
replace some of those extra
carbohydrates<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:49.320> your<00:01:49.350> diet<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> get<00:01:50.610> more

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
carbohydrates in your diet and get more

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.730 
carbohydrates in your diet and get more
protein<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.780> during<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.110> period<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.500> time

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
protein in during this period of time

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.249 
protein in during this period of time
when<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.490> trying<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.149> burn<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.600> fat<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
when you're trying to burn more fat and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
when you're trying to burn more fat and
so<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.979> case<00:01:56.310> again<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> weigh<00:01:57.060> 160

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
so in that case again if you weigh 160

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.139 
so in that case again if you weigh 160
pounds<00:01:58.439> times<00:01:58.890> 0.75<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.060> do

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
pounds times 0.75 you're going to do

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.090 
pounds times 0.75 you're going to do
closer<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:01.850> 102<00:02:02.850> maybe<00:02:03.119> 120<00:02:04.110> grams<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.619> protein

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
closer to 102 maybe 120 grams of protein

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.679 
closer to 102 maybe 120 grams of protein
a<00:02:05.130> day<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.759> trying<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.420> burn

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
a day if you're trying to really burn

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.389 
a day if you're trying to really burn
fat<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.710> if<00:02:07.770> you're<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> eat<00:02:08.220> let's

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
fat and so if you're going to eat let's

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.070 
fat and so if you're going to eat let's
say<00:02:08.550> four<00:02:08.910> meals<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.360> day<00:02:09.390> where<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:09.810> trying

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
say four meals a day where you're trying

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.180 
say four meals a day where you're trying
to<00:02:10.140> burn<00:02:10.289> fat<00:02:10.619> 25<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.910> 30<00:02:12.150> grams<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.629> protein

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
to burn fat 25 to 30 grams of protein

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.360 
to burn fat 25 to 30 grams of protein
three<00:02:13.970> times<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.450> day<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.500> ideal<00:02:15.860> amount

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
three times a day is the ideal amount

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.410 
three times a day is the ideal amount
that<00:02:16.490> you're<00:02:16.640> going<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.790> be<00:02:16.880> getting<00:02:17.240> if

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
that you're going to be getting if

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.360 
that you're going to be getting if
you're<00:02:17.900> looking<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> really<00:02:18.470> burn<00:02:18.680> fat<00:02:19.070> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
you're looking to really burn fat and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.740 
you're looking to really burn fat and
then<00:02:19.580> let's<00:02:19.790> say<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.090> trying<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.420> build

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
then let's say you're trying to build

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
then let's say you're trying to build
muscle<00:02:21.020> you're<00:02:21.410> trying<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.800> really<00:02:22.010> build

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
muscle you're trying to really build

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.570 
muscle you're trying to really build
lean<00:02:23.060> more<00:02:23.270> more<00:02:24.020> muscle<00:02:24.470> tone<00:02:24.710> or<00:02:25.040> you're

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
lean more more muscle tone or you're

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.490 
lean more more muscle tone or you're
trying<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.910> build<00:02:26.030> muscle<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.540> general<00:02:27.020> you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
trying to build muscle in general you

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.220 
trying to build muscle in general you
want<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.710> actually<00:02:27.860> take<00:02:28.280> your<00:02:28.640> weight<00:02:29.270> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
want to actually take your weight and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.310 
want to actually take your weight and
take<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.740> times<00:02:31.070> one<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:32.180> eat<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:33.080> many

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
take that times one and so eat that many

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.840 
take that times one and so eat that many
grams<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.830> protein<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.190> day<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.370> let's<00:02:34.610> say<00:02:34.790> you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
grams of protein a day so let's say you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.240 
grams of protein a day so let's say you
weigh<00:02:35.150> 160<00:02:36.050> pounds<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.830> you're<00:02:36.980> willing<00:02:37.130> to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
weigh 160 pounds and you're willing to

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.460 
weigh 160 pounds and you're willing to
pack<00:02:37.580> on<00:02:37.850> some<00:02:37.880> muscle<00:02:38.330> well<00:02:39.080> then<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.320> should

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
pack on some muscle well then you should

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.040 
pack on some muscle well then you should
be<00:02:39.560> trying<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.860> get<00:02:40.120> 160<00:02:41.120> grams<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.570> protein<00:02:42.020> a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
be trying to get 160 grams of protein a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.080 
be trying to get 160 grams of protein a
day<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.040> what<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.190> might<00:02:43.490> look<00:02:43.700> like<00:02:43.760> if

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
day and so what that might look like if

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.870 
day and so what that might look like if
you're<00:02:44.240> eating<00:02:44.680> five<00:02:45.680> meals<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:46.250> day<00:02:46.280> or<00:02:46.700> let's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
you're eating five meals a day or let's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.310 
you're eating five meals a day or let's
say<00:02:47.000> four<00:02:47.330> meals<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.720> day<00:02:47.750> you're<00:02:47.990> going<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.200> try

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
say four meals a day you're going to try

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.080 
say four meals a day you're going to try
and<00:02:48.410> getting<00:02:48.590> 40<00:02:49.070> grams<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.460> protein<00:02:49.880> per<00:02:50.060> meal

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and getting 40 grams of protein per meal

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.540 
and getting 40 grams of protein per meal
but<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:50.960> how<00:02:51.140> much<00:02:51.320> protein<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.100> need<00:02:52.310> per

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
but that's how much protein you need per

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.040 
but that's how much protein you need per
day<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.760> again<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.120> really<00:02:53.210> depends<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.840> your

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
day so again it really depends is your

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.380 
day so again it really depends is your
goal<00:02:54.230> for<00:02:54.620> general<00:02:55.040> health<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:56.060> case

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
goal for general health in that case

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.120 
goal for general health in that case
half<00:02:56.960> your<00:02:57.230> body<00:02:57.470> weight<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.710> grams<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
half your body weight in grams of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.080 
half your body weight in grams of
protein<00:02:58.550> if<00:02:58.730> your<00:02:59.300> goal<00:02:59.600> is<00:02:59.630> fat<00:03:00.470> burning<00:03:01.090> 0.7

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
protein if your goal is fat burning 0.7

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.120 
protein if your goal is fat burning 0.7
to<00:03:02.180> 0.75<00:03:02.750> grams<00:03:02.960> of<00:03:03.470> protein<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.070> if

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
to 0.75 grams of protein and then if

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.920 
to 0.75 grams of protein and then if
your<00:03:04.250> goal<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.580> build<00:03:04.730> muscle<00:03:05.210> you<00:03:05.630> need<00:03:05.780> an

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
your goal is to build muscle you need an

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.840 
your goal is to build muscle you need an
equal<00:03:06.410> amount<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.860> grams<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.310> protein<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.730> day

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
equal amount of grams of protein a day

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.090 
equal amount of grams of protein a day
to<00:03:07.910> your<00:03:08.270> body<00:03:08.600> way<00:03:08.930> if<00:03:09.200> you're<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.860> burn

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
to your body way if you're going to burn

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.350 
to your body way if you're going to burn
or<00:03:10.430> if<00:03:10.640> you're<00:03:10.760> going<00:03:10.850> to<00:03:10.970> actually<00:03:11.180> build

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
or if you're going to actually build

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.300 
or if you're going to actually build
muscle<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.080> so<00:03:12.500> again<00:03:12.800> remember<00:03:12.980> these

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
muscle and so again remember these

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.430 
muscle and so again remember these
benefits<00:03:13.970> of<00:03:14.090> protein<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.600> protein<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.080> so

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
benefits of protein and protein is so

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.520 
benefits of protein and protein is so
important<00:03:16.160> for<00:03:16.930> again<00:03:17.930> building<00:03:18.320> lean

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
important for again building lean

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.590 
important for again building lean
muscular<00:03:18.800> tissue<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.520> also<00:03:19.760> very<00:03:20.120> important

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
muscular tissue it's also very important

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600 
muscular tissue it's also very important
for<00:03:20.720> organ<00:03:21.110> function<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.650> fact<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:22.130> lot<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.489> your

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
for organ function in fact a lot of your

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580 
for organ function in fact a lot of your
organs<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.239> cells<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.660> tissues<00:03:24.200> require

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
organs and cells and tissues require

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.610 
organs and cells and tissues require
protein<00:03:25.280> for<00:03:25.910> proper<00:03:26.390> regeneration<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.500> so

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
protein for proper regeneration and so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.560 
protein for proper regeneration and so
if<00:03:27.739> you're<00:03:27.860> really<00:03:28.070> trying<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.430> heal<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
if you're really trying to heal and and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.030 
if you're really trying to heal and and
they're<00:03:29.870> they're<00:03:30.110> actually<00:03:30.290> studies<00:03:30.860> out

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
they're they're actually studies out

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.830 
they're they're actually studies out
there<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.310> if<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.430> have<00:03:31.700> burns<00:03:32.060> or<00:03:32.360> cuts<00:03:32.630> on

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
there that if you have burns or cuts on

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.960 
there that if you have burns or cuts on
your<00:03:32.989> body<00:03:33.230> that<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.130> actually<00:03:34.340> need<00:03:34.700> more

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
your body that you actually need more

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.640 
your body that you actually need more
protein<00:03:35.540> intake<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.050> if<00:03:36.140> you<00:03:36.230> ever<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.620> a

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
protein intake so if you ever have a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.580 
protein intake so if you ever have a
severe<00:03:37.040> burn<00:03:37.459> or<00:03:37.820> an<00:03:38.180> injury<00:03:38.690> your<00:03:39.320> body

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
severe burn or an injury your body

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.560 
severe burn or an injury your body
actually<00:03:39.890> needs<00:03:40.220> more<00:03:40.580> protein<00:03:40.910> during<00:03:41.420> those

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
actually needs more protein during those

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.210 
actually needs more protein during those
times<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.019> some<00:03:42.170> of<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.320> best<00:03:42.680> forms<00:03:43.130> of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
times and some of the best forms of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.790 
times and some of the best forms of
protein<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.730> get<00:03:44.030> are<00:03:44.330> things<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:45.050> grass-fed

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
protein to get are things like grass-fed

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.070 
protein to get are things like grass-fed
beef<00:03:46.130> wild<00:03:47.060> cut<00:03:47.330> chicken<00:03:47.600> and<00:03:47.900> turkey

protein<00:03:51.650> powder<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.070> like<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.220> good<00:03:52.610> quality

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
protein powder is like a good quality

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.330 
protein powder is like a good quality
whey<00:03:53.360> protein<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.080> also<00:03:54.530> great<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:54.920> get<00:03:55.100> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
whey protein is also great to get and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.729 
whey protein is also great to get and
one<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> my<00:03:56.000> favorites<00:03:56.450> collagen<00:03:57.230> protein

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
one of my favorites collagen protein

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.340 
one of my favorites collagen protein
which<00:03:58.280> are<00:03:58.430> actually<00:03:58.880> amino<00:03:59.420> acid<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.110> doing

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
which are actually amino acid so doing

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.170 
which are actually amino acid so doing
collagen<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.040> another<00:04:01.459> great<00:04:01.760> form<00:04:02.060> of

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
collagen is another great form of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.720 
collagen is another great form of
protein<00:04:02.630> easy<00:04:03.110> absorbable<00:04:03.980> and<00:04:04.100> digestible

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
protein easy absorbable and digestible

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.640 
protein easy absorbable and digestible
those<00:04:05.300> are<00:04:05.510> good<00:04:05.690> sources<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:06.110> protein<00:04:06.170> then

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
those are good sources of protein then

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.930 
those are good sources of protein then
really<00:04:06.890> also<00:04:07.220> you're<00:04:07.370> going<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.580> get<00:04:07.700> some

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
really also you're going to get some

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.509 
really also you're going to get some
protein<00:04:08.420> from<00:04:09.050> high<00:04:09.320> quality<00:04:09.380> nuts<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.280> seeds

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
protein from high quality nuts and seeds

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.729 
protein from high quality nuts and seeds
like<00:04:10.640> chia<00:04:11.090> seeds<00:04:11.450> flax<00:04:11.780> seeds<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:12.230> almonds

like chia seeds flax seeds and almonds

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.880 
like chia seeds flax seeds and almonds
also<00:04:13.640> in<00:04:13.820> certain<00:04:14.060> types<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.570> beans<00:04:14.930> you're

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
also in certain types of beans you're

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.440 
also in certain types of beans you're
going<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.070> get<00:04:16.190> some<00:04:16.370> protein<00:04:16.760> even<00:04:16.970> certain

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
going to get some protein even certain

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.990 
going to get some protein even certain
grains<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:17.930> oats<00:04:18.109> have<00:04:18.859> lower<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.640> moderate

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
grains like oats have lower to moderate

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.510 
grains like oats have lower to moderate
levels<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.480> protein<00:04:20.989> as<00:04:21.320> well<00:04:21.350> but<00:04:22.160> really<00:04:22.280> be

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
levels of protein as well but really be

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.190 
levels of protein as well but really be
conscious<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.270> this<00:04:23.450> week<00:04:23.630> look<00:04:23.870> at<00:04:23.930> how

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
conscious of that this week look at how
