but he doesn't hold it that well he

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.719 
but he doesn't hold it that well he
holds<00:02:09.379> it<00:02:09.470> pretty<00:02:09.739> much<00:02:09.860> only<00:02:10.069> like<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.519> as

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
holds it pretty much only like that as

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.699
