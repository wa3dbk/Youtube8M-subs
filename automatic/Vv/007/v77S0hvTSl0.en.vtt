00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hi guys, my name is Vuitton and today I 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 I came to talk about the incredible challenge of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:18.779
 last week I finished reading the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 iron challenge which is a written book 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.859
 between a partnership of cassandra clare 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.980
 with oil beck I had never read anything 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.890
 neither of these two authors and I am not 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.210
 very fan of reading sagas well are messages 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 which are not yet completed 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.590
 mainly sagas that only have the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.739
 first book available so I do not know 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 because I started reading the challenge of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.610
 Iron there you ask me, Victor, if you 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.350
 sorry and I say no, I do not 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'm sorry because this book is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.410
 wonderful in the challenge of iron people 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 with this story of a boy who has 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 a very mysterious childhood he is a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.739
 Marco and he goes to a magic school 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 where he meets two best friends the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.940
 boy and a girl the girl a lot 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.340
 intelligent the boy is very faithful 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.030
 companion will I'm not talking about 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.920
 Harry Potter 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.420
 despite the similarities I believe that the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.500
 land challenge have their own 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.240
 merits 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.850
 the authors take people to know the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 magisterium that this school of magic and 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.689
 underground that lies within a 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.180
 well hidden caves and there those 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.670
 students for five years until the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 to make complete wizards the father of the cabbage 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
 who is the protagonist of this story 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 I never wanted it to go to that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.140
 school of magic and never wanted it to be 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 teaching the reason for the father's 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.900
 We still do not know the book. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 carrying this mystery and will 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.710
 nurturing our curiosity to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.570
 people know why col can not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.159
 to study magic in this school every 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 magicians in the magisterium are marks 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.659
 elementals ie they do magic 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.479
 using the four main 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.479
 earth fire elements 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.560
 in this book there is a fifth element 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 what is chaos 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.159
 chaos is an element that represents the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.750
 the main enemy of this franchise 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.100
 by the cover you must have realized that this 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.960
 sinister face here 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.090
 but then what I liked about this book here 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.159
 this is a very steady action level not 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.649
 stops in every second of each chapter 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.329
 ends and begins with action and things 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.429
 There is no chapter going on. 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.680
 dragged until you have finished this 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.420
 book I could not get rid of when 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.610
 was in the last chapters was already 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.319
 Late afternoon I was drowsy sleep but I 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.810
 I wanted to finish at any cost and I 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.819
 I got up and read aloud and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.310
 walking around the house because I really wanted to 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.900
 know how it ends and the end of this book 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.519
 It's incredible, I can not even explain. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.769
 for you how I look forward to the fight 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.510
 that will be the continuation of the 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.250
 iron challenge for a long time. 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.720
 I did not see any fantasy books and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.790
 It's been a long time since I've felt this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 emotion but not knowing where you are 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.380
 discovering the new world and having new 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.269
 enemies and things that really put 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.250
 the protagonists in danger I felt 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.380
 so enveloped by the fantasy of this book 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.060
 That I felt a little desire for me. 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 To risk the books of cassandra claire 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.299
 that until today I died of laziness 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.340
 read because there are many books but 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.440
 while the precise continuation does not 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870
 feed me too much fantasy 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.590
 contemporary I'm afraid this saga is very 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.090
 addictive 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.970
 It was published here in Brazil by 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.560
 angry hashtag swim that is the youthful seal 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.319
 the new concept and if you like 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.569
 magic and likes fancy and likes to pre 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.430
 adolescents at risk of death I 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.780
 I recommend you read this book and see 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.040
 How are you with me because I need 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.079
 more people to talk about 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.670
 iron challenge and is not this is a book 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.290
 I gave it four stars recommend it 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 I'm looking forward to it and I 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.049
 I want to hear from you 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.940
 If you've read this book if you think 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.109
 that I should rather start reading the books 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.000
 of the claire camera 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.709
 if you are also looking forward to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.780
 continuation leaves everything here in 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.609
