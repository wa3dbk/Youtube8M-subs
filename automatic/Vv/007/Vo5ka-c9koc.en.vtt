00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.250
 arguments are excluded 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:21.739

 ok now, and he does not need to 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.259
 a few good punches and so 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.560
 I think I still get some of it 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.560
 Salewski 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.600
 sg 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.160
 me now well 2000 history 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 in the second third of larger 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.620
 gloves have thrown away 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.420
 hinted that on the applications then 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.519
 definitely has on his hand now 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.519
 gabi blood is seen the question is coming 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.370
 service center far left the two 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.649
 begin again to talk to 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.740
 then bought it later in the 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.990
 slap in the face okay that's his name 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.690
 will theoretically get more 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.930
 people as quasi badges and then 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.930
 have done 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.210
 Peter later for the second time for 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.750
 maybe two minutes out there will be 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.070
 more 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.830
 we heard right away I believe that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.110
 for both get for the home purchase but 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.390
 always for the exceptional case but once 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:45.420
 Two minutes later it was heavier 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 two minutes crosscheck and five each 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:55.800
 minutes for both of them sound pretty good or 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.210
 with our cameras other expert and 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.869
 the two minutes are on the course 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.880
 clock against Peter Schweda then the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.130
 double checked manuel vulture swallow 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.410
 had to do this with the later but it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.720
 was not still kneeling and yes now 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.620
 85 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:23.480
 he does not like me now as 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:26.670
 17 or 18 national players 17 years young 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 also shows that he already can and 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 his spending must be in the cabin 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.790
 have an injury and light 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.360
 actually 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.530
 More than five minutes or sms for the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.900
 Metropolitans are paying that's one 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 higher penalty for injury two 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.060
 minutes are normal when blood flows 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.420
