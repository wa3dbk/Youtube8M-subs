00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
pounds of jerky at one time
depending<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.849> how<00:02:14.900> how<00:02:15.900> thick<00:02:16.409> I<00:02:16.560> cut<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.150> how

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
depending on how how thick I cut it how

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.319 
depending on how how thick I cut it how
the<00:02:18.209> meat<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.689> I<00:02:19.430> don't<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.549> any<00:02:20.670> smoke<00:02:21.030> stack

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
the meat is I don't have any smoke stack

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.920 
the meat is I don't have any smoke stack
or<00:02:21.599> anything<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.230> just<00:02:23.060> didn't<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> roof<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
or anything I just didn't for the roof I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.670 
or anything I just didn't for the roof I
didn't<00:02:25.349> but<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.739> car<00:02:25.950> siding<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:27.349> very<00:02:28.349> tight

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
didn't but the car siding up very tight

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.000 
didn't but the car siding up very tight
so<00:02:29.690> it's<00:02:30.690> pretty<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.079> leaks<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:31.890> at

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
so it's pretty much just leaks right at

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.430 
so it's pretty much just leaks right at
the<00:02:32.159> top<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.329> actually<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> concept

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the top and I actually like that concept

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.600 
the top and I actually like that concept
a<00:02:34.530> little<00:02:34.739> better<00:02:34.890> than<00:02:35.099> having<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.370> smoke

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
a little better than having a smoke

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.479 
a little better than having a smoke
stack<00:02:36.230> because<00:02:37.230> when<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.099> have<00:02:38.159> a<00:02:38.220> smoke

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
stack because when you have a smoke

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.360 
stack because when you have a smoke
stack<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:39.780> will<00:02:39.900> draw<00:02:40.109> air<00:02:40.379> from<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.980> bottom

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
stack it will draw air from the bottom

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.250 
stack it will draw air from the bottom
and<00:02:41.549> most<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.659> heat<00:02:42.900> will<00:02:43.140> go<00:02:43.489> directly<00:02:45.260> up

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and most of the heat will go directly up

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.259 
and most of the heat will go directly up
to<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> up<00:02:47.129> to<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.430> smoke<00:02:47.670> stack<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.150> you'll

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
to the up to that smoke stack so you'll

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.580 
to the up to that smoke stack so you'll
get<00:02:48.390> hotspots<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
get hotspots in it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.160 
get hotspots in it
but<00:02:50.519> here<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.060> smoke<00:02:51.239> pretty<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.079> know

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
but here the smoke pretty much you know

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.229 
but here the smoke pretty much you know
leaves<00:02:52.409> leaves<00:02:53.190> everywhere<00:02:53.730> just<00:02:53.940> kind<00:02:54.150> of

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
leaves leaves everywhere just kind of

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.180 
leaves leaves everywhere just kind of
Rises<00:02:54.569> out<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.810> top<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.920> seems<00:02:56.129> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
Rises out of the top and it seems to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.750 
Rises out of the top and it seems to
cook<00:02:56.459> extremely<00:02:57.000> evenly<00:02:58.310> here's<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.400> handle

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
cook extremely evenly here's a handle

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.720 
cook extremely evenly here's a handle
off<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.299> gas<00:03:00.870> grill<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.220> screwed<00:03:02.609> on

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
off of a gas grill that I screwed on

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.610 
off of a gas grill that I screwed on
there<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.000> other<00:03:03.180> day

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
there the other day

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.059 
there the other day
these<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.769> lawn<00:03:05.190> mower<00:03:05.430> wheels<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:07.069> have

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
these are lawn mower wheels I just have

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.699 
these are lawn mower wheels I just have
these<00:03:08.220> little<00:03:08.430> splice<00:03:09.269> plates<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.349> use

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
these little splice plates that I use

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.119 
these little splice plates that I use
for<00:03:11.280> hooking<00:03:11.730> desks<00:03:12.150> together<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.620> cut<00:03:13.920> the

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
for hooking desks together and I cut the

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.160 
for hooking desks together and I cut the
hub's<00:03:14.639> off<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> lawnmower<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.750> welded<00:03:16.049> them

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
hub's off the lawnmower just welded them

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.629 
hub's off the lawnmower just welded them
to<00:03:16.290> those<00:03:16.409> so<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.739> could<00:03:16.889> screw<00:03:17.159> them<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.370> and

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
to those so I could screw them on and

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.330 
to those so I could screw them on and
have<00:03:17.760> them<00:03:17.849> be<00:03:18.000> removable<00:03:18.919> it's<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:19.980> great<00:03:20.190> big

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
have them be removable it's a great big

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.470 
have them be removable it's a great big
long<00:03:20.549> hinge<00:03:20.910> down<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> side<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.480> it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
long hinge down the side and it's

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.699 
long hinge down the side and it's
chained<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.019> I'm<00:03:25.109> probably<00:03:25.199> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.530> take

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
chained here I'm probably going to take

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.589 
chained here I'm probably going to take
that<00:03:25.859> off<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.250> used<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.579> use<00:03:26.760> used<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.329> use<00:03:27.419> this
