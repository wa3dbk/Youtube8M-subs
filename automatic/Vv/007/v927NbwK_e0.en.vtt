 The match eventually lost 1 to 3 and Voltis lost 5 consecutive games 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:04.549
 However, it became a game that will take the first goal from the strong team and lead next

 It is going to take to Fu Tteyuu how we taking advantage of the misunderstanding 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 Is more of that then or advanced by one year I I think the team of So What Learn 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.530
