00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.639
 how can we see what it is for 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:12.860
 then a meanwhile what is the Roman 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.370
 Rome is simply a projection 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 of the body astra 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 it is not temporal space 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.800
 the astral body we can explore 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.630
 with the conscience through the journey 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.730
 astral and in another space dimension 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.190
 temporal that is not in this world 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.809
 temporal space for which we cannot 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.030
 understand it using our 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.030
 brain we can only live it 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.480
 through what is called 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.719
 astral journey that transposition 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.519
 of our consciousness that is connected 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.640
 directly to our soul outside 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:02.499
 of space time in the astral world 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.320
 this street world has its own 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:08.530
 projection which is the connection with the 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:12.460
 our physical body which is called classroom e 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.320
 we can see the laura of people 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.760
 we can call it people 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.630
 if we also want the emotional body in the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.690
 meaning that emotions do for example 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.700
 vary in class both in size and in 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:39.130
 intensity in colors can create patterns 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:43.600
 holes in the classroom for which shortcomings e 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.540
 we could say that everything that happens 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.940
 our too physical dough before 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 through the classroom that constitutes one 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.760
 the energy envelope as we can 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:01.260
 see it and what it takes to see it 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.260
 using the eyes then the view 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.530
 we simply have to train and to 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.569
 train 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 just take the person to whom 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.400
 we want to be the publisher of the classroom 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:25.709
 place it in front of a screen or 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.709
 white or in any case a single color 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:36.900
 should be white black green better 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:41.770
 not too bright colors and in any case not 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 variegated because a multicolored background 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.540
 for beginners and especially not 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:56.970
 facilitates the need for the classroom after 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.970
 that we who want to remain reading 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.150
 we have to do a relaxation with 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.150
 eyes closed 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.610
 we could be standing or sitting where 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.100
 we are 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:19.870
 close your eyes focus on 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:23.760
 breath imagine to relax while 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.930
 go down a ladder or go down 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:33.610
 with an elevator just listening to the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.530
 transport down the methods 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.880
 however it can be many once 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.620
 that we have achieved with has been of 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.799
 relaxation we can open our eyes and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.170
 concentrate our central area 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:51.850
 focused on the third that is the person 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.709
 which we want to read the classroom but ours 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.140
 conscience we will send it to the vision 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.400
 peripheral that is on the contour of the 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:05.200
 person and we will notice if we are good at that 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:08.799
 on the control of the person one makes 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.070
 species of multicolored halo each one 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:15.760
 single color plus we will become more songs 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:19.019
 we will catch the small nuances e 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.900
 the breadth and grandeur of this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.460
 colored halo we might note in the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.380
 change this great colors e 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.830
 colored constitutes the true of the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:33.580
 person showing his camp 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.950
 astral in the world of forms to what 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.260
 need 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.720
 what is the vision of the classroom but in the meantime 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.430
 serves to easy in the account that a exists 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.080
 subtler world that is not only 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.850
 physical body then we can serve if 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.590
 we become good at catching any 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.450
 discomforts that a person lives but that i 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.840
 discomforts that the person lives yes 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.180
 manifest in Rome we could notice 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.930
 they are shifts of the classroom to one side 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.390
 to the other therefore for of symmetries they are 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.490
 lots of vectors that can be done 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.620
 however the important thing for now is that the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:20.340
 train to see and see and read 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.960
 laura at least in its basic form vi do 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.750
