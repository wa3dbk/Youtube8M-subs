00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
go to practice tomorrow I don't get to

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.440 
go to practice tomorrow I don't get to
coach<00:03:45.920> those<00:03:46.070> guys<00:03:46.310> tomorrow<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.269> worst

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
coach those guys tomorrow so the worst

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.240 
coach those guys tomorrow so the worst
thing<00:03:47.600> ever<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.380> going<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.800> locker<00:03:49.100> room

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
thing ever is going in that locker room

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.910 
thing ever is going in that locker room
after<00:03:49.550> this<00:03:49.670> game<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:50.600> know<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
after this game you know the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.009 
after this game you know the
substituting<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.220> plays<00:03:52.610> that's<00:03:53.019> simplistic

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
substituting and plays that's simplistic

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.670 
substituting and plays that's simplistic
every<00:03:54.680> time<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.730> we

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
every time that we

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.380 
every time that we
would<00:03:57.069> it<00:03:57.159> be<00:03:57.250> in<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.400> position<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.849> maybe<00:03:58.120> close

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
would it be in a position to maybe close

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.670 
would it be in a position to maybe close
the<00:03:58.569> game<00:03:58.750> out<00:03:58.900> we<00:03:59.079> would<00:03:59.260> they<00:03:59.379> would<00:03:59.409> make<00:03:59.650> a

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
the game out we would they would make a

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.710 
the game out we would they would make a
great<00:03:59.890> play<00:04:00.189> or<00:04:00.220> we<00:04:00.939> would<00:04:01.090> do<00:04:01.209> something<00:04:01.599> that

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
great play or we would do something that

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.960 
great play or we would do something that
would<00:04:01.840> would<00:04:02.620> hurt<00:04:02.799> us<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.849> know<00:04:03.939> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
would would hurt us and you know I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.770 
would would hurt us and you know I
thought<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.329> were<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> couple<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.659> times

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
thought there were a couple of times

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.000 
thought there were a couple of times
where<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.049> looked<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.560> know<00:04:05.650> maybe<00:04:05.829> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
where it looked you know maybe the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.170 
where it looked you know maybe the
momentum<00:04:06.340> had<00:04:06.430> changed<00:04:06.730> where<00:04:06.849> we<00:04:06.939> were<00:04:07.060> in

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
momentum had changed where we were in

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.339 
momentum had changed where we were in
trouble<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.599> we<00:04:07.720> would<00:04:07.840> come<00:04:07.959> up<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.200> make<00:04:08.319> a

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
trouble and we would come up and make a

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.559 
trouble and we would come up and make a
great<00:04:08.560> play<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:10.030> know<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.480> don't

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
great play and you know I just I don't

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.000 
great play and you know I just I don't
know<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.780> don't<00:04:11.140> know<00:04:11.260> what<00:04:11.379> to<00:04:11.500> say<00:04:11.530> other<00:04:11.950> than

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
know I don't know what to say other than

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.619 
know I don't know what to say other than
it<00:04:12.159> was<00:04:12.250> just<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.579> was<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:13.209> back<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.569> forth

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
it was just it was just back and forth

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.789 
it was just it was just back and forth
and<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.079> just<00:04:14.319> thought<00:04:14.409> was<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.650> great

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
and I just thought was a great

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.129 
and I just thought was a great

player he is really good we we did
everything<00:04:19.449> we<00:04:19.600> could<00:04:19.989> and<00:04:20.380> he<00:04:20.500> still<00:04:20.889> killed

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
everything we could and he still killed

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.550 
everything we could and he still killed
us<00:04:21.459> if<00:04:21.820> anything<00:04:22.240> it's<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.419> it's<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.440> all

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
us if anything it's just it's it's all

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.210 
us if anything it's just it's it's all
kind<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.889> way<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.039> ball<00:04:24.190> bounces

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
kind of the way the ball bounces

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.249 
kind of the way the ball bounces
sometimes<00:04:25.060> you<00:04:25.210> get<00:04:25.300> bad<00:04:25.509> for<00:04:25.539> fouls

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
sometimes you get bad for fouls

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.379 
sometimes you get bad for fouls
sometimes<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:26.979> don't<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.400> you<00:04:27.520> know<00:04:27.639> I<00:04:27.850> mean

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
they I'm sure they're probably talking

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.900 
they I'm sure they're probably talking
about<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.010> rest<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.250> little<00:04:30.430> bit<00:04:30.520> too<00:04:30.699> they're

of the big guys going out I mean it's
just<00:04:36.100> it's<00:04:36.580> just<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:36.820> way<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.030> ball<00:04:37.120> bounces

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
sometimes I mean I just played with the

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.830 
sometimes I mean I just played with the
same<00:04:39.220> intensity<00:04:39.580> I<00:04:39.699> always<00:04:40.030> do<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.419> shots

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840

little<00:04:43.090> bit<00:04:43.270> of<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.389> groove<00:04:43.570> but<00:04:43.960> it's<00:04:44.320> unique

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710
