the old dears light console the other

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.110 
the old dears light console the other
Zelda<00:05:51.870> one<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:52.260> thought<00:05:52.680> I'd<00:05:52.800> brick<00:05:53.340> bring<00:05:53.970> this

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
Zelda one I thought I'd brick bring this

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.750 
Zelda one I thought I'd brick bring this
out<00:05:54.360> well<00:05:55.200> just<00:05:55.710> to<00:05:55.830> show<00:05:56.010> you<00:05:56.070> like<00:05:56.340> the

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
out well just to show you like the

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.940 
out well just to show you like the
different<00:05:57.210> I<00:05:57.479> mean<00:05:57.660> this<00:05:57.750> was<00:05:57.960> gold<00:05:58.229> but<00:05:58.860> it

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
different I mean this was gold but it

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.210 
different I mean this was gold but it
was<00:05:59.250> kind<00:05:59.490> of<00:05:59.520> like<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.720> grey<00:06:00.720> gold<00:06:01.020> it<00:06:01.979> wasn't

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
was kind of like a grey gold it wasn't

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.969 
was kind of like a grey gold it wasn't
really<00:06:02.640> gold<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:03.960> think<00:06:04.200> they<00:06:04.320> did<00:06:04.380> that<00:06:04.710> so

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
really gold and I think they did that so

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.380 
really gold and I think they did that so
that<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:06.470> Triforce<00:06:07.470> symbol<00:06:07.800> appeared<00:06:08.610> you

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
that the Triforce symbol appeared you

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.519 
that the Triforce symbol appeared you
can<00:06:09.570> see<00:06:09.750> it

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
can see it

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:13.399 
can see it
but<00:06:10.769> this<00:06:10.979> one<00:06:11.189> plays<00:06:11.489> your<00:06:12.139> Gameboy<00:06:13.139> Advance

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
but this one plays your Gameboy Advance

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.729 
but this one plays your Gameboy Advance
games<00:06:13.679> as<00:06:13.829> well<00:06:14.039> so<00:06:14.609> that's<00:06:14.759> useful<00:06:15.319> but<00:06:16.319> just

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:16.739 
games as well so that's useful but just

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:18.349 
games as well so that's useful but just
goes<00:06:17.039> to<00:06:17.189> show<00:06:17.369> that's<00:06:17.699> that's<00:06:18.029> the<00:06:18.179> other

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:18.359 
goes to show that's that's the other

00:06:18.359 --> 00:06:20.329 
goes to show that's that's the other
like<00:06:18.659> addition<00:06:19.199> but<00:06:19.679> that<00:06:19.799> was<00:06:19.919> it<00:06:20.039> that<00:06:20.309> was

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:20.339 
like addition but that was it that was

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.749 
like addition but that was it that was
it<00:06:20.459> just<00:06:20.999> a<00:06:21.209> normal<00:06:21.859> ds3<00:06:22.859> PS<00:06:23.099> or<00:06:23.219> anything<00:06:23.369> and

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
it just a normal ds3 PS or anything and

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.209 
it just a normal ds3 PS or anything and
this<00:06:23.969> one<00:06:24.239> was<00:06:24.929> the<00:06:25.639> DSi<00:06:26.639> XL

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
this one was the DSi XL

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.089 
this one was the DSi XL
I've<00:06:29.219> got<00:06:29.399> DSi<00:06:29.849> as<00:06:29.909> well<00:06:30.209> somewhere<00:06:30.689> so<00:06:31.099> I've

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.099 
I've got DSi as well somewhere so I've

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:35.539 
I've got DSi as well somewhere so I've
got<00:06:32.339> plenty<00:06:32.369> of<00:06:33.049> Nintendo<00:06:34.049> consoles<00:06:34.619> but<00:06:35.459> it

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:35.549 
got plenty of Nintendo consoles but it

00:06:35.549 --> 00:06:38.149 
got plenty of Nintendo consoles but it
just<00:06:35.729> gives<00:06:35.849> you<00:06:35.999> a<00:06:36.529> quote<00:06:37.529> I<00:06:37.649> think<00:06:37.709> that's

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:38.159 
just gives you a quote I think that's

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.629 
just gives you a quote I think that's
quite<00:06:38.279> a<00:06:38.369> useful<00:06:38.689> show<00:06:39.689> of<00:06:40.309> where<00:06:41.309> it's<00:06:41.429> come

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
quite a useful show of where it's come

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.429 
quite a useful show of where it's come
from

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
from

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.769 
from
I<00:06:43.469> think<00:06:44.369> that<00:06:44.609> the<00:06:44.729> screen<00:06:45.089> is<00:06:45.329> such<00:06:45.569> Lee<00:06:45.749> a

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:45.779 
I think that the screen is such Lee a

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:48.039 
I think that the screen is such Lee a
little<00:06:45.989> bit<00:06:46.109> bigger<00:06:46.289> it<00:06:47.009> looks<00:06:47.039> bigger<00:06:47.459> on<00:06:47.669> the

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:48.049 
little bit bigger it looks bigger on the

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:52.789 
little bit bigger it looks bigger on the
3ds<00:06:50.089> but<00:06:51.089> that's<00:06:51.419> I<00:06:51.749> just<00:06:52.289> thought<00:06:52.379> I'd<00:06:52.529> show

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:52.799 
3ds but that's I just thought I'd show

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:54.019 
3ds but that's I just thought I'd show
you<00:06:52.829> that<00:06:52.979> I<00:06:53.129> might<00:06:53.309> do<00:06:53.399> another<00:06:53.549> video<00:06:53.699> I'll

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:54.029 
you that I might do another video I'll

00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:57.169 
you that I might do another video I'll
show<00:06:54.269> all<00:06:54.449> my<00:06:55.189> Nintendo<00:06:56.189> consoles<00:06:56.729> put<00:06:57.029> all

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:57.179 
show all my Nintendo consoles put all

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:59.539 
show all my Nintendo consoles put all
consoles<00:06:57.629> I<00:06:57.749> might<00:06:57.929> do<00:06:58.109> that<00:06:58.159> and<00:06:59.159> if<00:06:59.369> there's

00:06:59.539 --> 00:06:59.549 
consoles I might do that and if there's

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:01.879 
consoles I might do that and if there's
enough<00:06:59.729> interest<00:06:59.909> but<00:07:00.419> this<00:07:01.169> video<00:07:01.469> is<00:07:01.679> mainly

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:01.889
