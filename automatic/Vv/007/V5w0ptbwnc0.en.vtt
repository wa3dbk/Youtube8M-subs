the virus in the form of t-cells however
the<00:00:22.650> HIV<00:00:23.189> virus<00:00:23.220> spread<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.000> rapidly<00:00:24.029> that

the HIV virus spread so rapidly that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.060 
the HIV virus spread so rapidly that
there<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.140> aren't<00:00:25.289> enough<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:25.830> T

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
so the approach this team took was

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.060
