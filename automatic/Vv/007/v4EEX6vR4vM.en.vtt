cook it up and furnace here we are and I

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.180 
cook it up and furnace here we are and I
actually<00:04:08.540> explored<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.199> map<00:04:09.349> quite<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:09.889> lot

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
actually explored the map quite a lot

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.360 
actually explored the map quite a lot
before<00:04:10.730> actually<00:04:11.150> started<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.109> thing<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:13.160> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
before actually started this thing and I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.069 
before actually started this thing and I
found<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:13.940> wasn't<00:04:14.150> barrel<00:04:14.780> there

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
found that that wasn't barrel there

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.770 
found that that wasn't barrel there
wasn't<00:04:15.349> a<00:04:15.379> notion<00:04:15.709> about<00:04:15.789> alam<00:04:16.789> for<00:04:17.479> lease

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
wasn't a notion about alam for lease

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.520 
wasn't a notion about alam for lease
let's<00:04:18.590> say<00:04:19.269> few<00:04:20.269> thousand<00:04:20.810> blocks<00:04:21.049> because<00:04:21.349> i

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
let's say few thousand blocks because i

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.120 
let's say few thousand blocks because i
went<00:04:21.799> i<00:04:22.010> like<00:04:22.370> how<00:04:22.490> you've<00:04:22.699> made<00:04:23.120> 10<00:04:23.419> maps<00:04:24.130> just

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
went i like how you've made 10 maps just

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.400 
went i like how you've made 10 maps just
exploring<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.210> outside<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:27.020> see<00:04:27.139> how<00:04:27.229> far

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
exploring the outside to see how far

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.740 
exploring the outside to see how far
this<00:04:27.590> ocean<00:04:27.919> biome<00:04:28.250> how<00:04:29.000> far<00:04:29.240> we<00:04:29.389> are<00:04:29.419> away

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
this ocean biome how far we are away

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.870 
this ocean biome how far we are away
from<00:04:29.810> one<00:04:30.050> ocean<00:04:30.169> biome<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.680> there<00:04:30.949> is<00:04:31.070> one<00:04:31.099> on

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
from one ocean biome and there is one on

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.480 
from one ocean biome and there is one on
the<00:04:32.330> top<00:04:32.570> right<00:04:33.199> but<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.620> only<00:04:33.860> lasts<00:04:34.430> for

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
the top right but it only lasts for

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.760 
the top right but it only lasts for
about<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.849> few<00:04:35.180> blocks<00:04:35.330> few<00:04:36.050> hundred<00:04:36.349> blocks<00:04:36.560> in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
about a few blocks few hundred blocks in
