I<00:01:01.139> think<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.499> environment<00:01:02.069> in<00:01:02.129> business<00:01:02.429> is

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
I think of environment in business is

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.250 
I think of environment in business is
that<00:01:02.999> it's<00:01:03.179> such<00:01:03.299> a<00:01:03.329> small<00:01:03.629> program<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that it's such a small program the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
that it's such a small program the
professor's<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.880> name<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they recognize you in class and when you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
they recognize you in class and when you
go<00:01:08.250> see<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.720> everybody<00:01:10.110> in
