00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
these for this design I think I drew a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.660 
these for this design I think I drew a
black<00:01:12.390> pencil<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.020> white<00:01:13.350> paper<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.369> made

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
black pencil on white paper and made

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.260 
black pencil on white paper and made
sure<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.900> rows<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.470> totally<00:01:17.159> uneven<00:01:17.820> they

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
sure the rows were totally uneven they

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120 
sure the rows were totally uneven they
weren't<00:01:18.540> meant<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.200> same<00:01:19.530> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
weren't meant to look all the same and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.149 
weren't meant to look all the same and
there's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.640> bow<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.840> I

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
there's a little bow here and there I

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.940 
there's a little bow here and there I
think<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.670> life<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.750> whole<00:01:24.960> point<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.619> all

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
think in life the whole point is we all

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.910 
think in life the whole point is we all
live<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> certain<00:01:27.090> form<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.920> ethics

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
live it with a certain form of ethics

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.899 
live it with a certain form of ethics
that<00:01:29.189> keep<00:01:29.460> ourselves<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.670> do

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that keep ourselves going and we do

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.440 
that keep ourselves going and we do
things<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:34.110> hope<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> reason<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:36.060> think

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
things we hope with a reason and I think

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359 
things we hope with a reason and I think
if<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:37.020> things<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.070> hope

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
if you do things for what you hope

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.630 
if you do things for what you hope
personally<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:40.020> reason<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:41.310> gives

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
personally is the right reason it gives

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.679 
personally is the right reason it gives
you<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> another<00:01:42.829> extra<00:01:44.119> incentive<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.479> on
