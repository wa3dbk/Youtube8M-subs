00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.600 
joint type things because of incidents
like<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.300> or<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.720> benefits<00:04:54.140> no<00:04:54.680> way<00:04:55.040> no<00:04:55.580> I

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
like this or to the benefits no way no I

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.970 
like this or to the benefits no way no I
think<00:04:56.000> the<00:04:56.810> only<00:04:56.990> thing<00:04:57.110> I'll<00:04:57.380> rethink<00:04:57.860> is

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
think the only thing I'll rethink is

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.560 
think the only thing I'll rethink is
going<00:04:58.250> three<00:04:58.490> straight<00:04:58.760> days<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.180> pads<00:04:59.390> I

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
going three straight days and pads I

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.090 
going three straight days and pads I
think<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.020> think<00:05:00.380> against<00:05:00.620> new<00:05:00.710> england<00:05:00.770> last

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
think I think against new england last

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.200 
think I think against new england last
year<00:05:01.250> we<00:05:01.310> were<00:05:01.400> probably<00:05:01.520> two<00:05:01.760> days<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.120> then

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
year we were probably two days and then

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.750 
year we were probably two days and then
we<00:05:02.270> went<00:05:02.420> in<00:05:02.570> shorts<00:05:03.140> day<00:05:03.950> before<00:05:04.280> a<00:05:04.310> game<00:05:04.490> i

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
we went in shorts day before a game i

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.980 
we went in shorts day before a game i
think<00:05:05.030> three<00:05:05.210> days<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.540> row<00:05:05.570> is<00:05:05.750> probably

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
think three days in a row is probably

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.380 
think three days in a row is probably
too<00:05:06.140> much<00:05:06.320> these<00:05:06.770> guys<00:05:06.890> get<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.160> little<00:05:07.390> less

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
too much these guys get a little less

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.700 
too much these guys get a little less
third<00:05:08.750> day<00:05:08.930> if<00:05:09.020> they're<00:05:09.170> in<00:05:09.260> shorts<00:05:09.560> there's

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
third day if they're in shorts there's

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.930 
third day if they're in shorts there's
no<00:05:09.830> way<00:05:09.950> they<00:05:10.070> can<00:05:10.130> really<00:05:10.370> fight<00:05:10.670> because

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
no way they can really fight because

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.730 
no way they can really fight because
there's<00:05:11.090> no<00:05:11.180> contact<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:11.990> know<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:12.320> we

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
there's no contact you know but we

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.850 
there's no contact you know but we
thought<00:05:12.890> it<00:05:13.010> was<00:05:13.070> important<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:14.780> get<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.710> work

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
thought it was important to get the work

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.590 
thought it was important to get the work
in<00:05:16.040> for<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.280> lot<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.430> our<00:05:16.580> young<00:05:16.610> guys<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.300> our

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
in for a lot of our young guys and our

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.570 
in for a lot of our young guys and our
preseason<00:05:18.140> games<00:05:18.440> not<00:05:18.650> till<00:05:18.800> thursday<00:05:19.310> so<00:05:19.370> we

preseason games not till thursday so we

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.550 
preseason games not till thursday so we
had<00:05:19.670> time<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.030> do<00:05:20.180> this<00:05:20.330> so<00:05:20.570> that<00:05:21.230> be<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.440> only

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
had time to do this so that be the only

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.810 
had time to do this so that be the only
thing<00:05:21.740> i<00:05:21.800> rethink<00:05:22.130> but<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.340> think<00:05:22.640> these<00:05:22.760> are

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
thing i rethink but I think these are

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.330 
thing i rethink but I think these are
