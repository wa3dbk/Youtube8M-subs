balloon<00:00:13.259> indicators<00:00:14.120> first<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:16.130> have<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:17.340> two

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
balloon indicators first I have my two

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.109 
balloon indicators first I have my two
flies<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.680> I'd<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.640> two<00:00:20.850> smaller

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
flies on I'd like to use two smaller

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.820 
flies on I'd like to use two smaller
flies<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.660> need<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> lot<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> weight<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.560> don't

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
flies so I need a lot of weight I don't

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.980 
flies so I need a lot of weight I don't
like<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.100> use<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> big<00:00:23.550> heavy<00:00:24.300> fly<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
like to use a big heavy fly and a

like to use a big heavy fly and a
smaller<00:00:25.260> one<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.920> better<00:00:26.099> luck<00:00:26.279> with

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
smaller one I have better luck with

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.029 
smaller one I have better luck with
smaller<00:00:26.699> flies<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.210> I'm<00:00:27.300> using<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.779> those

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
smaller flies so I'm using two of those

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.820 
smaller flies so I'm using two of those
so<00:00:29.039> I'm<00:00:29.099> gonna<00:00:29.250> rig<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.480> fairly<00:00:30.480> heavy<00:00:30.830> weights

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so I'm gonna rig up fairly heavy weights

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.930 
so I'm gonna rig up fairly heavy weights
on<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:34.550> first<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:36.290> I'll<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.790> grab

container back and then I'll take the
stack<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.550> add<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.420> weight<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.809> I'll<00:00:54.930> put

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
stack of a add on weight so I'll put

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.520 
stack of a add on weight so I'll put
them<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.289> my<00:00:55.379> finger<00:00:55.680> step<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:57.260> add<00:00:58.260> on

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
them on my finger step to use to add on

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.410 
them on my finger step to use to add on
weight<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.190> fish<00:01:00.170> remove<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.059> nut<00:01:03.059> from<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
weight as I fish remove the nut from the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.859 
weight as I fish remove the nut from the
screw<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.270> I'll<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:08.360> post<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.630> line

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
screw and then I'll put the post on line

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.520 
screw and then I'll put the post on line
line<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> few<00:01:10.860> inches<00:01:10.979> above<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:12.530> first

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
line just a few inches above my first

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:22.640 
line just a few inches above my first
fly<00:01:13.830> put<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> nut<00:01:14.850> back<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.200> that'll<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
fly put the nut back on and that'll be

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
fly put the nut back on and that'll be
tight<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.759> line<00:01:28.579> move<00:01:29.600> there's<00:01:30.600> already

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
tight on the line move there's already

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.429 
tight on the line move there's already
some<00:01:31.470> weight<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.829> there<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.140> start

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
some weight in there but I'm gonna start

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.030 
some weight in there but I'm gonna start
with<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> couple<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.950> additional<00:01:35.210> weights<00:01:37.040> add

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
with a couple of additional weights add

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700 
with a couple of additional weights add
one<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.549> add<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> can

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
one on add two on as you can see I can

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.350 
one on add two on as you can see I can
add<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.400> subtract<00:01:41.729> weight<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.119> pretty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
add and subtract weight that's pretty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.950 
add and subtract weight that's pretty
easily<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:42.990> won't<00:01:43.170> cast<00:01:43.619> off<00:01:44.960> maybe

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
easily and they won't cast off maybe

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
easily and they won't cast off maybe
I'll<00:01:46.140> start<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> want<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
I'll start with three and if I want to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.359 
I'll start with three and if I want to
adjust<00:01:48.990> where<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.439> weights<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> line

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
adjust where the weights are on the line

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.850 
adjust where the weights are on the line
I<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.520> loosen<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.360> pull<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.560> different

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I just loosen and pull to a different

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.389 
I just loosen and pull to a different
spots<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:53.970> tighten<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.860> back<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:55.920> so

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
spots and then tighten it back up so

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.620 
spots and then tighten it back up so
that's<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.390> weight<00:01:57.540> system<00:01:59.090> as<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.299> said<00:02:00.479> I've
