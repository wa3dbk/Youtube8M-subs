Namaskar<00:00:07.270> today<00:00:08.270> I<00:00:08.300> am<00:00:08.420> going<00:00:08.570> to<00:00:08.660> share

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
Namaskar today I am going to share

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.549 
Namaskar today I am going to share
principles<00:00:11.000> of<00:00:11.120> fire<00:00:11.300> weather<00:00:11.559> specifically

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
principles of fire weather specifically

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.950 
principles of fire weather specifically
what<00:00:12.889> is<00:00:13.040> mentioned

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
what is mentioned

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.170 
what is mentioned
is<00:00:14.320> called<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.950> root<00:00:15.130> cause<00:00:15.430> of<00:00:15.460> diseases

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
is called the root cause of diseases

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.020 
is called the root cause of diseases
however<00:00:17.170> there<00:00:17.500> is<00:00:17.560> a<00:00:17.590> ancient<00:00:18.100> science<00:00:18.520> which

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.030 
however there is a ancient science which

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.970 
however there is a ancient science which
has<00:00:19.240> been<00:00:19.450> practiced<00:00:20.050> in<00:00:20.230> India<00:00:20.350> for<00:00:20.770> more

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
has been practiced in India for more

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.430 
has been practiced in India for more
than<00:00:21.130> 5,000<00:00:21.790> years<00:00:21.850> and<00:00:22.510> it<00:00:22.900> has<00:00:23.020> been<00:00:23.200> seen

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
than 5,000 years and it has been seen

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.010 
than 5,000 years and it has been seen
that<00:00:23.470> this<00:00:23.830> knowledge<00:00:24.279> is<00:00:25.090> very<00:00:25.510> deep<00:00:25.810> and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
that this knowledge is very deep and

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.230 
that this knowledge is very deep and
very<00:00:26.110> scientific<00:00:26.950> you<00:00:27.100> know<00:00:27.130> even<00:00:28.060> today

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
very scientific you know even today

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.420 
very scientific you know even today
after<00:00:28.930> so<00:00:29.110> many<00:00:29.290> thousands<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.890> years<00:00:30.070> this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
after so many thousands of years this

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.250 
after so many thousands of years this
knowledge<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:31.150> still<00:00:31.420> existing<00:00:31.780> and<00:00:32.110> it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
knowledge is still existing and it's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.250 
knowledge is still existing and it's
very<00:00:32.529> widely<00:00:32.770> practice<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.550> very<00:00:33.580> effective

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
very widely practice is very effective

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.650 
very widely practice is very effective
so<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.790> the<00:00:36.940> root<00:00:37.120> cause<00:00:37.150> of<00:00:37.449> disease

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
so what is the root cause of disease

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.770 
so what is the root cause of disease
it's<00:00:38.170> very<00:00:38.440> interesting<00:00:38.739> that<00:00:39.250> when<00:00:40.239> we<00:00:40.420> think

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
it's very interesting that when we think

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.990 
it's very interesting that when we think
of<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.020> root<00:00:41.230> cause<00:00:41.500> we<00:00:41.770> always<00:00:42.129> think<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.699> some

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
of a root cause we always think of some

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.110 
of a root cause we always think of some
infection<00:00:43.570> some<00:00:44.050> bacteria<00:00:44.590> some<00:00:44.890> virus<00:00:45.280> but

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
infection some bacteria some virus but

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.090 
infection some bacteria some virus but
in<00:00:46.300> our<00:00:46.420> weather<00:00:46.660> they<00:00:46.899> talk<00:00:47.410> in<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.710> different

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
in our weather they talk in a different

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.340 
in our weather they talk in a different
level<00:00:48.399> in<00:00:48.640> a<00:00:48.670> completely<00:00:49.480> different<00:00:49.630> level

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
level in a completely different level

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.229 
level in a completely different level
they<00:00:50.680> say<00:00:50.890> the<00:00:51.010> root<00:00:51.190> cause<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.489> first<00:00:51.940> root

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
they say the root cause of first root

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.620 
they say the root cause of first root
cause<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.989> diseases<00:00:53.850> misuse<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:54.880> intelligence

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
cause of diseases misuse of intelligence

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.690 
cause of diseases misuse of intelligence
not<00:00:56.230> using<00:00:56.710> our<00:00:56.829> intelligence<00:00:57.460> which<00:00:57.670> is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
not using our intelligence which is

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.250 
not using our intelligence which is
called<00:00:58.090> raga<00:00:58.600> Parag

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
called raga Parag

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.690 
called raga Parag
very<00:00:59.890> nice<00:01:00.809> thought<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:02.079> would<00:01:02.469> say<00:01:02.710> by<00:01:03.550> our

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
very nice thought I would say by our

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.670 
very nice thought I would say by our
ancient<00:01:04.030> Rishi's<00:01:04.600> in<00:01:04.989> our<00:01:05.170> ancient

ancient Rishi's in our ancient

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.280 
ancient Rishi's in our ancient
scientists<00:01:06.240> misuse<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.270> intelligence<00:01:08.020> of

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
scientists misuse of intelligence of

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.130 
scientists misuse of intelligence of
course<00:01:08.590> we<00:01:09.520> all<00:01:09.790> have<00:01:09.820> intelligence<00:01:10.690> but<00:01:10.960> when

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
course we all have intelligence but when

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.980 
course we all have intelligence but when
it<00:01:11.259> comes<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.680> our<00:01:11.770> own<00:01:12.009> system<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.780> see

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
it comes to our own system if you see

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.670 
it comes to our own system if you see
from<00:01:14.170> morning<00:01:14.680> till<00:01:14.890> night<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.789> are<00:01:15.910> busy<00:01:16.300> just

from morning till night we are busy just
destroying<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:17.950> system<00:01:18.369> not<00:01:18.580> taking<00:01:19.030> care

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240

kind of stuff may not really as if that
is<00:01:44.890> not<00:01:45.040> enough<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.210> are<00:01:46.299> eating<00:01:46.479> junk

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
is not enough then we are eating junk

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.749 
is not enough then we are eating junk
food<00:01:47.200> junk<00:01:47.560> means<00:01:47.799> garbage<00:01:48.100> we're<00:01:48.460> eating

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
food junk means garbage we're eating

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.060 
food junk means garbage we're eating
garbage<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:49.930> means<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.470> are<00:01:50.560> not<00:01:50.740> using

from a specific source of energy not

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.729 
from a specific source of energy not
from<00:02:11.799> some<00:02:12.549> kind<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.940> food<00:02:13.720> which<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.019> only<00:02:14.350> for

from some kind of food which is only for
the<00:02:14.890> tongue<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.540> are<00:02:16.630> eating<00:02:16.900> for<00:02:17.260> the

the tongue so when we are eating for the
tongue<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.070> called<00:02:18.370> misuse<00:02:18.850> of

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
tongue this is called misuse of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
tongue this is called misuse of
intelligence<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.440> tongue<00:02:20.680> really

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
intelligence because the tongue really

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.800 
intelligence because the tongue really
does<00:02:21.280> not<00:02:21.579> need

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810

intelligence in there we don't want our
mobile<00:03:38.200> phone<00:03:38.500> to<00:03:38.769> get<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.730> blast<00:03:40.000> we<00:03:40.569> don't

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
mobile phone to get a blast we don't

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.199 
mobile phone to get a blast we don't

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
want our car to just you know not

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.380 
want our car to just you know not
function<00:03:43.780> but<00:03:44.650> what<00:03:44.799> about<00:03:45.069> this<00:03:45.250> car<00:03:45.579> this

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
function but what about this car this

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.309 
function but what about this car this
most<00:03:46.780> important<00:03:47.530> car<00:03:48.489> that<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.910> have<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:50.109> the

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
most important car that I have is the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.590 
most important car that I have is the
most<00:03:50.500> important<00:03:51.040> amount<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.579> this<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:51.910> where

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
most important amount so this is where

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.809 
most important amount so this is where
we<00:03:53.079> don't<00:03:53.290> use<00:03:53.530> intelligence<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.400> that's<00:03:54.579> why

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
we don't use intelligence and that's why

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.170 
we don't use intelligence and that's why
we<00:03:55.030> actually<00:03:55.690> get<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.500> many<00:03:56.680> diseases<00:03:57.180> whether

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
we actually get so many diseases whether

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.729 
we actually get so many diseases whether
they're<00:03:58.480> physical<00:03:58.720> disease<00:03:59.319> or<00:03:59.530> mental

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
they're physical disease or mental

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.069 
they're physical disease or mental
diseases<00:04:00.250> they're<00:04:01.060> all<00:04:01.209> related<00:04:01.480> with<00:04:01.930> this

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
diseases they're all related with this

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.280 
diseases they're all related with this
one<00:04:02.440> root<00:04:02.889> cause<00:04:03.220> which<00:04:03.850> is<00:04:03.880> called<00:04:04.329> misuse<00:04:05.260> of

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
one root cause which is called misuse of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.400 
one root cause which is called misuse of
intelligence<00:04:06.069> so<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:07.150> would<00:04:07.660> like<00:04:07.840> all<00:04:08.170> of<00:04:08.290> you
