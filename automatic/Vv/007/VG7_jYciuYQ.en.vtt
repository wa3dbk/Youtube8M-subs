00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.919
 as in call android 4 April April 2 nuclear 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:51.870

 screen resolution of 768 by 1280 pixels 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.160
 main camera 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.250
 8 megapixel real 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:06.370
 8 megapixel shoots very well 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:10.300
 so on gig RAM 8 embedded 4 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.600
 core pros adreno 305 video card so so 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.169
 so pixel density is 325 density 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.760
 pixels 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:23.760
 not bad by the way camera 2 and they spear 8 8 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:27.040

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.910
 compass satellite positioning will 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.930
 to happen quite badly so from 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.690
 deficiencies 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.210
 of the shortcomings, I note the absence 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:45.310
 the touch buttons on the bottom they 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:48.810
 there is firmware here home button 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.850
 the menu button and the back button are all three 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:55.060
 buttons there is a bottom panel and firmware for me 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.040
 it's honestly inconvenient but the smartphone 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.340
 very worthy lies in my hand he 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.720
 quite liked the assembled cool 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.820

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.860
 stupid does not google does not slow down toys 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:26.000
 I did not set 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:28.520
 I think they will play normally then 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.060
 You can put such a device 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.950
