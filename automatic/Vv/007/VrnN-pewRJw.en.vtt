00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 I have this samsung galaxy s 3000 that 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.830
 it arrives because it does not charge the lady says that 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.590
 it appears that the client is loading and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 that does not load anything here at this moment 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.720
 we are connecting it by means 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.720
 of the usb detector 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.460
 is supplying the charger 5.3 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.100
 volts but there is zero consumption although the 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.260
 phone shows that you are loading this 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.060
 Why is that this should not be so 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.070
 For example, it's the phone that I have here 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.740
 just to show you when a phone 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.670
 is loading has to generate 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.489
 a consumption that the battery accumulating that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.260
 voltage and then add the components 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.920
 or circuits that are in charge of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.899
 manage that load consume something this 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.489
 minimum but consumption is also added 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.560
 of the battery that's why we see that it's 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.000
 consuming at this moment with a 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.370
 battery discharged at 1 percent 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.450
 then it is consuming almost 600 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.190
 thousand in periods 60 points 6 amps 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.220
 then this is the behavior 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.009
 normal of a phone is important the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.530
 usb detector in this case we can here 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.600
 analyze that I analyzed one with this 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.890
 phone that is here that came to me with 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.380
 this fails 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.260
 that something is happening and that although 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.930
 show that you are loading this is not 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.580
 consuming nothing which I will uncover 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.229
 it and most likely the pin is 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.940
 Failing but I will also be able to 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.460
 find say with sulfate in the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.200
 components some component in short 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.190
 failing then let's analyze to see what 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.050
 We will find 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.120
 he says I have the guard in my hands 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.100
 pulling out the screws that came to it 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.180
 to show the status of the pri insists 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.130
 in the brush apparently good 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.290
 what I am going to say next that 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.500
 here on the positive pizza is the pizza 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.840
 positive and is the negative we reach to 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.730
 see a small fissure but here there are 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.780
 something that can deceive us because if 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.040
 we take voltage 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.250
 for example here we take voltage 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.740
 look what happens if I take voltages 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.460
 it shows me what the voltage is going 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.010
 normally here the voltage is passing 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.830
 and then what happens is that the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.510
 voltage if it's happening but the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.700
 current is not coming with its 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.720
 power because of that fissure and a bad 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.530
 contact and even if the voltage passes there is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.960
 an important loss of amps or of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.060
 current which is not enough to 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.980
 open the circuit and let loose 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.010
 towards the other components is also 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.140
 the voltage then simply that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.980
 we are going to do then retouch the view in 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.520
 this case is doing wrong 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.840
 contact a cold solder what happens 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.290
 is that many times for example 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.230
 you touch and when when that track is 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.269
 big as it has a base 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.099
 bigger than the others we 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.460
 we have to leave the soldering iron for a while 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.260
 there 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.650
 waiting for him 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.230
 Tin is well founded 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.989
 and then retouch the good we're going to 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.769
 bury there to be well increased the 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.769
 temperature and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.650
 And we will tweak the other because 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.650
 we have there of zapa 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.760
 let's clean up and we'll analyze how we 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 stay 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.220
 after retouching hours and tracks 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.530
 a list goes down quickly 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.080
 battery connected just look what 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.170
 happens 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.360
 in the detector one starts showing 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.060
 in normal normal consumption of everything 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.440
 phone when it's charging well here 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.600
 we already see the phone loading 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.180
 perfectly we see that now if we 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.020
 shows a consumption in amperage and we see 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.350
 that has risen to 56% this had as 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.030
 48% now it is loading and it is in the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.400
 difference when a phone you follow 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.859
 accumulating in the battery that although 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.080
 show the ray shows us a consumption 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.910
 in amperage since the current is 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.180
 circulating along the lines of 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.580
 load and reaches to break the components 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.710
 because some work let's say to 500 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.930
 milliamps if there is a leak of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.360
 current then even if the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.160
 voltage is not going to activate the circuit 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.200
 until it reaches its amperage 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.210
 adequate service the arauca service
