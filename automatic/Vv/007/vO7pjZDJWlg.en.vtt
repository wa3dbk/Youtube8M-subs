the<00:00:28.320> hardware<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.950> our<00:00:29.100> unboxing<00:00:29.400> video<00:00:29.850> but

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the hardware on our unboxing video but

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
the hardware on our unboxing video but
just<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.720> elaborate<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.500> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just to elaborate a little bit on that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.870 
just to elaborate a little bit on that
and<00:00:31.860> how<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.010> feels<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> hand<00:00:32.610> before<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and how it feels in the hand before we

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.910 
and how it feels in the hand before we
pair<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.150> the<00:00:33.300> screen<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> definitely<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pair on the screen it is definitely a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.040 
pair on the screen it is definitely a
unique<00:00:35.460> device<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.840> look

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
unique device I really like the look

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.990 
unique device I really like the look
here<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> white<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.820> looks

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
here I think the white one really looks

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
here I think the white one really looks
amazing<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.570> even<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.840> black<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.230> has<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
amazing but even the black one has a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.890 
amazing but even the black one has a
quiet<00:00:40.860> sort<00:00:41.400> of<00:00:41.489> distinguished<00:00:42.090> dignity<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
quiet sort of distinguished dignity to

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200 
quiet sort of distinguished dignity to
it<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.199> as<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.280> mentioned<00:00:44.580> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.730> unboxing

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
it and as I mentioned on the unboxing

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
it and as I mentioned on the unboxing
video<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> looks<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.220> rigid

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
video this looks like a kind of a rigid

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
video this looks like a kind of a rigid
textured<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.199> actually

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
textured back but it's not it's actually

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
textured back but it's not it's actually
soft<00:00:49.800> touch<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.309> gives<00:00:50.790> you<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> good

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
soft touch and then gives you a good

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.729 
soft touch and then gives you a good
amount<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.479> grip<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.080> can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.470> screen

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
amount of grip as you can see the screen

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.399 
amount of grip as you can see the screen
is<00:00:53.010> no<00:00:53.159> stranger<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.640> fingerprints<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.839> but

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
is no stranger to fingerprints here but

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.170 
is no stranger to fingerprints here but
it<00:00:55.800> doesn't<00:00:56.070> mean<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.250> feels<00:00:56.460> bad<00:00:56.640> under<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it doesn't mean it feels bad under the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.600 
it doesn't mean it feels bad under the
thumb<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.809> feels<00:00:58.290> in<00:00:58.530> some<00:00:58.800> ways<00:00:58.979> a<00:00:59.010> lot<00:00:59.309> like

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
we're used to seeing from flagships but

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
to be honest it's quite refreshing to be

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.930 
to be honest it's quite refreshing to be

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you know very sharp angles on the front

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.000 
you know very sharp angles on the front
here<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.350> hurt<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.830> they

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
here but they don't hurt at all they

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.310 
here but they don't hurt at all they
just<00:01:17.040> add<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.210> aesthetic<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.260> a

just add to the aesthetic kind of a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
just add to the aesthetic kind of a
brutally<00:01:19.830> simplistic<00:01:20.460> aesthetic<00:01:21.030> but<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
brutally simplistic aesthetic but it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.720
