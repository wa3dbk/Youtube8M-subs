00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.330
 see 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.520
 I think this is the differential 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.560
 the whole scenario of this philosophy 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.270

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:31.300
 to our needs 

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:33.460

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.509

 we all work on various actions 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.460
 and in this experience 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.310
 we discover a true sense of the 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.229
 speak citizenship citizenship 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.569

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.529
 people learn 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.020

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:46.930

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:52.029
 generate individual and collective values 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:56.279
