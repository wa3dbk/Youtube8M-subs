they would get through even in the
hardest<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:19.600> know<00:04:19.919> situations<00:04:20.919> he's<00:04:21.459> just

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
hardest you know situations he's just

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.420 
hardest you know situations he's just
really<00:04:21.970> good<00:04:22.240> at<00:04:22.270> passing

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
really good at passing

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.420 
really good at passing
and<00:04:24.210> then<00:04:24.330> we<00:04:24.479> go<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.630> 0<00:04:24.780> zoo<00:04:25.080> this<00:04:25.320> guy<00:04:25.560> I'm<00:04:26.370> not

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
and then we go to 0 zoo this guy I'm not

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.090 
and then we go to 0 zoo this guy I'm not
joking<00:04:27.090> but<00:04:27.240> his<00:04:27.419> pace<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.930> really<00:04:28.259> is<00:04:28.650> not

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
joking but his pace is really is not

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.159 
joking but his pace is really is not
really<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> TI<00:04:29.789> think<00:04:30.150> he's<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.360> bit<00:04:30.570> faster<00:04:30.990> than

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
really a TI think he's a bit faster than

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.159 
really a TI think he's a bit faster than
that<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.500> quite<00:04:31.800> good<00:04:32.039> at<00:04:32.630> he<00:04:33.630> has<00:04:33.750> quite<00:04:33.960> good

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
that is quite good at he has quite good

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.430 
that is quite good at he has quite good
pace<00:04:35.210> his<00:04:36.210> passing<00:04:36.720> is<00:04:36.810> really<00:04:37.110> good<00:04:37.259> as<00:04:37.410> well

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
pace his passing is really good as well

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.300 
pace his passing is really good as well
and<00:04:37.860> obviously<00:04:38.580> he's<00:04:39.120> he's<00:04:39.509> more<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.259> a<00:04:40.440> Santa

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
and obviously he's he's more of a Santa

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.340 
and obviously he's he's more of a Santa
attacking<00:04:41.699> midfielder<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:42.810> because<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.139> don't

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
attacking midfielder but because I don't

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.020 
attacking midfielder but because I don't
have<00:04:43.380> that<00:04:43.590> position<00:04:44.039> I<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:44.370> put<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.610> there<00:04:44.820> I

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
have that position I just put in there I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.770 
have that position I just put in there I
really<00:04:46.020> like<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.259> 433<00:04:46.710> information<00:04:47.660> which<00:04:48.660> i

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
really like the 433 information which i

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.659 
really like the 433 information which i
think<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:49.080> like<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.410> big<00:04:49.560> bigger<00:04:50.250> brother<00:04:50.520> of

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
think is like the big bigger brother of

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.689 
think is like the big bigger brother of
this<00:04:50.820> formation<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.949> he's<00:04:52.949> too<00:04:53.130> expensive

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
this formation but he's too expensive

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.310 
this formation but he's too expensive
and<00:04:54.150> then<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:54.990> got<00:04:55.169> a<00:04:55.639> he's<00:04:56.639> jesus<00:04:57.330> navas<00:04:57.750> and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
and then we got a he's jesus navas and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.890 
and then we got a he's jesus navas and
his<00:04:58.979> pace<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.520> quite<00:04:59.729> fast<00:05:00.000> he<00:05:00.210> is<00:05:00.360> quite<00:05:00.599> fast

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
his pace is quite fast he is quite fast

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.749 
his pace is quite fast he is quite fast
and<00:05:01.610> probably<00:05:02.610> more<00:05:03.449> like<00:05:03.690> a<00:05:04.160> 99-93<00:05:05.160> I<00:05:05.430> don't

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 
and probably more like a 99-93 I don't

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.850 
and probably more like a 99-93 I don't
think<00:05:05.940> he's<00:05:06.060> really<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.479> fast<00:05:06.720> his<00:05:07.440> passing

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
think he's really that fast his passing

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.159 
think he's really that fast his passing
is<00:05:07.979> gold<00:05:08.280> mother<00:05:08.550> then<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.690> know<00:05:09.810> we<00:05:10.020> got

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
is gold mother then you know we got

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.230 
is gold mother then you know we got
Cristiano<00:05:10.710> Ronaldo<00:05:11.340> there's<00:05:11.639> nothing<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.090> say

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
Cristiano Ronaldo there's nothing to say

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.339 
Cristiano Ronaldo there's nothing to say
about<00:05:12.360> this<00:05:12.660> guy<00:05:12.979> he<00:05:13.979> is<00:05:14.099> really<00:05:14.340> good<00:05:14.699> I

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
about this guy he is really good I

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.300 
about this guy he is really good I
really<00:05:16.349> wanted<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.770> team<00:05:16.949> of<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.280> year

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
really wanted the team of the year

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.310 
really wanted the team of the year
version<00:05:17.880> or<00:05:18.030> probably<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.419> in-form<00:05:18.810> version

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
version or probably the in-form version

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.189 
version or probably the in-form version
but<00:05:19.800> that's<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.580> best<00:05:20.729> I<00:05:20.940> could<00:05:21.000> get<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.930> then

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
but that's the best I could get and then

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.060 
but that's the best I could get and then
we<00:05:22.380> have<00:05:22.669> informed<00:05:23.900> Benzema<00:05:24.900> obviously<00:05:25.830> he

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
we have informed Benzema obviously he

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.120 
we have informed Benzema obviously he
has<00:05:26.190> got<00:05:26.430> upgrade<00:05:26.910> and<00:05:27.289> you<00:05:28.289> know<00:05:28.440> his<00:05:28.919> upgrade

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
has got upgrade and you know his upgrade

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.820 
has got upgrade and you know his upgrade
is<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.580> same<00:05:29.789> but<00:05:30.060> still<00:05:30.360> I've<00:05:30.740> had<00:05:31.740> the

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
is the same but still I've had the

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.770 
is the same but still I've had the
in-form<00:05:32.159> before<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.669> upgrade<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.330> I'm<00:05:33.539> just

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
in-form before the upgrade and I'm just

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.370 
in-form before the upgrade and I'm just
keeping<00:05:34.110> him<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.530> his<00:05:35.280> pace<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.729> really<00:05:36.060> good

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
keeping him and his pace is really good

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.260 
keeping him and his pace is really good
and<00:05:37.430> he's<00:05:38.430> got<00:05:38.610> good<00:05:38.760> shooting<00:05:39.120> and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
and he's got good shooting and

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.270 
and he's got good shooting and
everything<00:05:39.570> but<00:05:39.690> his<00:05:39.810> face<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.050> ultimate<00:05:40.970> and

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280
