00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.929
 varieties of the band the office to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 islah'm here angustifolia is , 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.840
 we will also see them in a larger size 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.710
 we also have the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.810
 antolín as santolina is a news 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.770
 is a plant like lavender if the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.100
 pilgrims very appreciated for growing in 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 parterres in plants and aromatics 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.170
 rosemary there are also two types of 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.180
 rosemary the normal rosemary the officinalis and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.920
 then we have the post that is the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.819
 rosemary this hanging 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.450
 it is a rosemary that the characteristic 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.450
 main is falling and also sets 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.040
 on top of walls and it's very beautiful 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 a very beautiful blue flower stand apart from 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.160
 those of being good cooks also 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.400
 like to prepare them good mojitos or 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.860
 would be advised regrets that apart from that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.530
 it gets very big it stretches a lot in 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.220
 summer 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:52.239
 it enters but very well and for the mojito it is 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.310
 fantastic you also have chives 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.560
 chives that is this other variety that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.780
 do not confuse it with the calçots 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.490
 calçots are thicker but good 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.140
 as well 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.170
 one more variety of plant 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.990
 aromatic and culinary we have also 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 oregano and the guys that I told you that 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.080
 I did a lot of the smell that I taught you 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.680
 the nuanced here we have it in green is 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.270
 this guy that the pity is that I do not 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.890
 you can smell but it is a very intense pain 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.709
 very nice and good then also 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.750
 we have cilantro which is another kind of 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.840
 plant that is also culinary the 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.940
 cilantro and the dill this is also a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.790
 plant that is not known much by the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.540
 chefs appreciate it and like the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.140
 cilantro the cilantro is the dill 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.989
 is this and now we can move on to see 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.840
 aromatic plants in larger sizes in 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.269
 size and if you have space and you can my 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.239
 advice is to group them into groups the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.300
 bands that will bloom and all at the same 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.320
 time and if you have space put the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.320
 big z flame 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.680
 so you can better appreciate the 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.420
 different sizes and blooms 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.549
 teach the salvia for example 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.040
 officinalis that I have taught you before in 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.440
 small pot already with flower in pot 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.810
 two and a half liters here we have also 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.100
 the different varieties we say the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.770
 citrus and the compact the green in size 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.530
 big and before you have seen it in size 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.979
 small we also have the bands 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.760
 the lavender and already with flower from point to point 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:44.139
 to open that will last 23 months and the 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.169
 small size and a variety of rosemary 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.510
 the rosemary prostrates your also with flower and 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.139
 this is already beginning to notice how it starts 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:55.750
 to fall on the branch instead of going towards 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.060
 up as the rosemary officinalis goes 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.240
 I hope these tips have been 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.729
 especially the mojitos and 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.580
