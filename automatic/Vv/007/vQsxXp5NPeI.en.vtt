front the top of the iPad in first which

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.009 
front the top of the iPad in first which
actually<00:04:10.329> leaves<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.829> charging<00:04:12.579> port<00:04:13.019> open

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
actually leaves the charging port open

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.469 
actually leaves the charging port open
kind<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:14.799> at<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:14.980> end<00:04:15.159> because<00:04:15.879> the

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
kind of here at the end because the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.360 
kind of here at the end because the
where<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.169> sitting<00:04:17.470> by<00:04:17.739> my<00:04:17.859> nightstand

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
where I have it sitting by my nightstand

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.330 
where I have it sitting by my nightstand
I<00:04:18.639> can<00:04:19.120> kind<00:04:19.329> of<00:04:19.419> still<00:04:19.660> zip<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.109> up<00:04:20.289> and<00:04:20.530> and

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
I can kind of still zip this up and and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.689 
I can kind of still zip this up and and
slip<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:22.080> connector<00:04:23.080> cable<00:04:23.830> here<00:04:24.460> without

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
slip the connector cable here without

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.100 
slip the connector cable here without
actually<00:04:25.180> having<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.360> take<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.630> whole<00:04:25.750> device

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
actually having to take the whole device

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.779 
actually having to take the whole device
out<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:26.470> could<00:04:26.650> charge<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.220> device<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.699> the

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
out and could charge the device in the

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:29.820 
out and could charge the device in the
case<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.810> thought<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.289> was<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> pretty<00:04:29.620> cool

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
case so I thought that was a pretty cool

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.490 
case so I thought that was a pretty cool
idea<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.699> anyway<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.750> zipping<00:04:32.139> that<00:04:32.259> all<00:04:32.410> the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
idea so anyway so zipping that all the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.719 
idea so anyway so zipping that all the
way<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:33.419> closing<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:34.660> back<00:04:35.610> zipping<00:04:36.610> their

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
way up closing this back zipping their

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.670 
way up closing this back zipping their
own<00:04:36.820> way<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.120> mean<00:04:37.509> really<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.380> not<00:04:38.530> like

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
own way I mean really it's not like

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.270 
own way I mean really it's not like
there's<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:38.979> whole<00:04:39.099> lot<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:41.590> may<00:04:41.800> again

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
there's a whole lot to it you may again

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.210 
there's a whole lot to it you may again
not<00:04:42.610> really<00:04:42.940> get<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.690> is<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.860> little<00:04:45.099> bit

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
not really get this is it's a little bit

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.860 
not really get this is it's a little bit
more<00:04:45.310> padded<00:04:45.820> when<00:04:45.940> I<00:04:45.970> say<00:04:46.180> Pat<00:04:46.419> it's<00:04:46.690> kind<00:04:46.840> of

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
more padded when I say Pat it's kind of

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.249 
more padded when I say Pat it's kind of
hard<00:04:47.169> padded<00:04:47.680> on<00:04:47.770> this<00:04:47.949> backside<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:49.449> again<00:04:50.050> it

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
hard padded on this backside so again it

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.640 
hard padded on this backside so again it
provides<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.710> good<00:04:50.979> bit<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.310> durability<00:04:52.650> you

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
provides a good bit of durability you

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.710 
provides a good bit of durability you
know<00:04:53.740> if<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:53.949> read<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.370> actual<00:04:54.520> contents<00:04:55.449> of

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
know if you read the actual contents of

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.400 
know if you read the actual contents of
the<00:04:56.130> thought<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.970> tag<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.930> talks<00:04:59.199> about

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
the thought the the tag it talks about

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.980 
the thought the the tag it talks about
you<00:04:59.740> know<00:04:59.830> opening<00:05:00.009> flat<00:05:00.550> speeds<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:01.360> security

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
you know opening flat speeds up security

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.469 
you know opening flat speeds up security
checkpoints<00:05:02.710> at<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.090> airport<00:05:04.090> which<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.449> a

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
checkpoints at the airport which is a

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.529 
checkpoints at the airport which is a
good<00:05:04.750> point<00:05:05.139> to<00:05:05.380> make<00:05:05.889> it<00:05:06.400> is<00:05:06.580> soft<00:05:06.909> and<00:05:07.180> smart

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
good point to make it is soft and smart

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.839 
good point to make it is soft and smart
as<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.900> say<00:05:08.139> neoprene<00:05:08.740> protects<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.400> computer

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
as I say neoprene protects the computer

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.649 
as I say neoprene protects the computer
in<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.599> pack<00:05:10.930> or<00:05:11.680> briefcase<00:05:12.099> so<00:05:12.550> again<00:05:13.240> this<00:05:13.479> was

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
in a pack or briefcase so again this was

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.120 
in a pack or briefcase so again this was
for<00:05:13.870> my<00:05:14.080> ID<00:05:14.259> I<00:05:14.289> wanted<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.620> be<00:05:14.710> able<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.949> put

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
for my ID I wanted to be able to put

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.969 
for my ID I wanted to be able to put
this<00:05:15.280> inside<00:05:15.789> my<00:05:16.570> main<00:05:16.990> computer<00:05:17.409> bag<00:05:17.680> and

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
this inside my main computer bag and

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.939 
this inside my main computer bag and
also<00:05:19.110> indicates<00:05:20.110> which<00:05:20.259> is<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.470> really<00:05:20.680> neat

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
also indicates which is a really neat

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.710 
also indicates which is a really neat
point<00:05:21.250> is<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.580> it's<00:05:21.759> water-resistant<00:05:22.539> outer

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
point is that it's water-resistant outer

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.170 
point is that it's water-resistant outer
fabric<00:05:23.349> is<00:05:23.500> made<00:05:23.530> from<00:05:24.039> a<00:05:24.159> recycled<00:05:24.580> pet

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
fabric is made from a recycled pet

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.899 
fabric is made from a recycled pet
bottles<00:05:25.720> so<00:05:26.199> this<00:05:26.680> outer<00:05:26.979> fabric<00:05:27.610> that<00:05:27.729> they

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
bottles so this outer fabric that they

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.659 
bottles so this outer fabric that they
we<00:05:28.270> have<00:05:28.449> is<00:05:28.630> nylon<00:05:29.020> I<00:05:29.080> guess<00:05:29.289> it's<00:05:30.250> made<00:05:30.460> from

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
we have is nylon I guess it's made from

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.029 
we have is nylon I guess it's made from
recycled<00:05:31.240> fabric<00:05:31.570> so<00:05:31.750> again<00:05:32.080> for<00:05:32.289> all<00:05:32.800> of<00:05:32.949> us

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
recycled fabric so again for all of us

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.010 
recycled fabric so again for all of us
that<00:05:33.099> concerned<00:05:33.639> about<00:05:33.699> the<00:05:33.880> environment

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
that concerned about the environment

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.439 
that concerned about the environment
once<00:05:35.020> again<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.590> nice<00:05:36.220> feature<00:05:36.820> that<00:05:36.940> area<00:05:37.419> has

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
once again a nice feature that area has

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.230 
once again a nice feature that area has
put<00:05:37.900> the<00:05:38.050> place<00:05:38.380> there<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.000> they<00:05:40.000> talk<00:05:40.210> about

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
put the place there and they talk about

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.210 
put the place there and they talk about
the<00:05:40.690> carrying<00:05:41.020> options<00:05:41.139> obviously<00:05:41.710> you<00:05:42.039> can

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
the carrying options obviously you can

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.820 
the carrying options obviously you can
use<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.820> grab<00:05:43.300> handles<00:05:43.780> they<00:05:44.289> indicate<00:05:44.800> that

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
use the grab handles they indicate that

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.510 
use the grab handles they indicate that
there<00:05:45.099> is<00:05:45.280> an<00:05:45.520> external<00:05:46.120> sort<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.810> an<00:05:46.900> optional

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
there is an external sort of an optional

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.670 
there is an external sort of an optional

you may you see or some some rings here

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.760 
you may you see or some some rings here
that<00:05:51.550> can<00:05:51.849> be<00:05:52.000> used<00:05:52.389> to<00:05:52.960> connect<00:05:53.289> some<00:05:53.530> sort<00:05:53.740> of

find that shoulder strap point yet when
i<00:05:59.500> was<00:05:59.740> at<00:05:59.889> rei<00:06:00.190> i<00:06:00.759> did<00:06:01.150> see<00:06:01.740> an<00:06:02.740> all<00:06:02.949> black<00:06:03.250> case

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
i was at rei i did see an all black case

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.510 
i was at rei i did see an all black case
I<00:06:04.060> chose<00:06:04.389> kind<00:06:04.690> of<00:06:04.780> this<00:06:04.990> rust<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.949> gray<00:06:06.190> color
