a<00:04:25.320> little<00:04:25.590> bit<00:04:25.770> but<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.760> mean<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
a little bit but like I mean it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.909 
a little bit but like I mean it
obviously<00:04:27.440> obviously<00:04:28.440> didn't<00:04:28.650> get<00:04:28.770> what<00:04:28.890> I

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
obviously obviously didn't get what I

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:29.149 
obviously obviously didn't get what I
want

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
want

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.070 
want
but<00:04:29.729> still<00:04:29.909> good<00:04:30.089> fed<00:04:30.270> overall<00:04:30.599> well<00:04:30.869> I'll<00:04:30.959> use

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
but still good fed overall well I'll use

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.309 
but still good fed overall well I'll use
it<00:04:31.199> for<00:04:31.319> PvP<00:04:31.739> probably<00:04:32.459> probably<00:04:32.909> not<00:04:33.319> that's

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
it for PvP probably probably not that's

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.889 
it for PvP probably probably not that's
debatable<00:04:34.649> but<00:04:34.949> anything<00:04:35.879> else<00:04:35.909> watching<00:04:36.659> oh
