in<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:01.380> tutorial<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.070> go<00:00:02.220> over

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this tutorial I'm going to go over

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.849 
in this tutorial I'm going to go over
how<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.669> utilize<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.720> transponder<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
how to utilize the transponder in a

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.150 
how to utilize the transponder in a
Garmin<00:00:05.190> g1000<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.720> what<00:00:07.649> we'll<00:00:07.770> notice<00:00:07.890> is

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Garmin g1000 so what we'll notice is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.500 
Garmin g1000 so what we'll notice is
that<00:00:08.340> we've<00:00:08.460> got<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.639> field<00:00:08.880> over<00:00:09.150> here<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
that we've got a field over here on the

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.390 
that we've got a field over here on the
bottom<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.110> soft<00:00:10.500> key<00:00:10.710> menu<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
bottom in the soft key menu for a

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.180 
bottom in the soft key menu for a
transponder<00:00:12.030> which<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.360> X<00:00:12.660> PDR<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.440> then<00:00:14.099> we

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
transponder which is X PDR and then we

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.380 
transponder which is X PDR and then we
see<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.549> same<00:00:15.740> label<00:00:16.740> X<00:00:17.220> PDR<00:00:17.699> over<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
see the same label X PDR over here and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.790 
see the same label X PDR over here and
then<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> frequency<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.619> your

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
then this is the frequency that your

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.330 
then this is the frequency that your
squawking

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
squawking

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.700 
squawking
and<00:00:20.520> here<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.390> says<00:00:21.570> we're<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.810> ground<00:00:22.260> mode

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and here it says we're in ground mode

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519 
and here it says we're in ground mode
and<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.970> because<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.840> aircraft's<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
and that's because the aircraft's on the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.550 
and that's because the aircraft's on the
ground<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.890> not<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.220> area<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.410> we<00:00:28.410> can

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
ground is not in the area and we can

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.099 
ground is not in the area and we can
change<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.160> by<00:00:29.849> hitting<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.449> transponder

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
change this by hitting the transponder

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.889 
change this by hitting the transponder
button<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> soft<00:00:31.980> key<00:00:32.130> menu<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.750> now<00:00:33.750> if

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
button on the soft key menu and now if

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
button on the soft key menu and now if
we<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.290> say<00:00:34.469> change<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.040> stand<00:00:35.790> by<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.600> can

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we want to say change to stand by we can

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.510 
we want to say change to stand by we can
click<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> standby<00:00:37.500> button<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.489> in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
click the standby button and it's now in

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.389 
click the standby button and it's now in
white<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.270> standby<00:00:39.829> then<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.160> switch

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
white and on standby then we can switch

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.619 
white and on standby then we can switch
it<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.510> now<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.899> poun<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.910> if<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.329> need<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it on so now it's poun and if we need to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.760 
it on so now it's poun and if we need to
we<00:00:45.960> can<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.520> put<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> on<00:00:47.760> altitude<00:00:48.360> mode<00:00:48.809> by

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
we can also put it on altitude mode by

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
we can also put it on altitude mode by
hitting<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> altitude<00:00:50.700> button<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.420> we

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
hitting the altitude button and now we

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.470 
hitting the altitude button and now we
can<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> altitude<00:00:52.649> mode<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.250> enabled<00:00:53.520> we

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
can see the altitude mode is enabled we

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.319 
can see the altitude mode is enabled we
can<00:00:54.629> add<00:00:54.750> ident<00:00:55.230> button<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.800> ident<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.789> we'll

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
can add ident button to ident and we'll

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.360 
can add ident button to ident and we'll
see<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:57.809> goes<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.469> briefly<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
see that that goes on briefly and it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.500 
see that that goes on briefly and it
goes<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> altitude<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:02.730> also<00:01:02.879> exited

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
goes back to altitude and it also exited

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
goes back to altitude and it also exited
out<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.019> soft<00:01:04.619> key<00:01:04.830> menu<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.400> transponder

out of the soft key menu for transponder

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.730 
out of the soft key menu for transponder
we're<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> main<00:01:06.750> menu<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.290> let's<00:01:07.470> hit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
we're back to the main menu so let's hit

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.450 
we're back to the main menu so let's hit
transponder<00:01:08.400> again<00:01:09.260> now<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
transponder again now we can put in a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.880 
transponder again now we can put in a
code<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> anything<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.650> want

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
code so we can put in anything we want

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.270 
code so we can put in anything we want
let's<00:01:14.100> say<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.810> 7700<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.890> realize

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
let's say we put in 7700 and we realize

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
let's say we put in 7700 and we realize
this<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.299> that's<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.689> emergency

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
this is not right that's the emergency

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
this is not right that's the emergency
frequency<00:01:19.350> we<00:01:19.830> could<00:01:19.979> hit<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> backspace

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
frequency we could hit the backspace

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
frequency we could hit the backspace
button<00:01:21.000> over<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.900> change<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
button over here and change that to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.539 
button over here and change that to
let's<00:01:23.220> say<00:01:23.400> 70<00:01:23.850> 100<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.890> after<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> few<00:01:26.100> seconds

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
let's say 70 100 and after a few seconds

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
let's say 70 100 and after a few seconds
we'll<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> will<00:01:27.240> timeout<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
we'll see that it will timeout and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
we'll see that it will timeout and
accept<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> change<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.549> soft<00:01:29.820> key<00:01:30.000> menu

goes back to the original main menu and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
goes back to the original main menu and
now<00:01:33.299> let's<00:01:33.540> say<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.590> the
