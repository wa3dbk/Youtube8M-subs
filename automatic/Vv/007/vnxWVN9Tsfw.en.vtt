00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.330 

hello<00:00:09.350> this<00:00:10.220> is<00:00:10.280> over<00:00:10.880> here<00:00:11.180> I<00:00:11.950> just<00:00:12.950> got<00:00:13.130> this

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
hello this is over here I just got this

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.390 
hello this is over here I just got this
finger<00:00:13.730> here<00:00:13.910> from<00:00:14.150> two<00:00:14.600> notes<00:00:15.130> it's<00:00:16.130> a<00:00:16.250> new

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
finger here from two notes it's a new

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.250 
finger here from two notes it's a new
product<00:00:16.790> of<00:00:16.880> theirs<00:00:17.090> called<00:00:17.450> a<00:00:17.540> torpedo<00:00:17.900> live

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
product of theirs called a torpedo live

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.510 
product of theirs called a torpedo live
and<00:00:18.560> it's<00:00:19.430> a<00:00:19.520> professional<00:00:20.000> load<00:00:20.240> box<00:00:21.369> if<00:00:22.369> you

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
and it's a professional load box if you

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.820 
and it's a professional load box if you
don't<00:00:22.730> know<00:00:22.850> what<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.060> load<00:00:23.330> box<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.840> think<00:00:24.710> of

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
don't know what a load box is think of

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.760 
don't know what a load box is think of
it<00:00:24.920> as<00:00:25.100> a<00:00:25.130> substitute<00:00:25.610> for<00:00:25.880> your<00:00:26.240> cabinet<00:00:26.780> for

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
it as a substitute for your cabinet for

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.590 
it as a substitute for your cabinet for
say<00:00:27.980> if<00:00:28.039> you're<00:00:28.250> having<00:00:28.460> a<00:00:28.640> cube<00:00:28.940> amp<00:00:29.150> you

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
say if you're having a cube amp you

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.330 
say if you're having a cube amp you
always<00:00:29.900> need<00:00:30.080> to<00:00:30.110> have<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.350> cab<00:00:30.650> connected<00:00:31.220> to

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
always need to have a cab connected to

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.340 
always need to have a cab connected to
it<00:00:31.460> to<00:00:31.610> avoid<00:00:31.940> damaging<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.720> power<00:00:32.930> section

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
it to avoid damaging the power section

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100 
it to avoid damaging the power section
of<00:00:33.470> the<00:00:33.590> amp<00:00:33.850> so<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.000> product<00:00:35.420> works<00:00:35.809> as<00:00:36.080> a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
of the amp so this product works as a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.140 
of the amp so this product works as a
load<00:00:36.410> for<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.739> power<00:00:36.920> section<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.580> amp<00:00:37.699> so

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
load for the power section of the amp so

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.610 
load for the power section of the amp so
you<00:00:38.239> don't<00:00:38.390> have<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.720> connect<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.290> a<00:00:39.320> cab

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
you don't have to connect it to a cab

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.070 
you don't have to connect it to a cab
hence<00:00:40.610> it's<00:00:40.879> perfect<00:00:41.330> for<00:00:41.390> silent<00:00:41.930> recording

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
hence it's perfect for silent recording

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.490 
hence it's perfect for silent recording
at<00:00:42.470> home<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:43.820> also<00:00:43.970> has<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.239> lot<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.570> impulses<00:00:45.230> in

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
at home it also has a lot of impulses in

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.020 
at home it also has a lot of impulses in
it<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.400> just<00:00:46.550> connect<00:00:46.879> it<00:00:46.970> to

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
it so you can just connect it to

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.869 
it so you can just connect it to
whatever<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:47.629> it<00:00:47.720> sounds<00:00:48.050> good

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
whatever and it sounds good

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.130 
whatever and it sounds good
but<00:00:49.879> if<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:50.089> still<00:00:50.330> want<00:00:50.510> to<00:00:50.540> hook<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:50.839> up<00:00:50.930> to<00:00:50.989> a

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
but if you still want to hook it up to a

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.750 
but if you still want to hook it up to a
cab<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.500> can<00:00:51.680> do<00:00:51.769> so<00:00:51.979> by<00:00:52.190> using<00:00:52.220> the<00:00:52.460> through

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
cab you can do so by using the through

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.469 
cab you can do so by using the through
output<00:00:53.150> at<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.390> back<00:00:53.570> here<00:00:55.059> so<00:00:56.059> right<00:00:56.239> now<00:00:56.449> I

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
output at the back here so right now I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.200 
output at the back here so right now I
have<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.019> DV<00:00:57.440> mark<00:00:57.680> triple<00:00:58.070> six<00:00:58.309> hooked<00:00:58.820> up<00:00:59.030> to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
have the DV mark triple six hooked up to

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.630 
have the DV mark triple six hooked up to
it<00:00:59.360> and<00:01:00.320> as<00:01:00.470> you<00:01:00.500> can<00:01:00.710> see<00:01:00.769> it's<00:01:01.040> not<00:01:01.250> hooked<00:01:01.400> up

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
it and as you can see it's not hooked up

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.369 
it and as you can see it's not hooked up
to<00:01:01.699> you<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.059> cab<00:01:02.299> just<00:01:02.600> straight<00:01:03.019> into<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
to you in the cab just straight into the

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.070 
to you in the cab just straight into the
torpedo<00:01:03.589> live<00:01:04.120> and<00:01:05.120> then<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.330> use<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.659> line<00:01:05.870> out

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
torpedo live and then I use the line out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.960 
torpedo live and then I use the line out
of<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.350> units<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:06.920> into<00:01:07.790> my<00:01:07.940> audience<00:01:08.360> face

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
of the units and into my audience face

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.670 
of the units and into my audience face
so<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.090> set<00:01:11.420> up<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.690> amp<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:12.049> if<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.380> had<00:01:12.560> it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
so you set up the amp as if I had it

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.109 
so you set up the amp as if I had it
connected<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.189> camp<00:01:13.460> pretty<00:01:13.789> straight

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
connected to a camp pretty straight

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
all the other classic microphones st

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:14.590 
all the other classic microphones st
sm57<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:07.429> md<00:02:07.789> 421<00:02:09.069> norman<00:02:10.120> u87<00:02:11.120> etc<00:02:11.690> oh<00:02:13.600> and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
sm57 the md 421 norman u87 etc oh and

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.450 
sm57 the md 421 norman u87 etc oh and
this<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.930> simulated<00:02:15.500> miking<00:02:15.860> position<00:02:16.310> so

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
this is the simulated miking position so

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.820 
this is the simulated miking position so
you<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.580> choose<00:02:16.880> it<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.180> be<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:17.450> 0%<00:02:18.080> which<00:02:18.650> is

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
you can choose it to be at 0% which is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.290 
you can choose it to be at 0% which is
what<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.310> would<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:19.970> had<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
what you would get if you had the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.130 
what you would get if you had the
microphone<00:02:20.660> dead<00:02:20.870> center<00:02:21.290> until<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.650> speed

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
microphone dead center until the speed

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.480 
microphone dead center until the speed
so<00:02:23.140> I've<00:02:23.260> chosen<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.340> bit

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
so I've chosen to have it just a bit

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.860 
so I've chosen to have it just a bit
outside<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.240> say<00:02:25.480> 3%<00:02:27.000> mic<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.330> front<00:02:28.600> makes

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
outside so say 3% mic at the front makes

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.430 
outside so say 3% mic at the front makes
sense<00:02:30.150> there's<00:02:31.150> an<00:02:31.330> EQ<00:02:31.570> section<00:02:31.780> as<00:02:32.050> well<00:02:32.200> with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
sense there's an EQ section as well with

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.680 
sense there's an EQ section as well with
a<00:02:32.470> couple<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.860> fixed<00:02:33.160> frequencies<00:02:33.760> cool<00:02:34.570> to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
a couple of fixed frequencies cool to

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.750 
a couple of fixed frequencies cool to
tweak<00:02:34.900> around<00:02:35.020> with<00:02:35.320> I<00:02:35.350> guess<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
tweak around with I guess I have it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:46.950 
tweak around with I guess I have it
switched<00:02:37.000> off<00:02:37.180> here<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.830> recorded<00:02:39.640> bastard
