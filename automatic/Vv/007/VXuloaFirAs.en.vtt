received on the cabling before we

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
received on the cabling before we
connected<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> final<00:01:02.070> bits<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.370> equipment<00:01:02.460> up

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
connected the final bits of equipment up

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.719 
connected the final bits of equipment up
we<00:01:03.359> use<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> time<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> really

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we use it all the time and it is really

in<00:01:17.820> monitor<00:01:18.630> calibration<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.100> even

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
in monitor calibration is that even

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.480 
in monitor calibration is that even
displays<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.930> should<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.740> calibrated

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
displays like this should be calibrated

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.520 
displays like this should be calibrated
if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.330> relying<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> quality<00:01:25.500> of

if you are relying like the quality of
these<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.220> now<00:01:26.340> you're<00:01:26.520> probably

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
these is so good now you're probably

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
these is so good now you're probably
relying<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:28.020> doing<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.740> the

relying on it for doing a lot of the
setup<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.850> camera<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.829> you<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
setup with your camera and you need to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
setup with your camera and you need to
make<00:01:32.250> sure<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> accurate<00:01:33.810> as

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
make sure that it is as accurate as

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.179 
make sure that it is as accurate as

possible so a Tomas working with data

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.480 
possible so a Tomas working with data
color<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:39.150> released<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.960> new<00:01:40.439> product<00:01:40.890> which

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
color have released a new product which

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.080 
color have released a new product which
is<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:42.240> Atomos<00:01:42.990> spider<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> look<00:01:44.970> at

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is the Atomos spider or have a look at

is the Atomos spider or have a look at
it<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.689> think

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
we've downloaded installed and are now

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.410 
we've downloaded installed and are now
running<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.380> Atomos<00:03:15.040> calibrator<00:03:15.640> software

running the Atomos calibrator software

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.770 
running the Atomos calibrator software
we<00:03:17.320> now<00:03:17.500> need<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:18.280> connect<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:19.000> land<00:03:19.480> sea

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
we now need to connect the land sea

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.410 
we now need to connect the land sea
cable<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.680> remember<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.010> was<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.459> USB<00:03:22.150> on

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
cable if you remember this was a USB on

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.860 
cable if you remember this was a USB on
one<00:03:22.840> end<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.230> had<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.190> small<00:03:24.550> at<00:03:25.060> jack<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
one end and had a small at jack on the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.130 
one end and had a small at jack on the
other<00:03:26.020> end<00:03:26.320> which<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:27.190> plugs<00:03:27.489> into<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.150> land

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
other end which just plugs into the land

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.620 
other end which just plugs into the land
sea<00:03:29.640> port<00:03:31.230> so<00:03:32.230> we<00:03:32.350> plug<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.830> in<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.190> then

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
sea port so we plug that in and then

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.810 
sea port so we plug that in and then
there's<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.959> actual<00:03:35.440> spider<00:03:35.800> itself<00:03:36.520> now<00:03:36.760> the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
there's the actual spider itself now the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.650 
there's the actual spider itself now the
spider<00:03:37.300> has<00:03:37.989> will<00:03:38.230> they<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.680> foam<00:03:39.300> ring<00:03:40.300> on<00:03:40.510> it

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
spider has will they a foam ring on it

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.300 
spider has will they a foam ring on it
and<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.900> needs<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.410> sit<00:03:41.650> as<00:03:41.830> firmly<00:03:42.130> as

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and that needs to sit as firmly as

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.020 
and that needs to sit as firmly as
possible<00:03:43.060> on<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.410> blade<00:03:44.830> screen<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.519> we

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
possible on to the blade screen and we

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.080 
possible on to the blade screen and we
found<00:03:46.330> that<00:03:46.570> putting<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.370> about<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
found that putting it about that

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.060 
found that putting it about that
position<00:03:49.660> seemed<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.560> seem<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.400> work<00:03:51.580> well<00:03:51.610> and

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
position seemed to seem to work well and

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.170 
position seemed to seem to work well and
just<00:03:54.070> just<00:03:54.640> rests<00:03:55.060> nicely<00:03:55.570> on<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.440> screen<00:03:57.190> so

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
just just rests nicely on the screen so

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.990 
just just rests nicely on the screen so

is<00:04:19.570> very<00:04:19.810> simple<00:04:19.840> is<00:04:20.380> just<00:04:20.919> to<00:04:21.160> press<00:04:21.609> the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
is very simple is just to press the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.960 
is very simple is just to press the
calibrate<00:04:22.870> button<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:24.010> what<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.400> does<00:04:24.640> then

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
calibrate button and what that does then

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120 
calibrate button and what that does then
is<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.600> start<00:04:26.050> sending<00:04:26.350> some

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
is to start sending some

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.210 
is to start sending some
signals<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.540> blade<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.410> see<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.950> screen

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
signals to the blade and see the screen

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.930 
signals to the blade and see the screen
has<00:04:30.400> blanked<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.060> then<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:32.530> sends<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.400> series

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
has blanked and then it sends a series

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.830 
has blanked and then it sends a series
of<00:04:34.020> colors<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:37.000> calibration

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
of colors and that is the calibration

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.220 
of colors and that is the calibration
process<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:39.520> what<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.790> calibrating<00:04:40.480> we'll

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
process so what is calibrating we'll

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.780 
process so what is calibrating we'll
just<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.740> quick<00:04:42.010> break<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.460> we'll<00:04:42.550> come

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
just have a quick break and we'll come

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.150 
just have a quick break and we'll come
back<00:04:42.970> when<00:04:43.300> it's<00:04:43.330> finished<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.920> it's<00:04:45.040> now

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
back when it's finished so it's now

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.800 
back when it's finished so it's now
saying<00:04:45.490> that<00:04:45.760> it's<00:04:45.970> verifying<00:04:46.570> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
saying that it's verifying the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.920 
saying that it's verifying the
calibrated<00:04:47.440> settings<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.760> then<00:04:49.000> just<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.630> a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
calibrated settings and then just in a

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.900 
calibrated settings and then just in a
few<00:04:50.290> seconds<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.980> will<00:04:51.940> finish<00:04:52.390> the<00:04:52.630> process

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
few seconds it will finish the process

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.040 
few seconds it will finish the process
and<00:04:55.980> there<00:04:56.980> we<00:04:57.070> go<00:04:57.100> it<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.490> drawn<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.300> graph<00:04:58.570> on

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and there we go it is drawn a graph on

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.830 
and there we go it is drawn a graph on
the<00:04:59.530> display<00:04:59.830> and<00:05:00.220> if<00:05:00.760> you<00:05:00.880> actually<00:05:01.060> click<00:05:01.570> on
