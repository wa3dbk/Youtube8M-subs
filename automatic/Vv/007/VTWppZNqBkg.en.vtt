today I'm going to be showing you how to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.669 
today I'm going to be showing you how to
rebuild<00:00:08.790> attracts<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.540> ultra<00:00:09.929> shock<00:00:10.200> using

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
rebuild attracts this ultra shock using

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.610 
rebuild attracts this ultra shock using
the<00:00:10.769> Traxxas<00:00:11.309> shock<00:00:11.610> rebuild<00:00:12.120> kit<00:00:12.480> as<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:13.469> can

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the Traxxas shock rebuild kit as you can

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.150 
the Traxxas shock rebuild kit as you can
tell<00:00:13.889> my<00:00:14.219> rear<00:00:14.730> lift<00:00:15.120> shock<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.170> leaking<00:00:16.619> oil<00:00:16.770> I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
tell my rear lift shock is leaking oil I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.939 
tell my rear lift shock is leaking oil I
can<00:00:17.760> tell<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.480> has<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> really<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
can tell because it has a really just a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.660 
can tell because it has a really just a
grimy<00:00:20.460> look<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> almost<00:00:21.689> like<00:00:22.020> oil<00:00:22.550> now<00:00:23.550> if

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
grimy look to it almost like oil now if

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.730 
grimy look to it almost like oil now if
you<00:00:23.789> look<00:00:23.939> at<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.150> other<00:00:24.359> shocks<00:00:24.779> they're<00:00:25.380> dry

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
you look at my other shocks they're dry

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
you look at my other shocks they're dry
they're<00:00:26.039> dirty<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:27.060> they're<00:00:27.240> dry<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:28.170> I'm

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
they're dirty but they're dry so I'm

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.779 
they're dirty but they're dry so I'm
gonna<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.529> ahead<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.769> remove<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.279> shock<00:00:29.550> by

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
gonna go ahead and remove this shock by

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.330 
gonna go ahead and remove this shock by
undoing<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.420> top<00:00:30.689> screw<00:00:31.080> as<00:00:31.349> well<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
undoing the top screw as well as the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.049 
undoing the top screw as well as the
lower<00:00:32.550> one

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
lower one

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.910 
lower one
now<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> shock<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.649> really

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
now that the shock is off you can really

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
now that the shock is off you can really
see<00:00:35.160> there's<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:36.540> leaking<00:00:37.050> oil<00:00:37.230> pretty

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
see there's just it's leaking oil pretty

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
see there's just it's leaking oil pretty
badly<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.370> I'm<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.450> start<00:00:39.780> off<00:00:39.960> by<00:00:40.260> removing

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
badly so I'm gonna start off by removing

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520 
badly so I'm gonna start off by removing
the<00:00:40.800> spring<00:00:41.250> lift<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.329> at<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> base<00:00:42.780> pull

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
the spring lift it up at the base pull

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.810 
the spring lift it up at the base pull
the<00:00:43.710> brace<00:00:43.890> off<00:00:44.160> slide<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> side<00:00:46.820> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the brace off slide it to the side the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.130 
the brace off slide it to the side the
spring<00:00:48.149> should<00:00:48.660> follow<00:00:50.510> now<00:00:51.510> at<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> time

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
spring should follow now at this time

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
spring should follow now at this time
I'd<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.250> good<00:00:53.430> idea<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.090> ahead

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
I'd be a really good idea just go ahead

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.310 
I'd be a really good idea just go ahead
and<00:00:54.329> wipe<00:00:54.449> off<00:00:54.600> all<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> extra<00:00:55.289> oil<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:58.199> get

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and wipe off all the extra oil to get

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
and wipe off all the extra oil to get
the<00:00:58.500> shock<00:00:58.710> cap<00:00:58.980> off<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.579> always<00:00:59.879> use<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> small

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the shock cap off I always use a small

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.650 
the shock cap off I always use a small
screwdriver<00:01:01.199> stick<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> through<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.820> then

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
screwdriver stick it through and then

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.370 
screwdriver stick it through and then
rotate<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> works<00:01:04.920> every<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:06.049> works<00:01:07.049> really

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
rotate it works every time works really

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.149 
rotate it works every time works really
well<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:07.920> you're<00:01:07.950> tightening<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
well when you're tightening it to

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.260 
well when you're tightening it to
unscrew<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> shock<00:01:11.520> cap<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:14.270> and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
unscrew the shock cap all the way and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
unscrew the shock cap all the way and
yeah<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.409> oil<00:01:16.619> level<00:01:16.890> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
yeah you can see that the oil level is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.469 
yeah you can see that the oil level is
really<00:01:17.970> low<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:19.670> right<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> bat<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
really low so right off the bat I can

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.749 
really low so right off the bat I can
tell<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.229> reason<00:01:22.350> why<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> leaking<00:01:23.040> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
tell you the reason why it's leaking is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270 
tell you the reason why it's leaking is
the<00:01:24.750> bladder<00:01:24.990> isn't<00:01:25.500> sitting<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.100> right

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the bladder isn't sitting in there right

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
the bladder isn't sitting in there right
you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.720> almost<00:01:27.960> teamed<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you can see it's almost teamed at a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.440 
you can see it's almost teamed at a
certain<00:01:29.280> angle<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.560> why<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.890> leaking

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
certain angle that is why it's leaking

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.210 
certain angle that is why it's leaking
so<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> put<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> aluminum<00:01:34.770> shocks<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so when I put in the aluminum shocks I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
so when I put in the aluminum shocks I
guess<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.970> didn't<00:01:36.450> install<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> bladder<00:01:37.170> right

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
guess I didn't install the bladder right

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.350 
guess I didn't install the bladder right
no<00:01:38.100> problem<00:01:38.310> I'll<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.790> fix<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.270> I'll

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
no problem I'll go and fix it and I'll

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.630 
no problem I'll go and fix it and I'll
still<00:01:39.630> show<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> replace<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.340> seals

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
still show you how to replace the seals

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
still show you how to replace the seals
in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> lower<00:01:42.150> part<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> shock<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.799> for

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
in the lower part of the shock so for

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
in the lower part of the shock so for
now<00:01:44.280> I'm<00:01:44.610> gonna<00:01:44.759> go<00:01:44.970> ahead<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> empty<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.750> all

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
now I'm gonna go ahead and empty out all

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
now I'm gonna go ahead and empty out all
this<00:01:46.110> oil<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> drained<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.490> oil

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
this oil now that I drained all the oil

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.850 
this oil now that I drained all the oil
from<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> shock<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.659> need<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
from the shock I need to take off the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.429 
from the shock I need to take off the
rod<00:01:50.070> end<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> use<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> pair<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> pliers<00:01:51.750> with

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
rod end so I use a pair of pliers with

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.499 
rod end so I use a pair of pliers with
some<00:01:52.649> foam<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.390> not

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
some foam on there you really do not

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
some foam on there you really do not
want<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> scratch<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> piston<00:01:55.979> for<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
want to scratch up the piston for the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
want to scratch up the piston for the
shock<00:01:56.670> otherwise<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.479> cause<00:01:57.780> leaks<00:01:58.110> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
shock otherwise it will cause leaks in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.459 
shock otherwise it will cause leaks in

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
and pull this out gently now we can work

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.119 
and pull this out gently now we can work
on<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> bottom<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.019> shock<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.680> bottom<00:02:24.010> of

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129

to<00:04:14.650> change<00:04:14.889> your<00:04:15.010> piston<00:04:15.400> head<00:04:15.639> you<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.510> have

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
to change your piston head you just have

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.420 
to change your piston head you just have
to<00:04:16.719> take<00:04:16.900> off<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.139> little<00:04:17.349> Eclipse<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:18.250> then

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
to take off that little Eclipse and then

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.280 
to take off that little Eclipse and then
switch<00:04:18.969> out<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.299> piston

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
switch out the piston

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.260 
switch out the piston
now<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.620> pretty<00:04:20.920> much<00:04:21.100> controls<00:04:21.610> how<00:04:22.120> much

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
now this pretty much controls how much

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.260 
now this pretty much controls how much
fluid<00:04:22.600> goes<00:04:23.380> through<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.040> shock<00:04:24.310> when<00:04:24.820> it

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
fluid goes through the shock when it

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.500 
fluid goes through the shock when it
collapses<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:27.250> that's<00:04:27.490> all<00:04:27.670> for<00:04:27.850> performance

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
collapses but that's all for performance

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.140 
collapses but that's all for performance
so<00:04:28.990> what<00:04:29.290> you're<00:04:29.440> gonna<00:04:29.500> want<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.830> do<00:04:29.980> is<00:04:30.730> make

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
so what you're gonna want to do is make

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.420 
so what you're gonna want to do is make
sure<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.480> find<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.020> hole<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:33.100> you're<00:04:33.220> not

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
sure you find the hole and you're not

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.460 
sure you find the hole and you're not
gonna<00:04:33.610> want<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.910> jab<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.480> through<00:04:34.750> because<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
gonna want to jab it through because the

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.940 
gonna want to jab it through because the
thread<00:04:35.800> at<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.040> end<00:04:36.480> of<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.780> rod<00:04:38.020> will<00:04:38.530> tear

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
thread at the end of the rod will tear

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.970 
thread at the end of the rod will tear
up<00:04:39.660> those<00:04:40.660> seals<00:04:41.050> at<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.380> bottom<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.860> you're

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
up those seals at the bottom so you're

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.570 
up those seals at the bottom so you're
gonna<00:04:42.100> want<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.460> go<00:04:42.550> ahead<00:04:42.670> and<00:04:43.210> do<00:04:43.870> this

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
gonna want to go ahead and do this

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.170 
gonna want to go ahead and do this
rather<00:04:45.580> slowly<00:04:47.220> sometimes<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.670> can<00:04:48.820> push<00:04:49.030> it

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
rather slowly sometimes you can push it

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.290 
rather slowly sometimes you can push it
through<00:04:49.500> fairly<00:04:50.500> easily<00:04:50.860> other<00:04:51.250> times<00:04:51.640> you

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
through fairly easily other times you

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.660 
through fairly easily other times you
just<00:04:52.510> gotta<00:04:52.690> rotate<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.190> make<00:04:54.370> sure<00:04:54.400> it

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
just gotta rotate it and make sure it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.170 
just gotta rotate it and make sure it
makes<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.030> all<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.180> way<00:04:55.390> through<00:04:56.790> but<00:04:57.790> like<00:04:58.000> I

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
makes it all the way through but like I

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.750 
makes it all the way through but like I
said<00:04:58.240> do<00:04:58.690> not<00:04:58.960> jam<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.530> through<00:04:59.580> once<00:05:00.580> the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
said do not jam it through once the

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.710 
said do not jam it through once the
thread<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.240> passed<00:05:01.510> then<00:05:01.930> you<00:05:02.080> can<00:05:02.230> pull<00:05:02.440> it

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
thread is passed then you can pull it

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.880 
install it into the top of the shot cap
push<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.220> down<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.940> make<00:05:34.510> sure<00:05:34.540> that<00:05:35.470> it<00:05:35.650> lies

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
push it down and make sure that it lies

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.850 
push it down and make sure that it lies
flat<00:05:36.310> on<00:05:36.880> each<00:05:37.150> side<00:05:37.480> that's<00:05:38.320> what<00:05:38.530> I<00:05:38.560> didn't

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
flat on each side that's what I didn't

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.060 
flat on each side that's what I didn't
do<00:05:38.950> last<00:05:39.190> time<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.960> never<00:05:41.170> want<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.530> rest<00:05:41.770> on

top of the shock and then screw it on

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.080 
top of the shock and then screw it on
because<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.710> chances<00:05:45.100> of<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.370> not<00:05:45.610> going<00:05:45.940> in

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
because the chances of it not going in

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.990 
because the chances of it not going in
right<00:05:46.270> are<00:05:46.540> pretty<00:05:46.720> high<00:05:47.670> now<00:05:48.670> that<00:05:48.880> that's

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
right are pretty high now that that's

right are pretty high now that that's
installed<00:05:49.570> let's<00:05:50.530> get<00:05:50.650> your<00:05:50.800> shock<00:05:51.070> we're

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
installed let's get your shock we're

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.710 
installed let's get your shock we're
gonna<00:05:52.210> need<00:05:52.450> some<00:05:52.750> silicone<00:05:53.470> oil

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
gonna need some silicone oil

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720 
gonna need some silicone oil

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
how much do you fill it up all the way

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.250 
how much do you fill it up all the way
to<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.970> top<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:58.590> fill<00:05:59.590> it<00:05:59.740> up<00:05:59.860> about<00:06:00.100> halfway

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
to the top so fill it up about halfway

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
all the way up to the top quite

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.020 
all the way up to the top quite
literally<00:06:16.030> to<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:17.020> top<00:06:17.430> don't<00:06:18.430> worry<00:06:18.700> if<00:06:18.880> it

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
literally to the top don't worry if it

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.500 
literally to the top don't worry if it
overflows<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:20.280> less<00:06:21.280> air<00:06:21.820> in<00:06:22.180> there<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.480> a
