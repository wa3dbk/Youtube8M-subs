whole structure i know that you've built

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.680 
whole structure i know that you've built
it<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:54.680> have<00:00:54.830> contour<00:00:55.670> lines<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.180> match<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
it to have contour lines that match the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.000 
it to have contour lines that match the
tree<00:00:56.870> aesthetically<00:00:57.379> but<00:00:57.530> you've<00:00:57.650> also<00:00:57.830> been

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
tree aesthetically but you've also been

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.549 
tree aesthetically but you've also been
kind<00:00:58.430> of<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.610> tree<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.059> other<00:00:59.510> ways<00:00:59.690> well<00:01:00.170> as

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
kind of the tree in other ways well as

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.920 
kind of the tree in other ways well as
well<00:01:00.949> as<00:01:01.070> being<00:01:01.190> sculptural<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.629> tree

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
well as being sculptural to the tree

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.010 
well as being sculptural to the tree
then<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.220> tree<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:04.580> not<00:01:04.760> violated<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.600> any<00:01:05.720> way

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
then the tree is not violated in any way

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.080 
then the tree is not violated in any way
with<00:01:06.350> fasteners<00:01:06.920> or<00:01:07.130> not<00:01:07.280> there's<00:01:07.580> not<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.760> nail

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.099 
while it would wobble a little bit what
we<00:01:43.579> did<00:01:43.789> is<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:44.149> take<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.299> bunch<00:01:44.539> of<00:01:44.659> bowls<00:01:44.869> out

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
we did is just take a bunch of bowls out

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.020 
we did is just take a bunch of bowls out
of<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.289> kitchen<00:01:45.469> draw<00:01:46.159> some<00:01:46.460> circles<00:01:46.820> on<00:01:46.999> it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
of the kitchen draw some circles on it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.080 
of the kitchen draw some circles on it
cut<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.509> out<00:01:47.630> with<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.840> jigsaw<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.649> became<00:01:49.090> a

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
cut it out with a jigsaw and it became a

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.389 
cut it out with a jigsaw and it became a
climbing<00:01:50.749> board<00:01:51.140> instead<00:01:51.649> of<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.130> break

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
climbing board instead of just a break

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.069 
climbing board instead of just a break
so<00:01:52.789> this<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.210> way<00:01:53.240> two<00:01:53.420> kids<00:01:53.659> can<00:01:53.840> get<00:01:53.960> up

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
so this is one way two kids can get up

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.679 
so this is one way two kids can get up
to<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:54.590> deck<00:01:55.219> level<00:01:55.640> another<00:01:56.179> way<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.450> kids

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
to the deck level another way the kids

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.809 
to the deck level another way the kids
are<00:01:56.899> they<00:01:57.049> hear<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.560> your<00:01:58.159> options<00:01:58.609> here

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
are they hear that your options here

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.300 
are they hear that your options here
they<00:01:58.939> can<00:01:59.119> jump<00:01:59.569> up<00:01:59.749> on<00:01:59.929> a<00:01:59.960> trapeze<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:01.009> climb

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
they can jump up on a trapeze and climb

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.389 
they can jump up on a trapeze and climb
up<00:02:01.340> because<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.749> railing<00:02:03.200> above<00:02:03.499> is<00:02:03.859> spaced

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
up because the railing above is spaced

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.550 
up because the railing above is spaced
like<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> ladder<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:05.869> they'll<00:02:06.049> climb<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.469> the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
like a ladder so they'll climb on the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.700 
like a ladder so they'll climb on the
outside<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.789> go<00:02:08.030> up<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.899> holes<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.500> this

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
outside you go up the holes of this

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.190 
outside you go up the holes of this
climbing<00:02:10.160> board

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
climbing board

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.369 
climbing board
you<00:02:11.590> go<00:02:11.739> up<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> rock<00:02:12.220> climbing<00:02:12.459> wall<00:02:13.379> two

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
you go up the rock climbing wall two

you go up the rock climbing wall two
different<00:02:14.739> climbing<00:02:15.220> ropes<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.870> go<00:02:16.989> up<00:02:17.110> this

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
different climbing ropes you go up this

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.220 
different climbing ropes you go up this
ladder<00:02:17.769> this<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.879> platform<00:02:19.510> halfway<00:02:19.989> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
ladder this has a platform halfway it's
