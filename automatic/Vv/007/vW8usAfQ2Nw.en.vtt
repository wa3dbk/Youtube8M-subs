and such but that's the custom spell
where<00:05:00.810> spell<00:05:01.810> setting<00:05:02.199> where<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.620> start

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
where spell setting where you can start

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.339 
where spell setting where you can start
with<00:05:03.220> all<00:05:03.340> spells<00:05:03.669> but<00:05:03.940> it's<00:05:04.090> only<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:04.449> to<00:05:04.479> TBC

with all spells but it's only up to TBC

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.760 
with all spells but it's only up to TBC
so<00:05:06.310> if<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:07.449> are<00:05:07.690> death<00:05:08.050> knight<00:05:08.320> you<00:05:08.500> don't

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
any language or anything at all so that

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.120 
any language or anything at all so that
will<00:05:13.510> be<00:05:13.690> really<00:05:14.110> annoying

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
will be really annoying

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.450
