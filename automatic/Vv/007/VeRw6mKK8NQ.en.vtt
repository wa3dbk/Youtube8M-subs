I<00:00:56.850> didn't<00:00:57.000> hit<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> house<00:00:57.360> missed<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> house

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I didn't hit the house missed the house

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319

and<00:00:58.800> hit<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.219> tree<00:00:59.430> thankfully<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.120> tree

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and hit the tree thankfully that tree

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.580

actually<00:01:00.449> came<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> ground<00:01:01.199> cuz<00:01:01.500> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
actually came out of the ground cuz I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
actually came out of the ground cuz I
think<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.070> could<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.280> had<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.760> bad

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
think we could have had a really bad

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:17.690 
think we could have had a really bad
accident<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.870> wouldn't<00:01:04.080> know

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.709 

get<00:01:18.700> on<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> ground<00:01:18.909> get<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.630> ground

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.080 

when<00:01:27.320> your<00:01:27.439> juvenile<00:01:27.920> basically<00:01:28.640> you<00:01:28.789> go<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:28.999> a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
when your juvenile basically you go to a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.760 
when your juvenile basically you go to a
youth<00:01:29.329> center<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.840> don't<00:01:30.020> go<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.380> adult

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
youth center you don't go to the adult

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.709 
youth center you don't go to the adult
jail<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.520> sometimes<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:31.999> get<00:01:32.119> juveniles<00:01:32.569> that

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
jail so sometimes you get juveniles that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.440 
jail so sometimes you get juveniles that
they<00:01:32.929> keep<00:01:33.079> doing<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.409> same<00:01:33.439> crime<00:01:34.009> and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
they keep doing the same crime and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.459 
they keep doing the same crime and
sometimes<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.600> just<00:01:35.630> never<00:01:35.869> get<00:01:36.079> punished<00:01:36.409> for

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
sometimes I just never get punished for

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.109 
sometimes I just never get punished for
it<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:36.950> don't<00:01:37.399> think<00:01:37.520> they<00:01:37.670> are<00:01:37.819> where<00:01:38.000> the

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
it I don't think they are where the

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.969 
it I don't think they are where the
dangers<00:01:38.450> were<00:01:38.569> or<00:01:38.750> they<00:01:39.380> just<00:01:39.409> don't<00:01:39.679> care

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
dangers were or they just don't care

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.649 
dangers were or they just don't care
because<00:01:40.670> they're<00:01:41.000> they're<00:01:41.299> young<00:01:41.509> and

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
because they're they're young and

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.029 
because they're they're young and
they're<00:01:41.749> invincible<00:01:42.020> and<00:01:42.319> nothing<00:01:42.499> can

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
they're invincible and nothing can

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.039 
they're invincible and nothing can
happen<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.340> them<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.969> level<00:01:44.299> of<00:01:44.390> reckless<00:01:44.840> is

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
happen to them the level of reckless is

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.199 
happen to them the level of reckless is
way<00:01:45.439> higher<00:01:45.709> I<00:01:46.009> mean<00:01:46.609> you're<00:01:46.789> talking<00:01:46.909> about

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
way higher I mean you're talking about

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.520 
way higher I mean you're talking about
going<00:01:47.420> through<00:01:47.569> neighborhoods<00:01:47.899> at<00:01:48.170> 90<00:01:48.380> miles

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
going through neighborhoods at 90 miles

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.130 
going through neighborhoods at 90 miles
an<00:01:48.649> hour<00:01:48.770> or<00:01:49.099> running<00:01:49.939> red<00:01:50.119> lights<00:01:50.149> at<00:01:50.569> busy

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
an hour or running red lights at busy

an hour or running red lights at busy
intersections<00:01:51.740> with<00:01:52.219> without<00:01:52.609> even<00:01:52.670> slowing

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
intersections with without even slowing

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.609 
intersections with without even slowing
down<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.599> mean<00:01:53.840> you're<00:01:53.959> basically<00:01:54.289> taking<00:01:54.439> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
down I mean you're basically taking a

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.899 
down I mean you're basically taking a
50-50<00:01:55.130> chance<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.520> whether<00:01:55.670> you're<00:01:55.819> gonna

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
50-50 chance of whether you're gonna

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.099 
50-50 chance of whether you're gonna
make<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.240> through<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.450> intersection<00:01:56.780> or<00:01:56.959> not

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
make it through the intersection or not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.039 
make it through the intersection or not
and<00:01:57.590> you'll<00:01:57.799> see<00:01:58.009> that<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.459> lot<00:01:58.939> more<00:01:59.149> with<00:01:59.479> with

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
and you'll see that a lot more with with

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.289

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
how come you took off no answer all

how come you took off no answer all
right

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
right

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.870 
right
it's<00:02:28.010> important<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.430> get<00:02:28.550> all<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.760> them

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's important to get all of them

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.380 
it's important to get all of them
because<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.780> likelihood<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.940> of<00:02:31.940> other<00:02:32.180> ones

very slim the likelihood of them doing

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.600 
very slim the likelihood of them doing
it<00:02:36.560> again<00:02:36.830> because<00:02:37.160> they<00:02:37.250> haven't<00:02:37.430> been

caught is really high a lot of the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.240 
caught is really high a lot of the
people<00:02:39.260> that<00:02:39.440> will<00:02:39.560> catch<00:02:39.770> after<00:02:40.040> vehicle
