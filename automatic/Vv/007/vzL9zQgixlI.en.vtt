doesn't do too much work towards the end
of<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.520> gameplay<00:05:47.290> but<00:05:48.290> what<00:05:48.740> do<00:05:48.830> you<00:05:48.890> guys

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.070 
of the gameplay but what do you guys
think<00:05:49.040> about<00:05:49.370> using<00:05:49.670> assault<00:05:50.570> kill<00:05:50.750> streaks

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
think about using assault kill streaks

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.110 
think about using assault kill streaks
and<00:05:51.350> silencers<00:05:51.980> I<00:05:52.160> know<00:05:52.220> there's<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.670> fuse

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
and silencers I know there's a fuse

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.690 
and silencers I know there's a fuse
there's<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.540> streamer<00:05:53.900> I'm<00:05:54.380> not<00:05:54.650> gonna<00:05:54.800> say<00:05:55.070> his

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
there's a streamer I'm not gonna say his

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.180 
there's a streamer I'm not gonna say his
name<00:05:55.910> he<00:05:56.120> streams<00:05:56.390> on<00:05:56.570> twitch<00:05:56.810> and<00:05:57.050> he<00:05:57.590> he<00:05:58.070> gets

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
name he streams on twitch and he he gets

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.160 
name he streams on twitch and he he gets
mad<00:05:58.460> anytime<00:05:59.030> he<00:05:59.150> runs<00:05:59.330> into<00:05:59.510> someone<00:05:59.900> else

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
mad anytime he runs into someone else

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.320 
mad anytime he runs into someone else
that<00:06:00.710> uses<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:01.040> silencer<00:06:01.610> or<00:06:01.640> kill<00:06:02.060> streaks

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
that uses a silencer or kill streaks

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.380 
that uses a silencer or kill streaks
because<00:06:02.660> they<00:06:02.780> don't<00:06:02.930> have<00:06:02.990> gun<00:06:03.500> skill<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.390> I

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
because they don't have gun skill and I

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.450 
because they don't have gun skill and I
baffles<00:06:06.200> me<00:06:06.380> how<00:06:06.530> people<00:06:06.920> can<00:06:07.010> say<00:06:07.220> they're

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
baffles me how people can say they're

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
baffles me how people can say they're
better<00:06:07.700> because<00:06:08.060> they<00:06:08.180> don't<00:06:08.330> use

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
better because they don't use

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.140 
better because they don't use
killstreaks<00:06:09.080> when<00:06:09.950> obviously<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:10.610> can<00:06:10.970> win<00:06:11.120> a

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
killstreaks when obviously I can win a

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.970 
killstreaks when obviously I can win a
game<00:06:11.390> a<00:06:11.450> lot<00:06:11.690> easier<00:06:11.900> with<00:06:12.260> a<00:06:12.290> killstreak<00:06:12.680> than

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980 
game a lot easier with a killstreak than

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.670 
game a lot easier with a killstreak than
you<00:06:13.130> can<00:06:13.340> with<00:06:13.520> specialist<00:06:14.090> I<00:06:14.470> mean<00:06:15.470> there's

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
you can with specialist I mean there's

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.960

one<00:06:16.100> or<00:06:16.220> two<00:06:16.250> people<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:16.700> could<00:06:16.820> probably

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
one or two people that could probably

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.250 
one or two people that could probably
beat<00:06:17.210> me<00:06:17.240> with<00:06:17.540> specialist<00:06:17.960> while<00:06:18.140> I'm

running<00:06:18.500> kill<00:06:18.680> streaks<00:06:18.980> but<00:06:19.760> that's<00:06:20.030> besides

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
running kill streaks but that's besides

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.780
