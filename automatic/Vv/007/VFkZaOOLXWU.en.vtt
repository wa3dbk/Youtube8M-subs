00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
really scientifically based it's just I

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
really scientifically based it's just I
think<00:00:54.270> an<00:00:54.930> over<00:00:55.379> greening<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> area<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
think an over greening of this area and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.729 
think an over greening of this area and
it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> attitude<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
it's a attitude you see around the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's a attitude you see around the
country<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.780> unfortunately<00:01:01.850> certain<00:01:02.850> folks

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
country and unfortunately certain folks

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.929 
country and unfortunately certain folks
have<00:01:03.329> picked<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.229> place<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.939> let's

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
have picked on this place as a let's

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
have picked on this place as a let's
make<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> statement<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.590> use<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.950> as

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
make a statement and let's use this as

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
make a statement and let's use this as
an<00:01:08.280> example<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> be

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
an example and I think it's going to be

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.990 
an example and I think it's going to be
if<00:01:10.409> they're<00:01:10.650> successful<00:01:10.920> which<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.670> far<00:01:11.700> they

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
if they're successful which so far they

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.399 
if they're successful which so far they
have<00:01:12.180> been<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.600> going<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:12.960> something<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
have been it's going to be something you

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.640 
have been it's going to be something you
see<00:01:13.619> around<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> country<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.409> people<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
see around the country and people that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.020

businessman been his business man myself
down<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.619> during<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> beach<00:01:31.890> closure

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
down here and during the beach closure

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.580 
down here and during the beach closure
in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> spring<00:01:32.909> early<00:01:33.060> summer<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> had<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:34.560> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in the spring early summer I had not a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
in the spring early summer I had not a
single<00:01:34.710> order<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:36.000> fishing<00:01:36.479> lures<00:01:36.689> from<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
single order of fishing lures from the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.590 
single order of fishing lures from the
tackle<00:01:37.350> stores<00:01:37.590> down<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.479> say

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
tackle stores down here so I would say

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
tackle stores down here so I would say
it<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.350> hundred<00:01:40.619> percent<00:01:40.650> impact<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
it was a one hundred percent impact and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.580 
it was a one hundred percent impact and
I<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.210> businesses<00:01:43.020> were<00:01:43.200> definitely

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
I know other businesses were definitely

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
I know other businesses were definitely
suffering<00:01:44.070> many<00:01:45.030> layoffs<00:01:45.780> occurred<00:01:46.110> because

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
suffering many layoffs occurred because

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.310 
suffering many layoffs occurred because
of<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:47.329> just<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.630> overkill<00:01:49.079> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
of this I just think it's overkill it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.889 
of this I just think it's overkill it
doesn't<00:01:49.950> make<00:01:50.070> any<00:01:50.250> sense<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:51.270> it's

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
doesn't make any sense and I think it's

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.460 
doesn't make any sense and I think it's
a<00:01:52.020> gut<00:01:52.259> reaction<00:01:52.439> on<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:52.979> environmentalists

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
a gut reaction on the environmentalists

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
a gut reaction on the environmentalists
to<00:01:55.470> say<00:01:55.619> wow<00:01:55.799> look<00:01:56.009> at<00:01:56.100> all<00:01:56.189> those<00:01:56.340> vehicles

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to say wow look at all those vehicles

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
to say wow look at all those vehicles
out<00:01:57.000> there<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.479> can't<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.259> it's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
out there that can't be good but it's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.060 
out there that can't be good but it's
wrong<00:01:58.890> it's<00:02:00.409> actually<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> presence<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
wrong it's actually the presence of
