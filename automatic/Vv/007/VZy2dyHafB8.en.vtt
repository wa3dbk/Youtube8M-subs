00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
hard drive it's um

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.060 
hard drive it's um
this<00:02:50.070> program<00:02:50.519> here<00:02:50.730> at<00:02:51.570> sport<00:02:51.930> 360<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.360> then

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
this program here at sport 360 and then

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.900 
this program here at sport 360 and then
just<00:02:56.070> select<00:02:56.730> your<00:02:56.880> hard<00:02:57.150> drive<00:02:57.420> click<00:02:57.780> OK<00:02:58.910> go

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
just select your hard drive click OK go

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.110 
just select your hard drive click OK go
into<00:03:00.120> device<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.690> partition<00:03:01.200> three<00:03:02.120> content

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
into device one partition three content

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.520 
into device one partition three content
and<00:03:04.220> then<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.269> want<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.570> drag<00:03:06.930> in<00:03:07.140> your

and then here you want to drag in your
annihilation<00:03:08.190> profile<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.570> go<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:09.989> the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
annihilation profile so go into the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.229 
annihilation profile so go into the
folder<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.830> named<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.820> annihilation

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
folder that you named the annihilation

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.960 
folder that you named the annihilation
profile<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.380> then<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.100> drag<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> drop<00:03:14.700> in

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
profile and then just drag and drop in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.729 
profile and then just drag and drop in
the<00:03:15.720> folder<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.470> begins<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
the folder that begins with the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.460 
the folder that begins with the
beginnings<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.400> E<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.660> has<00:03:21.870> like<00:03:22.110> four

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
beginnings of E and then has like four

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.240 
beginnings of E and then has like four
zeros<00:03:22.890> after<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:24.269> drag<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.480> into<00:03:24.750> content

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
zeros after just drag that into content

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.259 
zeros after just drag that into content
and<00:03:26.250> then<00:03:26.970> check<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.330> Sarah<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.000> there

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and then check that Sarah so it's there

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.810 
and then check that Sarah so it's there
it<00:03:30.900> might<00:03:31.140> take<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.410> while<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> actually<00:03:32.220> inject

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
it might take a while to actually inject

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.289 
it might take a while to actually inject
so<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:34.580> now<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.640> want<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> go<00:03:36.030> into

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
so there it is now you want to go into

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.160 
so there it is now you want to go into
16<00:03:36.900> zeros<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:38.600> you<00:03:39.600> want<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> open<00:03:39.930> up

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
16 zeros and you want to open up

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.069 
16 zeros and you want to open up
Annihilation<00:03:41.130> folder<00:03:41.600> now<00:03:42.600> now<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> just

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
Annihilation folder now now you just

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.770 
Annihilation folder now now you just
want<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.350> drag<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.769> that<00:03:43.799> folder<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.579> well<00:03:44.780> or

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
want to drag in that folder as well or

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.150

if<00:03:45.900> you've<00:03:46.049> already<00:03:46.169> got<00:03:46.500> one

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
if you've already got one

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.650 
if you've already got one

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
you wanted to strike it in I could take

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.700 
you wanted to strike it in I could take
wall<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.420> don't<00:04:12.840> really<00:04:13.110> know<00:04:13.290> why<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.500> just

doesn't work and it resets a bad arm to
like<00:05:26.250> 10<00:05:26.490> zeros<00:05:26.940> if<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.840> have<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.139> case<00:05:28.380> just

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
like 10 zeros if you have that case just

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.580 
like 10 zeros if you have that case just
plug<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.340> a<00:05:29.370> USB<00:05:29.460> into<00:05:30.120> your<00:05:30.150> xbox<00:05:30.590> copy

something<00:05:32.070> across<00:05:32.280> like<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> saved<00:05:33.630> game<00:05:33.660> or

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
something across like a saved game or

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.840 
something across like a saved game or
something<00:05:34.410> and<00:05:34.919> then<00:05:35.160> try<00:05:35.460> again<00:05:35.550> because

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
something and then try again because

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.310 
something and then try again because
then<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.180> should<00:05:36.300> already<00:05:36.510> make<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.960> for<00:05:37.169> you
