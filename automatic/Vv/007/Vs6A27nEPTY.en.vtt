boys<00:00:42.520> level<00:00:43.120> 48<00:00:43.570> now<00:00:44.490> that<00:00:45.490> is<00:00:45.730> definitely

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
boys level 48 now that is definitely

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.810 
boys level 48 now that is definitely
higher<00:00:46.840> than<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.350> original<00:00:48.010> level<00:00:48.160> cap<00:00:48.460> for

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
higher than the original level cap for

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.970 
higher than the original level cap for
fallout<00:00:49.390> 3<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:50.230> original<00:00:50.500> level<00:00:50.590> cap<00:00:50.800> was

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
fallout 3 the original level cap was

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.530 
fallout 3 the original level cap was
level<00:00:51.160> 20<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.640> then<00:00:51.730> it<00:00:51.820> was<00:00:51.910> increased<00:00:52.180> level

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
level 20 and then it was increased level

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.660 
level 20 and then it was increased level
30<00:00:52.780> with<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.079> broken<00:00:53.290> steel<00:00:53.650> deal<00:00:53.890> scene<00:00:54.160> but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
30 with the broken steel deal scene but

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.170 
30 with the broken steel deal scene but
now<00:00:54.790> is<00:00:54.970> up<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.960> 48<00:00:56.530> so<00:00:56.770> it's<00:00:56.920> probably<00:00:57.670> safe<00:00:58.149> to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
now is up to 48 so it's probably safe to

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.990 
now is up to 48 so it's probably safe to
assume<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.110> global<00:00:59.470> cat<00:00:59.620> maybe<00:01:00.340> 50<00:01:00.790> I

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
assume that the global cat maybe 50 I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.569 
assume that the global cat maybe 50 I
can't<00:01:01.750> remember<00:01:01.870> what<00:01:02.290> skyrim's<00:01:03.070> level<00:01:03.430> cap

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
can't remember what skyrim's level cap

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.039 
can't remember what skyrim's level cap
boys<00:01:03.790> probably<00:01:04.390> put<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.689> the<00:01:04.780> screen<00:01:05.019> right

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
boys probably put on the screen right

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.920 
boys probably put on the screen right
now<00:01:05.170> but<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:06.369> level<00:01:06.610> cap<00:01:06.790> is<00:01:07.060> definitely

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
now but the level cap is definitely

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.569 
now but the level cap is definitely
higher<00:01:08.229> than<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.710> was<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:08.890> previous<00:01:09.369> four

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
higher than it was in previous four

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.879 
higher than it was in previous four
games<00:01:09.610> now<00:01:10.149> now<00:01:10.600> this<00:01:10.780> definitely<00:01:11.439> means<00:01:11.619> that

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:11.889 
games now now this definitely means that

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:14.039 
games now now this definitely means that
this<00:01:11.979> game<00:01:12.219> is<00:01:12.249> much<00:01:12.759> larger<00:01:13.030> than<00:01:13.450> followed

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
this game is much larger than followed
