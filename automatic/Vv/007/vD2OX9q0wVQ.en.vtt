all<00:02:18.940> right<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> bulldoze<00:02:19.810> doesn't<00:02:20.440> do<00:02:20.650> much

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
all right the bulldoze doesn't do much

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.850 
all right the bulldoze doesn't do much
but<00:02:21.849> it<00:02:22.000> lowers<00:02:22.480> its<00:02:22.750> speed<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.470> why<00:02:23.830> I

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
but it lowers its speed that's why I

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.380 
but it lowers its speed that's why I
used<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.760> cuz<00:02:25.300> now<00:02:26.040> emboar<00:02:27.040> will<00:02:27.640> be<00:02:27.819> faster

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
used it cuz now emboar will be faster

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.390 
used it cuz now emboar will be faster
