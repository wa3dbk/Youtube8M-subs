this old fireplace this was originally

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.580 
this old fireplace this was originally
boarded<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:25.210> when<00:03:25.660> I<00:03:25.690> first<00:03:25.900> bought<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:26.230> so

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
boarded up when I first bought it so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.520 
boarded up when I first bought it so
when<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.920> came<00:03:27.610> in<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.120> kind<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.690> thought<00:03:28.870> you

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
when I came in I kind of thought you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.260 
when I came in I kind of thought you
know<00:03:29.560> those<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.340> boards<00:03:30.700> over<00:03:30.940> here<00:03:31.120> with

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
know those the boards over here with

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.490 
know those the boards over here with
different<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.690> these<00:03:31.840> funds<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.320> thought

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
different to these funds and I thought

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.320 
different to these funds and I thought
and<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.190> obviously<00:03:33.730> there<00:03:33.850> was<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> chimney

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
and the obviously there was a chimney

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.620 
and the obviously there was a chimney
outside<00:03:34.720> which<00:03:34.960> was<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.200> dead<00:03:35.470> giveaway<00:03:36.330> so<00:03:37.330> I

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
outside which was a dead giveaway so I

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.510 
outside which was a dead giveaway so I
pulled<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.470> apart<00:03:38.560> and<00:03:38.890> I've<00:03:39.070> just<00:03:39.280> started

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
pulled it apart and I've just started

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.670 
pulled it apart and I've just started
I've<00:03:40.120> repainted<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:40.990> obviously<00:03:41.260> when<00:03:41.620> i

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
I've repainted it and obviously when i
