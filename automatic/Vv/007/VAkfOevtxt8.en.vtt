again because it'll snag and start up
higher<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.220> then<00:03:43.220> once<00:03:43.430> we<00:03:43.640> tremor<00:03:43.940> then<00:03:44.540> you

higher and then once we tremor then you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
higher and then once we tremor then you
won't<00:03:45.110> have<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.380> problem<00:03:47.080> but<00:03:48.080> just<00:03:48.709> try<00:03:48.920> to

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
and you can trim it like how I twisted

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.760 
and you can trim it like how I twisted

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
yes you can just trim that by yourself

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.410 
yes you can just trim that by yourself
if<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.459> don't<00:04:04.489> want<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.880> take<00:04:05.090> it<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.300> the

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
if you don't want to take it to the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.330 
if you don't want to take it to the
salon<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.050> chop<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.470> all<00:04:06.590> off

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.030 

but<00:04:11.970> see<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.180> noticed<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.810> difference<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.530> each

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
but see I noticed a difference like each

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.770 
but see I noticed a difference like each
time<00:04:14.099> you<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.940> getting<00:04:15.300> better<00:04:15.480> and

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
time you do it it's getting better and

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.840 
time you do it it's getting better and
better<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.290> then<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.250> make<00:04:17.430> sure<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.730> get

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
better and then just make sure you get

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.759 
better and then just make sure you get
down<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.239> base<00:04:18.510> as<00:04:18.900> fast<00:04:19.290> as<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.590> can

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
down to the base as fast as you can

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.590 
down to the base as fast as you can
because<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.639> twist<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.060> before<00:04:21.510> it

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
because you have to twist it before it

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:36.890 
because you have to twist it before it
becomes<00:04:21.810> dry<00:04:26.780> she's<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:27.990> cute

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:47.970 

yeah<00:04:37.560> nice

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.310 

so<00:04:48.580> when<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:48.910> yes<00:04:49.150> then<00:04:49.660> you<00:04:49.810> come<00:04:50.020> down

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
so when it yes then you come down

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.030 
so when it yes then you come down
exactly<00:04:54.630> perfect<00:04:55.630> put<00:04:56.440> it<00:04:56.560> back<00:04:56.740> under

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
exactly perfect put it back under

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.690 
exactly perfect put it back under
control

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.060 

so<00:05:03.270> do<00:05:03.510> you<00:05:03.630> feel<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.260> base<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.470> pretty

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
so do you feel that the base is pretty

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.980 
so do you feel that the base is pretty
much<00:05:05.250> detangle<00:05:05.880> then<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.510> want<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.750> start

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
much detangle then you want to start

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:27.879 
much detangle then you want to start
twisting<00:05:07.610> before<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.700> dries<00:05:08.910> out

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:46.450 

the<00:05:28.889> other<00:05:29.090> no<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.150> got<00:05:30.449> it<00:05:30.480> yeah<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.380> it

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.909 

I<00:05:46.550> know<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.360> takes<00:05:47.389> practice<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.139> you<00:05:48.470> get<00:05:48.740> it

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
I know it takes practice but you get it

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.100 
I know it takes practice but you get it
just<00:05:49.729> make<00:05:49.910> sure<00:05:49.940> you<00:05:50.120> use<00:05:50.300> those<00:05:50.509> fingers<00:05:50.990> I

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
too high up or you'll create more split

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.050 
too high up or you'll create more split
ends<00:07:06.630> when<00:07:06.810> you<00:07:06.930> pull<00:07:07.320> it<00:07:07.470> apart<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:08.070> you<00:07:08.850> see
