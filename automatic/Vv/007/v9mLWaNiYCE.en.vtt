00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.749
 not that is not always easy because after that I have to do it 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.579
 get up early in the morning is now 55 2 points behind and picks up the 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.259
 not always from the previous day and not come on the nightly use 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 DÃ¼ren 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.780
 the users the milk was collected from the region then it comes exactly 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.490
 here in this house in the beer crate of choice and I would like it 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.490
 look around what's with the milk as the iPad 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.260
 Victory is a big field 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.620
 certainly not the farmers 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.380
 they only make a product of the crisis 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.409
 and the enthusiasm every day 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.520
 if you want a product out to make the quality 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.950
 then this is also true 3 1 these farmers earn decent money 44 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.850
 cents 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.479
 the other animals and dairy farmers do not have 22 23 cents left 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.170
 that is i think that the future is due to the mining shows 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.159
 Iranian seen this morning who were not picked up from bankruptcy 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.380
 saved therefore delivered what happens and continue with the milk 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.250
 if that was her arrival 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.740
 The middle points there are the Fuggers pumped down on the eCommerce lowered 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:37.930
 fact and ran 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.840
 then runs over and tinkers or becomes in the critics Becker about Bastian 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.830
 They heated to 32 degrees the web, of course, the British had the lab 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.830
 Add live ticker 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.470
 the first in one that is a Dr and the serious one in a small glasses 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.460
 Terrorist is 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.440
 yes that is already working we are suffering in the crisis 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.280
 is the rooms running the takeover deadline the runway - 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.110
 there is only playing Ben Ayliffe 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.410
 coma-texts make cold 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.860
 to make a really good crisis probably just scary so far 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.529
 counting 

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.529
 there is no alternative 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.789
 Frederic Werner Fischer cheese pressed him what exactly is this? 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:22.749
 here it will need we get you form crisis representative 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.819
 the crisis hits the environment 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.679
 motivated quieter car always drives prefer 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:30.439
 we need you 25 14 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.779
 directly behind the leading Schumacher 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.859
 gets in every quarter 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.859
 the birds still possible the restrictions 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.219
 even when they agree on the list, where does the milk come from? 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.990
 know how Dirty Side works 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.569
 What leaves you in the dark is the hardest crisis 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.709
 TIG is the op of the Place de 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.209
 will fail 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.739
 I will only go daily 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.789
 Here can be together with the fair the clinic drives 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:00.319
 this crisis, the FCR has short BPA for health this church will be in 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.049
 Summer from Graz brought with the iPad 2 at the driver-wm 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.069
 dat grass Kesici has achieved something but sustainability would be the question 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.789
 Which 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:12.689
 And while criticizing the series is a bit faster because I have so many cards 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.539
 It is very very much a player who spreads that long for this leadership 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.229
 more interesting, however, will come to gripping 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:22.729
 I expect that we have already cheapened the title since the bankruptcy 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.819
 more practical 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.999
 so yes 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.549
 with the project "I'm in debt
