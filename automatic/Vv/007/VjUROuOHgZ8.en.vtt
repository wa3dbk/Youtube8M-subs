wasn't<00:00:33.120> an<00:00:33.329> option<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.590> kind

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
wasn't an option to me it was just kind

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
wasn't an option to me it was just kind
of<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> gimmicky<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.969> most<00:00:36.300> people<00:00:36.540> would

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
of a gimmicky thing as most people would

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
of a gimmicky thing as most people would
say<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.430> actually<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.790> very

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
say it is but this is actually a very

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.010 
say it is but this is actually a very
reliable<00:00:39.629> means<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.260> fire<00:00:40.590> started<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:42.020> the

reliable means of fire started and the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.610 
reliable means of fire started and the
fact<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:45.140> believed<00:00:46.140> extra

fine<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.370> extra<00:00:47.700> fine<00:00:47.940> often<00:00:48.899> referred<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
fine it's extra fine often referred to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.380 
fine it's extra fine often referred to
as<00:00:49.320> quadruple<00:00:49.980> zero<00:00:50.010> grade<00:00:50.550> steel<00:00:50.850> wool<00:00:51.090> I

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
as quadruple zero grade steel wool I

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
as quadruple zero grade steel wool I
don't<00:00:52.289> know<00:00:52.379> how<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.070> but

don't know how well you can see but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
don't know how well you can see but
these<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.120> fibers<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.809> steel<00:00:54.989> wool<00:00:55.199> not

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
these are like fibers of steel wool not

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
these are like fibers of steel wool not
like<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.980> pot<00:00:56.190> scrubbers<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.879> much

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like your pot scrubbers that are much

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.900 
like your pot scrubbers that are much
thicker<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.050> bulkier<00:00:58.590> those<00:00:59.489> really<00:00:59.760> don't

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
thicker and bulkier those really don't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
thicker and bulkier those really don't
work<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> stay<00:01:01.590> away

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
from the kind that have the chemicals

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
from the kind that have the chemicals
and<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> detergents<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.580> cleaners

just<00:01:39.600> use<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> cotton<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.530> demonstration

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
just use the cotton for demonstration

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.100 
just use the cotton for demonstration
purposes<00:01:41.579> I'm<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> take<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.840> steel

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
purposes I'm going to take some steel

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.360 
purposes I'm going to take some steel
wool<00:01:43.140> here

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
wool here

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.450 
wool here
take<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.770> chunk<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.930> about<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.350> come<00:01:50.280> loose

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
take a chunk there about like come loose

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
take a chunk there about like come loose
so<00:01:51.920> work<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.300> be<00:01:54.390> able

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
so work that out you want it to be able

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.010 
so work that out you want it to be able
to<00:01:54.630> breathe<00:01:54.870> but<00:01:55.140> still<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.500> compact<00:01:55.890> enough

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
to breathe but still be compact enough

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.170 
to breathe but still be compact enough
the<00:01:58.020> way<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.410> the<00:01:58.620> quote<00:01:59.520> unquote<00:01:59.640> embers

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the way that the quote unquote embers

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
the way that the quote unquote embers
transfer<00:02:00.900> on<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.500> needs<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.800> be

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
transfer on this it needs to be

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.070 
transfer on this it needs to be
relatively<00:02:02.550> tight<00:02:02.910> but<00:02:03.120> still<00:02:03.390> well<00:02:03.810> enough

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
relatively tight but still well enough

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.960 
relatively tight but still well enough
to<00:02:06.290> breathe<00:02:07.290> well<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.980> go<00:02:08.340> ahead<00:02:08.430> and<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:08.850> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to breathe well so go ahead and take the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.969 
to breathe well so go ahead and take the
novel<00:02:09.270> better<00:02:09.479> let's<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.990> ahead<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.350> give<00:02:10.950> a

novel better let's go ahead and give a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.360 
novel better let's go ahead and give a
couple<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> Pat's<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:13.070> try<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.130> get<00:02:14.280> it

couple of Pat's like that try to get it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.060 
couple of Pat's like that try to get it
well<00:02:14.520> there<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:14.850> go<00:02:15.110> fan<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.470> bit<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
well there we go fan it a little bit it

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.570 
well there we go fan it a little bit it
works<00:02:17.280> well<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.290> there<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.350> go<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:20.220> started

submerged go ahead and drop the non volt

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.050 
submerged go ahead and drop the non volt
battery<00:02:39.630> into<00:02:39.900> some<00:02:40.560> water<00:02:40.770> there<00:02:40.980> take<00:02:41.910> over

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
battery into some water there take over

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.950 
battery into some water there take over
another<00:02:42.210> pad<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.570> steel<00:02:42.660> wool<00:02:44.750> go<00:02:45.750> ahead<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770 
shake off the excess and touch it to the
stool<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.980> see<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.340> takes<00:02:50.550> well<00:02:50.790> even

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
stool and you see it takes well even

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.140 
stool and you see it takes well even
though<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.110> was<00:02:52.260> just<00:02:52.440> submerged<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.910> check

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
though it was just submerged so check

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.449 
though it was just submerged so check
you<00:02:54.300> into<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> pits<00:02:54.890> now<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.190> because

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you into the pits now just because

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
you into the pits now just because
everybody<00:02:57.120> knows<00:02:57.239> about<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.570> 9-volt<00:02:58.140> battery

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
everybody knows about the 9-volt battery

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320 
everybody knows about the 9-volt battery
and<00:02:58.830> still<00:02:59.220> doesn't<00:02:59.730> mean<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> only

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and still doesn't mean that's the only

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.229 
and still doesn't mean that's the only
option<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.380> going<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:02.060> going<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
option to get it going it's going to

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.590 
option to get it going it's going to
take<00:03:03.450> flame<00:03:03.810> incredibly<00:03:04.350> well<00:03:04.530> as<00:03:05.160> well<00:03:05.600> going

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
take flame incredibly well as well going

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.380 
take flame incredibly well as well going
to<00:03:06.660> take<00:03:06.810> another<00:03:07.370> path<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.670> work<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.270> up

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
to take another path there work it up

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.660 
to take another path there work it up
and<00:03:09.989> as<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> showed<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> 9-volt

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
and as it showed you with a 9-volt

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.430 
and as it showed you with a 9-volt
battery<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.480> know<00:03:12.600> that's<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.020> 100

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
battery you know that's a 100

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.229 
battery you know that's a 100
fire-starting<00:03:13.709> option<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.030> lighter

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
fire-starting option so is the lighter

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.550 
fire-starting option so is the lighter
but<00:03:15.450> if<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:15.720> gets<00:03:15.900> wet<00:03:16.110> you're<00:03:16.380> gonna<00:03:16.470> have

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
but if it's gets wet you're gonna have

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.780 
but if it's gets wet you're gonna have
to<00:03:16.650> wait<00:03:16.770> till<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.980> stress<00:03:17.190> out<00:03:17.370> before<00:03:17.670> it's

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
to wait till the stress out before it's

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.620 
to wait till the stress out before it's
usable<00:03:18.150> again<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.050> it's<00:03:19.560> more<00:03:19.739> cotton<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.630> you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
usable again so it's more cotton and you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.710 
usable again so it's more cotton and you
see<00:03:21.870> how<00:03:22.080> well<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.290> takes<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:24.510> that

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
see how well it takes just like that

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.480 
see how well it takes just like that
ended<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.709> bit<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.340> cotton

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
ended up a bit on the cotton

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.110 
ended up a bit on the cotton
and<00:03:28.830> look<00:03:29.830> there<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.070> go<00:03:30.190> go<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.670> blue<00:03:30.850> my<00:03:30.940> flame

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and look there we go go to blue my flame

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.510 
and look there we go go to blue my flame
out<00:03:31.300> but<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.020> takes<00:03:32.140> as<00:03:32.320> well<00:03:32.490> with<00:03:33.490> a

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
out but it takes as well with a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.370 
out but it takes as well with a
cigarette<00:03:33.790> lighter<00:03:33.940> no<00:03:34.600> problem<00:03:34.960> whatsoever

grade steel wool to actually start a

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.610 
grade steel wool to actually start a
fire<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.210> as<00:04:29.330> i<00:04:29.420> showed<00:04:29.630> you<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.260> lighter

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
fire but as i showed you that a lighter

fire but as i showed you that a lighter
and<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.670> fire<00:04:31.850> steel<00:04:32.120> are<00:04:32.330> also<00:04:32.450> viable<00:04:32.960> means

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
and a fire steel are also viable means

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.670 
and a fire steel are also viable means
of<00:04:33.380> an<00:04:34.040> ignition<00:04:34.400> source<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:35.120> get<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.330> going

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
of an ignition source to get this going

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.540 
of an ignition source to get this going
now<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:38.720> reason<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.200> carry<00:04:39.410> steel<00:04:39.740> wool<00:04:40.010> with

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
now the reason to carry steel wool with

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.610 
now the reason to carry steel wool with
you<00:04:40.760> for<00:04:40.970> far<00:04:41.150> as<00:04:41.240> starting<00:04:41.570> is<00:04:41.720> obviously

shown there with multiple ignition

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.590 
shown there with multiple ignition
sources<00:04:45.260> is<00:04:45.560> that<00:04:46.400> it's<00:04:46.580> very<00:04:46.850> cheap<00:04:47.270> it's

hanging<00:04:56.480> in<00:04:56.930> here<00:04:57.500> I've<00:04:57.710> actually<00:04:58.010> stuffed<00:04:58.550> to

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
hanging in here I've actually stuffed to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.920

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
full pads of Steel war just compacted it

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.040 
full pads of Steel war just compacted it
down<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:06.170> that's<00:05:06.290> two<00:05:06.680> full<00:05:06.920> pads<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:08.050> it's

down and that's two full pads and it's
not<00:05:09.200> much<00:05:09.350> larger<00:05:09.890> than<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.460> 9-volt<00:05:10.760> battery

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
not much larger than the 9-volt battery

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.130 
not much larger than the 9-volt battery
itself<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:14.030> know<00:05:14.060> this<00:05:14.330> weighs<00:05:14.570> maybe<00:05:14.870> an

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
itself you know this weighs maybe an

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.110 
itself you know this weighs maybe an
ounce<00:05:15.410> with<00:05:15.980> the<00:05:16.070> steel<00:05:16.310> wool<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.850> cap

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
ounce with the steel wool and the cap

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.750 
ounce with the steel wool and the cap
altogether<00:05:17.600> there<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.380> each<00:05:19.190> pad<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.640> steel

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760

altogether there and each pad of steel
wool<00:05:20.210> with<00:05:20.810> practice<00:05:21.050> even<00:05:21.530> if<00:05:21.710> you're<00:05:21.800> just

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
wool with practice even if you're just

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.680 
wool with practice even if you're just
starting<00:05:22.010> out<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:22.850> see<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.180> video<00:05:23.480> and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
starting out and you see this video and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.940 
starting out and you see this video and
you<00:05:23.750> think<00:05:23.960> well<00:05:24.080> this<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.410> actually<00:05:24.800> a<00:05:24.830> really

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
you think well this is actually a really

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.500 
you think well this is actually a really
good<00:05:25.040> idea<00:05:25.160> something<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.850> consider<00:05:26.150> and

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
good idea something to consider and

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.840 
good idea something to consider and
carry<00:05:26.720> with<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:27.190> each<00:05:28.190> one<00:05:28.400> of<00:05:28.430> these<00:05:28.580> when

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
carry with you each one of these when

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.100 
carry with you each one of these when
you<00:05:28.970> start<00:05:29.240> out<00:05:29.390> with<00:05:29.570> a<00:05:29.630> little<00:05:29.990> bit<00:05:30.080> of

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
you start out with a little bit of

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.720 
you start out with a little bit of
experience<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:30.710> probably<00:05:30.980> get<00:05:31.100> about<00:05:31.190> 15

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
experience you probably get about 15

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.430 
experience you probably get about 15
fires<00:05:32.000> going<00:05:32.270> from<00:05:32.510> just<00:05:32.720> one<00:05:32.930> pad<00:05:33.169> of<00:05:33.350> steel

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
fires going from just one pad of steel

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.130 
fires going from just one pad of steel
wool<00:05:34.210> with<00:05:35.210> a<00:05:35.240> little<00:05:35.450> more<00:05:35.600> practice<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.990> can

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
wool with a little more practice you can

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.500 
wool with a little more practice you can
push<00:05:36.290> that<00:05:36.440> up<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.710> 25<00:05:37.250> easily<00:05:37.880> just<00:05:38.270> getting

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
push that up to 25 easily just getting

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.850 
push that up to 25 easily just getting
that<00:05:38.540> much<00:05:38.750> more<00:05:38.960> familiar<00:05:39.110> with<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:39.590> and

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
that much more familiar with it and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.670 
that much more familiar with it and
working<00:05:40.250> with<00:05:40.460> these<00:05:40.550> techniques<00:05:41.680> it's

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
working with these techniques it's

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.480 
working with these techniques it's
definitely<00:05:43.040> something<00:05:43.190> to<00:05:43.400> consider

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490
