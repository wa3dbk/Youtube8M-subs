pet vacuum at the time we're recording
this<00:00:08.130> machine<00:00:08.519> retails<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.090> about<00:00:09.260> $180<00:00:10.260> and

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
this machine retails for about $180 and

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980 
this machine retails for about $180 and
it's<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.190> great<00:00:11.519> contender<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.630> sharp

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
it's a great contender to the sharp

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's a great contender to the sharp
rotator<00:00:13.769> lift<00:00:14.040> away<00:00:14.280> Pro<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:15.210> seems<00:00:15.570> like<00:00:15.750> this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
rotator lift away Pro it seems like this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.660 
rotator lift away Pro it seems like this
machine<00:00:16.080> was<00:00:16.379> designed<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.890> response<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
machine was designed in response to the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.000 
machine was designed in response to the
shark<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> certainly<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> being<00:00:19.650> marketed

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
shark and it certainly is being marketed

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.920 
shark and it certainly is being marketed
as<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.609> response<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> shark<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.600> let's<00:00:21.779> get

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
as a response to the shark so let's get

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.410 
as a response to the shark so let's get
into<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.230> first<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.340> all<00:00:23.460> let's<00:00:24.180> talk<00:00:24.359> about

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
into it first of all let's talk about

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.849 
into it first of all let's talk about
the<00:00:24.689> things<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.990> really<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:25.439> about<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the things I really like about this

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.029 
the things I really like about this
machine<00:00:26.300> number<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.869> has<00:00:28.439> great<00:00:28.800> edge

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
machine number one it has great edge

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.950 
machine number one it has great edge
cleaning<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.880> although<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> says<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> right

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
cleaning so although it says it right

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
cleaning so although it says it right
here<00:00:31.019> dual<00:00:31.560> edge<00:00:31.859> cleaning<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.579> actually

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
here dual edge cleaning it actually

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.090 
here dual edge cleaning it actually
really<00:00:33.719> works<00:00:33.960> well<00:00:34.230> that's<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
really works well that's one of the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.709 
really works well that's one of the
biggest<00:00:35.460> complaints<00:00:35.730> about<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> shark<00:00:36.480> if

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
biggest complaints about the shark if

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
biggest complaints about the shark if
you<00:00:37.170> try<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> go<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.800> against<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.250> edge<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you try to go up against some edge it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.209 
you try to go up against some edge it
doesn't<00:00:38.850> work<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.420> well<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:40.320> there's<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
doesn't work very well because there's a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.940 
doesn't work very well because there's a
gap<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.910> both<00:00:42.239> sides<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.350> brush<00:00:43.620> roll

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
gap on both sides of the brush roll

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
gap on both sides of the brush roll
where<00:00:44.370> there's<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:44.969> suction<00:00:45.329> no<00:00:45.690> brush<00:00:45.960> action

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
where there's no suction no brush action

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
where there's no suction no brush action
this<00:00:47.399> has<00:00:47.640> channels<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.270> allow<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.539> suction

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
this has channels to allow the suction

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.160 
this has channels to allow the suction
and<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> has<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> much<00:00:49.680> wider<00:00:49.710> brush<00:00:50.370> roll<00:00:50.700> so

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
and it has a much wider brush roll so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.479 
and it has a much wider brush roll so
very<00:00:52.170> good<00:00:52.789> number<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.190> machine<00:00:56.190> also

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
very good number two the machine also

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.529 
very good number two the machine also
has<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.500> handle<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.559> goes<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.219> down

although<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.690> doesn't<00:01:00.930> seem<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.500> lot

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
although this doesn't seem like a lot

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.479 
although this doesn't seem like a lot
for<00:01:01.980> some<00:01:02.219> people<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.640> very<00:01:02.879> small<00:01:03.350> closets

my<00:01:58.350> absolute<00:01:58.950> favorites<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.579> does<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> very

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
my absolute favorites it does a very

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.139 
my absolute favorites it does a very
good<00:02:00.420> job<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:01.049> carpet<00:02:01.920> cleaning<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.880> why<00:02:03.000> don't

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
good job at carpet cleaning so why don't

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
good job at carpet cleaning so why don't
I<00:02:03.210> show<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> pan<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> camera

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
I show you I'm going to pan the camera

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.719 
I show you I'm going to pan the camera
down<00:02:04.920> right<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:07.280> I'm<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.489> use<00:02:08.700> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
down right now and I'm going to use a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
down right now and I'm going to use a
little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.390> flour<00:02:09.690> here

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
little bit of flour here

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.130 
little bit of flour here
to<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.459> test<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.379> is<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:15.420> bread

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
to do a little test so this is a bread

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.309 
to do a little test so this is a bread
flour<00:02:17.720> there's<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.959> little<00:02:19.110> bit<00:02:19.230> right

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
flour there's just a little bit right

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.369 
flour there's just a little bit right
there<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.019> camera

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
there and you can see that on camera

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.380 
there and you can see that on camera
just<00:02:22.530> fine<00:02:22.799> I'm<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> turn<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
just fine I'm going to turn on the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.970 
just fine I'm going to turn on the
machine<00:02:24.690> with<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.900> brush<00:02:25.110> roll<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.590> do<00:02:25.799> one

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
machine with the brush roll and do one

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.740 
machine with the brush roll and do one
slow<00:02:26.220> pass<00:02:26.549> back<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:26.879> forth<00:02:27.090> let's<00:02:27.510> take<00:02:27.720> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
slow pass back and forth let's take a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:50.620 
slow pass back and forth let's take a
look<00:02:27.959> at<00:02:28.049> how<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> does

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.270 

now<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.959> see<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.380> ended<00:02:52.650> up<00:02:52.709> being<00:02:52.950> two

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
now as you see that ended up being two

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.250 
now as you see that ended up being two
passes<00:02:53.849> because<00:02:54.090> there<00:02:54.569> was<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:54.959> flower

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
passes because there was some flower

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.790 
passes because there was some flower
over<00:02:55.800> there<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.970> was<00:02:57.390> outside<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.530> range

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
over there that was outside of the range

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.309 
over there that was outside of the range
of<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.880> brush<00:03:00.180> head<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:02.069> let's<00:03:02.280> pan<00:03:02.550> back<00:03:02.790> up

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
of the brush head so let's pan back up

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.420 
of the brush head so let's pan back up
and<00:03:04.319> let's<00:03:04.470> talk<00:03:04.709> about<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.920> couple<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.220> things

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and let's talk about a couple of things

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.509 
and let's talk about a couple of things
that<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:07.739> really<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.069> about<00:03:08.400> this

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
that I don't really like about this

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.630 
that I don't really like about this
machine<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:10.110> machine<00:03:10.590> has<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> couple<00:03:11.580> of

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
machine this machine has a couple of

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.920 
machine this machine has a couple of
flaws<00:03:12.200> number<00:03:13.200> one<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.400> bin<00:03:14.610> itself<00:03:15.030> now

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
flaws number one with the bin itself now

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.809 
flaws number one with the bin itself now
if<00:03:16.319> you're<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:16.890> me<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.400> lot<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.610> other

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
if you're like me and a lot of other

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.790 
if you're like me and a lot of other
people<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.330> hit<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.810> bed<00:03:18.989> occasionally<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
people you hit the bed occasionally to

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.370 
people you hit the bed occasionally to
break<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.220> stuff<00:03:20.430> off<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.970> walls<00:03:21.230> so<00:03:22.230> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
break the stuff off of the walls so that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.070 
break the stuff off of the walls so that
it's<00:03:22.530> very<00:03:22.739> easy<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.700> empty<00:03:23.959> well<00:03:24.959> this

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
it's very easy to go and empty well this

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's very easy to go and empty well this
machine<00:03:25.410> has<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.980> flaw<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.640> which<00:03:26.910> if

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
machine has a bit of a flaw in which if

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.830 
machine has a bit of a flaw in which if
you<00:03:27.239> hit<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
you hit it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170 
you hit it
this<00:03:28.290> bin<00:03:28.650> release<00:03:29.100> latch<00:03:29.400> right<00:03:29.700> here<00:03:30.000> is

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this bin release latch right here is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.550 
this bin release latch right here is
designed<00:03:31.019> in<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.530> way<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.640> will<00:03:32.850> allow<00:03:33.030> the

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
designed in a way that it will allow the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.410 
designed in a way that it will allow the
bottom<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.830> fall<00:03:35.099> out<00:03:35.310> right<00:03:35.700> over<00:03:36.000> your<00:03:36.120> floor

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
bottom to fall out right over your floor

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.900 
bottom to fall out right over your floor
so<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.380> made<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.830> mistake<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.549> I<00:03:38.640> learned

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
so I made this mistake and I learned

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.120 
so I made this mistake and I learned
this<00:03:39.090> lesson<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.480> hard<00:03:39.569> way<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.980> was

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
this lesson the hard way as I was

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.280 
this lesson the hard way as I was
walking<00:03:41.310> over<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.819> garbage<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.660> tap<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
walking over the garbage can I tap the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.470 
walking over the garbage can I tap the
side<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.739> was<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:44.069> moderate<00:03:44.790> tap<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.209> wasn't

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
side it was a moderate tap it wasn't

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.120 
side it was a moderate tap it wasn't
light<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.170> wasn't<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> know<00:03:46.620> super<00:03:46.950> heavy

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
light but it wasn't you know super heavy

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.759 
light but it wasn't you know super heavy
and<00:03:47.599> all<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.750> these<00:03:48.900> synthetic<00:03:49.110> dirt<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.739> I

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and all of these synthetic dirt that I

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.070 
and all of these synthetic dirt that I
use<00:03:50.040> on<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.340> test<00:03:50.549> track<00:03:50.730> fell<00:03:51.510> out<00:03:51.660> right<00:03:51.900> all

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
use on the test track fell out right all

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.020 
use on the test track fell out right all
over<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.349> floor<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.989> not<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.230> great<00:03:55.500> design<00:03:56.030> now

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
over the floor so not a great design now

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.810 
over the floor so not a great design now
this<00:03:57.329> is<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.260> fluke<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.280> this<00:03:59.400> model

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
this is not a fluke just to this model

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.550 
this is not a fluke just to this model
if<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.390> look<00:04:00.660> at<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> way<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.079> machine<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
if you look at the way that machine is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.270 
if you look at the way that machine is
designed<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:02.070> designed<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.670> allow<00:04:02.850> some<00:04:03.090> flex

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
designed is designed to allow some flex

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.009 
designed is designed to allow some flex
then<00:04:05.280> allows<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.970> bin<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.329> fall<00:04:06.569> out<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
then allows the bin to fall out of the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.640 
then allows the bin to fall out of the
back<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:08.390> learn<00:04:09.390> my<00:04:09.569> lesson<00:04:09.900> there<00:04:10.049> if<00:04:10.230> you

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
back so learn my lesson there if you

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.590 
back so learn my lesson there if you
have<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.040> machine<00:04:11.250> don't<00:04:11.670> hit<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.000> too<00:04:12.299> hard

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
have this machine don't hit it too hard

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.360 
have this machine don't hit it too hard
on<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> side<00:04:13.049> otherwise<00:04:13.560> you<00:04:13.799> will<00:04:14.010> lose<00:04:14.220> your

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
on the side otherwise you will lose your

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.909 
on the side otherwise you will lose your
dirt<00:04:14.930> another<00:04:15.930> thing<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.410> not<00:04:16.590> too

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
dirt another thing that I'm not too

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.340 
dirt another thing that I'm not too
happy<00:04:17.100> with<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:18.389> fact<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.169> two

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
happy with is the fact that it is a two

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.140 
happy with is the fact that it is a two
cyclone<00:04:20.100> system<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:20.729> there's<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.000> outer

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
cyclone system so there's this outer

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.969 
cyclone system so there's this outer
cyclone<00:04:21.870> which<00:04:22.049> goes<00:04:22.260> around<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.590> outside<00:04:22.950> of

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
cyclone which goes around the outside of

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.620 
cyclone which goes around the outside of
the<00:04:23.130> bin<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.520> one<00:04:24.210> inner<00:04:24.450> cyclone<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:26.220> means

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
the bin and one inner cyclone this means

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.000 
the bin and one inner cyclone this means
that<00:04:27.630> you<00:04:27.780> will<00:04:27.870> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.110> wash<00:04:28.440> this<00:04:28.710> filter

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
that you will have to wash this filter

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.040 
that you will have to wash this filter
about<00:04:29.550> once<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:30.030> month<00:04:30.240> if<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.510> have<00:04:30.660> average

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
about once a month if you have average

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.409 
about once a month if you have average
vacuuming<00:04:31.560> or<00:04:32.039> about<00:04:32.400> two<00:04:32.789> times<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.150> month<00:04:33.180> if

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
vacuuming or about two times a month if

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.140 
vacuuming or about two times a month if
you<00:04:33.539> have<00:04:34.039> pretty<00:04:35.039> heavy<00:04:35.370> vacuuming<00:04:35.910> if<00:04:36.060> you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
you have pretty heavy vacuuming if you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.080 
you have pretty heavy vacuuming if you
have<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.300> lot<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.510> dirt<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:38.280> not<00:04:38.520> hard<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:38.940> wash

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
have a lot of dirt it's not hard to wash

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.370 
have a lot of dirt it's not hard to wash
the<00:04:39.300> filter<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:39.870> something<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.229> have

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the filter it's just something you have

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.580 
the filter it's just something you have
to<00:04:40.410> do<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.400> not<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.940> big<00:04:42.120> problem<00:04:42.389> and<00:04:42.690> then<00:04:43.350> one

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
to do so not a big problem and then one

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.510 
to do so not a big problem and then one
last<00:04:43.770> thing<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.830> filter<00:04:46.830> down<00:04:47.010> here<00:04:47.250> well

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
last thing is the filter down here well

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.650 
last thing is the filter down here well
we're<00:04:47.729> talking<00:04:47.789> about<00:04:47.940> filters<00:04:48.330> one<00:04:48.479> last

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
we're talking about filters one last

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.290 
we're talking about filters one last
thing<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.020> what<00:04:49.139> I<00:04:49.169> meant<00:04:49.639> this<00:04:50.639> filter<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.270> not

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
thing is what I meant this filter is not

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.920 
thing is what I meant this filter is not
a<00:04:51.479> lifetime<00:04:51.810> filter<00:04:53.150> this<00:04:54.150> will<00:04:54.330> states<00:04:54.750> that

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
a lifetime filter this will states that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.510 
a lifetime filter this will states that
you<00:04:55.050> will<00:04:55.139> have<00:04:55.320> to<00:04:55.470> replace<00:04:55.830> this<00:04:56.130> filter

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
you will have to replace this filter

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.520 
you will have to replace this filter
occasionally<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.360> they<00:04:57.450> sell<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:57.900> these

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
occasionally and they sell you these

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.080 
occasionally and they sell you these
nice<00:04:58.770> little<00:04:59.010> filter

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
nice little filter

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.969 
nice little filter
nice<00:05:02.090> new<00:05:02.659> filters<00:05:03.080> unlike<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.740> lot<00:05:03.949> of

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
nice new filters unlike a lot of

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.980 
nice new filters unlike a lot of
machines<00:05:04.400> like<00:05:04.550> shark<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:04.969> Dyson<00:05:05.360> which<00:05:05.749> have

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
machines like shark and Dyson which have

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.850 
machines like shark and Dyson which have
lifetime<00:05:06.289> filters<00:05:06.889> so<00:05:07.430> if<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.960> do<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> lot<00:05:09.800> of

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
lifetime filters so if you do a lot of

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.379 
lifetime filters so if you do a lot of
vacuuming<00:05:10.340> that's<00:05:10.759> something<00:05:11.029> you<00:05:11.090> may<00:05:11.180> want

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
vacuuming that's something you may want

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.050 
vacuuming that's something you may want
to<00:05:11.419> watch<00:05:11.569> out<00:05:11.779> for<00:05:12.219> the<00:05:13.219> last<00:05:13.460> thing<00:05:13.819> that<00:05:13.849> I'm

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
to watch out for the last thing that I'm

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.450 
to watch out for the last thing that I'm
not<00:05:14.210> too<00:05:14.659> happy<00:05:14.870> with<00:05:15.199> is<00:05:15.439> the<00:05:16.069> swivel

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
not too happy with is the swivel

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.939 
not too happy with is the swivel
steering<00:05:16.819> I'm<00:05:17.449> going<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.990> pan<00:05:18.229> down<00:05:18.499> and<00:05:18.860> you

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
steering I'm going to pan down and you

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.909 
steering I'm going to pan down and you
could<00:05:19.129> take<00:05:19.279> a<00:05:19.310> look<00:05:19.490> at<00:05:19.639> just<00:05:19.789> how<00:05:19.939> I<00:05:20.919> don't

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
could take a look at just how I don't

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.339 
could take a look at just how I don't
wanna<00:05:22.039> say<00:05:22.219> well<00:05:22.689> let's<00:05:23.689> just<00:05:23.870> take<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.050> look<00:05:24.259> at

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
wanna say well let's just take a look at

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.489 
wanna say well let's just take a look at
how<00:05:24.439> well<00:05:24.680> it's<00:05:25.189> swivel<00:05:25.699> steers<00:05:26.029> the<00:05:26.870> answer

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:27.499 
how well it's swivel steers the answer

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:30.119 
how well it's swivel steers the answer
is<00:05:27.560> not<00:05:27.710> very<00:05:28.009> well<00:05:28.249> but<00:05:28.490> let's<00:05:29.150> take<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.360> look

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
is not very well but let's take a look

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:52.410 
is not very well but let's take a look
so<00:05:31.129> I'm<00:05:31.279> going<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.610> turn<00:05:31.939> on<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.240> machine

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.850 

so<00:05:53.420> if<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.630> noticed<00:05:53.990> on<00:05:54.080> that<00:05:54.140> last<00:05:54.440> time<00:05:54.830> I

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
so if you noticed on that last time I

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.800 
so if you noticed on that last time I
tried<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.370> go<00:05:55.640> a<00:05:55.670> little<00:05:55.880> bit<00:05:56.180> further<00:05:56.450> than<00:05:56.690> it

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
tried to go a little bit further than it

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.080 
tried to go a little bit further than it
would<00:05:56.930> let<00:05:57.080> me<00:05:57.260> and<00:05:57.670> instead<00:05:58.670> of<00:05:58.730> being

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
would let me and instead of being

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.750 
would let me and instead of being
flushed<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.500> carpet<00:06:00.950> it<00:06:01.130> started<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.520> lift

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
flushed to the carpet it started to lift

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.170 
flushed to the carpet it started to lift
up<00:06:01.940> on<00:06:02.090> one<00:06:02.300> side<00:06:02.600> so<00:06:03.200> if<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:04.520> are<00:06:04.610> looking<00:06:04.790> for

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
up on one side so if you are looking for

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.660 
up on one side so if you are looking for
a<00:06:05.210> machine<00:06:05.420> to<00:06:05.810> match<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.380> dyson<00:06:06.860> ball<00:06:07.070> level

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
a machine to match the dyson ball level

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.810 
a machine to match the dyson ball level
of<00:06:07.960> swivel<00:06:08.960> enos<00:06:09.230> this<00:06:09.890> is<00:06:10.040> not<00:06:10.220> your<00:06:10.460> machine

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
of swivel enos this is not your machine

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.920 
of swivel enos this is not your machine
and<00:06:12.190> then<00:06:13.190> finally<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:14.030> last<00:06:14.270> thing<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:14.720> I

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
and then finally the last thing that I

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.050 
and then finally the last thing that I
do<00:06:15.020> not<00:06:15.320> like<00:06:15.500> about<00:06:15.560> this<00:06:15.920> machine<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.610> don't

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
do not like about this machine and don't

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.030 
do not like about this machine and don't
give<00:06:17.210> me<00:06:17.240> progress<00:06:17.450> is<00:06:17.690> a<00:06:17.750> great<00:06:17.990> machine<00:06:18.170> so

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
give me progress is a great machine so

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.220 
give me progress is a great machine so
these<00:06:19.790> are<00:06:20.000> just<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.240> things<00:06:20.420> that<00:06:20.600> I<00:06:20.630> found<00:06:20.930> I

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
these are just the things that I found I

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.600 
these are just the things that I found I
don't<00:06:21.470> like<00:06:21.650> compared<00:06:22.010> to<00:06:22.100> other<00:06:22.220> machines

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
don't like compared to other machines

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.310
