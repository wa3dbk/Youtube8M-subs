00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
life of our patients and the patients

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.089 
life of our patients and the patients

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
that have vision loss they have to learn

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.469 
that have vision loss they have to learn
to<00:01:48.159> move<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.490> little<00:01:48.609> more<00:01:48.729> slowly<00:01:48.999> they<00:01:49.329> know

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
to move a little more slowly they know

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.480 
to move a little more slowly they know
they<00:01:49.630> may<00:01:49.749> bump<00:01:49.929> into<00:01:50.079> things<00:01:50.409> I'm<00:01:51.099> in<00:01:51.399> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
they may bump into things I'm in the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.429 
they may bump into things I'm in the
middle<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.880> designing<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.749> whole<00:01:52.929> line<00:01:53.139> for

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
middle of designing a whole line for

middle of designing a whole line for
blind<00:01:53.679> dogs<00:01:53.919> I<00:01:54.219> had<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.639> little<00:01:54.789> angel<00:01:55.240> wings

for<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.139> small<00:01:56.380> dogs<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.919> then<00:01:57.039> for<00:01:57.189> the

00:01:57.269 --> 00:01:57.279 
for the small dogs and then for the

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.099 
for the small dogs and then for the
bigger<00:01:57.459> dogs<00:01:57.789> I<00:01:58.209> need<00:01:58.419> to<00:01:58.509> make<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.779> stronger

for them for the impact so I came up

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.879 
for them for the impact so I came up
with<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.899> idea<00:02:02.169> of<00:02:02.229> having<00:02:02.499> them<00:02:02.619> look<00:02:02.799> like
