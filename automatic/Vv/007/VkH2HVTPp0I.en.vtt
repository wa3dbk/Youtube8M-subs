00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
scientists have been studying her
rigorously<00:01:54.600> they<00:01:55.200> found<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.680> lot<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> cool

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
rigorously they found a lot of cool

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.679 
rigorously they found a lot of cool
things<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> main<00:01:57.240> things<00:01:57.509> they

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
things and one of the main things they

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.420 
things and one of the main things they
found<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.649> could<00:01:58.680> tell<00:01:59.009> her<00:01:59.189> age

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
found was that they could tell her age

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.850 
found was that they could tell her age
by<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.909> Rings<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860

bones<00:02:01.130> much<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.090> way<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.240> would<00:02:02.420> tell<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
bones much the way you would tell the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.870

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
age of a tree they found out that su is

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.120 
age of a tree they found out that su is
28<00:02:05.450> years<00:02:05.600> old<00:02:05.870> when<00:02:06.050> she<00:02:06.080> died<00:02:06.380> now<00:02:06.980> I<00:02:07.010> know

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
28 years old when she died now I know

Museum<00:03:05.900> using<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.910> field<00:03:08.150> museum<00:03:08.269> had

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
Museum using it so the field museum had

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.160 
Museum using it so the field museum had
a<00:03:08.810> contest<00:03:09.230> with<00:03:09.470> Chicago<00:03:09.920> schools<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.489> they

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
a contest with Chicago schools and they

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.479 
a contest with Chicago schools and they
