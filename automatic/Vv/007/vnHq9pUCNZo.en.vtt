in fractions like this the longer the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
exposure is the more light you're going

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060

to<00:01:32.399> let<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.030> also<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.869> shaky<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to let in but also the shaky or the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.529

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
you're not careful so down here you

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.130 
you're not careful so down here you
better<00:01:38.280> use<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.550> tripod<00:01:38.910> if<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.600> sixth<00:01:40.080> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
better use a tripod if it's one sixth of

a<00:01:40.259> second<00:01:40.649> now<00:01:41.280> you'll<00:01:41.640> notice<00:01:41.910> that<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
a second now you'll notice that the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.190 
a second now you'll notice that the
exposure<00:01:44.250> meter<00:01:44.670> stays<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.869> zero

that's<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.070> as<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> turn<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.940> style<00:01:48.240> and

that's because as I turn the style and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.930 
that's because as I turn the style and
change<00:01:48.690> my<00:01:49.020> time<00:01:49.350> value<00:01:49.800> or<00:01:50.070> shutter<00:01:50.520> speed

want to hit the shutter button halfway

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.910 
want to hit the shutter button halfway
down<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.790> watch<00:02:48.290> what<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:49.470> different

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
down and watch what your different

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.100 
down and watch what your different
f-stop<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.610> when<00:02:51.030> you're<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.540> shutter

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
f-stop is when you're in shutter

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.449 
f-stop is when you're in shutter
priority<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:53.190> value<00:02:53.400> mode

now<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.700> neat<00:02:55.030> thing<00:02:55.269> about<00:02:55.299> this<00:02:55.689> camera<00:02:56.019> is

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
now the neat thing about this camera is

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.890 
now the neat thing about this camera is
that<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.489> reverse<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.299> whole<00:02:58.540> process

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that you can reverse this whole process

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.009 
that you can reverse this whole process
and<00:02:59.500> decide<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.519> want<00:03:00.790> my<00:03:00.939> aperture<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:01.900> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
and decide I want my aperture to be the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.440 
and decide I want my aperture to be the
priority<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.129> want<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.579> take<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.849> portrait

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
priority so if I want to take a portrait

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.479 
priority so if I want to take a portrait
and<00:03:04.599> have<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.930> background<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.620> way<00:03:06.159> out<00:03:06.340> of

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
and have the background be way out of

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.589 
and have the background be way out of
focus<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:07.060> would<00:03:07.450> turn<00:03:07.659> my<00:03:07.870> top<00:03:08.140> dial<00:03:08.470> here<00:03:09.599> to

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
focus I would turn my top dial here to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.949 
focus I would turn my top dial here to
AV<00:03:11.170> mode<00:03:11.409> aperture<00:03:12.340> priority<00:03:12.579> now<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.720> dial

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
AV mode aperture priority now I can dial

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.440 
AV mode aperture priority now I can dial
that<00:03:14.200> aperture<00:03:15.359> all<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.750> way<00:03:16.870> up<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:18.269> 22<00:03:19.269> or

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
that aperture all the way up to 22 or

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.500 
that aperture all the way up to 22 or
above<00:03:19.900> which<00:03:20.859> is<00:03:21.010> going<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.220> give<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.609> so<00:03:22.329> much

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
above which is going to give you so much

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.030 
above which is going to give you so much
stuff<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:22.989> focus<00:03:23.379> which<00:03:23.530> is<00:03:23.560> great<00:03:23.859> for

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
stuff in focus which is great for

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.789 
stuff in focus which is great for
landscaping<00:03:24.579> or<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.269> could<00:03:25.629> dial<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.049> down<00:03:27.000> to

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
landscaping or I could dial it down to

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.619 
landscaping or I could dial it down to
5.6<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.950> this<00:03:30.099> case<00:03:30.340> which<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.209> going<00:03:31.359> to<00:03:31.420> be

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
5.6 in this case which is going to be

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.240 
5.6 in this case which is going to be
more<00:03:31.930> apt<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.319> put<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> background<00:03:32.859> out<00:03:33.190> of

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
more apt to put the background out of

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.759 
more apt to put the background out of
focus<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:34.420> want<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:35.109> what<00:03:35.379> my<00:03:35.500> shutter

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
focus if I want to see what my shutter

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.339 
focus if I want to see what my shutter
speed<00:03:35.859> is<00:03:36.250> while<00:03:36.700> I'm<00:03:36.970> doing<00:03:37.389> my<00:03:37.420> f-stop<00:03:38.079> I

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
speed is while I'm doing my f-stop I

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.509 
speed is while I'm doing my f-stop I
simply<00:03:39.069> hold<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.519> button<00:03:39.730> down<00:03:39.879> halfway<00:03:40.659> and

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
simply hold this button down halfway and

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.360 
simply hold this button down halfway and
I<00:03:42.519> don't<00:03:42.970> even<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.450> hold<00:03:43.629> it<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.889> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
I don't even have to hold it all the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.039 
I don't even have to hold it all the
time<00:03:45.549> I<00:03:45.579> just<00:03:45.730> have<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.150> push<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.510> for<00:03:46.689> a<00:03:46.720> half<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
time I just have to push it for a half a

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.500 
time I just have to push it for a half a
second<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.500> you'll<00:03:48.189> notice<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.909> dial<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.359> my

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
second and you'll notice as I dial in my

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.289 
second and you'll notice as I dial in my
different<00:03:49.810> F<00:03:49.989> stops<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:51.099> camera<00:03:51.639> chooses<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
different F stops the camera chooses the

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.210 
different F stops the camera chooses the
shutter<00:03:52.629> speed<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.200> would<00:03:53.349> be<00:03:53.560> appropriate

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
shutter speed that would be appropriate

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.270 
shutter speed that would be appropriate
so<00:03:54.879> it's<00:03:55.180> going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.540> say<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> want<00:03:56.280> everything

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
so it's going to say I want everything

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.949 
so it's going to say I want everything
in<00:03:57.489> focus<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:58.030> want<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.239> do<00:03:58.329> landscape<00:03:58.810> I'll

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
in focus I want to do landscape I'll

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.439 
in focus I want to do landscape I'll
just<00:03:59.109> dial<00:03:59.349> it<00:03:59.500> up<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.739> F<00:03:59.859> 25<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.060> tells<00:04:01.269> me

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
just dial it up to F 25 and it tells me

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.210 
just dial it up to F 25 and it tells me
that<00:04:01.750> it's<00:04:02.260> going<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.440> be<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:02.709> sixth<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.099> a

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
that it's going to be one sixth of a

that it's going to be one sixth of a
second<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:04.870> disappeared<00:04:05.470> because<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:05.889> to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
second it disappeared because I have to

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.740 
second it disappeared because I have to
hold<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.370> shutter<00:04:06.579> button<00:04:06.910> down<00:04:06.940> again<00:04:07.329> but
