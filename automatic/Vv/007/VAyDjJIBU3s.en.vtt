were<00:03:22.140> introduced<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.130> s4<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:24.239> also<00:03:24.570> uses

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
were introduced on the s4 it also uses

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.540 
were introduced on the s4 it also uses
the<00:03:25.140> hand<00:03:25.410> gesture<00:03:25.709> features<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.340> just

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
the hand gesture features you can just

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.160 
the hand gesture features you can just
wave<00:03:26.730> your<00:03:26.910> hand<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.270> change<00:03:27.570> pictures<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
wave your hand to change pictures you

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.540 
wave your hand to change pictures you
can<00:03:28.320> wave<00:03:28.500> your<00:03:28.530> hand<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.070> pick<00:03:29.220> up<00:03:29.340> calls

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
can wave your hand to pick up calls

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.420 
can wave your hand to pick up calls
etcetera<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.989> hand<00:03:31.260> gesture<00:03:31.680> are<00:03:31.890> also<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
etcetera so the hand gesture are also a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.060 
etcetera so the hand gesture are also a
welcome<00:03:32.820> step<00:03:33.510> there<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> slight

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
welcome step there is a slight

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.740

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
would not say it is very significant

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.160 
would not say it is very significant
considering<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.209> slimness<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> device

it is fairly good at 3200 milliampere

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.260 
it is fairly good at 3200 milliampere
our<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.860> hope<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.459> will<00:03:44.610> also<00:03:44.670> deliver
