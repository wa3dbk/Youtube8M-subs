all about my experience in California

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.180 
all about my experience in California
back<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.400> 1990<00:03:10.120> 91<00:03:10.720> 92<00:03:11.170> when<00:03:11.829> everything

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
back in 1990 91 92 when everything

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.009 
back in 1990 91 92 when everything
crashed<00:03:12.459> from<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:12.940> lost<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.299> 17<00:03:13.750> million

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
crashed from and I lost a 17 million

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.199 
crashed from and I lost a 17 million
dollar<00:03:14.170> business<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:15.340> trashed<00:03:15.670> my<00:03:15.849> credit

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
dollar business that trashed my credit

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.879 
dollar business that trashed my credit
and<00:03:16.389> I<00:03:16.540> had<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.870> learn<00:03:16.989> how<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.230> do<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.680> with

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
and I had to learn how to do this with

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.789 
and I had to learn how to do this with
no<00:03:18.040> money<00:03:18.280> with<00:03:18.849> no<00:03:19.060> credit<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.630> that's<00:03:20.560> where

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
no money with no credit and that's where

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.979 
no money with no credit and that's where
all<00:03:20.920> these<00:03:21.069> techniques<00:03:21.489> came<00:03:21.880> from<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.329> I

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
all these techniques came from and I

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.289 
all these techniques came from and I
built<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.410> them<00:03:23.560> over<00:03:23.799> the<00:03:23.920> years<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.730> create

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
built on them over the years to create

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.030 
built on them over the years to create
the<00:03:25.480> program<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.049> I've<00:03:26.170> created<00:03:26.349> today<00:03:26.680> and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
the program that I've created today and

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.089 
the program that I've created today and
to<00:03:27.160> build<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.790> portfolio<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:28.720> come<00:03:28.900> back

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
to build the portfolio and to come back

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.490 
to build the portfolio and to come back
and<00:03:30.099> be<00:03:30.669> stronger<00:03:30.970> than<00:03:31.209> before<00:03:31.389> so<00:03:32.380> hopefully

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
and be stronger than before so hopefully

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.400 
and be stronger than before so hopefully
that<00:03:32.799> helps<00:03:32.829> thanks

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.470
