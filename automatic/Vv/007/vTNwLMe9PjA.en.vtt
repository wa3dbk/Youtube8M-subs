00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.860 
probably gonna do some of this I guess
I'm<00:02:01.920> pretty<00:02:02.160> much<00:02:02.190> just<00:02:02.640> gauging<00:02:03.000> how<00:02:03.540> much

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
I'm pretty much just gauging how much

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.140 
I'm pretty much just gauging how much
weight<00:02:04.140> could<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.500> comfortable<00:02:05.010> for<00:02:05.160> me<00:02:05.190> so<00:02:06.120> i

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
weight could be comfortable for me so i

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.040 
weight could be comfortable for me so i
would<00:02:06.420> say<00:02:06.660> around<00:02:06.810> 3<00:02:07.590> 15<00:02:07.770> 4<00:02:08.460> 5<00:02:08.850> by<00:02:09.060> 5<00:02:09.330> should

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
would say around 3 15 4 5 by 5 should

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
would say around 3 15 4 5 by 5 should
suffice<00:02:10.350> for<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:12.150> i<00:02:12.210> definitely<00:02:12.870> felt<00:02:13.290> my

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
suffice for now but i definitely felt my

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.750 
suffice for now but i definitely felt my
grip<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:15.540> course<00:02:16.370> hamstrings<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.580> goes
