 fabio duarte very good morning and as he has 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.000
 past yesterday's stage and a little more 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.730
 quiet here and more serene more restful 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 yes profe bueno yesterday was a stage 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.710
 complicated for all runners 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.100
 because good as always in the turn 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.590
 from the first stage I did not leave yesterday 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.380
 it was very slippery and good there was a 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.600
 quite hard fall at the end but 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.690
 thank God we were well located and not 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.730
 We suffer no accident but follow the 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.790
 return and if you follow part of the race 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.320
 yes yes yes we are there good we get 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.660
 stand up that was the important thing and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.640
 well then we passed all that 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.960
 they were down and we started to come back 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.270
 with my team with quintero with duke 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.240
 with chalapud with swamp with all and 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 good at the end 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.220
 we managed to cut back a bit and it will be good 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.150

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.520

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.300

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.070

 day I'm improving every day better 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.979
 sensations 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.200

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.780
 on the descent but still a lot 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.750
