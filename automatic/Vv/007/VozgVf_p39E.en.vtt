this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.879> coagulant<00:00:51.750> I'm<00:00:52.320> gonna<00:00:52.469> post<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
this is a coagulant I'm gonna post a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
this is a coagulant I'm gonna post a
link<00:00:52.980> below<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> smaller

link below this is one of the smaller

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
link below this is one of the smaller
pouches<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.309> offer<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.120> hard<00:00:57.270> to

because they actually sever the femoral

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
because they actually sever the femoral
artery<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> pig<00:01:07.470> let<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> bleed<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.580> they

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
pour this stuff in there and it clots up

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.020 
pour this stuff in there and it clots up
nicely<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:13.770> pretty<00:01:13.979> cool<00:01:14.159> stuff<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.790> I'm

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
gonna get a bigger pouch of this and

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.630 
gonna get a bigger pouch of this and
then<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.549> should<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.450> good<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> go<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.640> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
then I should be good to go on that so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.179 
then I should be good to go on that so
additionally<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.509> got<00:01:21.900> some<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> these<00:01:22.439> newer

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
additionally I got some of these newer

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.450 
additionally I got some of these newer
emergency<00:01:23.960> trauma<00:01:24.960> dressings<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.920> six<00:01:26.189> inch

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
emergency trauma dressings the six inch

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.179 
emergency trauma dressings the six inch
and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.880> think<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.450> four<00:01:27.840> inch<00:01:28.189> these

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and I think this was the four inch these

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.950 
and I think this was the four inch these
are<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> lot<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> Israeli<00:01:30.299> bandages<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
are a lot like the Israeli bandages with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.429 
are a lot like the Israeli bandages with
the<00:01:31.079> exception<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.570> pressure<00:01:33.960> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the exception of the little pressure I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
the exception of the little pressure I
forget<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> Israeli<00:01:35.790> bandage<00:01:36.180> calls<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
forget what the Israeli bandage calls it

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.090 
forget what the Israeli bandage calls it
but<00:01:36.810> there's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> pressure

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
but there's a there's like a pressure

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
but there's a there's like a pressure
hook<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:39.119> fish<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.630> through

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
hook that you you fish it back through

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
hook that you you fish it back through
and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.710> put<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> torque<00:01:41.220> down<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and you can put the torque down on it I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.109 
and you can put the torque down on it I
don't<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.320> has<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.610> I'm

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
don't think this one has it so I'm

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.370 
don't think this one has it so I'm
probably<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.420> grab<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> few<00:01:45.840> Israeli

how<00:02:19.050> Sam<00:02:19.349> splints<00:02:19.830> work<00:02:19.980> also<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.569> have<00:02:21.780> a

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
how Sam splints work also so they have a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.820 
how Sam splints work also so they have a
metal<00:02:22.560> core<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:24.200> they<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.530> get<00:02:25.650> their

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
metal core and they really get their

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.170 
metal core and they really get their
strength<00:02:26.069> when<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.430> bend<00:02:26.790> them<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
strength when you bend them in that

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.820 
strength when you bend them in that
fashion<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:28.019> see<00:02:28.230> here<00:02:28.440> there's<00:02:28.650> two

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
fashion so you can see here there's two

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.040 
fashion so you can see here there's two
of<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.430> 2-pack<00:02:29.880> there's<00:02:30.660> 36

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
inches long they come with this black

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.240 
inches long they come with this black
wrap<00:02:32.910> also<00:02:33.390> but<00:02:34.080> when<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> bend<00:02:34.800> them<00:02:35.010> in

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
wrap also but when you bend them in

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.660

these types of shapes and then wrap them
they<00:02:39.360> really<00:02:39.840> gain<00:02:40.049> their<00:02:40.260> rigidity<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:41.819> can

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
they really gain their rigidity you can

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.789 
they really gain their rigidity you can
bend<00:02:42.209> them<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.510> tip<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:43.170> all<00:02:43.350> day<00:02:43.560> long

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.830 
bend them this tip this way all day long
but<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.430> soon<00:02:44.610> as<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.819> kind<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:45.239> an<00:02:45.330> arc<00:02:45.540> in

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
but as soon as you kind of put an arc in

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530 
but as soon as you kind of put an arc in
them<00:02:46.010> they<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.459> really<00:02:47.580> rigid<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:48.480> I'm

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
them they get really really rigid so I'm

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.330 
them they get really really rigid so I'm
gonna<00:02:48.690> post<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.989> link<00:02:49.140> below<00:02:49.319> check<00:02:49.650> these<00:02:50.190> out
