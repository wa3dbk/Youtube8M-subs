00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello today on our review 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 starring 65 which was released on 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.710
 factory road 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 and magazine series tractors number five 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.410
 from ashot or aj et tractor collection 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.300
 pretty big look here 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.029
 For example, if you compare from the same series 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.430
 with tracked tractors for example with d t 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.859
 54 look here what's the size 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.610
 here now let's compare them in front here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.660
 look even here a seat on the Stalinists 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.260
 went to the roof level to t-54 that is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.180
 was very powerful and huge tractor here 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.219
 of course 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 d t 54 a little bit even less mts-50 but 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.480
 yet if you compare the tracks 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 tractors that is, it is higher 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.500
 We will be much, but there was more power 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 for example to something d 54 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 well let's go to the model itself 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:07.890
 the first thing I want to say is that the tractor 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.310
 Stalinite is very similar to the tractor 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.040
 caterpillar which was made in the us then 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.869
 there they are almost indistinguishable and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.890
 externally and on technical characteristics 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.200
 they are almost the same that is the same 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 tractors were only released there in the us 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 it's to russia 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 well and let's go to the model model 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 I was very pleased with the first thing that I 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.509
 I want to say this is the engine because 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.200
 what the engine here did open here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.360
 for example in the magazine was drawn that is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.329
 with a lid with such here that is 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.420
 would it be closed and the engine but on 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.970
 models they performed it in the open 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 as it gives more realism 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.040
 eat and models have and pleased 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.100
 but also let's move on to the inspection 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.280
 to the first models I want to notice 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.570
 this tinted grille looks very much 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.390
 believable and attached more 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.790
 realistic model 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.909
 also we can see what decals 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.130
 The inscription Stalinist is made here and not 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.480
 also diesel inscription but here too 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.160
 the side of the Stalinist made decal inscription 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.709
 then out of the six ready acts above 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.459
 there are plans and also painted red 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.530
 color inscription chtz that is the plant 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.340
 tractor well and the parts department here 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.810
 made and headlights and also we can see 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.340
 what is done and plastic will be 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.820
 here are the headlights 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.730
 Well, the lights themselves made transparent that is 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.940
 separately and they are not just painted 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.550
 silverfish is good pipe do or 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.950
 details here can see the filter do 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.920
 or did a new also we can see 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.370
 what is done very well engine and 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.709
 I am just a diode and hoses all 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.050
 painted in black that is made 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.170
 very high quality not even very visible 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.950
 there are small bolts and everything else 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.810
 great everything is well done not yet here 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:14.959
 fan made on caterpillar 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.390
 made of rubber and all of course 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.480
 will become interesting is spinning on or not 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:25.489
 by a procession they will demonstrate it here 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.190
 spinning goes he look here but by 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.670
 the blackboard here is not bad anymore but here's 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.420
 so here I will try to hand it by the way 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.269
 caterpillars here here or left and 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.510
 the right not to separate the turns 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.360
 there is not together if for example you know 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.269
 there and you have to twist and it turns too 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.690
 that is, here they are individually smaller 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.320
 performed very well here we can 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.340
 see that there is such a hook for 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.280
 clues there any devices and everything 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.010
 the rest 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.489
 here 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.590
 but here on this side too 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.930
 engine you even look here 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.230
 department also made a filter 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.019
 there is which is already connected here you can 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.199
 say and to the engine here and how 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.310
 did so that's what he comes out of here then 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:26.370
 have done everything well but it is separate 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.850
 that is, six filters from the very here 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.169
 here by the way what else do I want to say 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:37.590
 model made of plastic and iron 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.840
 that is, in front of this one along with the seat 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:45.870
 with everything else made of iron 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.600
 these are the wings there and the wheels themselves 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.470
 which move the tracks all 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.570
 the rest is made of plastic do not let 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.449
 let's look behind the model now 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.490
 The model’s rear lights are also made 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.830
 separate by part then tow 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.680
 the device is made very well 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.720
 look exactly even this one 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.990
 can say such a bolt which 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.530
 secures the trailer is done that is all 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.289
 done well pleased me but 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.169
 let's move on to the driver’s 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:25.260
 place 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:28.680

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.560
 look you can even play with there 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.710
 touch them and so on by the way they 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.680
 I will tell you very even not fragile 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.990
 men chatting there sometime 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.620
 here here are the pedals we can see made 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.500
 and even look at the sensors are made 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.440
 ice potassium that is not just not there 0 by 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.949

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:08.220
 I was pleased and you are here even we can 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.780
 see from there sensors go wires then 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:16.330
 there is done everything is well authentic 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:19.389
 I was pleased here well and in general I 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.550
 I want to say I managed the model very much 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:25.990
 liked it done very much 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.360
 qualitatively without jambs and engines 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.970
 pleased made very believable and 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.760
 driver's seat and looks very 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:37.090
 good tractor that is similar to the original 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.200
 I will do everything very well everyone thanks for
