 I only work from 40,000 restaurants in San Domenico, 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:19.230
 feel the reason why you are defined a bit 'one of the fathers of modern cuisine 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 Italian 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.429
 in your opinion 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.589
 battery for 40 years we're here 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:29.189
 2 because restaurant san domenico in the 70s was the first restaurant in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.679
 Italy 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.950
 to give the image and wanted the Italian restaurant was not seen 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.820
 like the trattoria like the page once

 a bit of Romagna cuisine - 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.270
 diet 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.170
 lamborhini beware restaurant has wanted ok you did a restaurant 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.170
 with a device no less than the French 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.660
 with Italian materials topolino with Italian silverware with all that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 it could be the best to pass 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.860
 guest 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.730
 2 hours of happiness 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.240

 as related to later in america has known for mandolin guitars 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.560
 at the restaurant you can always tell from outside that you sing and dance 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 instead after French restaurant it turns out with the tuxedo and the lady with the col 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.730
 seen along 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.650
 things fortunately there are choices 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 nin Italians as they have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 they were ready for this 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.670
 note this again 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.490
 alitalia a must see no henkel emilia romagna mind -

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.160
 overtone 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.470
 it had not started cheaply 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.460
 I presented a little 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.020
 still tricks 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 nice waiters that you needed dada to bring to the streets to 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.359

 photo 80 out of many 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.299
 It is also difficult for us to introduce this kind of philosophy 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.019
 of san domenico 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.379
 now that it started exactly in the year 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.319
 7 March 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.589
 2 1970 today is the 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:19.859
 days of March 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.299
 for jason 41 years and 3 days 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.929
 atheist made birthday the other day 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:29.249
 Italy if in which direction it is going in its identity 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.879
 as for a kitchen 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:38.959
 or it is still tremendously linked to stereotypes and some of the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.729
 trattoria tradition second after 40 years in small measure eh eh eh we say 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.869
 connected and right translation that there is some 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.939
 to those who are able to do the trattoria column of the 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.449
 with the typical digital despejada products that absolutely must not be 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:55.919
 abandoned 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.079
 there has been professional growth in the schools and the young people they have 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.380
 undertaken this work 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.829
 therefore professionalism has expanded 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.899
 we have to say thanks to one of the pillows come out of the Alps speak French 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.839
 because in the 70s 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:16.219
 for many of us I went to France to take professionalism 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.449
 because in catering, professionalism and childhood 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.729
 in Italy there was more tradition 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:26.369
 in the mountain pastures you needed the good brave waiter to put on 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.269
 for our beautiful way of knowing how to smile 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.269
 but professionalism and sewing in france 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.019
 and I could make so many names but it is not easy I surely made in France 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.019
 to learn their professionalism 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:42.189
 from the kitchen 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.469
 typical Romagna style 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.229
 magazine inna in key more 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:48.669

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.689

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.079
 sea ​​volatility in text 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.009
 any sector of childhood remains imprinted in the mind 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:18.959
 it remains imprinted in my mind with those tastes fortunately 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.219
 small professionalism I can reproduce 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.740
 and in some cases, bring the dishes - of you our dog 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.919
 I ask a provocative question r4i everything before you told me that a little name 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:37.080
 the romagnoli are there 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.210
 the Romagna cuisine recipe begins 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 months have woken up a point 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.029
 now the delay sometimes 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:46.810
 but how do you do hahaha 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.479
 break away from crawl 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.259
 tasty mosons like nitro sciuti the cheeses the pastas 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:55.639
 how is it possible 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.539
 break away 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.400
 start something new 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.789
 have a little open mind 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.939
 make sure that if there is any 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.349
 professional chef who proposes a total instead of with butter and sage 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.749
 but I propose a parmesan cream is not a scandalous slave 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:17.840
 finotti lourdes the parmesan and su have spoiled but reduced cream 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.879
 and there is no panda because it is only made with chicken olive oil 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.969
 to give a small example I can be cut into slices does not have to be 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.220
 of course always 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.580
 the flat of tagliatelle 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.360
 with the lake 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.559
 there were still other furniture above 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:36.529
 to make it Romagna cuisine 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:39.989
 as I said it did not give up envelopes rhyme with the restaurants 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.949
 casarecce that make these products prone to the professionals we see 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.870
 the image of our Italian regional cuisine 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.620
 in the world to propose 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.810
 the same tastes 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.389
 but let's say with one 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:56.739
 with appearances is a new a new special 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:58.669
 Last question 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.669
 what will be eaten in Emilia Romagna in 50 years 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.350
 box for nail polish codebò prosciutto is a volunteer discount voucher 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.659
 it is the typical rose with parmesan 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.819

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:13.199

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.020

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.480

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.430
