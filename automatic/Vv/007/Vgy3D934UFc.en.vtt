00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
difference so I don't personally think

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.540 
difference so I don't personally think
it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> difference<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.710> let's<00:00:44.460> do

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
it's a difference but you know let's do

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
it's a difference but you know let's do
a<00:00:44.610> little<00:00:44.730> test<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> we'll<00:00:45.239> find<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.720> man<00:00:45.960> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
a little test and we'll find out man so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
a little test and we'll find out man so
we'll<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.040> when<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.220> get<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.780> here

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
we'll see you when we get out there here

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.220 
we'll see you when we get out there here
we<00:00:48.870> go

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
we go

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.180 
we go
so<00:00:49.530> one<00:00:50.190> stone<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.579> lightweight<00:00:51.320> 135<00:00:52.320> I'm

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
so one stone really lightweight 135 I'm

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.729 
so one stone really lightweight 135 I'm
gonna<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> couple<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.850> reps<00:00:54.260> my<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.470> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
gonna do a couple of reps my way I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.710 
gonna do a couple of reps my way I
normally<00:00:56.040> do<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> without<00:00:56.640> locking<00:00:56.970> out<00:00:57.210> keep

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
normally do it without locking out keep

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.479 
normally do it without locking out keep
it<00:00:57.840> constant<00:00:58.140> tension<00:00:58.260> on<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.470> chest<00:00:58.710> I'll

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it constant tension on the chest I'll

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.030 
it constant tension on the chest I'll
just<00:00:59.610> say<00:00:59.730> five<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.329> I'm<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.540> do<00:01:00.600> five

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
just say five then I'm gonna do five

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.759 
just say five then I'm gonna do five
locking<00:01:02.040> out<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.510> taking<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> release<00:01:04.499> off

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
locking out and taking that release off

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.590 
locking out and taking that release off
the<00:01:04.949> chest<00:01:05.219> at<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> top<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> movie<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the chest at the top of the movie so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:33.399 
the chest at the top of the movie so
let's<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.170> see<00:01:07.289> the<00:01:07.380> difference

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.499 

but<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> did<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.860> rails<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.180> kept<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
but I did my rails my way and I kept the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
but I did my rails my way and I kept the
Constitution<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.860> felt<00:01:38.220> like

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
Constitution on there it just felt like

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.760 
Constitution on there it just felt like
more<00:01:38.580> of<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.790> smoother<00:01:39.330> movement<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:40.049> when

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
more of a smoother movement for me when

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.120 
more of a smoother movement for me when
I<00:01:40.799> went<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.190> start<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> lockout<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.890> gonna

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I went to start the lockout I'm gonna

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.050 
I went to start the lockout I'm gonna
lock<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.549> feel<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
lock you still feel it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
lock you still feel it
but<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.290> feels<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.850> taken<00:01:48.299> away

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
but it just feels like I'm taken away

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.990 
but it just feels like I'm taken away
it's<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.350> almost<00:01:49.680> making<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.220> rest

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
it's like I'm it's almost making me rest

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's like I'm it's almost making me rest
at<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> top<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> makes<00:01:52.830> it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
at the top and it kind of makes it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.010 
at the top and it kind of makes it
harder<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.580> be<00:01:53.820> honest<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.720> think

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
harder to be honest with you so I think

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.350 
harder to be honest with you so I think
that's<00:01:55.380> why<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> lot<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.740> times<00:01:55.860> what<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.250> do

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
that's why a lot of times what I do

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
that's why a lot of times what I do
heavier<00:01:57.360> weight<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.070> keep<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
heavier weight I like to keep going and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.130 
heavier weight I like to keep going and
not<00:01:59.909> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> map<00:02:00.479> because<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.690> can<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.960> more

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
not going to map because I can get more

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.920 
not going to map because I can get more
reps<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.690> man

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
reps at it that way so I don't know man

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.359 
reps at it that way so I don't know man
let's<00:02:04.170> we're<00:02:04.440> gonna<00:02:04.590> move<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.979> wait<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
let's we're gonna move up and wait and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.790 
let's we're gonna move up and wait and
then<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.179> comparison<00:02:06.659> again<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.440> see<00:02:07.649> what

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
then do a comparison again and see what

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.759 
then do a comparison again and see what
we're<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.630> good<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.110> effective<00:02:10.530> but

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
we're just as good just as effective but

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.020 
we're just as good just as effective but
I<00:02:10.800> like<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.250> difference<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:11.640> when<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.880> rest

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
I like the difference is when you rest

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
I like the difference is when you rest
at<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> top<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:13.019> me<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> rest<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> top

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
at the top for me I rest in the top

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.920 
at the top for me I rest in the top
because<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.250> allows<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> rest<00:02:15.600> between

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because it allows me to rest between

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.449 
because it allows me to rest between
sets<00:02:16.140> I'm<00:02:16.319> feeling<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.769> like<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
sets I'm feeling like I'm like the

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.070 
sets I'm feeling like I'm like the
essence<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.150> can't<00:02:18.600> go<00:02:18.720> any<00:02:18.870> more

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
essence going up can't go any more

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.160 
essence going up can't go any more
I<00:02:19.290> rest<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> top<00:02:20.450> goodbye<00:02:21.450> gather<00:02:21.720> myself

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
I rest at the top goodbye gather myself

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.660 
I rest at the top goodbye gather myself
and<00:02:22.319> come<00:02:22.440> right<00:02:22.560> back<00:02:22.620> down<00:02:22.739> keep<00:02:23.100> going<00:02:23.310> so

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
and come right back down keep going so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.830 
and come right back down keep going so
that's<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> only<00:02:24.000> difference<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.480> me<00:02:24.569> that's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that's the only difference for me that's

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.090 
that's the only difference for me that's
the<00:02:24.930> whole<00:02:25.049> reason<00:02:25.080> why<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.830> really

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
the whole reason why I like out really

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.960 
the whole reason why I like out really
key<00:02:26.760> word<00:02:27.049> pick<00:02:28.049> then<00:02:28.230> he's<00:02:29.220> saying<00:02:29.459> one<00:02:29.700> thing

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
key word pick then he's saying one thing

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.430 
key word pick then he's saying one thing
that<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.209> always<00:02:30.390> talk<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> him<00:02:31.049> about<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.350> he

that I always talk to him about it he

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.130 
that I always talk to him about it he
said<00:02:31.470> rest<00:02:32.010> at<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.400> top<00:02:32.640> when<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.630> say<00:02:33.870> that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140

said rest at the top when you say that
to<00:02:34.410> me<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:35.160> thinking<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.640> myself<00:02:35.730> dude<00:02:36.150> why

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
to me I'm thinking of myself dude why

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.850 
to me I'm thinking of myself dude why

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
would you rest on the top and you can

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740 
would you rest on the top and you can
keep<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.760> get<00:02:38.910> another<00:02:39.090> TD<00:02:39.390> three<00:02:39.510> reps

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
keep going and get another TD three reps

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600 
keep going and get another TD three reps
that's<00:02:39.989> my<00:02:40.200> concept<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.890> that's<00:02:40.980> how<00:02:41.519> I've

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
that's my concept and that's how I've

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.370 
that's my concept and that's how I've
been<00:02:41.640> bitching<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.180> years<00:02:42.480> because<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.200> lot<00:02:43.350> of

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
been bitching for years because a lot of

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080 
been bitching for years because a lot of
times<00:02:43.650> where<00:02:44.220> I'm<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> get<00:02:44.579> tired<00:02:44.850> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
times where I'm going to get tired and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.460 
times where I'm going to get tired and
then<00:02:45.209> he'll<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> lockout<00:02:46.110> at<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.290> top

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
then he'll do that lockout at the top

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.080 
then he'll do that lockout at the top
and<00:02:46.650> he'll<00:02:46.769> rest<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.280> I'm<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.940> could

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
and he'll rest and I'm like you could

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.300 
and he'll rest and I'm like you could
have<00:02:48.180> got<00:02:48.269> two<00:02:48.450> more<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.170> let's<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.130> up<00:02:50.190> on

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
have got two more so let's go up on

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.210 
have got two more so let's go up on
weight<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.609> we'll<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.880> comparison<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> see

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
weight and we'll do a comparison and see

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.240 
weight and we'll do a comparison and see
moving<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> 225<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.750> lock<00:02:54.930> out<00:02:55.140> see<00:02:56.070> how

to six on a good day doing it his way
which<00:04:52.890> was<00:04:53.040> locking<00:04:53.400> out<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:53.850> my<00:04:54.690> whole

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
which was locking out so my whole

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.630 
which was locking out so my whole
concept<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.710> think<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:56.070> can<00:04:56.160> get<00:04:56.280> more<00:04:56.430> reps

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
concept is I think you can get more reps

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.250 
concept is I think you can get more reps
if<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:56.910> do<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.210> with<00:04:57.330> constitutional<00:04:57.750> chest

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
if you do it with constitutional chest

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.320 
if you do it with constitutional chest
and<00:04:58.680> he<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:59.010> proved<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.400> so<00:04:59.670> let's<00:04:59.850> see<00:05:00.240> how
