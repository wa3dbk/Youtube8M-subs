let's say like you normally think when

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.090 
let's say like you normally think when
you<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.780> take<00:04:39.960> an<00:04:40.080> application<00:04:40.680> like<00:04:40.710> from

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
you just take an application like from

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.180 
you just take an application like from
here<00:04:42.200> like<00:04:43.200> if<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.560> just<00:04:43.710> take<00:04:43.920> an

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
application and move to trash empty 8

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.650 
application and move to trash empty 8
