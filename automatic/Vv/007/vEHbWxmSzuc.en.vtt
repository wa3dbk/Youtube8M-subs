 without seeing the ingame city 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.500
 he really has also already agreed that he 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 just 98 finishing this 96 sprints blue 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.110

 voting after the list goes through and through me 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.129
 so crossroads after all ye put it on 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.879
 bracket quiet look but this one does 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.830
 really oh my god i am term 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.430
 during the war child pipa scream and and 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.800
 unbelievably so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.420
 injustice he is sincerely the best player 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.930
 who ever used 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.760
 like holy shit if your with if you lead the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.100
 hey and he wasn't serious about fifa 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.080
 play am a tear you still everyone 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 one pieces are in-game rating as 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.030
 peak is 98 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 can you imagine that you know how 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.650
 expensive so he will always stay card 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.930
 will be more expensive so primarily he will 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 peter are they to me management 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 this peak tour is incredible 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.159
 you can't keep up with it you can't 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.409
 off the ball and he scores chocen 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.119
 hurt the goals when here can go on goal 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.170
 run off and you can put another card on the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.340
 goalkeeper 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.409
 you can just enjoy the defenders 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.130
 dribbling it is it is all 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.770
 possible 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.149
 and I am getting really energetic from the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 I think about you touch your words 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.439
 because he is so good this too 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.700
 just the keeper can do nothing he 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.770
 almost shoot him at our head 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 it is unbelievable what is possible 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.009
 Here it can also just take the ball 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.780
 a little turn i can honor in schelle 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.149
 I can't even do that here either 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.829
 so smooth on the ball 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.659
 you can take it anywhere and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.100
 he never fly off 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.600
 You will see every play app sometimes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.039
 that the wrong ball with that but 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.869
 and though it just doesn't matter 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.359
 Here also Paul is in a difficult corner 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.039
 does not take him perfectly with me 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.499
 just shoots him in and the keeper is 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.359
 still just completely hopeless and that 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.490
 is the story with him in all the games that 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.590
 played him you give and the ball you 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.850
 goes on purpose and you can pass three pairs 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.240
 and you can go straight for the keeper 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.340
 run 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.690
 you can run into the corner of your blast 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.920
 just the corner and you really have none 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.020
 problem it and it's just 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.420
 ridiculous good is here again 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.620
 through or no chance mission for everyone 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.150
 whoever can keep track of anyone 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.940
 nobody can stop me 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.790
 come all free kicks penalties none 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.530
 has them all yes i am already by aino 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.329
 you can tell when case here 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.579
 for example also reptile at a time 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.170
 pay tribute to the ball with legs and you see 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.840
 here says retirement is so 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.609
 it's nice to be 93 so it's incredible 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.959
 because he runs like the hole in 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.340
 and if he does not sprint speed though 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.750
 then it is all that positioning that makes 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 which is simply the absolute killer 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.799
 but this is just this is the best striker 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.879
 the best player you will ever be in ultimate 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.450
 team is going to have 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.530
 shot space skills he has everything as 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.599
 you can buy it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.280
 tour and enjoy your life thank you 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.900
 you enjoyed likers and watching 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.900
