00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.440
 because he always asks me how 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.660
 Exactly sees because the black version 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.880
 and maybe she is more beautiful than in 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.010
 silver I thought I'll do it 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.720
 a video with all details and show 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.490
 I exactly like it looks 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.470
 So today it's not about any 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.099
 inner values ​​but purely around the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.529
 appearance 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.419
 and that's just the beginning of a lot 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.740
 fun 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.439
 If the hair sees her from us in front of us 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.720
 of course, 1 falls on top 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.460
 aluminum then comes a lot of glass with a lot 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.480
 display and then comes in 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.640
 aluminum beams 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 what exactly is it? 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.050
 initial things the htc when is a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.330
 uni because the housing is made of aluminum 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.730
 and we only have a few small ones 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.950
 accents set by polycarbonate 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.690
 stripes are there for us to be there 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.700
 get little reception because behind it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.950
 or by that then run the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.510
 antennas somehow received us 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 to be able to guarantee for example 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.400
 with wireless or on the phone 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.680
 apart from that we find everywhere 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.020
 pure aluminum itself the buttons and 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.629
 aluminum and all in all it is one 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.790
 absolutely ingeniously processed smartphone 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.710
 but we do not just want to drum around now 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.560
 to look around saw how to go as I said 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.970
 exactly in detail and there we catch 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 once on the back of 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.900
 I tried it as much as possible 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.120
 to get rid of fingerprints with it 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.140
 we do it all in perfect 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.330
 beauty angle 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.100
 we have a microphone here for active 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.330
 noise suppression for example 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.370
 when we are in the handsfree 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.479
 calling the speakers accepted 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.370
 or record a video 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.740
 then we see the two stripes for the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.630
 Antennas and we see the camera this 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 surrounded with a silver ring and 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.320
 otherwise we only see the glass there 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.840
 the camera next to me another 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.970
 single led still short the camera 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.600
 details here my four megapixel ultra 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.310
 camera 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.010
 I have enough in the review 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.750
 or said it would have said again 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.369
 that's why we do not go for it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.799
 just want to see him what you see so 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.420
 get underneath the htc lettering 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.270
 this not imprinted but us 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 see here you see that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.830
 that is I wait and installed 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.960
 below, please give me a hint on beats 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.850
 audio fits naturally is still installed 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.459
 once a polycarbonate paint for 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.800
 reception and some labeling what who 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.840
 the two speakers are striking 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.650
 htc when once below the displays 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.959
 and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.329
 once above the displays we have 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.030
 So through series front speakers with 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.430
 Integrated amplifier and HTC names 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 all of the sound up here in the upper one 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.040
 but part of the speaker we have 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 also an earpiece for 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.870
 call and a little down here 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.760
 Notify me you do my 2.1 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.129
 megapixel front camera and light and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.530
 Proximity sensor around the display 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.060
 we find the so-called battle or 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.489
 besel that is the distance between 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.230
 display and the edge so the black 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.889
 here and you can see the edge 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.060
 not big but also smaller 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.519
 below the display we still find 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.940
 two buttons and once back and 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.190
 once the htc logo is in principle 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.720
 So a key has the function 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.090
 to be assigned a key that is 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.829
 right now but not that if 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.750
 Let's do the HTC once from the bottom 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.430
 we can see very well 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.099
 that we have a little bend 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.650
 means only in the middle it is 9.3 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.689
 millimeter thick the frame is one 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.030
 thinner because of this lies well in the 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.530
 hand or better because our hand, too 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.120
 always a bit kinky 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.430
 also we see here on the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.180
 base the micro-usb connection and 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.319
 Of course, a microphone to call 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.910
 on the right side we look 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.040
 short the seed 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.690
 because this is polished you can see 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.970
 that now is not quite straight 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.230
 but just ground down and that 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.810
 give it all over again 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.849
 a really classy look, what else do we see? 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.980
 so of course we see our loud here 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.139
 quietly we are currently on the 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.769
 otherwise we will find there on the right side 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.750
 Nothing 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.209
 It's really hard to show though 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.069
 the loudly soft cube is really very 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.260
 tightly installed in the housing 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.970
 she does not really stand out 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.400
 It may be a millimeter 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.229
 but you can still feel it because it is 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.940
 out a bit and the edges 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.620
 be filled accordingly 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.389
 We can start on the left world 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.069
 again on the bottom there 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.989
 we do not do anything until we go upstairs and 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.720
 here we find the sled for the 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.729
 Simply click here to download a micro sim card 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.139
 with the leaf supplied tool then 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.130
 the sled comes out and we can 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.410
 here ours 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.200
 a lie as I said make sure that 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.990
 you have a micro sim card we have come 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.360
 to the top and deep with the 3.5 mm 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.520
 jack connection for put and the one 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.560
 off power button the same time too 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.750
 the infrared transmitter also represents 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.940
 this one stands out a bit and has 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.130
 a really good pressure point i can 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.710
 just stress that htc when 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.780
 is an absolute jewel 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.330
 it looks good in silver if 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.740
 you ask me is the black one that 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.260
 black vision but again one 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.130
 neat sled nice absolutely 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.630
 great part 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.460
 yes I hope I could get you now 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.770
 say a little something could show you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.630
 Okay, that's what the black version looks like 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.580
 as I said a really chic sting 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.840
 So if you're thinking about black or 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.400
 silver and the silver version 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.960
 probably already knows because she is in 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.030
 every media market and others 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.860
 electroniketten rumliegt now know 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.690
 you look like the black version yes 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.010
 that was mine, thank you for 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.010
 your time is good
