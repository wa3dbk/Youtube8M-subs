00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.809
 on TV it is going to be different already very specific 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.630
 Running form here combined forward and backward 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.659
 here the fast stop and started while keeping the body 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.549
 Control with upright trained and good balance 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 Here pendant lamp are completed in sideways running 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.910
 this player turns his back on topological and fast 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.840
 to be able to run such superfluous movements as possible 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.800
 be avoided 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.750
 run with raised arms to coordinatively demanding 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.010
 At the same time, the typical arm work for the handball game is added 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 trained with short quick direction changes 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.920
 make sure that even when changing direction or when 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.730
 Running sideways a tactician prints about the footballers 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.050
 instead of having to encircle with them, they now have to go with directionless robes 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.350
 to be admired that requires even more effort 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.230
 here the ground must be touched on the hat with both hands 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.799
 all running form presented here 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.899
 can be integrated into the squadrons and sprint competitions such 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.040
 Performance comparisons are particularly motivating and Wichern thereby for 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 the speed training necessary maximum is crying out cold 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.180
 because if the squadrons will slow the specific down 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.449
 Direction changes trained 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.309
 In addition, such forms of organization are particularly close to 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.309
 if little space is available 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.199
 Perfect 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.290
 here the same form of competition 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.460
 however, the players are running against each other, which adds extra 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.540
 Requirements for the perception this form is already very hand with 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.379
 specific 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 Dallas gives them offense called Engelken is trained 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.849
 The Slalom Sprenz will be challenged today's direction changes here 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.849
 also completed the slalom track time itself 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.069
 all three North Germans 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.069
 b 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.039
 here the slalom track is completed in fast forward run 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.259
 while the hats have to urge as much as possible to run 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.569
 these players are at the direction changes the 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.309
 Body emphasis too much off that costs strength and pays 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.119
 Now the slalom course is completed in the forward and reverse run 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:05.179
 this player runs a little way too far he would have to 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.969
 Turn backwards more strongly from the two and not press 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.969
 look back 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.669
 now it will run faster in another rhythm 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.669
 Ladies time themselves between the hat 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:27.150
 Get the trophy 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 normally 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.149
 Again, the players should the British as tight and time-saving 

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.639
 circulate
