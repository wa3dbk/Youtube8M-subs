00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
also have a universal tool now these are

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090 
also have a universal tool now these are
the<00:00:32.070> universal<00:00:32.309> tools<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.500> had<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> problem

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the universal tools now I had a problem

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.819 
the universal tools now I had a problem
with<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> universal<00:00:36.120> tools<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
with the universal tools and this is the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.209 
with the universal tools and this is the
reason<00:00:38.219> why<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.620> universal<00:00:40.620> tool<00:00:40.800> gives<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
reason why the universal tool gives a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.790 
reason why the universal tool gives a
person<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.579> problem<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.870> these<00:00:43.020> tools<00:00:43.290> fit

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
person a problem you see these tools fit

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.850 
person a problem you see these tools fit
in<00:00:44.300> between<00:00:46.250> these<00:00:47.250> two<00:00:47.640> sprockets<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:49.559> keep

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
in between these two sprockets to keep

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.389 
in between these two sprockets to keep
them<00:00:50.129> sprockets<00:00:51.350> from<00:00:52.350> turning<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.160> keeps

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
them sprockets from turning it keeps

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.060 
them sprockets from turning it keeps
them<00:00:53.579> secure<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> belts<00:00:55.710> removed

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
them secure so when the belts removed

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.569 
them secure so when the belts removed
they<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:57.180> turn<00:00:57.680> because<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:59.100> cannot

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
they do not turn because they cannot

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.270 
they do not turn because they cannot
turn<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.149> they<00:01:00.930> will<00:01:01.230> turn<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:02.129> they're

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
turn and they will turn because they're

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.479 
turn and they will turn because they're

and the same as on this side the timing

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
and the same as on this side the timing
cover<00:01:31.130> screws<00:01:32.130> go<00:01:32.820> into<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.509> that's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
cover screws go into that and that's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
cover screws go into that and that's
what<00:01:33.869> holds<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.369> timing<00:01:35.790> cover<00:01:35.939> itself

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
what holds on the timing cover itself

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.740 
what holds on the timing cover itself
now<00:01:37.520> those<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> way<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.450> these

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
now those are in the way of these

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.109 
now those are in the way of these
Universal<00:01:40.380> tools<00:01:41.150> they<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> way<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
Universal tools they go in the way of it

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.270 
Universal tools they go in the way of it
so<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> does<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.630> allow<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.740> place<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.189> in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so it does not allow you to place it in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.359 
so it does not allow you to place it in
between<00:01:47.310> them<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.799> done<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
between them so what I have done and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
between them so what I have done and
what<00:01:50.399> works<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.329> good<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.409> take<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> piece<00:01:52.920> of

what works just good you take a piece of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.030 
what works just good you take a piece of
pipe<00:01:53.399> short<00:01:53.939> piece<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.180> pipe<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.619> slide

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
wheels so they do not move before you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.750 
wheels so they do not move before you
remove<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:59.090> timer<00:02:59.299> though<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.920> do<00:03:01.190> not<00:03:01.370> want
