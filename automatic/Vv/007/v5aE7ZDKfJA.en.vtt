us both both of our Castle cars it's a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.050 
us both both of our Castle cars it's a
little<00:03:36.439> bit<00:03:36.530> easier<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:36.890> do<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.700> when<00:03:37.879> it's

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060

the same sponsor but I believe Cruz I
believe<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.640> fix<00:03:40.849> was<00:03:40.939> in<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.239> fact<00:03:41.420> that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
believe the fix was in the fact that

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.449
