00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.469
 good youtube friend 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:15.280
 today I come with a tutorial on how 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.360
 make a virtual hard disk 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.789
 windows 7 and windows others able to 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.700
 cappa can also be approved in xp or 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:29.100
 in another system but never in windows 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
 well what we're going to do is go to 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.700
 run 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 let's execute and write this disc 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:52.760
 mgm of points ms sc 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.760
 once this is written, they accept 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 as you see, this window appears 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.509
 they will wait a little until they are up 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.490
 to load the disk drives that 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:11.500
 have good as you see these are the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.260
 hard drives that I have 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.420
 these two are the hard drives 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.060
 local people who were already with 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.980
 computer 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.310
 and this is a hard drive to act 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.050
 and that I think what we're going to do to 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.320
 create a new hard drive 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:36.700
 is to go to action and create bhd 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:41.979
 good me in this window in location 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.420
 that they give to examine and we are going to look for the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.120
 location where you want to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.760
 save the virtual choir file 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.659
 they give him the name they want, I'm going to 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.170
 put discs 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.170
 and 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.390
 they carry in save 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.549
 winter and it will be embroidered caloric 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.200
 and then take out an elegy of the size 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.530
 of the virtual hard disk can be in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.260
 megas swollen or in tigabea they 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.870
 Hate bytes are already happening to the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.360
 Michigan 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 and passing the thousand megs longer stays that way 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.489
 that I am going to choose gb 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.290
 and here we put the amount of gigabytes 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.740
 the earth is transmitted byte 64 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.430
 but that I'm going to put a 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.430
 good 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.960
 this is what this is, we're going to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.500
 change to bh x 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.920
 so 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.940
 as it says here so that it admits the maximum 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:59.420
 of 64 why 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.960
 because if I do not know if you put this option 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:07.290
 no more than 2 mb you do not go or you will not be able to 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.920
 create a virtual hard drive and then you 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.920
 we give to accept 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.230
 how she 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.450
 I have already done this 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.430
 here in this list below is going to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.110
 appear the disk and with an icon 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.280
 he told me 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.819
 light blue 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.819
 Y 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.250
 or that is the disc that we 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.250
 we create new 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:44.100
 well here where the disc says 7 we do 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:47.570
 right click initialize disk 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.570
 this is given to accept 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.370
 and they are starting in 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.110
 the created file that we keep in the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.230
 starting folder 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.920
 well there it is already mounted 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.580
 they click back but in this part 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.730
 not back from disk 7 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.060
 the details and we put new volume 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.810
 simple 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.810
 and the next 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:23.300
 and the next one too and well here 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:26.690
 we choose the name of the unit 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.409
 in the letter I'm going to choose 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.409
 mobility 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.700
 we give you next to format this 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.830
 volume with the following configuration 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.240
 of the system ntfs files do not change it 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.050
 expand 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.180
 they leave it ntfs and here they put labels 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.990
 crowd in the name of the volume I 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.260
 I'm going to put 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.260
 the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.960
 sales isco 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.840
 and you always give everything the nation leaves 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.280
 and after that, the 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.030
 euro details of what we 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.880
 we did when setting the placido the 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.199
 virtual hard disk volume and the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.199
 final now they give you to finalize 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.770
 As you can see, it takes a little 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.509
 good to me it seems to me so you can 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.050
 do not look like it but if you show up they give you 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.050
 canceled 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.170
 good 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:37.170
 as you see, the disc is already created 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.510
 good 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.510
 Y 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.970
 and good 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:53.170
 and we can not go fixing anymore 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.170
 team and we already have is that this is this 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:59.440
 virtual disk is the one that we create you're going to 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:04.080
 see that it has 0.99 gigabytes or is a 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.080
 gigabyte with a thousand gigs 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.120
 this can be used for any type 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.790
 can not be put in a file 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.310
 HDD 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.850
 and well I still do not know any so 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.640
 It can 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.890
 same when you start the pc is not going to 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.900
 continue to follow the hard disks that 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:28.770
 believe the virtual ones will continue to be 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.990
 there so do not worry and if you want 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:37.050
 Continue creating or deleting a hard drive 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:42.169
 virtual you right click and delete 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:48.340
 volume while that 's how to eliminate 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:51.850
 so good as they have already finished 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:55.090
 so good I'm leaving 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:58.919
 I am primal and I send a greeting to you 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.919
 please subscribe is very commented
