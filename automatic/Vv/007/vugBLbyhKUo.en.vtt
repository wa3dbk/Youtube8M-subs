your water there's two general types
there's<00:00:38.020> purification<00:00:39.010> and<00:00:39.220> there's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
there's purification and there's

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.270 
there's purification and there's
filtration<00:00:40.420> now<00:00:40.899> as<00:00:41.079> far<00:00:41.260> as<00:00:41.320> purification

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
filtration now as far as purification

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.709 
filtration now as far as purification
you're<00:00:42.789> going<00:00:42.910> to<00:00:42.969> look<00:00:43.120> at<00:00:43.210> your<00:00:43.300> classic

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
you're going to look at your classic

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.540 
you're going to look at your classic
iodine<00:00:44.140> tablets<00:00:44.379> or<00:00:44.769> other<00:00:44.890> tablets<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.489> can

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
iodine tablets or other tablets that can

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.490 
iodine tablets or other tablets that can
treat<00:00:45.850> water<00:00:46.120> you<00:00:46.329> just<00:00:46.390> drop<00:00:46.719> in<00:00:46.930> there<00:00:47.170> and

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
treat water you just drop in there and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.650 
treat water you just drop in there and
there's<00:00:47.769> also<00:00:48.010> other<00:00:48.399> options<00:00:48.850> like<00:00:49.090> these<00:00:49.210> UV

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
there's also other options like these UV

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.740 
there's also other options like these UV
systems<00:00:50.170> like<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.379> SteriPEN<00:00:50.980> these<00:00:51.789> UV<00:00:52.239> systems

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
systems like a SteriPEN these UV systems

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.990 
systems like a SteriPEN these UV systems
are<00:00:52.899> extremely<00:00:53.170> lightweight<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.339> really<00:00:54.699> non

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
are extremely lightweight and really non

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.810 
are extremely lightweight and really non
bulky<00:00:55.600> another<00:00:56.170> huge<00:00:56.649> advantage<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.489> UV

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
bulky another huge advantage to the UV

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.930 
bulky another huge advantage to the UV
systems<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.510> they<00:00:58.960> kill<00:00:59.199> viruses<00:00:59.469> filters<00:01:00.460> it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
systems is they kill viruses filters it

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.400 
systems is they kill viruses filters it
will<00:01:01.059> not<00:01:01.179> filter<00:01:01.570> out<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.839> viruses<00:01:02.260> because

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
will not filter out the viruses because

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.160 
will not filter out the viruses because
they're<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.280> small<00:01:03.609> you<00:01:04.150> need<00:01:04.300> a<00:01:04.330> UV<00:01:04.570> system

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
they're so so small you need a UV system

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.010 
they're so so small you need a UV system
or<00:01:05.410> something<00:01:06.310> like<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.670> tablet<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.570> kill<00:01:07.810> those

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
or something like a tablet to kill those

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.060 
or something like a tablet to kill those
viruses<00:01:08.530> when<00:01:08.740> you're<00:01:08.860> out<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:08.980> the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
viruses when you're out in the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.250 
viruses when you're out in the
backcountry<00:01:09.450> keep<00:01:10.450> in<00:01:10.570> mind<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:10.960> if<00:01:11.080> there's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
backcountry keep in mind that if there's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.200 
backcountry keep in mind that if there's
good<00:01:11.530> clean<00:01:12.100> running<00:01:12.430> water<00:01:12.550> like<00:01:12.970> we<00:01:13.090> had

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
good clean running water like we had

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.120 
good clean running water like we had
today<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.630> UV<00:01:13.960> or<00:01:14.110> iodine<00:01:14.440> system<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.800> great

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
today the UV or iodine system is great

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.830 
today the UV or iodine system is great
but<00:01:15.640> if<00:01:15.790> you're<00:01:15.910> running<00:01:16.030> really<00:01:16.660> nasty

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
but if you're running really nasty

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.290 
but if you're running really nasty
stagnant<00:01:17.740> pools<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.220> dirty<00:01:18.460> water<00:01:18.730> you're

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
stagnant pools and dirty water you're

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.840 
stagnant pools and dirty water you're
gonna<00:01:19.450> want<00:01:19.690> to<00:01:19.750> lean<00:01:19.900> towards<00:01:20.200> filtering

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
gonna want to lean towards filtering

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.040 
gonna want to lean towards filtering
when<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.970> comes<00:01:22.120> to<00:01:22.240> filtration<00:01:22.840> there's<00:01:22.990> a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
when it comes to filtration there's a

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.960 
when it comes to filtration there's a
lot<00:01:23.350> of<00:01:23.530> different<00:01:23.800> options<00:01:23.950> like<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.670> Sawyer
