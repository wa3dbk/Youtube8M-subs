00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 our facility has become the task 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.430
 done that we adult the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.750
 Possibility to offer the high school diploma 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.300
 catch up 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 the latest version was at least 18 years old 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.150
 are old and a closed one 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 We have the vocational training 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.420
 same frames the same 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.310
 curricula like other high schools also and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.230
 Consequently, we are exactly the same 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 high school diploma in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.580
 sachsen-anhalt yes also involved so that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.359
 the people who succeed with us 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 to lock 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.619
 also everywhere in Germany probably 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:38.520
 Europe-wide studies can do what they need 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:40.440
 Nevertheless, high school want to be for adults 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 the chance again right 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.129
 durchzustarten 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 whether studying better job or im 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 progress 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.600
 for many it is the occasion more 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 to make of your life 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.480
 student of the second educational path he has 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 yes these two ingredients are collegiate and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.770
 evening high school the evening high school students 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.149
 have a full working day and catch 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.129
 to 17:30 at 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.720
 and so if you have a lot of questions 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.689
 So writing is also possible on a regular basis 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.549
 until 22 o'clock a day is different 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 These students are not going anybody 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.380
 occupational activity full-time 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 but you can do the collegiate 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.640
 This is called day education 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 8 o'clock 7 30 to 15 o'clock 45 received 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.189
 Parent independent bafÃ¶g that applies for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.790
 the law students not so I could me 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.909
 Imagine if HR leaders in the lead 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 read that somebody next to you 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.759
 his actual occupation evening itself 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 then it has been tormented by and that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.570
 as successful as that, too 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.400
 someone is the one you can trust the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.799
 has to know and then of course 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.420
 even company can move something and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.500
 do not run dry right away 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.360
 every one of them here again the school bench 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 presses with the conclusion 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.690
 different goal 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.270
 also the reasons why the high school graduation is not 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.080
 that was done on the normal way 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.850
 different 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 Personally, it was like that for me 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 my education did then 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.350
 moved to dresden even if 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.119
 lived in a flat but in the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.770
 Run the two years I lived there 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.940
 I had to realize that the job was me 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.670
 the country has me right for me 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.130
 it was so that I mean 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.420
 graduated and me 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.459
 actually my high school right after that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.600
 But I wanted to attach by one 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.600
 do not argue with my mother 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.700
 was allowed to do but only one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.950
 had to do training at home 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.560
 not to be thrown out complained 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.720
 special students open up neat 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.220
 crashes then also what I have 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.090
 my statements with awards for 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.459
 the tenth grade 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.080
 but I had such a political way 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.819
 a little bit of problems and a little bit 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.190
 trouble and that's why you have me there too 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.319
 did not want to study and then wanted 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.510
 I am unemployed and have no 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.100
 get more job so look where 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 Of course you can continue your education there 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.799
 I'll stop sometime after 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.440
 a little bit of internet research quickly 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.769
 the second educational path encountered and in 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.750
 ask friends and now I am 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.180
 here 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 Third, teaching is finished 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.590
 adult adult one 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.829
 special learning climate that both 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.079
 had to get used to pages there was really 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.609
 that is grown-up with each other already 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.440
 different and every day is already 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.209
 worked in his life and knows that 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.590
 a teacher from his job makes a lot 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.629
 strong together 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.670
 and practically no against a man 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.379
 meets at eye level so 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.200
 there are absolutely any victories 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.849
 not that it falls 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.620
 grown-up is relaxed and the teachers 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.170
 have adjusted to that the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.849
 Students are adult than the new one 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.799
 signs they used to work with 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.599
 Although there are times from time to time 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.459
 friction also some teacher between 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.620
 but students and teachers say that belongs 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.870
 adult people are the life for that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.569
 is not always nice 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.810
 from old to new not only your future 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.970
 take the students themselves in the hand 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.480
 the action we design our school 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.849
 that school principal planning and as we do that 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.049
 then it started then that was on 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.920
 bit wrong with the planning because we 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.239
 do not have enough material for everyone and 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.470
 then the students are on their own 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.629
 again went off and have the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.480
 We really have worried all the students 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.850
 over three days four days the whole room 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.950
 deleted and have ourselves here 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.090
 nicely done if you have something for yourself 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.830
 they create with their own hands to 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.690
 I also notice that somewhere you feel yes 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.610
 I really listen to that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.289
 I'll give you a little bit of what you might do 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.930
 go to school and come home 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:37.770
 and that's it and there's a week ahead 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.139
 sacrifice a bit she was not 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.919
 big problem and generally 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:47.490
 you identify yourself quite strong 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.510
 For three years school has no problem 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.700
 After all, you are already 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.010
 packed but many underestimate the 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.620
 high requirements and above all the 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.289
 temporal and financial factor of 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.139
 the 100 percent we are here at the beginning 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.419
 We welcome you in a big house 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.490
 maybe cut about 50 percent so 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.650
 Half of that can be a bit more 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.310
 as eleventh time a little less than that 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.950
 be half 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.940
 to reach the high school one is now 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.860
 also show 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.240
 it must count as success that he 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.669
 university of applied sciences from the sommerfrische 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.050
 two-thirds of this fade in 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.580
 quotation marks come through 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.289
 that the pupils realize that is 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.270
 but a huge burden is what 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.240
 you definitely have to stress at the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.129
 is it what is it? 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.259
 Time factor is playing a role over 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.860
 These three years really 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.090
 perseverance that the students at 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.400
 have to lay the day 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.259
 and that, in our opinion, is the 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.419
 It's really tough after three 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.919
 to create years to the Abitur creates one 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.419
 it aside from working time when you look at yourself 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.979
 that's really three years anton I mean 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.240
 each of us had somewhere before 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.680
 the time has said 'now pictures 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.789
 not now he can not live there anymore 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.990
 you just have to white because you have to 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.430
 By team you actually too 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.139
 So as I said I do not want 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.729
 when i sit my performance at first 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.939
 devices come you can do it too 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.300
 and then an investment in the future 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:02.319
 but also a second chance at cost 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.879
 the taxpayer 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.860
 so you must not forget it 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.349
 highest education which it in 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.560
 to reach the Federal Republic and 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.479
 I can achieve this highest degree 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.849
 just like that at other schools 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:17.500
 to be forgiven with one must 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.150
 from a human point of view, of course 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.069
 Students who arrive with us also the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.779
 opportunities may be times 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.330
 missed it or did not reach it 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:27.729
 make up I can also think that it 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.710
 in our present situation and 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.379
 time is that you actually 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.029
 must learn constantly you talk yet 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.440
 nowadays from the shortage of skilled workers 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.969
 and how should I turn it off when I am 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.120
 adult people do not continue 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:42.659
 Pictures only from the youth does not come 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.800
 Now I think a lot of potential what 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:46.569
 the state but also the economy 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.550
 maybe even get lost if it does 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.279
 do not give this second educational path 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.259
 the school of the second educational path 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.900
 hard plaster without question 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.580
 but what do three years if 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.449
 So you lay the foundation for one 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.449
 sunny future 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.300
 So for me what the best chance 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.879
 to rebuild everything the life 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.860
 to redesign myself again 

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.629
 I want to make something out of my life and 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.500
 who plans that school 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:14.090
 every case the right one 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.000
 I also go much more relaxed to the 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.990
 At that time, that was the problem 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 maybe even as a teenager 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.430
 impression you have to gotta do it you have to and 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.409
 Now I tell myself I want that from me 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.580
 it is definitely better than anything 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:27.620
 to put on TV 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.319
 You learn what you want to get up to 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.759
 does not rust 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.849
 I noticed the first months 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.500
 again no crumbling it is already nice 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:38.629
 Another three years you open again 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.000
 but the hump has the leading though 

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:43.810
 him also have a goal and this 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.810
 the aim is to study
