00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
started with some rope I got one of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.580 
started with some rope I got one of
those<00:00:39.899> hard<00:00:40.199> floats<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.890> won't<00:00:41.129> collapse

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
those hard floats that won't collapse

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.310 
those hard floats that won't collapse
runs<00:00:43.590> down<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.010> rope<00:00:44.449> tied<00:00:45.449> it<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
runs down the rope tied it on to a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.479 
runs down the rope tied it on to a
bungee<00:00:46.829> cord<00:00:46.859> a<00:00:48.289> little<00:00:49.289> more<00:00:49.440> rope<00:00:49.679> and<00:00:49.949> then

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
bungee cord a little more rope and then

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.270 
bungee cord a little more rope and then
I<00:00:50.760> went<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.570> home<00:00:52.019> depot<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I went to home depot and I got a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.959 
I went to home depot and I got a
three-eighths<00:00:53.789> inch<00:00:54.739> three<00:00:55.739> foot<00:00:55.949> long<00:00:55.980> stick

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
three-eighths inch three foot long stick

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.959 
three-eighths inch three foot long stick
of<00:00:57.149> solid<00:00:57.510> aluminum<00:00:58.100> just<00:00:59.100> aluminum<00:00:59.489> rod<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
of solid aluminum just aluminum rod and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.139 
of solid aluminum just aluminum rod and
it's<00:01:00.420> where<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.070> all<00:01:02.070> thread<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.940> things

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
it's where the all thread and things

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.290 
it's where the all thread and things
like<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.629> kept<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.309> made<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> little

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
like that are kept so I made a little

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.730 
like that are kept so I made a little
loop<00:01:06.480> and<00:01:06.690> closed<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> enough<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.710> I

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
loop and closed it enough that when I

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.840 
loop and closed it enough that when I
tie<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.550> rope<00:01:08.730> it<00:01:09.150> can't<00:01:09.420> come<00:01:09.510> out

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
tie on with the rope it can't come out

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.900 
tie on with the rope it can't come out
and<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> other<00:01:12.240> end<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:14.160> can<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.490> my<00:01:14.640> hand

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
and on the other end you can see my hand

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.700 
and on the other end you can see my hand
for<00:01:15.090> comparison<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.840> big<00:01:16.050> enough<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
for comparison it's big enough that the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.060 
for comparison it's big enough that the
leg<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.940> Rizzo<00:01:18.500> if<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:22.070> we

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
leg of the Rizzo if I go up here and we

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.420 
leg of the Rizzo if I go up here and we
clip<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.060> clip<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:25.220> then<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
clip on I can clip on and then when I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
clip on I can clip on and then when I
want<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.850> back<00:01:27.030> off<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.780> push<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
want to get it back off I can push it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
want to get it back off I can push it
and<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> will<00:01:28.560> come<00:01:28.710> off<00:01:28.880> but<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and it will come off but it as it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.260 
and it will come off but it as it
dangles<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.490> won't<00:01:32.700> come<00:01:32.880> off<00:01:32.940> by<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
dangles there it won't come off by the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.000 
dangles there it won't come off by the
other<00:01:33.480> thing<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.960> forgot<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.410> explain<00:01:34.560> is

cut<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.440> basically<00:02:04.940> in<00:02:06.110> half<00:02:07.110> coming<00:02:07.470> around

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
cut it basically in half coming around

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.800 
cut it basically in half coming around
so<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.519> it<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:08.910> flex<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.790> allows<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so that it can flex and it allows it it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750 
so that it can flex and it allows it it
doesn't<00:02:13.410> want<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.650> flex<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.100> very<00:02:14.340> much<00:02:14.580> that's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
doesn't want to flex in very much that's

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.180 
doesn't want to flex in very much that's
where<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> push<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.390> on<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
where I push it on to the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.150 
where I push it on to the
but<00:02:17.190> then<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.490> pull<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.819> back<00:02:18.000> off<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:19.160> put

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
but then when I pull it back off I put

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
but then when I pull it back off I put
that<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.489> V<00:02:20.730> cut<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:22.050> can

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
that little V cut in it so that it can

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.320 
that little V cut in it so that it can
it<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.800> open<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.459> I<00:02:23.489> can<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.730> back<00:02:23.880> off<00:02:24.120> of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
it can open up and I can get back off of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 
it can open up and I can get back off of
the<00:02:24.420> rig<00:02:24.690> leg<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.500> easily<00:02:25.770> it's<00:02:26.160> simple<00:02:26.610> it

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the rig leg pretty easily it's simple it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.160 
the rig leg pretty easily it's simple it
doesn't<00:02:27.209> weigh<00:02:27.390> anything<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:29.670> costs<00:02:30.170> 10

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
doesn't weigh anything and it costs 10

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
doesn't weigh anything and it costs 10
bucks<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.620> put<00:02:31.770> together<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.790> not<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.940> big

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
bucks to put together so it's not a big

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.870 
bucks to put together so it's not a big
loss<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.600> doesn't<00:02:33.870> work<00:02:33.989> but<00:02:34.260> hopefully

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
loss if it doesn't work but hopefully

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.070 
loss if it doesn't work but hopefully
this<00:02:35.880> will<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.120> pretty<00:02:36.239> easy<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> end

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
this will be pretty easy and on the end

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.910 
this will be pretty easy and on the end
of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> rope<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.970> end<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.390> rope<00:02:39.920> I'm

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
of the rope on the end of this rope I'm

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.820 
of the rope on the end of this rope I'm
going<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.130> put<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.690> carabiner<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.650> clip

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
going to put a carabiner so I can clip

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.640 
going to put a carabiner so I can clip
it<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.250> off<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.550> my<00:02:44.700> anchor<00:02:45.120> trolley<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it on and off of my anchor trolley and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.050 
it on and off of my anchor trolley and
we'll<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.769> set<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.250> hopefully<00:02:47.430> hopefully

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
we'll be set so hopefully hopefully

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.059 
we'll be set so hopefully hopefully
you'll<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.450> seeing<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.019> some<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> rig

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you'll be seeing that on some of the rig

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.989 
you'll be seeing that on some of the rig
trips<00:02:50.280> coming<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.610> pretty<00:02:50.760> soon<00:02:50.880> see<00:02:51.840> ya
