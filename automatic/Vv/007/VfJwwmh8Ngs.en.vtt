00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
a Christmas tree since I already had

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.049 
a Christmas tree since I already had
mine<00:00:50.980> right<00:00:51.160> on<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.460> Christmas<00:00:51.850> tree<00:00:52.030> I

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
mine right on the Christmas tree I

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.579 
mine right on the Christmas tree I
thought<00:00:52.329> I'd<00:00:52.420> do<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> quick<00:00:52.839> video<00:00:52.989> and<00:00:53.350> explain

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
thought I'd do a quick video and explain

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.229 
thought I'd do a quick video and explain
how<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.309> did<00:00:54.760> this

okay<00:01:13.120> so<00:01:13.180> what<00:01:13.510> it<00:01:13.630> did<00:01:13.870> was<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.170> took<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:14.710> car

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
okay so what it did was I took this car

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.390 
okay so what it did was I took this car
here<00:01:15.460> which<00:01:16.030> is<00:01:16.180> basically<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:17.020> same<00:01:17.260> as<00:01:17.400> this

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
here which is basically the same as this

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.870 
here which is basically the same as this
car<00:01:18.700> here<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.320> for<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.100> wheels<00:01:21.310> are<00:01:21.640> trucks

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
car here and for the wheels are trucks

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.510 
car here and for the wheels are trucks
wise<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.810> base<00:01:22.990> just<00:01:23.320> comes<00:01:23.619> off<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.100> like<00:01:24.250> so

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
wise the base just comes off it like so

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.350 
wise the base just comes off it like so
we<00:01:25.479> have<00:01:25.720> a<00:01:25.750> bottom<00:01:26.590> base<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:28.030> then

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
we have a bottom base like that and then

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.070 
we have a bottom base like that and then
I<00:01:28.600> drill<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.050> hole<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.100> center<00:01:30.460> here

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
I drill the hole in the center here

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.170 
I drill the hole in the center here
because<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.890> reason<00:01:33.220> on<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.570> motor<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
because of this reason on the motor on

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.149 
because of this reason on the motor on
the<00:01:37.360> top<00:01:37.600> there's<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.990> peg<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.560> peg<00:01:38.740> has<00:01:38.950> to

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
the top there's a peg and the peg has to

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.219 
the top there's a peg and the peg has to
walk<00:01:39.369> and<00:01:39.610> sit<00:01:39.790> in<00:01:39.909> you<00:01:40.509> can<00:01:40.690> build<00:01:40.900> up<00:01:41.080> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
walk and sit in you can build up the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.730 
walk and sit in you can build up the
motor<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.560> suppose<00:01:42.009> so<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.670> would<00:01:42.880> sit<00:01:43.470> sit<00:01:44.470> below

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
motor I suppose so I would sit sit below

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.770 
motor I suppose so I would sit sit below
without<00:01:45.009> sit<00:01:45.280> higher<00:01:45.460> but<00:01:45.729> this<00:01:45.910> fits<00:01:46.210> up<00:01:46.420> into

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
without sit higher but this fits up into

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.770 
without sit higher but this fits up into
the<00:01:46.869> well<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.340> sits<00:01:48.759> up<00:01:48.910> into<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.330> like<00:01:49.509> that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
the well and sits up into that like that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.859 
the well and sits up into that like that
that's<00:01:50.050> our<00:01:50.170> 9<00:01:50.380> volt<00:01:50.649> motor<00:01:50.830> that's<00:01:51.610> how<00:01:51.820> I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that's our 9 volt motor that's how I

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.639 
that's our 9 volt motor that's how I
motorized<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:54.100> Toy<00:01:54.460> Story<00:01:54.789> train<00:01:55.500> for<00:01:56.500> 9

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
motorized the Toy Story train for 9

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.560 
motorized the Toy Story train for 9
volts<00:01:57.009> just<00:01:57.580> basically<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.330> train

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
volts just basically with the train

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.870 
volts just basically with the train
novel<00:01:59.080> train<00:01:59.350> motor<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.890> I<00:02:00.160> just<00:02:00.369> put<00:02:00.700> on<00:02:00.789> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
novel train motor and I just put on the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.249 
novel train motor and I just put on the
bottom<00:02:01.060> there<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:03.310> became<00:02:03.640> our<00:02:03.820> motor

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
bottom there and that became our motor

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.460 
bottom there and that became our motor
rather<00:02:05.259> than<00:02:05.500> actually<00:02:05.800> putting<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.190> in<00:02:06.729> the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
rather than actually putting it in the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.160 
rather than actually putting it in the
engine<00:02:08.470> itself<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:10.539> talking<00:02:10.869> about<00:02:10.899> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
engine itself so talking about the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.310 
engine itself so talking about the
engine<00:02:11.440> itself<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:14.680> had<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:16.140> convert<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
engine itself we had to convert the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.160 
engine itself we had to convert the
front<00:02:17.560> wheels<00:02:17.769> to<00:02:17.980> modify<00:02:18.370> them<00:02:18.579> a<00:02:18.610> little<00:02:18.910> bit

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
front wheels to modify them a little bit

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.880 
front wheels to modify them a little bit
basically<00:02:20.920> because<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.380> blue<00:02:23.560> pin

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
basically because there's a blue pin

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.979 
basically because there's a blue pin
that<00:02:24.579> comes<00:02:24.700> up<00:02:24.970> through<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> bottom<00:02:25.450> here<00:02:25.810> in

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
that comes up through the bottom here in

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.990 
that comes up through the bottom here in
the<00:02:26.110> front<00:02:26.320> trucks<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:29.620> was

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the front trucks right there and it was

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.240 
the front trucks right there and it was
sitting<00:02:31.000> up<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> boiler<00:02:31.810> up<00:02:31.959> here<00:02:32.350> 1.2<00:02:33.160> up

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
sitting up in the boiler up here 1.2 up

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.940 
sitting up in the boiler up here 1.2 up
in<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.430> front<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> black<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:35.560> was<00:02:35.709> really

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
in the front and the black it was really

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.789 
in the front and the black it was really
too<00:02:36.130> tight<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.630> we<00:02:37.720> had<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> make<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:38.230> looser<00:02:38.560> so

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
too tight so we had to make it looser so

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.550 
too tight so we had to make it looser so
well<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.640> had<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.150> was<00:02:40.420> build<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.350> bottom

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
well I had to do was build the bottom

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.900 
well I had to do was build the bottom
out<00:02:41.950> here<00:02:42.420> with<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.720> plate<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
out here with a little plate and I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.490 
out here with a little plate and I
called<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.239> bank<00:02:46.390> plates<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.989> just<00:02:47.170> sits<00:02:47.380> up

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
called the bank plates that just sits up

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.210 
called the bank plates that just sits up
above<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.060> had<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.410> cross<00:02:50.410> beam<00:02:50.739> here<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:53.220> some

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
above and had a cross beam here and some

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.240 
above and had a cross beam here and some
other<00:02:55.680> reinforcement<00:02:56.680> bricks<00:02:56.920> underneath

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
other reinforcement bricks underneath

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.330

tactical a technic theme with the holes
and<00:03:05.079> that<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.590> use<00:03:05.709> one<00:03:05.980> number<00:03:06.760> one<00:03:06.940> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
and that I just use one number one and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.259 
and that I just use one number one and
drill<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.390> hole<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.810> bottom<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:08.350> here

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
drill the hole in the bottom of it here

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.870 
drill the hole in the bottom of it here
for<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.600> pin<00:03:11.190> because<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.400> pin<00:03:12.549> has<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> be

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
for the pin because the pin has to be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.380 
for the pin because the pin has to be
relatively<00:03:13.299> loose<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.720> turn<00:03:14.640> like<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.150> has

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
relatively loose to turn like so it has

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.569 
relatively loose to turn like so it has
to<00:03:16.540> pivot<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:17.859> sitting<00:03:18.190> up<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.459> this

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579

it<00:03:24.090> doesn't<00:03:24.450> give<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.959> well<00:03:25.560> because<00:03:25.980> it's

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
it doesn't give it to well because it's

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.949 
it doesn't give it to well because it's
it's<00:03:26.430> sitting<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.909> in<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.300> it's<00:03:27.450> tight<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:27.900> we

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
it's sitting up in and it's tight so we

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.430 
it's sitting up in and it's tight so we
have<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.230> make<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.500> freely<00:03:29.840> freely<00:03:30.840> pivot<00:03:31.349> in

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
have to make it freely freely pivot in

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.930 
have to make it freely freely pivot in
order<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.010> turning<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.700> track

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
order to make the turning of the track

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970 
order to make the turning of the track
that<00:03:33.239> was<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.840> problem<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.200> were<00:03:34.290> having<00:03:34.680> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
that was the problem we were having it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.149 
that was the problem we were having it
was<00:03:35.159> coming<00:03:35.670> off<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.970> track<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.950> that's<00:03:37.950> how<00:03:38.129> I

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
was coming off the track so that's how I

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:46.400 
was coming off the track so that's how I
I<00:03:38.549> did<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.730> turns<00:03:45.510> on<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
I did that and now it turns on the

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.789 
I did that and now it turns on the
radius<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.040> track<00:03:47.280> quite<00:03:47.549> nicely<00:03:48.799> no

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
radius of the track quite nicely no

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.380 
radius of the track quite nicely no
problems<00:03:52.370> let<00:03:53.370> me<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.670> look<00:03:53.760> at<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.150> back

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
problems let me just look at that back

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.280

functions<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:32.970> believe<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.539> motor<00:04:33.720> may<00:04:34.139> be

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
functions and I believe the motor may be

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.159 
functions and I believe the motor may be
similar<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.479> but<00:04:36.780> it's<00:04:36.870> not<00:04:36.990> only

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
similar to this but it's not only

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.409 
similar to this but it's not only
involved<00:04:37.470> its<00:04:37.620> power<00:04:37.830> functions<00:04:38.419> this

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419

then what what would happen it should

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.559 
then what what would happen it should
work<00:04:51.400> because<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.610> runs<00:04:52.819> off<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.120> nyvold

problems<00:05:31.159> and<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:32.630> just<00:05:33.080> have<00:05:33.259> it<00:05:33.289> in<00:05:33.470> the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
problems and I just have it in the

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.760 
problems and I just have it in the
tender<00:05:34.250> of<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.580> Emerald<00:05:34.970> night<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:35.590> which<00:05:36.590> is
