00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hey hello everyone alexei basinger with you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.770
 today we look at the stair step or 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.599
 jump stack in this type of strike 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 the main thing is to move correctly and 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.570
 count the moment of the step itself and so 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.430
 mechanics how do st step on 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.619
 at first glance everything is simple 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.529
 jump over the enemy unfold 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.380
 180 degrees though as you can see turning 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 90 degrees will be quite enough and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.500
 we hit but not everything is so easy your flight 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.489
 the target must be the head of the opponent 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.649
 they back 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.500
 if you aim at your back then 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.840
 successfully lose the moment of strike advise 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 download the walkway map and practice 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 in jumping the corner of the turn and finding the right 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.110
 hitbox and in our case back however 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.539
 training practice is completely different 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.629
 things can actually be more difficult 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.719
 and the enemy is much smarter than the bot therefore 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's look at the game moments and 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.780
 analyze them 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 let's go out of invisibility ringing and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.430
 we give the impression that we are very 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.799
 afraid of the physician make him believe in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.229
 what we are really running away and not 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 going to fight so cool 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.220
 the stairs will be enough to jump 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.650
 up and the enemy himself will abut your 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 heel mechanics of the game does not allow 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.080
 climb further if on your head 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.670
 someone worth it greatly simplifies the task 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.369
 with a slight movement of the hand we eliminate 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.229
 adversary and deal with the end on this 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.270
 example clearly shows one of the important 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.700
 spy criteria movement 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.619
 fast motion you should be able to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.759
 move and think two times faster than 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.380
 your opponent 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.360
 but the topic is already touched 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.000
 psychology about which we talk 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.259
 a bit later 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.360
 I have very few moments therefore 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.180
 I will try to put all to the maximum 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 information in a little box and so 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.600
 again the stairs and again the style i'm afraid 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 you dude 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 but it's a little different in this case 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.840
 jump set was performed exclusively 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.570
 for ponta 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.009
 in order to check your inner 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 prudence okay 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.540
 the first thing we notice is that yes mom 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.849
 is behind us 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.890
 this can be understood from the motion path 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.200
 which is set right on 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.530
 and swinging the sword in the hope of somehow 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.620
 get us further we like we run away 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.910
 the stairs up but there is a sudden 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.860
 stop and jump back 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.890
 while directing the camera as much as possible 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.290
 down and controlling the moment of impact as 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.420
 see smoke perfectly fit under our 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 knife and got it in the back 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.150
 and here is another interesting point i 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.070
 notice a bunch of medic for soldiers go out 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.770
 from invisibility with the expectation that 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.470
 the exit moment I will be at the back of the medic 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.810
 but then a sudden merrick happens 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 misses the rise and falls 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.100
 it was important to work quickly here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.680
 further actions of the doctor let's 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.270
 Consider options 1 Medic 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.030
 turns in our direction and 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.370
 calculates us 2 merrick runs backs on 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.200
 us and rises back to the hill and we 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.480
 successfully killed in the back 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.790
 however, there is already a high probability that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.360
 on the way up he will turn back like 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.730
 treat anyone and he will see us but still 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.310
 number one medic worked 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.430
 turned in our direction and found 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.950
 us until the fall of the medic was unexpected but 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.080
 do not immediately get lost about 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.239
 we expect that the doctor will not be able to us 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.760
 reach at that moment when we go in 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.290
 slide and climb it then 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.200
 expect the time for which he 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.299
 run up to our back but accuracy is here 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.120
 not necessarily in our case I just 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.900
 jumped and he caught up with me 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.330
 knife in the back 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.450
 The next moment is very interesting because 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.000
 there are two types of steppes in it 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.170
 great by the way map for training yes 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.840
 and the bot is not needed 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.820
 I was noticed demoman and pen light 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.580
 keystrokes tracy mas in different 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.650
 the parties thereby not letting yourself be hit 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.840
 then go away from the crowd and 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.239
 we start to deal with them one by one 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.730
 we are very lucky that the pen decided to go around 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.370
 from the flank we lose but he failed 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.060
 as you can see I was constantly monitoring him 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.000
 motion 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.220
 further we deceive Dima matador with a step on 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.040
 which I will discuss in the next lesson and 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.739
 waiting for the pen that just arrived 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.020
 on time my first attempt since the very 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.180
 the beginning was unsuccessful therefore I 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.030
 Immediately turned on the ringing so that the pen does not cause 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 i'm doing too much damage then trying to up 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.310
 Well, now I am a matador step and again 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.800
 failures i miss the point of hitting the pen 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.500
 successfully deals me damage with an ax but not 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.180
 worth giving up we throw ourselves a flame 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.520
 by turning on the ringing 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.320
 go around peers and go out of stealth 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.470
 just turning out to be very profitable 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.780
 position on the hill we have already taught 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.940
 Pyroman ok attempts matador tap dance and nor 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.770
 never tried jump step on it 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.990
 excluding the moment when we are stupid 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.810
 jumped over it accordingly 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.630
 the feast is waiting for the next attempt of the matador 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.970
 but a sudden jump awaits him 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.430
 jump over pen turning 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.280
 at the same time 180 degrees and wait 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.320
 the moment of the animation habits actually 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.230
 usually nobody is guided by it all 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.720
 the spies themselves know the moment of the strike and then 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.650
 successfully check the guy with the boot on 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.830
 head back with a boot on the head back 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.990
 so exactly the way we did two 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.080
 guys while having a lot of fun with them 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.600
 and trying various options let's 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.669
 make a conclusion on the material received 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.010
 to make jump sheet air step 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.860
 learn to count the moment of impact on 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.140
 training card wolf way 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.710
 you can download it in google settings 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.210
 read in the same place but kei I still leave 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.370
 reference in the description 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.850
 next you must learn to manipulate 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.729
 the enemy make him do what he needs 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.919
 this is psychology for you 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.940
 I will highlight a separate lesson until we give 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.770
 example position I run away don't kill 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.050
 turning away from the enemy you disconnect from 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.390
 his attention and he understands that if you 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.820
 don't look anymore 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.740
 actions will not take it all 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.020
 at the subconscious level no one 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.150
 analyzes these moments in the game as 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.250
 only the enemy believed you really 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.250
 running away send him to the right place 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.500
 ladder slide angle doesn't matter then 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:22.260
 jump as fast as possible and 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.440
 clearly so that the enemy did not understand how everything 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.229
 actually happened on the subject of psychology 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.830
 I can talk endlessly but let's 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:33.780
 this finish i am waiting for your comments about 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.920
 that was not enough for you to complete 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.500
 understanding of this topic 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.170
 what to add and what to change 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.970
 The following lessons on this I have everything with 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.600
 you were alexei basinger 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.600
 good luck
