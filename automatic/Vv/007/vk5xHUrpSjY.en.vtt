module<00:00:01.140> four<00:00:01.399> experiment<00:00:02.399> four<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:03.020> yeast<00:00:04.020> and

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
module four experiment four to yeast and

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.780 
module four experiment four to yeast and
the<00:00:04.470> fermentation<00:00:04.830> process<00:00:06.410> in<00:00:07.580> this<00:00:08.580> lab

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the fermentation process in this lab

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.240 
the fermentation process in this lab
we're<00:00:08.940> gonna<00:00:09.030> take<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> look<00:00:09.599> at<00:00:09.809> yeast<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.889> how

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
we're gonna take a look at yeast and how

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.459 
we're gonna take a look at yeast and how
yeast<00:00:11.580> ferment<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.570> then<00:00:13.170> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.440> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
yeast ferment and then we're going to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
yeast ferment and then we're going to
observe<00:00:13.830> yeast<00:00:14.250> budding<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.120> they<00:00:15.660> are

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
observe yeast budding as they are

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.109 
observe yeast budding as they are
feeding<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.500> growing<00:00:16.710> so<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.760> first<00:00:17.970> thing

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
feeding and growing so the first thing

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.040 
feeding and growing so the first thing
we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> do<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.750> need<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> start

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
we're going to do is we need to start

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
we're going to do is we need to start
growing<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.380> yeast<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> cup<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
growing some yeast I have here a cup of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.090 
growing some yeast I have here a cup of
really<00:00:21.779> warm<00:00:22.050> water<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.500> actually<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.859> cups

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
really warm water it's actually two cups

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.849 
really warm water it's actually two cups
of<00:00:23.279> warm<00:00:23.430> water<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:25.019> want<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.560> like

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
of warm water and you want it to be like

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.540 
of warm water and you want it to be like
a<00:00:25.910> warm<00:00:26.910> bath<00:00:27.180> water<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.830> too<00:00:29.070> hot<00:00:29.310> if

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
a warm bath water so it's not too hot if

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
a warm bath water so it's not too hot if
you<00:00:29.640> were<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.789> stick<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.060> finger<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> then

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you were to stick your finger in it then

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.650 
you were to stick your finger in it then
we're<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.769> add<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> packet<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.759> yeast<00:00:35.660> but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
we're gonna add a packet of yeast but

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.610 
we're gonna add a packet of yeast but
whole<00:00:37.590> packet<00:00:40.280> yeah<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.809> then<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> we

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
whole packet yeah and then to that we

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.220 
whole packet yeah and then to that we
want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.890> add<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.539> tablespoon<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.629> sugar<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
want to add a tablespoon of sugar this

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
want to add a tablespoon of sugar this
is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> food<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> yeast<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.850> be

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
is the food that the yeast will be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:59.349 
is the food that the yeast will be
feeding<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> add<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:52.370> stir<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> around

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.520 

okay<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.809> we're<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> let<00:01:01.379> that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
okay so we're going to want to let that

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
okay so we're going to want to let that
sit<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.160> about<00:01:02.640> five<00:01:03.120> minutes<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.690> give<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
sit for about five minutes to give the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
sit for about five minutes to give the
yeast<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.500> chance<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.280> ferment<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> grow<00:01:06.689> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
yeast a chance to ferment or to grow to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.640 
yeast a chance to ferment or to grow to
to<00:01:07.320> feed<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.010> grow<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:10.290> mixture

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to feed and grow and as this mixture

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.830 
to feed and grow and as this mixture
stands<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> sits<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> while<00:01:12.450> you're<00:01:12.720> gonna

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
stands and sits for a while you're gonna

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.530 
stands and sits for a while you're gonna
start<00:01:13.290> seeing<00:01:13.560> bubbles<00:01:14.070> forming<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:15.180> bubbles

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
start seeing bubbles forming the bubbles

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
start seeing bubbles forming the bubbles
are<00:01:15.750> gases<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.590> yeasts<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.130> producing

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
are gases that the yeasts are producing

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
are gases that the yeasts are producing
remember<00:01:19.560> what<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.340> were<00:01:20.460> dumping<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.030> there

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
remember what you were dumping in there

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
remember what you were dumping in there
from<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> packet<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.680> spores<00:01:23.189> of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
from a packet is actually spores of

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.630 
from a packet is actually spores of
yeast<00:01:24.450> cells<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.409> baker's<00:01:25.770> yeast<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.250> bakers

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
yeast cells of baker's yeast and bakers

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.999 
yeast cells of baker's yeast and bakers
use<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.210> baking<00:01:27.540> baking<00:01:27.810> bread<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
use this for baking baking bread and so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.550 
use this for baking baking bread and so
you<00:01:30.000> watch<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> top<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.840> mixture<00:01:31.409> as

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
you watch the top of this mixture as

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.530 
you watch the top of this mixture as
you're<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:31.979> letting<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> sit<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you're as you're letting it sit for a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.880 
you're as you're letting it sit for a
couple<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.810> minutes<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> you're<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
couple of minutes and you're going to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
couple of minutes and you're going to
start<00:01:35.189> seeing<00:01:35.250> foam<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.420> bubbles<00:01:36.840> appear

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
start seeing foam and bubbles appear

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.569 
start seeing foam and bubbles appear
it's<00:01:37.290> gonna<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.560> bigger<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> bigger<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it's gonna get bigger and bigger and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's gonna get bigger and bigger and
more<00:01:38.759> foam<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.270> more<00:01:39.390> bubbles<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
more foam and more bubbles and that's a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.410 
more foam and more bubbles and that's a
result<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.710> carbon<00:01:41.070> dioxide<00:01:41.549> which<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:42.060> gas

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
result of carbon dioxide which is a gas

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
result of carbon dioxide which is a gas
that<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> yeast<00:01:43.020> produce<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.549> are

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that the yeast produce as they are

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.389 
that the yeast produce as they are
feeding<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> sugar<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.020> fermenting<00:01:46.860> so

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
feeding on the sugar and fermenting so

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.670 
feeding on the sugar and fermenting so
you'll<00:01:48.390> notice<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> bubbles<00:01:49.259> you'll<00:01:49.409> you'll

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you'll notice the bubbles you'll you'll

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
you'll notice the bubbles you'll you'll
be<00:01:49.799> viewing<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.310> bubbles<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:50.970> also

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
be viewing the bubbles but you're also

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
be viewing the bubbles but you're also
going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.780> hopefully<00:01:52.470> noticing<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
going to be hopefully noticing a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.380 
going to be hopefully noticing a
familiar<00:01:53.939> aroma<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:55.380> aroma<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.299> kind<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
familiar aroma that aroma is kind of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.209 
familiar aroma that aroma is kind of
like<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> fresh<00:01:57.930> baked<00:01:58.259> bread<00:01:58.380> aroma<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> we

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
like a fresh baked bread aroma that we

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
like a fresh baked bread aroma that we
all<00:01:59.369> seem<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> love<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.930> actually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
all seem to love and it's actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.069 
all seem to love and it's actually
partially<00:02:01.770> due<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.219> alcohol<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.899> yeast

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
partially due to alcohol that the yeast

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.020 
partially due to alcohol that the yeast
is<00:02:04.290> producing<00:02:04.920> from<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.700> fermentation

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
is producing from the fermentation

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
is producing from the fermentation
process<00:02:08.030> okay<00:02:09.060> my<00:02:09.450> solution<00:02:10.349> has<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.649> been

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
process okay my solution has now been

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
process okay my solution has now been
sitting<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.370> five<00:02:11.550> minutes<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.510> see

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
sitting for five minutes and you can see

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.790 
sitting for five minutes and you can see
that<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:13.290> lots<00:02:13.500> of

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
that it's got lots of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
that it's got lots of
bowls<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.310> top<00:02:14.580> which<00:02:15.120> means<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.600> East

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
bowls on the top which means the East

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.020 
bowls on the top which means the East
have<00:02:16.050> been<00:02:16.200> doing<00:02:16.470> their<00:02:16.650> job<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.760> we're<00:02:17.970> now

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
have been doing their job so we're now

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.790 
have been doing their job so we're now
going<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.270> take<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> look<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.810> these<00:02:18.960> guys<00:02:19.410> under

get a small drop set it on your slide
with<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> coverslip<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.050> let's<00:02:37.050> take<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> look

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
with a coverslip and let's take a look

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.990 
with a coverslip and let's take a look
at<00:02:37.530> these<00:02:37.680> under<00:02:38.070> low<00:02:38.280> medium<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.880> high<00:02:38.970> power

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
at these under low medium and high power

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.670 
at these under low medium and high power
first<00:02:42.000> under<00:02:42.270> low<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.560> looking

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
first under low and what you're looking

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.700 
first under low and what you're looking
for<00:02:44.160> are<00:02:44.670> single<00:02:45.660> cells<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.290> you're<00:02:46.560> also

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
for are single cells and you're also

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.320 
for are single cells and you're also
going<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.070> look<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.490> see<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.060> find

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
going to look and see if you can find

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720 
going to look and see if you can find
two<00:02:48.780> cells<00:02:49.050> connected<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.800> each<00:02:49.890> other<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
two cells connected to each other that

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.670 
two cells connected to each other that
means<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> cell<00:02:51.600> has<00:02:51.810> butted<00:02:52.230> one<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
means that a cell has butted one is the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.020 
means that a cell has butted one is the
original<00:02:53.070> cell<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.430> other<00:02:53.580> one<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
original cell and the other one is the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.210 
original cell and the other one is the
bud<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.900> once<00:02:55.080> you've<00:02:55.260> identified<00:02:55.470> where<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
bud so once you've identified where the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.680 
bud so once you've identified where the
cells<00:02:56.490> are<00:02:56.670> go<00:02:56.910> ahead<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.180> go<00:02:57.240> under<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.480> next

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
cells are go ahead and go under the next

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.380 
cells are go ahead and go under the next
high<00:02:57.960> power<00:02:59.060> medium<00:03:00.060> power<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.510> focus<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.050> and

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
high power medium power and focus in and

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.440 
high power medium power and focus in and
then<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:04.740> highest<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.340> power<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:08.240> see<00:03:09.240> if<00:03:09.330> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
then the highest of power and see if you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.920 
then the highest of power and see if you
can<00:03:09.630> identify<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:11.090> single<00:03:12.090> cell<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.690> cell

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
can identify a single cell and a cell

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.800 
can identify a single cell and a cell
that<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.200> budding<00:03:13.760> they<00:03:14.760> should<00:03:14.970> look<00:03:15.120> kind<00:03:15.720> of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
that is budding they should look kind of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.220 
that is budding they should look kind of
oval-shaped<00:03:16.170> maybe<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.100> greenish<00:03:17.490> color<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
oval-shaped maybe a greenish color and

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.870 
oval-shaped maybe a greenish color and
it<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.350> illustrate<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.040> your<00:03:20.160> lab<00:03:20.310> notebook<00:03:20.340> a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it is illustrate in your lab notebook a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.390 
it is illustrate in your lab notebook a
single<00:03:21.300> cell<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.810> then<00:03:22.260> also<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.860> cell<00:03:23.250> that

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
single cell and then also a cell that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.150 
single cell and then also a cell that
has<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.610> bud<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.739> once<00:03:25.739> you've<00:03:25.950> done<00:03:26.100> that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
has a bud on it once you've done that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.890 
has a bud on it once you've done that
we're<00:03:26.610> going<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.760> take<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.000> look<00:03:27.180> at<00:03:27.330> them<00:03:27.480> with

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
we're going to take a look at them with

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.110 
we're going to take a look at them with
under<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.320> stain<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:29.100> sustain<00:03:29.730> that's<00:03:29.910> called

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
under a stain a sustain that's called

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.479 
under a stain a sustain that's called
methylene<00:03:30.510> blue<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.170> that<00:03:31.680> helps<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.130> enhance

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
methylene blue and that helps to enhance

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.460 
methylene blue and that helps to enhance
what<00:03:33.239> you're<00:03:33.420> looking<00:03:33.690> at<00:03:33.780> under<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.110> scope

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
what you're looking at under the scope

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.830 
what you're looking at under the scope
so<00:03:34.800> I'm<00:03:35.730> gonna<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> same<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:36.360> I'm<00:03:36.750> gonna

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
so I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:45.020 
so I'm gonna do the same thing I'm gonna
grab<00:03:38.120> just<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.209> small<00:03:39.540> drop<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:43.130> my<00:03:44.130> yeast<00:03:44.550> and

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
grab just a small drop of my yeast and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.970 
grab just a small drop of my yeast and
then<00:03:45.600> I'm<00:03:45.780> going<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.080> take<00:03:48.410> my<00:03:49.410> methylene<00:03:49.830> blue

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
then I'm going to take my methylene blue

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.390 
then I'm going to take my methylene blue
very<00:03:50.820> small<00:03:51.270> drop<00:03:51.510> this<00:03:52.230> stuff<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:53.010> stain

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
very small drop this stuff will stain

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.910 
very small drop this stuff will stain
anything<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.910> touches<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.600> really<00:03:54.870> careful

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
anything it touches so be really careful

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.940 
anything it touches so be really careful
when<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.070> use<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:58.760> then<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.560> grab<00:04:01.560> another

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
when you use it and then I grab another

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.560 
when you use it and then I grab another
cover<00:04:02.250> slip<00:04:03.800> slide<00:04:04.800> that<00:04:05.010> on<00:04:05.330> put<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.390> under

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
cover slip slide that on put it under

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.390 
cover slip slide that on put it under
the<00:04:06.660> scope<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.530> again<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.010> want<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.160> look<00:04:08.220> at

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
the scope and again you want to look at

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.759 
the scope and again you want to look at
it<00:04:08.520> low<00:04:08.700> medium<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.390> high<00:04:09.480> power<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.230> see<00:04:10.680> if

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
it low medium and high power and see if

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.220 
it low medium and high power and see if
you<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.010> identify<00:04:11.870> with<00:04:12.870> greater<00:04:13.140> detail

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
you can identify with greater detail

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.400 
you can identify with greater detail
your<00:04:16.230> organism<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.609> have<00:04:17.669> them<00:04:18.030> on

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
your organism so here I have them on

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.140 
your organism so here I have them on
medium<00:04:19.410> power<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:21.710> then<00:04:22.710> we'll<00:04:22.830> take<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.039> look

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
medium power and then we'll take a look

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.870 
medium power and then we'll take a look
under<00:04:24.900> 400<00:04:25.440> power<00:04:25.620> which<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.310> our<00:04:26.430> high<00:04:28.880> and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
under 400 power which is our high and

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.170 
under 400 power which is our high and
there<00:04:30.150> you<00:04:30.240> go<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.449> can<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:31.610> some<00:04:32.610> individual

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
there you go you can see some individual

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.779 
there you go you can see some individual
cells<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:33.840> hopefully<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.590> see<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:35.250> couple

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
cells and hopefully you can see a couple

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.850 
cells and hopefully you can see a couple
that<00:04:35.940> have<00:04:36.060> begun<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.419> start<00:04:36.870> reproducing<00:04:37.440> our

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
that have begun to start reproducing our

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.909 
that have begun to start reproducing our
budding<00:04:38.509> once<00:04:39.509> you've<00:04:39.690> done<00:04:39.900> that<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.680> want

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
budding once you've done that you want

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.340 
budding once you've done that you want

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
to let your solution sit for another 30

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.680 
to let your solution sit for another 30
minutes<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.979> give<00:04:44.580> those<00:04:44.789> yeast<00:04:45.120> cells<00:04:45.360> time

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
minutes and give those yeast cells time

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.930 
minutes and give those yeast cells time
to<00:04:45.900> continue<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.650> reproduce<00:04:47.220> feeding<00:04:47.789> on<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
to continue to reproduce feeding on that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.140 
to continue to reproduce feeding on that
sugar<00:04:48.680> fermenting<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:49.889> producing<00:04:50.550> buds<00:04:50.850> at

sugar fermenting and producing buds at
that<00:04:51.690> point<00:04:52.050> we'll<00:04:52.169> come<00:04:52.410> back<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:52.830> take<00:04:53.009> a

that point we'll come back and take a

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.620 
that point we'll come back and take a
look<00:04:53.160> at<00:04:53.550> what<00:04:53.759> these<00:04:53.880> guys<00:04:54.060> look<00:04:54.270> at<00:04:54.389> into<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
look at what these guys look at into the

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.820 
look at what these guys look at into the
microscope<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:57.600> my<00:04:58.110> solution<00:04:58.680> has<00:04:58.800> been

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
microscope so my solution has been

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.890 
microscope so my solution has been
sitting<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.310> 30<00:04:59.639> minutes<00:05:00.000> now<00:05:00.180> now<00:05:00.570> let's<00:05:00.780> do

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
sitting for 30 minutes now now let's do

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.560 
sitting for 30 minutes now now let's do
the<00:05:01.020> same<00:05:01.229> thing<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.560> did<00:05:01.680> before<00:05:02.180> looking<00:05:03.180> for

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
the same thing we did before looking for

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.620 
the same thing we did before looking for
longer<00:05:04.139> chains<00:05:04.470> hopefully<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.250> want<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.060> grab<00:05:06.240> a

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
longer chains hopefully I want to grab a

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.850 
longer chains hopefully I want to grab a
small<00:05:07.380> sample<00:05:08.160> of<00:05:10.310> my<00:05:11.310> yeast<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.500> put<00:05:13.830> a

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
small sample of my yeast and put a

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.820 
small sample of my yeast and put a
coverslip<00:05:14.160> on<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:15.380> we're<00:05:16.380> going<00:05:16.500> to<00:05:16.560> look<00:05:16.680> at

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
coverslip on it we're going to look at

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.670 
coverslip on it we're going to look at
them<00:05:16.949> without<00:05:17.360> dye<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.750> then<00:05:18.930> again<00:05:19.199> with<00:05:19.380> dye

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
them without dye and then again with dye

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.379 
them without dye and then again with dye
so<00:05:20.010> under<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:21.000> lowest<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.510> power<00:05:21.720> of<00:05:21.900> 40<00:05:22.229> power

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
so under the lowest of power of 40 power

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.180 
so under the lowest of power of 40 power
focus<00:05:24.389> in<00:05:24.720> on<00:05:24.870> the<00:05:25.020> section<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.979> yeast

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
focus in on the section of the yeast

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.790 
focus in on the section of the yeast
cells<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.880> then<00:05:27.479> move<00:05:27.630> up<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.080> magnification

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
cells and then move up and magnification

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.010 
cells and then move up and magnification
to<00:05:29.340> medium<00:05:29.669> and<00:05:32.479> at<00:05:33.479> this<00:05:33.599> point<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:33.990> should

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
to medium and at this point you should

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.010 
to medium and at this point you should
you<00:05:34.530> should<00:05:34.560> try<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.070> see<00:05:35.250> if<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:35.370> can<00:05:35.580> find

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
you should try to see if you can find

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.589 
you should try to see if you can find
longer<00:05:37.020> chains<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.710> buds<00:05:38.520> something<00:05:39.419> like

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
longer chains of buds something like

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.320 
longer chains of buds something like
what<00:05:39.780> you're<00:05:39.960> seeing<00:05:40.169> here<00:05:41.180> under<00:05:42.180> the

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
what you're seeing here under the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.000 
what you're seeing here under the
microscope<00:05:42.720> and<00:05:43.050> this<00:05:43.139> is<00:05:43.289> under<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.590> highest

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
microscope and this is under the highest

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.140 
microscope and this is under the highest
power<00:05:45.080> we're<00:05:46.080> looking<00:05:46.500> for<00:05:46.740> long<00:05:46.949> chains<00:05:47.580> if

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
power we're looking for long chains if

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.969 
power we're looking for long chains if
we<00:05:48.270> can<00:05:48.449> find<00:05:48.659> 3<00:05:49.199> then<00:05:49.440> you're<00:05:49.560> doing<00:05:49.770> really

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
we can find 3 then you're doing really

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.899 
we can find 3 then you're doing really
great<00:05:50.220> to<00:05:50.580> find<00:05:50.849> a<00:05:51.000> chain<00:05:51.360> of<00:05:51.510> 3<00:05:51.810> budding<00:05:52.199> and

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
great to find a chain of 3 budding and

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.540 
great to find a chain of 3 budding and
make<00:05:53.909> an<00:05:54.030> illustration<00:05:54.150> of<00:05:55.070> what<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.250> see

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
make an illustration of what you see

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.520 
make an illustration of what you see
there<00:05:57.030> with<00:05:57.360> those<00:05:57.479> new<00:05:57.630> cells<00:05:57.870> a<00:05:58.080> single<00:05:58.380> one

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
there with those new cells a single one

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.100 
there with those new cells a single one
and<00:05:58.770> then<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.010> chains<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.669> see<00:06:00.110> once

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
and then the chains that you see once

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.860 
and then the chains that you see once
you've<00:06:01.260> done<00:06:01.440> that<00:06:02.150> we<00:06:03.150> want<00:06:03.360> to<00:06:03.419> do<00:06:03.510> this<00:06:03.630> one

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
you've done that we want to do this one

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.629 
you've done that we want to do this one
more<00:06:04.050> time

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
more time

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.089 
more time
but<00:06:05.639> we<00:06:05.760> want<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.210> add<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.720> drop<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:07.560> methylene

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
but we want to add a drop of methylene

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.820 
but we want to add a drop of methylene
blue<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.610> stain<00:06:08.909> those<00:06:09.120> cells<00:06:09.419> so<00:06:09.780> I'm<00:06:10.650> going

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
blue and stain those cells so I'm going

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.719 
blue and stain those cells so I'm going
to<00:06:10.889> grab<00:06:11.070> again<00:06:12.020> very<00:06:13.020> very<00:06:13.110> small<00:06:13.590> drop<00:06:14.280> of

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
to grab again very very small drop of

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:25.880 
to grab again very very small drop of
the<00:06:15.720> yeast<00:06:18.860> my<00:06:19.860> methylene<00:06:20.250> blue<00:06:20.400> on

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.540 

close<00:06:26.890> that<00:06:27.070> up<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.390> coverslip<00:06:31.900> on<00:06:32.080> top

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
close that up and that coverslip on top

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.310 
close that up and that coverslip on top
and<00:06:33.550> we<00:06:33.610> want<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:33.970> observe<00:06:34.180> again<00:06:34.540> low<00:06:34.840> medium

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
and we want to observe again low medium

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.940 
and we want to observe again low medium
and<00:06:35.380> high<00:06:35.470> power<00:06:35.830> so<00:06:36.160> first<00:06:36.970> under<00:06:37.210> low<00:06:37.360> power

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
and high power so first under low power

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:42.390 
and high power so first under low power
get<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.130> good<00:06:39.370> spot<00:06:39.510> or<00:06:40.510> you<00:06:40.690> can<00:06:40.870> see<00:06:41.400> the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
get to a good spot or you can see the

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.150 
get to a good spot or you can see the
organisms<00:06:43.000> move<00:06:43.960> up<00:06:44.080> to<00:06:44.230> medium<00:06:44.560> power<00:06:44.770> and

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
organisms move up to medium power and

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.010
