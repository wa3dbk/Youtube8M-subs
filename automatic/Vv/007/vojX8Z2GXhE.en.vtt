just over 30 pieces and they densely fit
a<00:00:26.240> single<00:00:27.240> board<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:29.160> could<00:00:29.340> easily<00:00:29.699> be

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
a single board this could easily be

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
a single board this could easily be
stretched<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> two<00:00:31.140> boards<00:00:31.650> worth<00:00:31.890> of

how<00:00:34.920> awesome<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.550> stuff<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:37.260> client

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
how awesome this stuff is the client

how awesome this stuff is the client
asked<00:00:38.040> for<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.960> swampy<00:00:39.960> type<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.860> area<00:00:41.129> where

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
asked for a swampy type of area where

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.660 
asked for a swampy type of area where
buildings<00:00:41.700> were<00:00:42.210> crumbling<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> if

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
buildings were crumbling into it and if

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 
buildings were crumbling into it and if
you<00:00:44.789> notice<00:00:45.590> everything<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.950> one<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
you notice everything from one end of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.240 
you notice everything from one end of
the<00:00:47.460> board<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.940> other<00:00:48.350> slowly<00:00:49.350> degrades

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the board to the other slowly degrades

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.420 
the board to the other slowly degrades
down<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.030> where<00:00:51.210> it's<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.510> lower<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.140> lower

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
down to where it's a lower and lower

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
down to where it's a lower and lower
level<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> over<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> fortified

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
level and over here you have a fortified

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.250 
level and over here you have a fortified
area<00:00:55.980> all<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.460> are<00:00:56.640> separate<00:00:57.059> pieces<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
area all of these are separate pieces a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.240 
area all of these are separate pieces a
lot<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> them<00:00:58.829> magnetized<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:01.250> flac

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
lot of them magnetized like this flac

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
lot of them magnetized like this flac
emplacement<00:01:03.239> there<00:01:03.420> you've<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.229> pillboxes<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
emplacement there you've got pillboxes a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.260 
emplacement there you've got pillboxes a
lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> homebrew<00:01:08.159> stuff<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
lot of this is homebrew stuff like it's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.140 
lot of this is homebrew stuff like it's
been<00:01:09.479> converted<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.710> kits<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
been converted from other kits now the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
been converted from other kits now the
models<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.590> included

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
models you see here are not included

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.490 
models you see here are not included
I've<00:01:14.280> only<00:01:14.400> included<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.509> give<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> sense

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
I've only included them to give a sense

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.859 
I've only included them to give a sense
of<00:01:16.619> scale<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.700> take<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> look<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.600> piece

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
of scale so take a look at this piece

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.590 
of scale so take a look at this piece
here<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> my<00:01:19.890> favs<00:01:20.189> how<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
here this is one of my favs how the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560 
here this is one of my favs how the
building<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> sinking<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.880> Swan

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
building is sinking into the Swan

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
building is sinking into the Swan
there's<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.590> gap<00:01:25.830> over<00:01:26.700> here

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there's actually a little gap over here

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.539 
there's actually a little gap over here
so<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.420> definitely<00:01:27.810> has<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> very<00:01:28.409> organic<00:01:28.799> feel

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
so it definitely has a very organic feel

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.580 
so it definitely has a very organic feel
there's<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.030> lots<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:30.900> details<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
there's also lots of little details like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.620 
there's also lots of little details like
the<00:01:32.369> bridge<00:01:32.579> segments<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.210> bullet<00:01:33.600> holes

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the bridge segments have bullet holes

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
the bridge segments have bullet holes
and<00:01:34.229> potholes<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.100> with<00:01:35.280> pieces<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and potholes in and with pieces of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.530 
and potholes in and with pieces of
skeletons<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.070> places<00:01:38.070> where<00:01:38.340> material<00:01:38.939> has

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
skeletons and places where material has

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.380 
skeletons and places where material has
grown<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> has<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.850> rusty<00:01:42.329> rebar<00:01:44.390> coming

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
grown up it has some rusty rebar coming

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
grown up it has some rusty rebar coming
out<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.750> freeway<00:01:46.280> type<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.520> also<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
out of the freeway type thing also this

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.469 
out of the freeway type thing also this
can<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.420> moved<00:01:48.810> together<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
can all be moved together so that

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.080 
can all be moved together so that
vehicles<00:01:51.479> could<00:01:52.100> reasonably<00:01:53.100> pass<00:01:53.490> over<00:01:53.909> its

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
vehicles could reasonably pass over its

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
vehicles could reasonably pass over its
same<00:01:54.299> thing<00:01:54.540> over<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.770> kind<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
same thing over here that they kind of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
same thing over here that they kind of
match<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> play<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
match up and you can play that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
match up and you can play that
differently<00:01:58.649> obviously<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.340> could<00:01:59.490> do<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
differently obviously you could do it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.959 
differently obviously you could do it
from<00:01:59.850> side<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.240> side<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.549> get<00:02:02.549> lots<00:02:02.759> of

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
from side to side and get lots of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
from side to side and get lots of
different<00:02:03.180> configurations<00:02:03.899> also<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
different configurations also the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
different configurations also the
buildings<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.070> these<00:02:05.689> stripe<00:02:06.689> marks<00:02:07.350> on

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
buildings have these stripe marks on

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.230 
buildings have these stripe marks on
them

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
them

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.900 
them
which<00:02:08.900> is<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> nice<00:02:09.440> feature<00:02:09.800> same<00:02:10.400> thing<00:02:10.640> here

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
which is a nice feature same thing here

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.410 
which is a nice feature same thing here
so<00:02:11.170> I'm<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.350> pointing<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.800> out<00:02:12.860> as<00:02:13.850> lots<00:02:14.270> of

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so I'm just pointing that out as lots of

really quickly oh these hills are
detachable<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.240> modular<00:04:30.810> they<00:04:31.290> even<00:04:31.500> fit

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
detachable and modular they even fit

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.560 
detachable and modular they even fit
together<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.400> other<00:04:32.550> way<00:04:32.790> if<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.090> flip<00:04:33.390> them
