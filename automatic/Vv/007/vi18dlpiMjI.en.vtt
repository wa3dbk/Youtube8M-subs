00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.840
 hello today came to us to review 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.300
 phone MTS 970, let's go again 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.320
 the technical characteristics of 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.710
 screen housing 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:30.779
 then probably everything else 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:34.949
 Well, as for the processor, the processor is here 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.410
 worth mtk6592 octa core for those who do not 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:42.000
 knows what octa core is eight 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:48.570
 cores as many as eight cores so video 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.379
 accelerator mali 400 mp4 gives 15 thousand 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.019
 parrots 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.799
 given mark 50 frames per second so what 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:02.100
 As for the housing body here such 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:06.600
 good does not creak anywhere 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 In general, everything is cool in general design 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.299
 the phone just amazes me how up 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.940
 not a single phone thought of this 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.110
 was made this is possibly one of the most 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:25.170
 beautiful phones that I saw so 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 what is there on the screen screen we have super mts 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 gorilla voice retina 3d screen well how are you 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.690
 might notice 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.210
 a little earlier here it is a 3d screen 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.800
 viewing angles just going wild you can 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.730
 look like this but see the screen 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.400
 absolutely in full color he's here 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.890
 so bright that even at minimum you 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:54.560
 you will see everything even at very bright 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.579
 sun plus 30 weather 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.060
 so well here the back button is the home button and 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.350
 menu button here we have two sensors 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.799
 but you won't see them 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.310
 I'll show you a little later and the front 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.769
 the camera is very small on our left 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:19.420
 there is a microusb volume rocker 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.420
 top button on and lock and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.720
 headphone jack 35 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.930
 on the left we have nothing below 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.600
 we have a 13 megapixel camera at the back with 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.650
 autofocus but no flash speaker 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.540
 very loud as well as the front 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.540
 hear very well as well as I 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.599
 said let me show you the sensors 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:56.810
 because you have not seen now I will open 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:03:01.310
 screen now I will note so well here they are 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.620
 sensors 2 and some other but this is probably 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.250
 Not a camera, but I do not know here a loop and a loop 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.739
 and here they are very strong, they hold me even 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.350
 they cut off they are set i don't 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.940
 I know how to do it well, in general, here 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.549
 the display itself you see how everything is 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.459
 beautifully built so let's 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.480
 restore it again and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:31.190
 crawled under the back cover see what 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.890
 we have it there so now I will do it again 3d 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.790
 our uta matrix 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:41.770
 so open the lid on noisy does not want 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:48.290
 open so we have it with a trigger 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:54.370
 so open the battery an hour she does not 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.370
 wants to open here she fell so 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.730
 mts to work in the network mts 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:07.959
 bluetooth model pay 970 made in china 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:12.709
 so here we have the usual sim card 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:16.370
 hardware and micro usb slot for 32 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:19.850
 hectares damn her this is cute i think that 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:27.380
 the owner will not notice so okay where are we 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:33.770
 close the lid close let's close 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:36.590
 neatly yet again with us 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.919
 the screen broke but here's one single 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:45.200
 the disease is that they have no screens 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.280
 every time you need to correct so 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.820
 concerns games 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.720
 Well, the games here go well, just for five seconds 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.380
 plus here you know but 8-core 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:03.380
 why did you want no samsung here 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:06.220
 I shouldnâ€™t play around here I played d-trigger 2 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.530
 gta san andreas gta 3 gta wei city 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.700
 there were absolutely all games at once 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:17.750
 all at once and he even had no sign 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:21.350
 that he started off the phone 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.940
 just a bomb I bit his dog with 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.940
 he had nothing to do with him and he still 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:31.419
 alive he fell from a thousand meters away from me 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.070
 blindly and he absolutely doesn't give a shit about everything 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.470
 simply 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.920
 super phone I have never been such 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:44.050
 I saw mts well done just praise guys 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.600
 in general, so well, so far everyone at the end I 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.980
 show you how the games work and 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.980
 how does the camera work 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.389
 Well, here is our first game this is a real race 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:06.740
 racing 3 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:09.020
 car we Mouzon so now here 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:13.520
 loaded here seconds passed all he 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.909
 booted well let's play as 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.729
 we see that we even have mirrors there 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:21.979
 Reflection all shows on let's 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.889
 little ride I play at all 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.669
 I know how to ride and only two times probably 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:34.800
 but then the next game there any 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:37.900
 well let's here's the first game 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.620
 have you seen that there is absolutely no lag 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:47.189
 let's play another so there 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.930
 let's play the second time all the same I 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:53.229
 I wanted to play again in the race because 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:57.250
 which really fascinated me this game and I 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:07:02.129
 wanted more time to play it well, let 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:05.530
 I will start so 1 2 3 start 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:08.620
 window as you can see lags absolutely but 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:14.009
 just but not observed them and not them 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:18.810
 There should generally be essentially a tone of 8 Christmas trees 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:25.439
 these same yager so we now i 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:25.439
 pause and turn on another game 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.580
 volleyball basketball 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:42.389
 so well and of course I shot to probably 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:51.660
 yes trigger 2 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:54.620
 so well out zombie grenade well, maybe 

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:58.550
 all finish our games 

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:03.350
 Well, in general, all all bye 

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.350
 who was interested in putting like
