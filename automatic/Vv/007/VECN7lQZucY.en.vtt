00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:16.640
 flax standing than before because it goes from 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.330
 couple is alive and well cyclone at 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.330
 hank of the bow 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 so how long does it take to sleep 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.590
 on a solo race 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 according to some who sleeps the least 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.310
 it's the one who wins except that this little 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.070
 game there there is so ended on the beach 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.360
 so between sleeping a lot or not 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 where is the truth 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
 first you have to know yourself well 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 I mean not his boyfriends 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.560
 because as we are all a little 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 different we do not need the same 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.380
 amount of sleep 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.690
 after the mini transatlantic it's not a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.490
 sprint must last we will necessarily 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.400
 less sleep than on a coastal race 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 of three days on average 3 5 hours per 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.650
 day it's going to depend on the conditions and 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.380
 of course not a block one is fragmented 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.940
 there is no rule even if 20 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 minutes seems to be an average duration 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.580
 pretty universal like the nap at the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.580
 house what 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 good ok 20 minutes it seems short with 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 of training is also a huge 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.929
 dose of fatigue recover a lot in 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.460
 20 minutes 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.229
 especially when we know how to do it to the good 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.729
 moment and that's where we can create 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.700
 real differences between competitors 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.939
 in clear it must be done in boat goes 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.280
 well 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.420
 without our intervention after the man 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 it is a diurnal animal 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.929
 you have to sleep at night so 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.149
 favor the absence of light for 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.830
 better recovery nap 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.430
 after lunch it can also be a 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 good calculation 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.989
 the warrior who is in us is there 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.310
 and recovers rather well but if 20 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.319
 minutes has passed and what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 conditions are conducive to his rest then 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.450
 we can chain three four five six 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.450
 years it takes 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.040
 in clear one in 20 minutes we get 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 wake up we watch if everything is fine and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.120
 we go back 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.650
 the important thing is to know not to 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 enter this red zone where the dream 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.920
 merges with reality 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.630
 we call it hallucinations and that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.020
 it's never people to go quickly to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.020
 to sell
