00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.089 

okay<00:02:27.969> hope<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.629> that<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.439> how<00:02:29.620> was<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
okay hope you like that so how was this

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.420 
okay hope you like that so how was this
to<00:02:30.370> throw<00:02:30.730> well<00:02:31.689> the<00:02:32.469> balance<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.250> is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
to throw well the balance of this is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.910 
to throw well the balance of this is
like<00:02:33.609> a<00:02:33.640> traditional<00:02:34.480> table<00:02:35.109> Hawk<00:02:35.379> meaning

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
like a traditional table Hawk meaning

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520 
like a traditional table Hawk meaning
it's<00:02:36.819> very<00:02:36.939> top-heavy<00:02:37.569> you<00:02:37.930> know<00:02:38.049> all<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
it's very top-heavy you know all the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.229 
it's very top-heavy you know all the
metal<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.069> in<00:02:39.189> the<00:02:39.280> head<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.760> hawk<00:02:39.969> and

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
metal is in the head of the hawk and

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.580 
metal is in the head of the hawk and
then<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.870> just<00:02:41.079> have<00:02:41.230> lightweight

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
then you just have lightweight

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.140 
then you just have lightweight
polypropylene<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.810> handle<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.640> being<00:02:45.939> so

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
polypropylene as the handle so being so

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.830 
polypropylene as the handle so being so
top-heavy<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:47.019> tends<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.840> over

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
top-heavy it tends to want to over

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830 
top-heavy it tends to want to over
rotate<00:02:50.079> okay<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.099> that<00:02:52.090> part<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.599> was<00:02:52.780> a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
rotate okay so that part of it was a

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.830 
rotate okay so that part of it was a
little<00:02:53.139> bit<00:02:53.290> challenging<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.700> throw<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.689> it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
little bit challenging to throw and it

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.009 
little bit challenging to throw and it
is<00:02:56.260> also<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.680> long<00:02:57.040> Hawk<00:02:57.459> now<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.480> shape<00:02:58.840> of

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
is also a long Hawk now the shape of

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.910 
is also a long Hawk now the shape of
that<00:02:59.170> blade<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.769> not<00:03:00.069> really<00:03:00.549> designed<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
that blade is not really designed to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.410 
that blade is not really designed to
stick<00:03:02.920> particularly<00:03:03.609> well<00:03:03.879> into<00:03:04.209> wood

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
stick particularly well into wood

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.440 
stick particularly well into wood
because<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.900> see<00:03:05.109> it<00:03:05.230> curves<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.180> tend

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
because you see it curves it could tend

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.429 
because you see it curves it could tend
to<00:03:07.720> almost<00:03:08.590> roll<00:03:08.980> off<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.659> spike<00:03:10.959> stuck<00:03:11.409> a

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
to almost roll off but the spike stuck a

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.349 
to almost roll off but the spike stuck a
lot<00:03:11.799> better<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.340> basically<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.939> was<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> lot

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
lot better and basically it was a lot

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.589 
lot better and basically it was a lot
easier<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:14.709> firmly<00:03:15.099> stick<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.700> spike<00:03:16.030> into

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
easier to firmly stick the spike into

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.729 
easier to firmly stick the spike into
the<00:03:16.720> target<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:18.250> overall<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:20.109> was<00:03:20.230> pretty<00:03:20.260> fun

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
the target but overall it was pretty fun

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.039 
the target but overall it was pretty fun
to<00:03:20.919> throw<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.250> would<00:03:21.669> say<00:03:21.939> as<00:03:22.269> far<00:03:22.750> as

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
to throw I would say as far as

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.119 
to throw I would say as far as
difficulty<00:03:23.829> easy<00:03:24.370> medium<00:03:25.269> hard<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:26.319> would<00:03:26.769> say

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
difficulty easy medium hard I would say

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.629 
difficulty easy medium hard I would say
this<00:03:27.370> would<00:03:27.579> be<00:03:27.609> medium<00:03:28.239> difficulty<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:30.250> throw

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
this would be medium difficulty to throw

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.360 
this would be medium difficulty to throw
