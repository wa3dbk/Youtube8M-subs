field I thought the best chance we have

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.990 
field I thought the best chance we have
I<00:01:33.109> just<00:01:33.409> ran<00:01:34.100> out<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.280> bounds<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:34.759> give<00:01:34.880> our

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
I just ran out of bounds and give our

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.910 
I just ran out of bounds and give our
office<00:01:35.149> a<00:01:35.509> chance<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.289> know<00:01:36.439> complete<00:01:36.770> a

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
office a chance to you know complete a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.990 
office a chance to you know complete a
pass<00:01:37.189> or<00:01:37.429> two<00:01:37.549> then<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.119> get<00:01:38.270> some<00:01:38.420> penalty<00:01:40.000> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
pass or two then we get some penalty and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.550 
pass or two then we get some penalty and
I<00:01:41.090> think<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:41.420> ended<00:01:41.659> up<00:01:41.689> starting<00:01:41.929> off<00:01:42.140> inside

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560

I think we ended up starting off inside
the<00:01:42.679> team<00:01:42.890> but<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.520> mentality<00:01:43.969> had<00:01:44.659> been<00:01:44.990> play
