00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.910 
came to realize as many optometrists do
that<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.330> glasses<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.959> was<00:02:29.110> prescribing<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.830> a

do<00:04:14.380> for<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.220> first<00:04:15.460> time<00:04:15.730> in<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.239> long<00:04:16.270> time<00:04:16.570> I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
do for the first time in a long time I

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.650 
do for the first time in a long time I
get<00:04:18.130> thank<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.430> cards<00:04:18.520> almost<00:04:19.150> daily<00:04:19.510> from

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
get thank you cards almost daily from

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.660 
get thank you cards almost daily from
people<00:04:19.960> telling<00:04:20.140> me<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.410> saved<00:04:20.920> their<00:04:21.130> lives<00:04:21.340> of

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
people telling me I saved their lives of

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.480 
people telling me I saved their lives of
what<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.910> did<00:04:22.060> with<00:04:22.390> them<00:04:22.570> well<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.530> me<00:04:23.650> getting

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
what I did with them well to me getting

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.100 
what I did with them well to me getting
one<00:04:24.730> letter<00:04:24.970> like<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.540> worth<00:04:25.570> all<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
one letter like that is worth all the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.410 
one letter like that is worth all the
money<00:04:26.140> in<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.620> world<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.850> took<00:04:28.000> me<00:04:28.180> about<00:04:28.360> a

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
money in the world it took me about a

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.450 
money in the world it took me about a
year<00:04:28.510> but<00:04:29.350> I<00:04:29.410> was<00:04:29.650> able<00:04:29.770> to<00:04:29.920> condense<00:04:30.250> the

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
year but I was able to condense the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.700 
year but I was able to condense the
method<00:04:30.790> down<00:04:30.940> into<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> book<00:04:31.660> called<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
method down into a book called the

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.340 
method down into a book called the
quantum<00:04:32.980> vision<00:04:33.580> system<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.420> this<00:04:35.080> book<00:04:35.290> is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
quantum vision system and this book is

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.380 
quantum vision system and this book is
now<00:04:35.620> available<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.730> has<00:04:36.850> allowed<00:04:37.120> people
