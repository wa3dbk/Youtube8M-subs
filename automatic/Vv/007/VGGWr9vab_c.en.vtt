00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.050
 share 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.309
 ok health magazine 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.039
 doctors today I would like to talk about a situation that may seem to imagine 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:15.659
 but that actually invests 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.250
 philosophically all the meaning of our survival on this earth 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.310
 because it involves dealing directly with the attitude of 

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.689
 active rape of nature that has seen us responsible nutini and hundreds of 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:26.560
 years 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.699
 of the deformations that have affected our planet 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.160
 and that may even prevent us from surviving 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.410
 in the ages that follow 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.060
 we are talking about a small village and for the precision of pagliare del tronto 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 in the province of Ascoli Piceno in the brands where there is a school that you think 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.180
 a bit in contrast with the rest of Italy than in the big one 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.310
 most of the cases welcome students with concrete structures 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.840
 inserted in urban contexts where I have little space reserved for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.320
 nature with this school there is a garden and this orders there is one 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.890
 pond a place 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.739
 biologically running 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.570
 cory cody forms of life of animals and plants 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.219
 that from few steps from the classes of the students that in this way 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.569
 often and willingly go out with teachers that some have been yes 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.230
 they take care of enriching it to preserve it 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.650
 and can do research they can look closely at 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.560
 reproduction of the metamorphosis of the emerald toad rather than taking of 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 water samples for then analyzing the microscope and watching 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.080
 and the cellular organisms that move inside make exhibitions like the 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.490
 in other words, a world in a drop that is a wonderful experience for anyone 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.430
 of us have children would hope to be able to replicate in the institute 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.950
 school and its children attend well 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.859
 as in fairy tales there is a serious threat and this threat consists m 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:48.360
 by a committee of citizens who live in the area 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.760
 and who sent a series of challenges 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.600
 haben 14 between institutions and institutions requesting 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.660
 the cementing of this space of fortune was defined by someone a 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.940
 flood of dead waters a small stagnation of dead waters 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.050
 when I invite you to look at the images that are flowing right now 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.570
 to give you an idea of ​​the beauty of this place and the need to 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.610
 preserve it for the sons of pagliare del tronto and not just as an example 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.859
 possibly to be replicated for other Italian schools 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.859
 well what is the problem complained of by this committee of citizens 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.279
 car with the residences witness the presence of natrix natrix specimens 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:32.459
 a snake from the collar an endangered species absolutely no komachi 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.269
 evidently awakens 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.019
 in our by now in total habit to the natural world of the atavistic terror 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.990
 to which we react with disproportionate violence 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.690
 here it is necessary to specify that the presence of this snake does not have any 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.499
 relevance to the school pond 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.989
 it is a specimen found in all city centers even in those where 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.200
 is exchanged and are not present, it feeds on small mouse shrews 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.929
 mammals and just in case 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:02.239
 probably its presence is not linked to hahaha an abandoned villa 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.799
 and you are just around the residences that have complained about 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.139
 presence of natrix natrix 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:11.930
 citizens complained about the presence of tiger mosquitoes but also in 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.979
 in this case the accusation seems as groundless as the tiger mosquitoes 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.579
 the municipality where they reproduce in shallow water stacks ea 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.679
 very low biological diversity 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.499
 therefore absolutely it is not distant among other things they have made the history of the man. 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:28.339
 a man of about 200 meters 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:30.370
 they cannot go away too much 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.430
 what you can do now because this wonder of nature is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.120
 even what you allow me should be considered a pride for the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.380
 our ministry of education bring a preserved from this ecological barbarism 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.779
 from this genocide of living species 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:48.669
 largely due to ignorance our low propensity attitude to 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.819
 respect for nature with which we will have to exist if we do not want 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.540
 approach 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.140
 to extinction in a sudden way and to report to the mayor ours 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.349
 annoyance by sending a message a letter you can find 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.880
 a sample on the blog I have an address address of the mayor in common or 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.940
 to his e-mail address I still have his mobile number vs always put with 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.160
 extreme courtesy as it is published in clear light of day on the site 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.719
 institutional of the municipality here we are not invading your privacy 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:21.489
 I ask myself to participate enthusiastically in this campaign because you look 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.300
 it's a matter of civilization 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.680
 it is also a question of respect for other life forms but above all one 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.409
 question guys physically talking about the possibility of survival of the 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.880
 our own species because if we don't reverse this trend this 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.050
 extreme lack of interest in quality ecosystems must be 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.539
 included 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.389
 we will soon try to face an abyss it will be a very deep abyss
