cool<00:01:59.159> and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
cool and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.800 
cool and
his<00:02:00.980> shift<00:02:01.340> tree<00:02:01.580> will<00:02:01.760> go<00:02:01.880> down<00:02:02.150> which<00:02:02.780> is

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
his shift tree will go down which is

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.450 
his shift tree will go down which is
also<00:02:03.200> really<00:02:03.500> cool<00:02:03.770> because<00:02:03.920> he's<00:02:04.220> down<00:02:04.430> a

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
also really cool because he's down a

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.790 
also really cool because he's down a
Pokemon<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.300> I<00:02:05.750> do<00:02:05.810> go<00:02:06.050> for<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.230> outright<00:02:06.440> but

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
Pokemon and I do go for the outright but

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.020 
Pokemon and I do go for the outright but
since<00:02:07.010> there's<00:02:07.160> nothing<00:02:07.430> there<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> can't

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
since there's nothing there I can't

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.359 
since there's nothing there I can't
really<00:02:08.210> do<00:02:08.330> any<00:02:08.479> damage<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.740> he<00:02:10.009> does<00:02:10.190> go<00:02:10.340> into

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
really do any damage so he does go into

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.730 
really do any damage so he does go into
his<00:02:10.670> entei<00:02:11.060> next<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.630> he<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.650> to

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
his entei next and he is going to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500 
his entei next and he is going to
predict<00:02:13.100> me<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.460> go<00:02:13.550> for<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.730> sucker<00:02:14.000> punch<00:02:14.120> so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
predict me to go for the sucker punch so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.720 
predict me to go for the sucker punch so
he<00:02:14.660> goes<00:02:14.780> for<00:02:14.990> extreme<00:02:15.380> speed<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.460> I<00:02:16.490> actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
he goes for extreme speed but I actually

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.120 
he goes for extreme speed but I actually
wanted<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.630> take<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> physical<00:02:18.170> move<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.010> I<00:02:19.040> do

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
wanted to take a physical move so I do

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.160 
wanted to take a physical move so I do
switch<00:02:19.550> into<00:02:19.850> my<00:02:20.000> spirit<00:02:20.420> zoom<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.750> take<00:02:20.959> it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
switch into my spirit zoom to take it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.710 
switch into my spirit zoom to take it
and<00:02:21.320> he<00:02:21.830> goes<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> extreme<00:02:23.120> speed<00:02:23.450> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and he goes for the extreme speed and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660 
and he goes for the extreme speed and
it's<00:02:24.530> not<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.010> anything<00:02:25.250> because<00:02:25.520> I

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
it's not going to do anything because I

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
it's not going to do anything because I
am<00:02:25.880> obviously<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.360> ghost<00:02:26.600> pokemon<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.680> that's

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
am obviously a ghost pokemon so that's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.440 
am obviously a ghost pokemon so that's
pretty<00:02:28.010> cool<00:02:28.250> he<00:02:28.760> is<00:02:28.850> going<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.090> switch<00:02:29.300> out

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.090 
pretty cool he is going to switch out
again<00:02:29.750> next<00:02:29.930> turn<00:02:30.230> as<00:02:30.410> he's<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.770> go<00:02:30.920> into

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.920 
cryogonal to take the next giga drain
and<00:03:13.190> i'm<00:03:14.090> not<00:03:14.209> really<00:03:14.360> sure<00:03:14.480> how<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:14.810> going

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
and i'm not really sure how it's going

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.030 
and i'm not really sure how it's going
to<00:03:14.989> take<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.350> don't<00:03:15.620> think<00:03:15.739> it's<00:03:15.860> going<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
to take you I don't think it's going to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.670

take<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.519> well<00:03:16.790> as<00:03:17.120> he<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.200> obviously

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
take it that well as he is obviously

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.520 
take it that well as he is obviously
going<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.070> go<00:03:19.190> for<00:03:19.340> another<00:03:19.400> giga<00:03:19.730> drain<00:03:19.910> and

going to go for another giga drain and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.229 
going to go for another giga drain and
it's<00:03:21.530> not<00:03:21.980> going<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.280> take<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.760> well<00:03:23.030> as

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
it's not going to take you that well as

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.420 
it's not going to take you that well as
i<00:03:23.330> said<00:03:23.540> before<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:24.260> he's<00:03:24.950> going<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.130> recover

a<00:03:53.239> gun<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.570> leave<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.049> as<00:03:54.140> death<00:03:54.350> water<00:03:54.650> because

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
a gun to leave it as death water because

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.759 
a gun to leave it as death water because
um<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:56.060> doesn't<00:03:56.299> have<00:03:56.480> as<00:03:56.630> much<00:03:56.959> HP<00:03:57.230> left<00:03:57.620> and

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
um it doesn't have as much HP left and

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.860 
um it doesn't have as much HP left and
only<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:57.980> like<00:03:58.070> 70<00:03:58.400> HP<00:03:58.519> so<00:03:59.329> he's<00:03:59.600> going<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.810> go

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
only is like 70 HP so he's going to go

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.150 
only is like 70 HP so he's going to go
for<00:04:00.019> the<00:04:00.049> giga<00:04:00.230> drain<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.680> take<00:04:00.829> me<00:04:01.010> out<00:04:01.130> and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
for the giga drain and take me out and

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.770 
for the giga drain and take me out and
he's<00:04:01.370> not<00:04:01.489> going<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.670> recover<00:04:01.880> that<00:04:02.239> much<00:04:02.510> HP

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
he's not going to recover that much HP

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.600 
he's not going to recover that much HP
and<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> life<00:04:03.860> orb<00:04:04.130> damage<00:04:04.459> will

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
and then the life orb damage will

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.819 
and then the life orb damage will
basically<00:04:04.820> cancel<00:04:05.390> out<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.630> giga<00:04:05.870> drain<00:04:05.989> so

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
basically cancel out the giga drain so

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.759 
basically cancel out the giga drain so
he's<00:04:07.280> going<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.489> be<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.820> at<00:04:08.030> about<00:04:08.570> 40<00:04:09.139> HP<00:04:09.530> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
he's going to be like at about 40 HP and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.820 
he's going to be like at about 40 HP and

another good play as he's going to go

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.080 
another good play as he's going to go
into<00:04:28.630> his<00:04:28.840> typhlosion<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.430> am<00:04:30.700> I<00:04:30.910> was

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
into his typhlosion and I am I was

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.730 
into his typhlosion and I am I was
predicting<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:31.570> hidden<00:04:31.840> power<00:04:31.990> grass<00:04:32.320> as<00:04:32.590> he

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
predicting a hidden power grass as he

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.260 
predicting a hidden power grass as he
was<00:04:32.890> predicting<00:04:33.280> me<00:04:33.400> to<00:04:33.520> go<00:04:33.640> into<00:04:33.760> my<00:04:33.910> omastar

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
was predicting me to go into my omastar

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810 
was predicting me to go into my omastar
so<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:34.990> do<00:04:35.110> switch<00:04:35.530> into<00:04:35.830> my<00:04:35.950> Magnum<00:04:36.280> Oryx<00:04:36.610> take

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
so I do switch into my Magnum Oryx take

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.970 
so I do switch into my Magnum Oryx take
the<00:04:36.940> HP<00:04:37.330> grass<00:04:37.600> and<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.350> obviously<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.830> going

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
the HP grass and it obviously is going

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.470 
the HP grass and it obviously is going
to<00:04:39.040> take<00:04:39.160> it<00:04:39.310> really<00:04:39.550> well<00:04:39.700> because<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.450> a

to take it really well because it is a

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.210 
to take it really well because it is a
fire-type<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.290> then<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:41.860> want<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.100> make

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
fire-type and then I want to make

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.610 
fire-type and then I want to make
another<00:04:42.580> good<00:04:42.790> play<00:04:43.000> as<00:04:43.240> I'm<00:04:43.870> predicting<00:04:44.500> him

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
another good play as I'm predicting him

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.710 
another good play as I'm predicting him
to<00:04:44.710> go<00:04:44.830> into<00:04:44.980> his<00:04:45.190> regirock<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.210> do<00:04:46.270> go<00:04:46.570> for

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
to go into his regirock and I do go for

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.930 
to go into his regirock and I do go for
the<00:04:46.780> focus<00:04:46.990> blast<00:04:47.320> as<00:04:47.770> he<00:04:48.220> does<00:04:48.430> switch<00:04:48.700> into

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
the focus blast as he does switch into

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.540 
the focus blast as he does switch into
the<00:04:49.030> regirock<00:04:49.480> and<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:50.470> try<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.040> hit<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.370> red

the regirock and I try to hit the red

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.270 
the regirock and I try to hit the red
rock<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.180> unfortunately<00:04:52.840> my<00:04:53.050> focus<00:04:53.740> blast<00:04:53.920> is

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
rock but unfortunately my focus blast is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.950 
rock but unfortunately my focus blast is
going<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.700> end<00:04:54.850> up<00:04:54.910> missing<00:04:55.210> which<00:04:55.720> really

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960

capitalize on my opportunity go for

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.860 
capitalize on my opportunity go for
another<00:05:00.070> focus<00:05:00.370> class<00:05:00.730> miss<00:05:01.240> again<00:05:01.630> which

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
another focus class miss again which

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.690 
another focus class miss again which
really<00:05:02.110> sucks<00:05:02.440> he<00:05:02.950> goes<00:05:03.130> for<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.310> stone<00:05:03.550> edge

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
really sucks he goes for a stone edge

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.090 
really sucks he goes for a stone edge
and<00:05:03.940> he<00:05:04.090> ends<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:04.360> missing<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.590> then<00:05:05.860> I<00:05:05.890> have

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
and he ends up missing so then I have

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.830 
and he ends up missing so then I have
another<00:05:06.130> triangle<00:05:06.700> for<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.060> focus<00:05:07.330> blasphemous

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
another triangle for a focus blasphemous

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.230 
another triangle for a focus blasphemous
again<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.500> then<00:05:08.890> he<00:05:09.040> just<00:05:09.070> goes<00:05:09.340> first<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:10.060> set

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
again and then he just goes first to set

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.510 
again and then he just goes first to set
up<00:05:10.330> stealth<00:05:10.630> rocks<00:05:10.900> and<00:05:11.230> then<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:11.860> do<00:05:12.400> have

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
up stealth rocks and then I do have

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.820 
up stealth rocks and then I do have
another<00:05:12.550> shot<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.450> take<00:05:13.600> em<00:05:13.870> out<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.290> go<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:14.770> the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
another shot to take em out I go for the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.860 
another shot to take em out I go for the
focus<00:05:15.190> blast<00:05:15.400> finally<00:05:16.000> hit<00:05:16.210> after<00:05:16.540> missing

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
focus blast finally hit after missing

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.630 
focus blast finally hit after missing
three<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.169> a<00:05:17.230> row<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.620> that<00:05:17.950> will<00:05:18.130> definitely

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
three in a row and that will definitely

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.850 
three in a row and that will definitely
take<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.180> take<00:05:19.450> out<00:05:19.600> this<00:05:19.780> regirock<00:05:20.320> which

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
take that take out this regirock which

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.710 
take that take out this regirock which
another<00:05:21.340> another<00:05:21.760> one<00:05:21.970> of<00:05:22.060> his<00:05:22.150> Pokemon<00:05:22.540> goes

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
another another one of his Pokemon goes

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.960 
another another one of his Pokemon goes
down<00:05:22.930> so<00:05:23.860> he's<00:05:24.010> going<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.160> go<00:05:24.280> into<00:05:24.400> his<00:05:24.550> ante

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
down so he's going to go into his ante

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.180 
down so he's going to go into his ante
next<00:05:25.390> and<00:05:25.540> I'm<00:05:26.260> gonna<00:05:26.380> go<00:05:26.560> back<00:05:26.800> into<00:05:26.980> my

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
next and I'm gonna go back into my

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.300 
next and I'm gonna go back into my
spirit<00:05:27.550> soon<00:05:27.730> to<00:05:27.850> take<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.330> physical<00:05:28.780> hit<00:05:28.990> I

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
spirit soon to take the physical hit I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.230 
spirit soon to take the physical hit I
kind<00:05:30.310> of<00:05:30.400> doubt<00:05:30.580> that<00:05:30.820> he<00:05:30.880> was<00:05:30.940> going<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.120> go

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
kind of doubt that he was going to go

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.630 
kind of doubt that he was going to go
for<00:05:31.419> an<00:05:31.540> extreme<00:05:31.900> speed<00:05:32.260> because<00:05:32.650> he<00:05:32.919> already

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
for an extreme speed because he already

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.790 
for an extreme speed because he already
did<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:34.150> so<00:05:34.450> it's<00:05:34.750> kind<00:05:35.140> of<00:05:35.230> unlikely<00:05:35.590> that

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
did that so it's kind of unlikely that

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.100 
did that so it's kind of unlikely that
he<00:05:35.919> will<00:05:36.040> do<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.250> again<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.820> it's<00:05:37.600> highly

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
he will do it again and it's highly

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.450 
he will do it again and it's highly
unlikely<00:05:38.230> that<00:05:38.440> he'll<00:05:38.680> go<00:05:38.860> for<00:05:39.040> Flair<00:05:39.280> was

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
unlikely that he'll go for Flair was

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.040 
unlikely that he'll go for Flair was
because<00:05:39.760> he<00:05:39.880> doesn't<00:05:40.030> want<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.630> recoil

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
because he doesn't want the recoil

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.720 
because he doesn't want the recoil
damage<00:05:41.350> so<00:05:41.470> then<00:05:41.590> he<00:05:41.710> can't<00:05:41.950> switch<00:05:42.280> back<00:05:42.520> out

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
damage so then he can't switch back out

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.820 
damage so then he can't switch back out
because<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:43.210> stealth<00:05:43.480> rocks<00:05:43.750> so<00:05:44.500> he's<00:05:44.710> going

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
because of stealth rocks so he's going

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.650 
because of stealth rocks so he's going
to<00:05:44.890> go<00:05:45.010> for<00:05:45.250> another<00:05:45.310> move<00:05:45.669> which<00:05:45.910> is<00:05:45.940> Stone

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
to go for another move which is Stone

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.800 
to go for another move which is Stone
Edge<00:05:47.130> luckily<00:05:48.130> for<00:05:48.280> him<00:05:48.400> he<00:05:48.460> doesn't<00:05:49.210> miss<00:05:49.480> and

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
Edge luckily for him he doesn't miss and

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.730 
Edge luckily for him he doesn't miss and
my<00:05:50.260> spirit<00:05:50.980> soon<00:05:51.220> will<00:05:51.340> go<00:05:51.370> down<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.990> now<00:05:53.590> I'm

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
my spirit soon will go down so now I'm

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.590 
my spirit soon will go down so now I'm

cut not really sure why I probably
should<00:06:00.760> have<00:06:00.790> went<00:06:01.000> for<00:06:01.240> a<00:06:01.270> high<00:06:01.960> jump<00:06:02.290> kick

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
should have went for a high jump kick

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.230 
should have went for a high jump kick
but<00:06:02.919> he<00:06:03.040> entered<00:06:03.250> surviving<00:06:03.700> with<00:06:03.820> non-hp

but he entered surviving with non-hp

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.210 
but he entered surviving with non-hp
because<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.200> stone<00:06:05.410> age<00:06:05.560> unfortunately<00:06:05.740> for
