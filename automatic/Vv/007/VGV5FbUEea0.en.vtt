00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.680 
trials fusion challenge guide this is
the<00:00:06.259> archaeology<00:00:07.259> challenged<00:00:08.220> found<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
the archaeology challenged found on the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.370 
the archaeology challenged found on the
jungle<00:00:10.110> gym<00:00:10.320> karna<00:00:11.280> track<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.509> basically

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
jungle gym karna track and basically

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.900 
jungle gym karna track and basically
involves<00:00:14.099> three<00:00:15.020> buttons<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.400> some<00:00:17.400> spinning

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
involves three buttons and some spinning

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.480 
involves three buttons and some spinning
coloured<00:00:18.539> boxes<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.710> basically<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
coloured boxes so basically this is the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.000 
coloured boxes so basically this is the
first<00:00:20.580> one<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> get<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.800> got<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
first one you get to and what you got to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.800 
first one you get to and what you got to
do<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.430> you've<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.820> stop<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> certain

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
do is you've got to stop it on a certain

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.950 
do is you've got to stop it on a certain
color<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.980> after<00:00:26.670> hours<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.210> finding<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.810> out

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
color now after hours of finding it out

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.950 
color now after hours of finding it out
this<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.240> need<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.510> stop<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
this is the one you need to stop it on

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
this is the one you need to stop it on
so<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.920> bit<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.189> lines<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> one

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so I'm a little bit kind of lines to one

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
so I'm a little bit kind of lines to one
set<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> colors<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.570> paused<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
set of colors but that I paused the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.260 
set of colors but that I paused the
screen<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.149> one

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
screen so you can look it that's the one

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.360 
screen so you can look it that's the one
you've<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> stop<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:38.040> button

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you've got to stop at the first button

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.209 
you've got to stop at the first button
you<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.149> continue<00:00:39.480> through<00:00:40.079> tracked<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you then continue through tracked like a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
you then continue through tracked like a
pro<00:00:42.950> continue<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> track<00:00:45.020> go<00:00:46.020> enter

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
pro continue through the track go enter

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
pro continue through the track go enter
the<00:00:46.680> second<00:00:47.070> button<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> when<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the second button and when you get to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
the second button and when you get to
the<00:00:47.940> second<00:00:48.420> bun<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.200> guys<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> stand

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the second bun you guys do have to stand

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
the second bun you guys do have to stand
on<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> let<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.910> spin<00:00:51.239> round<00:00:51.420> until<00:00:51.870> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
on it and let it spin round until it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.490 
on it and let it spin round until it
reaches<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:56.030> configuration<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
reaches this configuration so that's the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
reaches this configuration so that's the
configuration<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> second<00:00:59.760> button<00:01:00.230> read

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
configuration for the second button read

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.219 
configuration for the second button read
it<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.149> then<00:01:03.149> finish<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> rest<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.170> us

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
it well and then finish the rest of us

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
it well and then finish the rest of us
you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.530> you've<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:04.799> way<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.129> again<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you know you've got way for it again so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.340 
you know you've got way for it again so
I<00:01:05.909> won't<00:01:06.060> pause<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.450> again<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:06.869> but

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I won't pause it again this time but

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.270 
I won't pause it again this time but
that<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> goes

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
that was the one this one there it goes

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.750 
that was the one this one there it goes
again

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
again

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969 
again
so<00:01:12.330> once<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.960> comes<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.470> you've<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
so once that one comes in you've got to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.380 
so once that one comes in you've got to
move<00:01:14.130> off<00:01:14.430> you've<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.880> pretty<00:01:15.030> Swift

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
move off you've got to be pretty Swift

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
move off you've got to be pretty Swift
with<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.229> turn<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:16.950> quickly

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
with it because they turn pretty quickly

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399 
with it because they turn pretty quickly
and<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:19.229> you've

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and you don't all see know if you've

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.380 
and you don't all see know if you've
definitely<00:01:19.890> left<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.360> not

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
definitely left on the right one or not

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.080 
definitely left on the right one or not
and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.409> basically<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> move<00:01:23.070> forward<00:01:23.729> into

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
and then basically you move forward into

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
and then basically you move forward into
track<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.330> third<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.689> final<00:01:28.320> button<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
track to the third and final button and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
track to the third and final button and
if<00:01:29.310> you've<00:01:29.460> done<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> first<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.240> correctly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
if you've done the first two correctly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.010 
if you've done the first two correctly
only<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.740> bottom<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.640> move<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
only the bottom one will move so it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.670 
only the bottom one will move so it
doesn't<00:01:34.320> matter

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
doesn't matter

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.850 
doesn't matter
and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.490> fix<00:01:36.240> into<00:01:36.509> place<00:01:36.720> you'll<00:01:37.650> hear

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
and it will fix into place you'll hear

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
and it will fix into place you'll hear
this<00:01:37.950> weird<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.520> noise<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this weird little noise and that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
this weird little noise and that
basement<00:01:39.869> means<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> you've<00:01:40.500> solved<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
basement means that you've solved the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.060 
basement means that you've solved the
riddle<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.329> all<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.320> simply<00:01:43.590> is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
at through quite a few faults even

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.389 
at through quite a few faults even
though<00:02:07.810> I'm<00:02:07.930> doing<00:02:08.110> my<00:02:08.259> best<00:02:08.619> at<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.979> end<00:02:09.130> here
