00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.820
 Hello my dear, I have you 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.190
 I promised from the sncf 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.170
 extreme mascara still an extra review 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.120
 will do and that comes here 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.180
 I'll show you now how I like that 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.730
 mascara application there is only one here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.590
 Little trick to pay attention to them 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 can be layered very well but you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.590
 gets a much better result though 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.739
 from the beginning on you order as much as you do 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.899
 you want to apply that in the end 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.609
 So not three layers because with everyone 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.589
 stratum intensifies this 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.960
 fly legs effect as well is mine 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.579
 bottle still pretty full since me 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 me only a few weeks ago 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.800
 bought and some mascara in the test 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.899
 So I had used in exchange and me 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 must say that it is extreme in seoul 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.370
 mascara has cost about 3 euros I have 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 to send me about douglas 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 but also in every dm and i am 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.229
 really excited about the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.170
 mascara 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.110
 that is very very dark very black it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.090
 a lot of product on the brush is the best 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.430
 very much compared to other bristles 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.049
 big and can be well dosed but 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.560
 as I said when you are the first 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.570
 Order tries as much product as you do 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.119
 want to have on the eyelashes 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.310
 then this fly will be effect 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.920
 do not occur that way you will 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.049
 Remember this is the only thing I have now 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.750
 if you speak of negative at all 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.549
 I noticed and you can see it 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 is easy to apply 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.600
 and does not look like flying legs 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.590
 I have only one layer here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 applied 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 Of course you can also layer more 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 use if you then the result 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.950
 better like that always comes up 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.289
 the personal feel on it but 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.840
 I think it's as good as it is for me 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.179
 she lengthens her that condenses it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.240
 what is really normal for girls 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.600
 have lilac in the eyelashes and also normal 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.719
 long eyelashes it really is a very eyelash 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.330
 very prolonged result at the end 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.640
 So it comes out in comparison to mine 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.340
 other mascara of lancom or of 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.530
 cecile who have already tested 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 is that really something? 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.710
 better here you can see it very well 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.810
 on 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.660
 picture the right eye is not deceived 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 the left one already takes the best 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.070
 swing of the eyelash curler wonderful 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.890
 with you on and you really come up 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.380
 at the back of the outer eyelid and also 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.170
 At the inner corner of the eye there is no problem 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.150
 and even the lower eyelashes i did 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.180
 can say that is not 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.430
 crumbles there are no unsightly patches 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.410
 at the top of the song or she also stamps 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.240
 not down she does not crumble either 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.190
 spread over the day and stops with me 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.350
 easy 12 hours without that 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.360
 have to do anything or that I have 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.400
 fool to do I'm so really 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.860
 very, very enthusiastic about the bears you 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.420
 the just times in the dm for three euros 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.970
 you can not do much wrong 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.830
 this is an incredibly beautiful mascara 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.960
 so it is suitable for my eyelashes 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.060
 very good but should stop 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.100
 look how that leaves you so 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.590
 Of course it's not like that 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.020
 That's why it can be the same now 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.500
 only from me on my eyelashes related 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.390
 supposed to be a one video but I can 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.210
 really recommend it is very very good 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.800
 for the sensationally small price I would have 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.450
 never thought of it that way 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.280
 nice result I am delivering 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.530
 curious if you know who have some 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.180
 I already wrote it 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.220
 yes what have you experience with the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.470
 may you made that I have indeed the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.540
 normal volume mascara in black 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.880
 bottle with the pink inscription it 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.190
 she probably still in waterproof there have 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.540
 I do not do it because that's me 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.820
 sufficient also from the result I need 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.100
 the not waterproof that is enough for me 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.230
 the whole day it keeps it in place 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.490
 and do not put and crumb and that is 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.530
 for me the most important 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.060
 Now I am curious about your opinion 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.960
 and please write me in the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.420
