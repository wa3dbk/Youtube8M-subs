00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
is for yellows these are actually really

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.609 
is for yellows these are actually really
good<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:08.369> color<00:02:08.610> casts<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.450> use<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:10.440> images

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
good for color casts I use these images

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.760 
good for color casts I use these images
a<00:02:10.920> lot<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.489> baby<00:02:11.760> images<00:02:12.690> babies<00:02:13.290> tend<00:02:13.650> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
a lot with baby images babies tend to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.030 
a lot with baby images babies tend to
have

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
have

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.679 
have
a lot<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.310> extra<00:02:14.640> redness<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.209> their<00:02:15.360> skin

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
a lot of extra redness in their skin

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.890 
a lot of extra redness in their skin
some<00:02:16.379> babies<00:02:16.769> have<00:02:17.180> extra<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> lot<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.569> extra

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
some babies have extra a lot of extra

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.589 
some babies have extra a lot of extra
yellow<00:02:19.109> in<00:02:19.379> their<00:02:19.530> skin<00:02:19.879> so<00:02:20.879> these<00:02:21.030> are<00:02:21.239> really

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
yellow in their skin so these are really

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.420 
yellow in their skin so these are really
good<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.560> also<00:02:22.920> good<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.280> other

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
good for that but also good for other

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.069 
good for that but also good for other
images<00:02:23.909> where<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.239> might<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.659> little<00:02:24.930> bit

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
images where you might get a little bit

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.949 
images where you might get a little bit
of<00:02:25.170> color<00:02:25.560> casting<00:02:26.129> as<00:02:26.280> well<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.900> don't<00:02:27.900> think

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
of color casting as well I don't think

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.569 
of color casting as well I don't think
that<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.469> image<00:02:28.680> needs<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.459> I'm<00:02:29.549> just

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
that this image needs that so I'm just

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.270 
that this image needs that so I'm just
gonna<00:02:29.849> skip<00:02:30.180> over<00:02:30.329> those<00:02:30.859> we<00:02:31.859> have<00:02:32.010> color

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
gonna skip over those we have color

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.539 
gonna skip over those we have color
enhanced<00:02:32.909> blues<00:02:33.230> which<00:02:34.230> really<00:02:34.680> does<00:02:35.220> exactly

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
enhanced blues which really does exactly

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.910 
enhanced blues which really does exactly
what<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.939> says<00:02:35.989> enhances<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.170> pops<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.590> blues

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
what it says enhances and pops the blues

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.009 
what it says enhances and pops the blues
I<00:02:38.250> don't<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> lot<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.569> in<00:02:39.689> this<00:02:39.840> image

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
I don't have a lot of that in this image

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.319 
I don't have a lot of that in this image
so<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:40.379> gonna<00:02:40.530> skip<00:02:40.829> this<00:02:41.010> one<00:02:41.069> as<00:02:41.370> well<00:02:41.579> when

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
so I'm gonna skip this one as well when

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.149 
so I'm gonna skip this one as well when
you<00:02:42.420> add<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.870> one<00:02:43.079> you'll<00:02:43.290> notice<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:44.010> a

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
you add this one you'll notice just a

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.740 
you add this one you'll notice just a
little<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.519> more<00:02:44.639> coolness<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.389> image

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
little bit more coolness to the image

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.280 
little bit more coolness to the image
also<00:02:46.909> color<00:02:47.909> pop<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.209> little<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.780> am<00:02:48.900> gonna<00:02:49.079> click

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
also color pop a little I am gonna click

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.979 
also color pop a little I am gonna click
on<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.489> one<00:02:50.730> tends<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.359> just<00:02:51.629> pop

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
on this one this one tends to just pop

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.039 
on this one this one tends to just pop
the<00:02:52.200> colors<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> little<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:53.069> more<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:54.239> suits

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
the colors a little bit more this suits

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.890 
the colors a little bit more this suits
this<00:02:55.379> image<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.919> think<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.430> lot<00:02:56.780> there's<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> lot

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
this image I think a lot there's a lot

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.899 
this image I think a lot there's a lot
of<00:02:58.169> really<00:02:58.409> pretty<00:02:58.560> color<00:02:58.919> in<00:02:59.159> this<00:02:59.310> image<00:02:59.519> so

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
of really pretty color in this image so

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.670 
of really pretty color in this image so
I<00:02:59.939> think<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.419> a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.169> color<00:03:01.409> pop

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
I think that a little bit of color pop

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.819 
I think that a little bit of color pop
is<00:03:01.889> really<00:03:02.159> nice<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.810> next<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:04.260> presets

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
is really nice the next two presets

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.330 
is really nice the next two presets
cover<00:03:05.730> contrast<00:03:06.480> contrast<00:03:07.409> a<00:03:07.919> little<00:03:08.189> and

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
cover contrast contrast a little and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.300 
cover contrast contrast a little and
contrast<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:09.060> lot<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.590> think<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.129> tell

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
contrast a lot so I think you can tell

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
contrast a lot so I think you can tell
it<00:03:11.459> what<00:03:11.609> they<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.819> pretty<00:03:12.150> much<00:03:12.290> they<00:03:13.290> add

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it what they do pretty much they add

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.250 
it what they do pretty much they add
varying<00:03:14.010> amounts<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.430> contrast<00:03:15.049> you<00:03:16.049> could

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
varying amounts of contrast you could

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.259 
varying amounts of contrast you could
hover<00:03:16.470> over<00:03:16.829> them<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:17.280> click<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.700> them<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:18.120> see

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
hover over them or click on them to see

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.059 
hover over them or click on them to see
exactly<00:03:18.299> how<00:03:18.810> much<00:03:18.959> they<00:03:19.260> add<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.470> for<00:03:19.919> this

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
exactly how much they add up for this

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.250 
exactly how much they add up for this
image<00:03:20.400> I'm<00:03:20.609> going<00:03:20.639> to<00:03:20.849> click<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.359> contrast<00:03:22.019> a

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.099 
image I'm going to click on contrast a
little<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.889> don't<00:03:23.819> think<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:24.269> image<00:03:24.540> needs<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
little I don't think this image needs a

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.960 
little I don't think this image needs a
lot<00:03:25.379> of<00:03:25.590> contrast<00:03:26.069> I'm<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.609> gonna<00:03:26.790> add<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
lot of contrast I'm just gonna add a

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.089 
lot of contrast I'm just gonna add a
little<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.590> next<00:03:29.129> seven<00:03:30.120> images<00:03:30.269> here

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
little now the next seven images here

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.580 
little now the next seven images here
not<00:03:32.099> seven<00:03:32.459> images<00:03:32.609> seven<00:03:33.299> presets<00:03:33.870> cover

not seven images seven presets cover

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.879 
not seven images seven presets cover
exposure<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.269> first<00:03:36.569> three<00:03:37.079> are<00:03:37.379> for

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
exposure the first three are for

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.280 
exposure the first three are for
brightening<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.489> image<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.750> first<00:03:39.989> one<00:03:40.169> is

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
brightening your image the first one is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.250 
brightening your image the first one is
brighten<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.709> little<00:03:41.010> brighten<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.609> lot<00:03:41.819> and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
brighten a little brighten a lot and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.819 
brighten a little brighten a lot and
then<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.409> third<00:03:43.680> one<00:03:43.889> is<00:03:44.040> bright<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:44.489> center

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
then the third one is bright and center

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.460 
then the third one is bright and center
so<00:03:46.829> I<00:03:47.220> really<00:03:48.030> don't<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.299> this<00:03:48.810> image<00:03:49.049> needs

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
so I really don't think this image needs

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.939 
so I really don't think this image needs
brightening<00:03:50.659> so<00:03:51.659> I'm<00:03:51.840> not<00:03:52.019> going<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.530> click<00:03:52.769> on

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
brightening so I'm not going to click on

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.059 
brightening so I'm not going to click on
any<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.310> these<00:03:54.229> but<00:03:55.229> these<00:03:55.409> are<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> great<00:03:55.829> way

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
any of these but these are a great way

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.140 
any of these but these are a great way
to<00:03:56.099> add<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:56.639> bit<00:03:56.879> of<00:03:56.970> brightness

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
to add a little bit of brightness

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.089

down and choose color pop a little and
I'm<00:07:09.350> also<00:07:09.590> going<00:07:09.920> to<00:07:10.040> do<00:07:10.510> contrast<00:07:11.510> a<00:07:11.690> little

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:22.220 
a little and I think that it needs maybe

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.030 
a little and I think that it needs maybe
just<00:07:22.550> a<00:07:22.700> teeny<00:07:23.090> bit<00:07:23.360> more<00:07:23.390> or<00:07:23.690> less<00:07:23.840> let's<00:07:24.350> try

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
bumping it up just a little bit up to 33

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.840 
bumping it up just a little bit up to 33
there<00:07:28.840> that<00:07:29.840> I'm<00:07:29.960> going<00:07:30.200> to<00:07:30.730> skip<00:07:31.730> over
