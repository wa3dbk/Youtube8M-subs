little bit awesome with intonation yeah
work<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> bit<00:02:51.129> as<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.459> play<00:02:51.670> on<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.879> on<00:02:52.180> a

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
work a bit as if you play on a on a

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.660 
work a bit as if you play on a on a
saxophone<00:02:53.049> or<00:02:53.079> something<00:02:53.470> you<00:02:53.530> know

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
saxophone or something you know

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.119 
saxophone or something you know
intonation<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.440> articulation<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.739> all<00:02:57.010> of

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
intonation and articulation and all of

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.380 
intonation and articulation and all of
those<00:02:57.220> sort<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.459> techniques<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:58.030> think<00:02:58.269> he

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
those sort of techniques I think he

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.500 
those sort of techniques I think he
focused<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.870> them<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.379> lot<00:02:59.650> which<00:03:00.400> improves<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
focused on them a lot which improves the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.050 
focused on them a lot which improves the
whole<00:03:01.720> general<00:03:02.109> ensemble<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.890> lot<00:03:03.160> more<00:03:03.340> which

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
whole general ensemble a lot more which

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.080 
whole general ensemble a lot more which
in<00:03:04.239> turn<00:03:04.480> kind<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.870> gives<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.090> feeling

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
in turn kind of gives you the feeling

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.460 
in turn kind of gives you the feeling
and<00:03:07.359> expression<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.959> needed<00:03:08.319> in<00:03:08.440> that
