sony ericsson xperia the HTC g1 and the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.330 
sony ericsson xperia the HTC g1 and the
blackberry<00:00:23.099> bolt<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> let's<00:00:25.500> turn<00:00:26.099> them<00:00:26.220> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
blackberry bolt so let's turn them all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.339 
blackberry bolt so let's turn them all
on<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> same<00:00:27.180> time<00:00:27.239> and<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.810> which<00:00:28.020> one

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
on at the same time and see which one

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:39.490 
on at the same time and see which one
boots<00:00:28.829> the<00:00:29.520> fastest

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.920 

so<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.830> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.160> see<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.730> BlackBerry<00:00:42.420> turned

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so as you can see the BlackBerry turned

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.230 
so as you can see the BlackBerry turned
on<00:00:43.260> immediately<00:00:44.480> and<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.380> using

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
on immediately and it's actually using

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.840 
on immediately and it's actually using
the<00:00:48.240> BlackBerry<00:00:49.310> operating<00:00:50.310> system<00:00:50.670> just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the BlackBerry operating system just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.049 
the BlackBerry operating system just
blackberry<00:00:51.300> OS<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:53.240> HTC<00:00:54.240> uses<00:00:55.670> Android<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
blackberry OS the HTC uses Android and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.110 
blackberry OS the HTC uses Android and
the<00:00:57.750> sony<00:00:58.020> ericsson<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.950> using<00:00:59.520> Windows

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
the sony ericsson is using Windows

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000 
the sony ericsson is using Windows
Mobile

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.890 

as<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.030> see

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.340 

so<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.620> BlackBerry<00:01:08.010> turned<00:01:08.340> on

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
so the BlackBerry turned on

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.650 
so the BlackBerry turned on
significantly<00:01:10.350> faster<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.520> other<00:01:12.390> two

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
significantly faster than the other two

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.770 
significantly faster than the other two
phones<00:01:12.840> let's<00:01:13.680> start<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.640> Xperia<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
phones let's start with the Xperia it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.270 
phones let's start with the Xperia it
has<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> sleep<00:01:16.770> black<00:01:17.460> outer<00:01:17.850> shell<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.280> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
has a sleep black outer shell and it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
has a sleep black outer shell and it's
metallic<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.420> makes<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:22.020> bit

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
metallic so it makes it a little bit

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.070 
metallic so it makes it a little bit
heavier<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> very<00:01:24.360> nice<00:01:24.600> like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
heavier but it has a very nice like

heavier but it has a very nice like
compact<00:01:25.590> size<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:25.950> feels<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.970> fits<00:01:27.240> nicely

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
compact size and feels it fits nicely

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.460 
compact size and feels it fits nicely
into<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.050> palm<00:01:28.440> and<00:01:29.990> since<00:01:30.990> its<00:01:31.140> using

with<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.930> angle<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.640> easier<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050

with an angle to make it easier for you
to<00:02:04.080> see<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.740> you're<00:02:04.890> typing<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:05.940> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
to see what you're typing because as you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.590 
to see what you're typing because as you
hold<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.750> screen<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.830> more<00:02:08.220> angle<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
hold it that screen is more angle and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.640 
hold it that screen is more angle and
the<00:02:10.200> typing<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.250> pretty<00:02:12.000> easy

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the typing with it is pretty easy

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.920 
the typing with it is pretty easy
it<00:02:14.130> also<00:02:14.280> guesses<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.060> you're<00:02:15.209> saying<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it also guesses what you're saying the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.350 
it also guesses what you're saying the
keys<00:02:16.230> are<00:02:16.530> very<00:02:16.590> flat<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.940> can't<00:02:18.209> really

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
keys are very flat so you can't really

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.750 
keys are very flat so you can't really
distinguish<00:02:18.900> between<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.650> ring<00:02:19.950> keys<00:02:20.250> but

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
distinguish between the ring keys but

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.740 
distinguish between the ring keys but
they<00:02:21.120> are<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.930> pretty<00:02:22.860> easy<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.430> use<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
they are so pretty easy to use the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.900 
they are so pretty easy to use the
problem<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.500> problem<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:26.070> can<00:02:26.430> really

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
problem one problem that I can really

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.360 
problem one problem that I can really
see<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.780> top<00:02:27.989> row<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.500> very<00:02:28.739> close<00:02:29.070> to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
see is the top row it's very close to

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.680 
see is the top row it's very close to
the<00:02:30.769> screen<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.100> so<00:02:32.459> if<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.880> have<00:02:33.150> bigger

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
the screen and so if you have bigger

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.990 
the screen and so if you have bigger
fingers<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.560> might<00:02:34.769> just<00:02:34.980> keep<00:02:35.190> running<00:02:35.459> into

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
fingers you might just keep running into

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.090 
fingers you might just keep running into
them<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.900> might<00:02:37.080> make<00:02:37.230> typing<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.860> little

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
them and it might make typing a little

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.720 
them and it might make typing a little
bit<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.519> difficult<00:02:38.970> look<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.290> G<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.220> has

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
bit more difficult look at the G it has

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.000 
bit more difficult look at the G it has
a<00:02:41.760> rubbery<00:02:42.510> outer<00:02:42.780> shell<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.620> is

significantly larger than the exterior

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.620 
significantly larger than the exterior

the touchscreen for this phone is more

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.050 
the touchscreen for this phone is more
sensitive<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:55.080> don't<00:02:55.650> need<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.579> apply

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
sensitive so you don't need to apply

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.140 
sensitive so you don't need to apply

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
has been it's design is more

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.750 
has been it's design is more
symmetrically<00:03:35.620> created<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.709> has<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> more
