I've<00:01:21.689> been<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> staying<00:01:22.470> clear<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> them

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
I've been kind of staying clear of them

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
having that a memory issue problem I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
having that a memory issue problem I
think<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:27.570> something<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.049> do<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
think it has something to do with the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
think it has something to do with the
RAM<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.369> something<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:29.970> about<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
RAM or something like it's not about the

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.330 
RAM or something like it's not about the
memory<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.470> phone<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.950> try<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
memory on your phone so try not to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.550 
memory on your phone so try not to
delete<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.060> things<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.659> apps<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.439> stuff

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
delete like things like apps and stuff

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.899 
delete like things like apps and stuff
that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.979> because<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.729> you're

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that you have because you think you're

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.160 
that you have because you think you're
running<00:01:36.060> low<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.329> memory<00:01:36.600> has<00:01:36.840> something<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
running low on memory has something to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
running low on memory has something to
do<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> RAM<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> may<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
do with the RAM and you may have to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.399 
do with the RAM and you may have to
change<00:01:39.030> some<00:01:39.390> settings<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.200> all

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
