00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.359
 helpless and welcome to another chapter 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.309
 of little less in which we will see what 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.660
 proposals of the new team you made 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 well here are all comments had 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.880
 a lot of comments then in 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.740
 total 72 plus with my answers and such and 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.140
 good youtube has targeted them here 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 made a summary for you to choose 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.250
 yourselves the team within what 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 that you have chosen the main stage place and 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 good as much educate me as goal gross 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
 some repeated that I will not put for 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.890
 the fact that they are repeated and I 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.660
 I want some good number, let's start with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.100
 strip remove that is what I said that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 I like that we also have what is very 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.149
 elective beast and that is a little what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 you will be watching over there screen 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 diminished is preferred is a version 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.100
 It's very beast and I think they can have 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 fake smack so you can catch the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.640
 Pokemon 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.770
 julian therapy 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.630
 I think we are in a great ideal of 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600
 'dragon ball' hilux that maybe I like 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.290
