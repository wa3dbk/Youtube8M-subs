today<00:01:16.820> we're<00:01:17.180> working<00:01:17.570> with<00:01:17.720> some<00:01:18.170> 85

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.590 
just over 200 individual baselines and
that<00:01:24.770> gives<00:01:25.100> us<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.520> better<00:01:25.729> overall<00:01:26.180> package

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
that gives us a better overall package

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.910 
that gives us a better overall package
this<00:01:27.380> type<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.650> winemaking<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.610> very<00:01:29.920> blending

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
this type of winemaking is very blending

add a little sugar and we'll go through

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.920 
add a little sugar and we'll go through
a<00:01:39.890> second<00:01:40.400> fermentation<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:41.479> time<00:01:41.689> in<00:01:41.840> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.490 

here<00:01:54.760> we<00:01:54.910> can<00:01:55.060> see<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.480> yeast<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.050> has

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
here we can see the yeast that has

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.190 
here we can see the yeast that has
caused<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.580> second<00:01:58.000> fermentation<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.840> happen

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
caused a second fermentation to happen

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.220 
caused a second fermentation to happen
inside<00:01:59.560> this<00:01:59.830> bottle<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.790> wine<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:01.390> bottled

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
inside this bottle the wine is bottled

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.140 
inside this bottle the wine is bottled
in<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.920> spring<00:02:03.190> following<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.730> fall<00:02:03.970> harvest

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
in the spring following the fall harvest

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.990 
in the spring following the fall harvest
with<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> little<00:02:05.050> bit<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.260> yeast<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.800> sugar<00:02:06.000> we

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
with a little bit of yeast and sugar we

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.630 
with a little bit of yeast and sugar we
then<00:02:07.380> stack<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> bottles<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.070> these<00:02:09.250> stacks

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
then stack the bottles in these stacks

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.460 
then stack the bottles in these stacks
where<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.420> second<00:02:10.810> fermentation<00:02:10.929> will

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
where the second fermentation will

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.260 
where the second fermentation will
happen<00:02:11.890> typically<00:02:12.400> within<00:02:12.610> two<00:02:12.910> or<00:02:12.940> four

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
happen typically within two or four

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.840
