think it goes and I got that's right
kind<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.809> know<00:00:59.929> it<00:01:00.140> doesn't<00:01:00.379> seem<00:01:00.620> like<00:01:00.769> we've

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
kind of know it doesn't seem like we've

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.319 
kind of know it doesn't seem like we've
got<00:01:01.069> a<00:01:01.100> lot<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.309> thread<00:01:01.609> tension<00:01:01.819> on<00:01:02.120> there<00:01:02.269> I

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
got a lot of thread tension on there I

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.680 
got a lot of thread tension on there I
might<00:01:02.479> have<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.690> take<00:01:02.839> a<00:01:02.870> look<00:01:03.170> at<00:01:03.289> that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
might have to take a look at that

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.940 
might have to take a look at that
doesn't<00:01:05.690> seem<00:01:05.900> like<00:01:06.170> there's<00:01:06.380> any<00:01:06.560> thread

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't seem like there's any thread

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.780 
doesn't seem like there's any thread
tension<00:01:08.860> let's<00:01:09.860> see<00:01:10.070> if<00:01:10.190> we<00:01:10.310> can<00:01:10.460> hook<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
tension let's see if we can hook the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.840 
tension let's see if we can hook the
bobbin<00:01:11.210> thread

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bobbin thread

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.660 
bobbin thread
here<00:01:13.009> okay<00:01:14.009> it<00:01:14.070> looks<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.490> did

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
here okay it looks like you did

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
here okay it looks like you did
something<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.210> yep<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.540> got<00:01:15.689> bobbin<00:01:16.049> thread

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
something there yep we got bobbin thread

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
something there yep we got bobbin thread
so<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.130> sure<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> says<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:20.100> that's<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so I'm pretty sure it says so that's a
