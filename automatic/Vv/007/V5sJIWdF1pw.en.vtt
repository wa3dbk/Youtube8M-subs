00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
this kind of f'd it over our souls but

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.620 
this kind of f'd it over our souls but
look<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.290> okay<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.730> natural

running<00:00:36.930> conditions<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:38.280> ancient<00:00:38.640> probably

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
running conditions this ancient probably

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
running conditions this ancient probably
had<00:00:39.800> by<00:00:40.800> looks<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.579> how<00:00:41.730> clean<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:43.940> probably

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
had by looks on how clean it is probably

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.160 
had by looks on how clean it is probably
my<00:00:45.180> guess<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> probably<00:00:47.840> under<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> hundred

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
my guess is probably under a hundred
