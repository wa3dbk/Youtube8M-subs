upstairs<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.930> communication<00:03:03.650> suite

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
upstairs this is the communication suite

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.740 
upstairs this is the communication suite
so<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.220> backbone<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.850> aircraft<00:03:05.269> all<00:03:05.570> the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
so the backbone of the aircraft all the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.240 
so the backbone of the aircraft all the
phones<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.230> see<00:03:06.440> onboard

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
phones that you see onboard

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.500 
phones that you see onboard
really<00:03:07.460> connects<00:03:07.790> up<00:03:07.940> into<00:03:08.150> this<00:03:08.300> air<00:03:08.450> how

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
really connects up into this air how

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.650 
really connects up into this air how
many<00:03:08.660> phones<00:03:08.870> at<00:03:09.380> 87<00:03:09.980> phones<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.700> basically<00:03:11.420> on

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
many phones at 87 phones so basically on

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.990 
many phones at 87 phones so basically on
one<00:03:11.870> side<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.380> all<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> phones<00:03:12.920> on<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.250> jet<00:03:13.490> on

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
one side is all the phones on the jet on

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.490 
one side is all the phones on the jet on
the<00:03:14.060> other<00:03:14.300> side<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.690> phone<00:03:14.900> lines<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.410> they

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the other side are phone lines if they

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960 
the other side are phone lines if they
have<00:03:15.620> available<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.370> they're<00:03:16.520> just<00:03:16.730> plugging

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
have available so they're just plugging

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.520 
have available so they're just plugging
and<00:03:17.240> playing<00:03:17.510> now<00:03:17.780> what's<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.080> difference<00:03:18.410> in

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
and playing now what's the difference in

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.040 
and playing now what's the difference in
color<00:03:18.770> over<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.160> on<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.460> right<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:20.420> normal

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
color over here on the right the normal

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.170 
color over here on the right the normal
communications<00:03:21.950> are<00:03:22.250> in<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.550> gray<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.060> then

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
communications are in the gray and then

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.600 
communications are in the gray and then
the<00:03:23.390> red<00:03:23.570> is<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:24.140> basically<00:03:24.980> once<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.250> want<00:03:25.520> to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610
