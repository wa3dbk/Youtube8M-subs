00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.760
 I know this last harry potter face 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.949
 worth seeing this movie is the scene that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.949
 I won from voldemort it was sensational 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.059
 The word spoiler comes from the verb and spain. 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.710
 what does it mean to ruin 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.510
 something and the word spoiler 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 popularized as being a piece of a 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.530
 series or movie that you have not seen yet 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.140

 ends up even if you have not yet seen that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.000
 It was nice to have a famous franchise that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
 ended in 2007 everyone has an obligation 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.390
 to know how the cable is more or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.430
 less as a person complaining that he did not know 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 that the titanic sink at the end of the movie 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.460

 Globe the whole brazil see that the spoiler 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.009
 will sprout somewhere on the internet or 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.820
 Someone will finish talking in the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.500
 globe 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 Fudeu general but for more that everybody 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.409
 know it's not cool to tell some 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 thing that the person has not ever seen 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.890
 have that pole and finish talking 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.180
 something and most of the time 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.210
 I watched the fucking series 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 just want to talk to stop you 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.329
 I spoke yesterday to watch the last one. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.240
 lord of the rings has seen the man is gone 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.500
 It does not fit here, it's not just about wringing 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.649
 if you cold tonight in the north of the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.649
 Last 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.170
 It's a face, it's a joke and it does not die. 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.420
 But now I also know that he does not 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.550
 It seems to us an exaggeration but it is not if you 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.050
 tell me that the character can not 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.340
 be some tense scene from that 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.470
 character that he is in a situation 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.660
 of life and death and now you already know 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.760
 it will be life because some idiot 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.650
 said before you watch it, that's it. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.490
 especially for who is this game of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.320
 thrones because game of thrones is the series 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.210
 most unpredictable world does not matter 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.190
 that character is you never know if 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.530
 he will die they really kill 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.480
 any character without cause even though he 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.890
 whether the main character is different 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.140
 when you watch a series like 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.450
