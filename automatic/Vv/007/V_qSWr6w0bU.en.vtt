00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.500

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.500
 of film and television chooses in Spain 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.420
 this visit 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.670
 days to rest and to be with the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.380
 family so nothing better than one of 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.450
 those movies with which to spend a good 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.620
 long and do not give many turns to the coconut 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.960
 that's why we already have the rest of the year 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.240
 thanks to the tour of the muppets we will see 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.250
 the rené pay frog and company leave 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.560
 tour around some European capitals like 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.990
 madrid or berlin but they will not get rid of 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.000
 chaos not even abroad because 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.710
 they will be involuntarily trapped in 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 an international intrigue that they lead 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.210
 Konstantin the biggest criminal of the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.250
 world and the living image of the René frog and 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.510
 Dominique your vile buddy 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.400

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.670
 so you can listen to ricky gervais 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.280
 ya tina fey that is worth it in addition 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.350
 ign take the opportunity and review 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.900
 those movies in which the protos are 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.330
 dolls that have ripped us more than one 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.310
 smile and that have not necessarily been 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.590
 designed and designed for the delight of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.659
 the kids in the house 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.549
 and following with movies in which 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.280
 protagonists are not flesh and blood 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.460
 here is great news for all 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.590
 fans of animation tapes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.210
 Apparently Disney has already started the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.000
 preparations to take to the cinemas 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.710

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.170
 animation based on the world of 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.690
 videogames breaks ralph premiered in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.729
 theaters in 2012 and the fans of 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 everyone could appreciate how the 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.690
 film tackled a story with a 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.670
 thematic focused on a way of 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.149
 entertainment born in the 80s 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.860
 super mario sonic or pacman are some 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.110
 of the winks that are made to this world 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.450
 audiovisual considered by some as 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.300
 the eighth art that you would like to play 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.670
 You see in this second installment 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.250
 if you see the new boy goonies is 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.180
 that you did not have childhood that's the way it is and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.370
 it fits discussion 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.980
 Richard Donner has confirmed that there will be 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.930
 sequel to the goonies if friends after 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.539
 several years of rumors and speculations 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.820
 the director has definitely given light 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.310
 green to the new project as told 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.680
 through the American website tmc 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.959
 it is also everything seems to indicate that 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.880
 making brand gordi and the rest of the cast 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.040
 with which a whole 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.440
 generation of children in the 80s and 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.209
 early 90 could form 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.400
 part of this new adventure a 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.470
 momentazo remember in full rule that 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.850
 sure it thrills more than 30 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.890
 I want nostalgic 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.350
 it seems they want to retire to harrison 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.570
 for his quasi-life post 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.340
 indiana jones so before that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.310
 anything that man already happens 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.770

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.510
 although lady is her most famous role and 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.520
 nobody like him will ever wear the hat and 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.830
 the fort whip has also left us 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.080
 some spectacular roles in 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.660
 pure entertainment movies worthy 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.630

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.210
 we have all and with some we have 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.430
 released a tear when recalling it and 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.130
 is that harrison has been up to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.840
 president of usa in air force one and 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.450

 he did not have a vinegar- like face since 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.280
 He married ali mcbeal 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.320

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.090
