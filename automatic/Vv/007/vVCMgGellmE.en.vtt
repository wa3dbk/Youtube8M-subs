00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
let me just see if I block in one tree

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.709 
let me just see if I block in one tree
that's<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.619> same<00:01:22.920> thing<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
this seem to be a logical tree at the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.639 
this seem to be a logical tree at the
back<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:01.999> the<00:02:02.999> people<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.749> still<00:02:04.289> sort

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
of noise okay I can see some of these

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.330 
of noise okay I can see some of these
branches<00:02:10.259> go<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.490> way<00:02:12.500> okay<00:02:13.500> some<00:02:13.950> brands

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
branches go in that way okay some brands

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.670 
branches go in that way okay some brands
going<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.910> will<00:02:15.300> be

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
going and will be

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
things or see trees in the mass and then

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.130 
things or see trees in the mass and then
and<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:29.030> go<00:02:29.239> ahead<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.720> identify<00:02:31.180> your<00:02:32.180> your

and then go ahead and identify your your
three<00:02:33.439> phones<00:02:33.890> all<00:02:34.280> right<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.120> let's<00:02:35.569> go<00:02:36.019> for

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
three phones all right so let's go for

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.759 
three phones all right so let's go for
that<00:02:37.189> one<00:02:37.640> there<00:02:37.970> with<00:02:38.359> maybe<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.349> little<00:02:39.500> bit

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
that one there with maybe a little bit

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.809 
that one there with maybe a little bit
stronger<00:02:40.250> treat<00:02:40.939> run<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:42.129> making<00:02:43.129> connection

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
stronger treat run and making connection

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.140 
stronger treat run and making connection
there<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.420> would<00:02:44.750> be<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.049> foliage<00:02:45.560> there

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
there this would be the foliage there

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.759 
there this would be the foliage there
okay<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.980> way<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.989> could<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:51.409> all

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
okay and in that way and it could go all

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.089 
okay and in that way and it could go all
the<00:02:51.829> way<00:02:52.280> down<00:02:52.819> say<00:02:53.239> through<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:57.099> through

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
this well we got one we got one tree now

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.240 
this well we got one we got one tree now
remember<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.389> lot<00:03:08.750> them<00:03:09.109> found<00:03:09.560> okay

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250

remember that a lot them found okay
going<00:03:11.349> going<00:03:12.349> behind<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.400> branch<00:03:14.120> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
going going behind the branch the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:21.689 
going going behind the branch the
foliage<00:03:15.500> going<00:03:16.069> behind<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:16.970> years<00:03:17.889> okay

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:21.699 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.990 

now<00:03:22.699> we<00:03:23.419> cravaack<00:03:24.019> Oh<00:03:24.290> find<00:03:24.620> other<00:03:24.949> trees<00:03:25.549> here

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
now we cravaack Oh find other trees here

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.640 
now we cravaack Oh find other trees here
this<00:03:26.629> suggest<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.799> lot<00:03:28.220> of<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:29.060> tree<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.290> penny

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
this suggest a lot of a tree of a penny

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.129 
this suggest a lot of a tree of a penny
is<00:03:30.980> come<00:03:31.310> from<00:03:33.879> this<00:03:34.879> in<00:03:35.209> front<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.659> that<00:03:35.840> that

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
is come from this in front of that that

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.229 
is come from this in front of that that
tree<00:03:36.500> there<00:03:36.799> I'd<00:03:37.159> make<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.489> break<00:03:37.909> there

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
tree there I'd make a break there

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.189 
tree there I'd make a break there
suggesting<00:03:39.109> this<00:03:39.739> one<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:41.150> rightly<00:03:41.629> so

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
suggesting this one is and rightly so

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.699 
suggesting this one is and rightly so
because<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:42.859> is<00:03:43.069> a<00:03:43.099> lighter<00:03:43.489> four<00:03:44.329> years<00:03:44.659> now

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
because this is a lighter four years now

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.300 
because this is a lighter four years now
if<00:03:45.889> I<00:03:46.129> were<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.519> Twitter<00:03:47.510> as<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> tree<00:03:48.349> then<00:03:49.069> the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
if I were to Twitter as a tree then the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.280 
if I were to Twitter as a tree then the
trend<00:03:49.669> will<00:03:49.879> come<00:03:50.120> down<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.659> way<00:03:50.989> okay<00:03:51.769> now

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
trend will come down this way okay now

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.969 
trend will come down this way okay now
if<00:03:54.290> if<00:03:54.949> a<00:03:55.129> tree<00:03:55.459> trunk<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.329> start<00:03:56.750> again<00:03:57.739> the

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
if if a tree trunk is start again the

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.300 
if if a tree trunk is start again the
very<00:03:58.190> top<00:03:58.609> background<00:03:59.389> then<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.650> shape<00:04:00.979> would

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
very top background then the shape would

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.000 
very top background then the shape would
not<00:04:01.519> read<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.569> know<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:03.019> will<00:04:03.169> get<00:04:03.349> lost<00:04:03.680> in

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
not read you know we will get lost in

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.199 
not read you know we will get lost in
there<00:04:04.250> okay

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209

colour<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.570> reveal<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.840> tree<00:04:41.230> trunk<00:04:42.450> all

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
colour to reveal the tree trunk all

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.950 
colour to reveal the tree trunk all
right<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.440> tree<00:04:44.770> trunk<00:04:45.190> is<00:04:45.520> lighter<00:04:46.390> in

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
right this tree trunk is lighter in

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.050 
right this tree trunk is lighter in
value<00:04:47.680> than<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.790> background<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.300> there<00:04:49.740> and

value than the background of there and
besides<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.480> will<00:04:52.630> make<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.380> tree<00:04:53.740> the

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
besides that you will make the tree the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.570 
besides that you will make the tree the
grouping<00:04:55.060> of<00:04:55.270> trees<00:04:55.510> more<00:04:56.160> interesting<00:04:57.160> if

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
grouping of trees more interesting if

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.050 
grouping of trees more interesting if
they<00:04:58.270> are<00:04:58.600> value<00:04:59.440> differences<00:05:00.310> or<00:05:00.610> some<00:05:00.880> a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
they are value differences or some a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.910 
they are value differences or some a
light<00:05:01.510> in<00:05:01.900> some<00:05:02.230> are<00:05:02.920> dark<00:05:04.260> if<00:05:05.260> they're<00:05:05.560> all

suggest<00:05:16.990> that<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:18.040> a<00:05:18.070> lighter<00:05:18.550> tree<00:05:19.150> term

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
suggest that is a lighter tree term

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.940 
suggest that is a lighter tree term
behind<00:05:20.830> there<00:05:21.420> now<00:05:22.420> sometimes<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.380> can<00:05:23.620> find

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
behind there now sometimes you can find

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.790 
behind there now sometimes you can find
a<00:05:24.160> spot<00:05:24.640> there<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.090> lighter<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.900> value<00:05:26.500> and

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
a spot there is lighter in value and

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.920 
a spot there is lighter in value and
then<00:05:27.280> introduce<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:28.030> say<00:05:28.240> for<00:05:28.420> instance<00:05:28.510> I<00:05:28.720> see

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
then introduce a say for instance I see

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.040 
then introduce a say for instance I see
as<00:05:29.200> supply<00:05:29.650> spotters<00:05:30.130> as<00:05:30.400> but<00:05:30.730> the<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.870> is

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
as supply spotters as but the that is

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.530 
as supply spotters as but the that is
lighter<00:05:32.380> in<00:05:32.710> value<00:05:33.160> okay<00:05:33.610> then<00:05:34.030> I<00:05:34.360> would

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
lighter in value okay then I would

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.930 
lighter in value okay then I would
simply<00:05:35.140> just<00:05:35.820> connect<00:05:36.820> days<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.990> become<00:05:38.530> a

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
simply just connect days to become a

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.050 
simply just connect days to become a
peak<00:05:39.940> branch<00:05:40.660> or<00:05:41.290> a<00:05:41.350> big<00:05:42.220> trunk

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
peak branch or a big trunk

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:51.630 
peak branch or a big trunk
yeah<00:05:43.960> a<00:05:43.990> big<00:05:44.380> branch<00:05:44.650> of<00:05:44.950> the<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.840> tree<00:05:50.460> okay

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
yeah a big branch of the that tree okay

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.140 
yeah a big branch of the that tree okay
and<00:05:51.730> then<00:05:51.970> I<00:05:52.210> will<00:05:52.420> block<00:05:52.660> out<00:05:54.510> some<00:05:55.510> water<00:05:55.780> and

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
and then I will block out some water and

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.420 
and then I will block out some water and
some<00:05:58.150> color
