00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
around even though they could just offer

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.180 
around even though they could just offer
right<00:00:57.020> now<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.500> would<00:00:57.620> probably<00:00:57.800> help

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
right now and it would probably help

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.130 
right now and it would probably help
them<00:00:58.399> out<00:00:58.489> in<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.699> long<00:00:58.879> run<00:00:59.120> but<00:00:59.390> whatever

Chiba<00:01:44.690> Tuxedo<00:01:45.349> Mask<00:01:45.380> Sora<00:01:45.890> comes<00:01:46.130> across<00:01:46.369> as

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
Chiba Tuxedo Mask Sora comes across as

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.880 
Chiba Tuxedo Mask Sora comes across as
like<00:01:46.819> a<00:01:47.000> father<00:01:47.390> figure<00:01:47.539> for<00:01:47.899> chibiusa<00:01:48.380> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
like a father figure for chibiusa and

like a father figure for chibiusa and
again<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.789> believe<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.270> is<00:01:50.450> where<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.780> series

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
again I believe that is where the series

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.839 
again I believe that is where the series
is<00:01:51.229> going<00:01:51.560> i<00:01:51.679> believe<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.130> chibi-usa<00:01:52.610> is

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
is going i believe that chibi-usa is

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.120 
is going i believe that chibi-usa is
actually<00:01:53.420> from<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.720> future<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:55.009> this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
actually from the future and that this

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.279 
actually from the future and that this
is<00:01:55.280> actually<00:01:55.640> her<00:01:55.759> parents<00:01:56.239> she<00:01:56.660> doesn't<00:01:56.989> just

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
quite realize it quite yet or maybe it's

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.669

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
but I especially love how she starts

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.629 
but I especially love how she starts
making<00:03:23.290> clones<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.919> herself<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.519> there's

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
making clones of herself and there's

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.250 
making clones of herself and there's
water<00:03:24.819> erupting<00:03:25.419> all<00:03:25.540> over<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:25.810> place<00:03:26.019> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
water erupting all over the place and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.140 
water erupting all over the place and
ice<00:03:26.500> but<00:03:27.069> then<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.370> Bertier<00:03:27.760> who<00:03:28.000> does

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
ice but then you have Bertier who does

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.670 
ice but then you have Bertier who does
this<00:03:28.269> really<00:03:28.690> cool<00:03:28.870> move<00:03:29.109> where<00:03:29.349> she<00:03:29.500> does

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
this really cool move where she does

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.530 
this really cool move where she does
this<00:03:29.769> backflip<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.519> ends<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.090> creating<00:03:31.419> this

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
this backflip and ends up creating this

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.270 
this backflip and ends up creating this
massive<00:03:31.900> torrent<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.500> water<00:03:32.709> which<00:03:32.980> ends<00:03:33.250> up

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
massive torrent of water which ends up

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.680 
massive torrent of water which ends up
catching<00:03:33.489> Sailor<00:03:34.180> Mercury

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
catching Sailor Mercury

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.440 
catching Sailor Mercury

day with another one-shot attack which

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.890 
day with another one-shot attack which
frankly<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.760> kind<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.060> disappointing<00:03:40.690> and

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
frankly is kind of disappointing and

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.150 
frankly is kind of disappointing and
just<00:03:41.260> like<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.470> last<00:03:41.500> episode

Senshi<00:03:48.099> down<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.849> I<00:03:49.120> imagine<00:03:49.540> that's<00:03:49.720> what

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
Senshi down and I imagine that's what

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.180 
Senshi down and I imagine that's what
the<00:03:49.900> next<00:03:50.079> couple<00:03:50.349> of<00:03:50.379> episodes<00:03:50.500> are<00:03:50.949> going<00:03:51.099> to

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
the next couple of episodes are going to

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.309 
the next couple of episodes are going to
be<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.549> again<00:03:52.180> very<00:03:52.510> similar<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.169> like<00:03:53.260> a

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
be like again very similar to like a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.900 
be like again very similar to like a
Super<00:03:53.680> Sentai<00:03:54.040> show<00:03:54.280> where<00:03:54.459> there's<00:03:54.609> a<00:03:54.699> brand

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
Super Sentai show where there's a brand

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.640 
Super Sentai show where there's a brand
new<00:03:54.940> monster<00:03:55.449> every<00:03:55.720> single<00:03:56.019> week<00:03:56.169> and<00:03:56.290> it's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
new monster every single week and it's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.199 
new monster every single week and it's
just<00:03:56.829> sort<00:03:56.919> of<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.190> rinse<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.669> repeat<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.180> I

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
just sort of like rinse and repeat but I

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.819 
just sort of like rinse and repeat but I
do<00:03:58.299> like<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> fact<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.109> we're<00:03:59.470> getting<00:03:59.590> to

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
do like the fact that we're getting to

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.500 
do like the fact that we're getting to
know<00:04:00.069> these<00:04:00.310> characters<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.760> little<00:04:01.180> bit<00:04:01.329> more

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
know these characters a little bit more

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.819 
know these characters a little bit more
and<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.019> seems<00:04:02.199> like<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.440> story<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.769> the

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829

and it seems like the story in the
action<00:04:03.190> is<00:04:03.310> just<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.549> little<00:04:03.879> more<00:04:04.030> interesting

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239

than<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.200> first<00:04:30.500> half<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:30.920> lot<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.100> that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
than the first half and a lot of that

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.890 
than the first half and a lot of that
does<00:04:31.460> have<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.760> do<00:04:31.880> with<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.120> villains<00:04:32.450> who<00:04:32.840> I

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
does have to do with the villains who I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.600 
does have to do with the villains who I
think<00:04:33.140> are<00:04:33.200> just<00:04:33.380> way<00:04:33.560> more<00:04:33.590> charismatic<00:04:34.130> and

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
think are just way more charismatic and

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.100 
think are just way more charismatic and
interesting<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.360> I<00:04:35.570> like<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> fact<00:04:36.020> that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
interesting and I like the fact that

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.600 
interesting and I like the fact that
their<00:04:36.320> goal<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.650> mostly<00:04:37.010> all<00:04:37.100> about

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
their goal is mostly all about

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.010 
their goal is mostly all about
destruction<00:04:38.060> and<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.420> just<00:04:38.600> want<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.810> learn<00:04:38.990> a

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
destruction and I just want to learn a

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.020 
destruction and I just want to learn a
little<00:04:39.290> bit<00:04:39.410> more<00:04:39.530> about<00:04:40.010> them<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.490> just<00:04:40.610> do

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
little bit more about them I just do

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.280 
little bit more about them I just do
think<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.480> little<00:04:41.660> cheesy<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.140> they're

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
think it is a little cheesy that they're

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.870 
think it is a little cheesy that they're
capturing<00:04:42.650> all<00:04:42.800> these<00:04:42.950> Sailor<00:04:43.250> Senshi<00:04:43.460> trying

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
capturing all these Sailor Senshi trying

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.220 
capturing all these Sailor Senshi trying
to<00:04:43.940> get<00:04:44.030> information<00:04:44.150> out<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.660> them<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:44.990> they

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
to get information out of them and they

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.900 
to get information out of them and they
just<00:04:45.380> leave<00:04:45.890> them<00:04:46.100> alone<00:04:46.370> like<00:04:46.640> they<00:04:46.760> don't

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
just leave them alone like they don't

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.520 
just leave them alone like they don't
ever<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:47.240> try<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.450> execute<00:04:47.870> them<00:04:48.140> or<00:04:48.260> finish

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
ever like try to execute them or finish

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.900 
ever like try to execute them or finish
them<00:04:48.680> off<00:04:48.830> there's<00:04:49.340> just<00:04:49.550> something<00:04:49.850> about

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
them off there's just something about

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.370 
them off there's just something about
anime<00:04:50.390> villains<00:04:50.690> who<00:04:50.780> never<00:04:50.990> do<00:04:51.170> that<00:04:51.320> and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
anime villains who never do that and

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.230 
anime villains who never do that and
that<00:04:51.560> always<00:04:51.980> really<00:04:52.520> bugs<00:04:52.760> me<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.120> then

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
that always really bugs me but then

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.180 
that always really bugs me but then
again<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:53.930> is<00:04:53.990> Sailor<00:04:54.440> frickin<00:04:54.800> Moon<00:04:55.040> I

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
again this is Sailor frickin Moon I

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.470 
again this is Sailor frickin Moon I
don't<00:04:55.340> think<00:04:55.460> it's<00:04:55.580> really<00:04:55.820> gonna<00:04:55.910> go<00:04:56.240> into

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
don't think it's really gonna go into

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.140 
don't think it's really gonna go into
dark<00:04:56.750> territory<00:04:57.260> that<00:04:57.620> much<00:04:57.980> another<00:04:58.970> thing

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
dark territory that much another thing

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.370 
dark territory that much another thing
that's<00:04:59.270> really<00:04:59.390> interesting<00:04:59.780> about<00:05:00.080> this

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
that's really interesting about this

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.650 
that's really interesting about this
episode<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:01.190> how<00:05:01.610> we<00:05:01.910> saw<00:05:02.090> these<00:05:02.300> basically

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
episode is how we saw these basically

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.720 
episode is how we saw these basically
being<00:05:02.930> slowly<00:05:03.290> broken<00:05:03.740> down<00:05:03.980> as<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.340> arc<00:05:04.610> is

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
being slowly broken down as this arc is

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.180 
being slowly broken down as this arc is
going<00:05:04.880> on<00:05:05.210> not<00:05:05.870> only<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.500> she<00:05:06.530> losing<00:05:07.040> all<00:05:07.160> of

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
going on not only is she losing all of

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.159 
going on not only is she losing all of
her<00:05:07.400> friends<00:05:07.640> but<00:05:08.000> in<00:05:08.180> some<00:05:08.419> ways<00:05:08.600> she<00:05:08.870> sort<00:05:09.080> of

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
her friends but in some ways she sort of

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.470 
her friends but in some ways she sort of
feels<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.890> she's<00:05:10.100> losing<00:05:10.520> Tuxedo<00:05:11.000> Mask<00:05:11.030> as

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
feels that she's losing Tuxedo Mask as

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.210 
feels that she's losing Tuxedo Mask as
well<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.930> chibi-usa<00:05:12.260> who's<00:05:12.830> sort<00:05:13.040> of<00:05:13.100> like

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
well to chibi-usa who's sort of like

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.220 
well to chibi-usa who's sort of like
taking<00:05:13.520> all<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.730> attention<00:05:14.120> away<00:05:14.240> and<00:05:14.690> I

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
taking all the attention away and I

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.900 
taking all the attention away and I
think<00:05:15.590> that's<00:05:15.740> another<00:05:15.919> interesting<00:05:16.490> dynamic

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
think that's another interesting dynamic

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.730 
think that's another interesting dynamic
although<00:05:17.150> it<00:05:17.300> is<00:05:17.390> kind<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.750> drag<00:05:18.080> because<00:05:18.620> we

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
although it is kind of a drag because we

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.990 
although it is kind of a drag because we
already<00:05:18.860> went<00:05:19.100> through<00:05:19.280> a<00:05:19.340> lot<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.640> that<00:05:19.880> in

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
already went through a lot of that in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.460 
already went through a lot of that in
the<00:05:20.090> first<00:05:20.330> arc<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:20.780> then<00:05:20.870> we<00:05:20.990> finally<00:05:21.230> got

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
the first arc and then we finally got

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.990 
the first arc and then we finally got
her<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.620> get<00:05:21.800> all<00:05:21.890> pepped<00:05:22.160> up<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> end<00:05:22.669> only

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
her to get all pepped up to the end only

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.460 
her to get all pepped up to the end only
forward<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.630> get<00:05:23.750> all<00:05:23.870> depressed<00:05:24.050> again

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
forward to get all depressed again

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.320 
forward to get all depressed again
otherwise<00:05:25.250> I<00:05:25.669> think<00:05:25.730> the<00:05:25.880> best<00:05:26.120> thing<00:05:26.300> about

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
otherwise I think the best thing about

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.210 
otherwise I think the best thing about
this<00:05:26.660> week's<00:05:26.840> episode<00:05:27.320> was<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.680> Battle<00:05:28.160> of

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
this week's episode was the Battle of

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.830 
this week's episode was the Battle of
Sailor<00:05:28.520> Mercury<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:29.150> Bear<00:05:29.300> ta<00:05:29.510> who<00:05:29.750> was

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
Sailor Mercury and Bear ta who was

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.420 
Sailor Mercury and Bear ta who was
freaking<00:05:30.200> awesome<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.710> her<00:05:30.770> water<00:05:31.010> powers

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
freaking awesome and her water powers

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.520 
freaking awesome and her water powers
that<00:05:31.970> was<00:05:32.090> probably<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.810> best<00:05:32.930> action<00:05:33.350> scene

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
that was probably the best action scene

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.440 
that was probably the best action scene
of<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.740> entire<00:05:34.070> series<00:05:34.490> and<00:05:34.520> even<00:05:34.820> still<00:05:35.060> it

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
of the entire series and even still it

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.940 
of the entire series and even still it
really<00:05:35.750> wasn't<00:05:35.930> all<00:05:36.050> that<00:05:36.229> special<00:05:36.530> but<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.890> was

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
really wasn't all that special but I was

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.170 
really wasn't all that special but I was
really<00:05:37.250> glad<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.669> they<00:05:37.820> were<00:05:37.850> able<00:05:38.000> to

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
really glad that they were able to

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.430 
really glad that they were able to
incorporate<00:05:38.720> that<00:05:39.080> and<00:05:39.229> it<00:05:39.320> was<00:05:39.410> just

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
incorporate that and it was just

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.990 
incorporate that and it was just
something<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.250> little<00:05:40.460> different<00:05:40.820> from<00:05:40.880> some

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
something a little different from some

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.400 
something a little different from some
of<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.240> other<00:05:41.419> action<00:05:41.780> that<00:05:41.810> I've<00:05:41.990> seen<00:05:42.200> from

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
of the other action that I've seen from

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.170 
of the other action that I've seen from
the<00:05:42.530> rest<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:42.890> show<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.729> technical

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
the rest of the show on the technical

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.400 
the rest of the show on the technical
side<00:05:44.240> of<00:05:44.450> things<00:05:44.570> this<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:45.020> pretty<00:05:45.200> much<00:05:45.260> just

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
side of things this is pretty much just

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.469 
side of things this is pretty much just
again<00:05:45.830> another<00:05:46.220> pretty<00:05:46.430> average<00:05:46.640> episode<00:05:47.300> of
