00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
so yeah this is basically this is hard

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.479

truck<00:03:58.989> 18<00:03:59.410> Wheels<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.770> Steel<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.040> just<00:04:00.370> thought

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
truck 18 Wheels of Steel I just thought

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.080 
truck 18 Wheels of Steel I just thought
I'd<00:04:00.670> show<00:04:00.910> my<00:04:00.940> controller<00:04:01.540> configuration<00:04:01.810> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
I'd show my controller configuration and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.270 
I'd show my controller configuration and
it's<00:04:04.090> much<00:04:04.989> better<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.470> think<00:04:05.530> than<00:04:05.920> using<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
it's much better I think than using the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.390 
it's much better I think than using the
keyboard<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.880> mouse<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.750> look<00:04:07.780> around<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
keyboard and mouse to look around the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.370 
keyboard and mouse to look around the

use<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.200> rearview<00:04:23.410> mirrors<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.160> that

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
use the rearview mirrors and that

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.700 
use the rearview mirrors and that
usually<00:04:24.970> that's<00:04:25.750> sufficient<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:27.130> most<00:04:27.520> cases
