00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.080 
for six weeks that is the Kaplan program
and<00:00:29.510> I<00:00:29.779> did<00:00:29.960> some<00:00:30.080> on<00:00:30.230> my<00:00:30.529> own<00:00:30.590> studying<00:00:31.160> I<00:00:31.520> use

and I did some on my own studying I use

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.270 
and I did some on my own studying I use
the<00:00:32.419> Saunders<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.230> collects<00:00:33.559> book<00:00:33.890> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the Saunders and collects book the

the Saunders and collects book the
yellow<00:00:34.520> I<00:00:34.820> think<00:00:35.239> that's<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.539> fifth<00:00:35.750> edition

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
yellow I think that's the fifth edition

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.139 
yellow I think that's the fifth edition
I've<00:00:36.739> worked<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.100> like<00:00:37.280> two<00:00:37.460> semesters<00:00:38.000> ago

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
I've worked that like two semesters ago

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.569 
I've worked that like two semesters ago

boards<00:01:40.310> was<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:43.340> wasn't<00:01:43.760> as<00:01:43.820> difficult<00:01:44.000> as

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
boards was it wasn't as difficult as

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.080 
boards was it wasn't as difficult as
everyone<00:01:44.900> is<00:01:45.020> making<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.380> same<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.280> don't

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
everyone is making the same so I don't

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.720 
everyone is making the same so I don't
know<00:01:47.210> um<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:48.260> don't<00:01:48.920> know<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.220> don't<00:01:49.280> know<00:01:49.430> why<00:01:49.580> so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
know um I don't know I don't know why so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.000 
know um I don't know I don't know why so
many<00:01:49.760> people<00:01:49.940> are<00:01:50.300> felony<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.650> think<00:01:51.890> if

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
many people are felony but I think if

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.770 
many people are felony but I think if
you<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.340> core<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:52.970> basics<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:53.659> you

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
you have the core on the basics and you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.000 
you have the core on the basics and you
know<00:01:53.930> how<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.140> answer<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.500> questions<00:01:54.890> you

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
know how to answer the questions you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.640 
know how to answer the questions you
should<00:01:55.550> pass<00:01:55.730> um<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.810> definitely<00:01:57.260> feel<00:01:57.530> as

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
should pass um so I definitely feel as

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.580 
should pass um so I definitely feel as
if<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.890> Kaplan<00:01:58.370> was<00:01:58.870> the<00:01:59.870> Holy<00:02:00.050> Grail<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
if the Kaplan was the Holy Grail the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.990 
if the Kaplan was the Holy Grail the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
how to even some priority questions a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.890 
how to even some priority questions a
lot<00:02:40.959> better<00:02:41.260> than<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.180> soundest<00:02:43.660> book

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900

lot<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:52.870> presentable<00:03:53.440> for<00:03:53.680> work<00:03:53.829> but

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
lot more presentable for work but

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.940 
lot more presentable for work but
initially<00:03:55.630> when<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.840> did<00:03:56.079> my<00:03:56.319> first<00:03:56.350> interview

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
initially when I did my first interview

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.800 
initially when I did my first interview
I<00:03:57.130> had<00:03:57.459> just<00:03:57.670> got<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.819> braids<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.389> so<00:03:58.690> they

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
I had just got the braids on so they

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.569 
I had just got the braids on so they
were<00:03:58.930> really<00:03:59.079> you<00:03:59.530> know<00:03:59.590> not<00:03:59.829> tight<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.489> they

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
were really you know not tight but they

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.160 
were really you know not tight but they
were<00:04:00.670> really<00:04:00.819> fresh<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.599> couldn't<00:04:01.900> wear<00:04:02.139> it

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
were really fresh and I couldn't wear it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.229 
were really fresh and I couldn't wear it
in<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.410> bun<00:04:02.620> like<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.920> wanted<00:04:03.220> it<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:03.970> had<00:04:04.150> to

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
in a bun like I wanted it to so I had to

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.120 
in a bun like I wanted it to so I had to
wear<00:04:04.389> it<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.569> a<00:04:04.660> long<00:04:04.840> ponytail<00:04:05.139> and<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:05.920> think

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
wear it in a long ponytail and I think

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.520 
wear it in a long ponytail and I think
that<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.459> was<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.609> little<00:04:06.760> bit<00:04:06.970> too<00:04:07.120> much<00:04:07.530> but

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
that that was a little bit too much but

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.349 
that that was a little bit too much but
if<00:04:08.620> you<00:04:08.650> have<00:04:08.799> any<00:04:09.010> questions<00:04:09.549> about<00:04:09.730> me
