00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello everyone today let's make a mini 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.490
 home arch and for this we will use 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.759
 some hot silicone sticks 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.140
 ice cream thread sewing a screwdriver 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 a cutter and a plier 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.640
 we will start by making a small mark 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.530
 with the help of a pencil on the sticks 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.040
 we must mark them at the height of 5 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.040
 centimeters 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.680
 once they are marked we cut ourselves 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.289
 you have to mark exactly two 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.619
 sticks to have four pieces 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.870
 same 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.530
 once they are cut we are going to 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.449
 trim the tips in this way 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.519
 we have to remove the little corners for 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.480
 later once we have them 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:48.790
 in this way sanding it let's try 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.380
 that are as round as possible 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.380
 something like this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 once we have it we will take one and 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 we will put two droplets of silicone to 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 each side and in these droplets 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.690
 of silicone we are going to stick two sticks 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.970
 big 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.100
 now we put another little silicone in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.620
 the upper part and we cover with another of the 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.750
 small clubs now only remains 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.640
 remove the silicone beads with the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.230
 cutter help 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.580
 and once we get clean 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.090
 there may be something similar to this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.520
 we put some silicone on the sides 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.120
 and we close that little rectangle that goes 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.740
 to be the center of our ship once 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.570
 that we have closed it with the help of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.910
 a screwdriver for example let's go 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.150
 making a hole in the center and 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.070
 we must cross it in such a way that with 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.020
 the help of a skewer can be 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.910
 cross perfectly and pass the arrow 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 out there now let's do some 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.400
 small notches on the sides with the 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.620
 cutter help 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.270
 we must have something like that 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.610
 once we have the notches 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.000
 we only need to put the rope of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.740
 our boat we give it to a side the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.270
 we fix the other we tended a little the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.730
 rope so there is tension in the bow 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.730
 and we finally make a knot 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.410
 once this is done we cut the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.629
 leftover rope and practically already 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.830
 we have our boat finished 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.930
 we think rope and it works 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.410
 we perfectly make small ones for 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.410
 criticize yourself shot 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.750
 we have that despite being quite 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 small because it has enough power and 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.280
 arrows go through and stay 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.440
 stuck in the cardboard good companions 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.150
 this has been everything and I did not want 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.880
 dismiss from this video without first 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.070
