 There you put it but it's optional, then. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.000
 We're going to start our recipe out of the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.240
 fire 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.509
 We'll put the liter of milk 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.460
 preferably people, the milk inter acts 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.170
 environment is there we will put the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.950
 three male colleagues 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.820
 Now we go stirring it can rain all over. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.930
 corn starch in people's milk 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 Of fire 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.450
 because if we're already cooking it goes 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.680
 thickening and we did not put all the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.280
 ingredients even then people raining 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.439
 in the launch of corn in milk now 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.600
 We will not even put the milk carton 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.810
 condensed 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.530
 it is if you have condensed milk you 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.319
 If you had not, you can put 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.830
 thin sugar time because our revenue is 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.470
 a simple recipe now so you do not get 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.230
 with the taste of porridge that we want 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.519
 fear of corn milk milk 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.290

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.290
 we put the essence of vanilla 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.450
 Okay, now we 're going to take this mix. 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:46.170
 We made the low fire here. 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:49.709
 here we go stirring constantly 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.120
 stir with 10 minutes until thickened 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.340
 that 30 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.730
 so people have almost ten minutes 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.090
 we are stirring our cream 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.680
 Look how he has the holy people now. 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.470
 usually gets very thick even with 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.480
 but only looking at the pan if 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.239
 We already saw thick eyed 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.310
 We deleted the fluff 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.480
 now we after we do the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:21.269

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.630
 strawberry does not matter the mark of people 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.400
 as long as it's strawberry 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.190
 That was the morning started in the milk. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.230

 now we're going to stir until it dissolves 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:46.069
 completely not to embark 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:51.030
 So people we stir bent we dilute 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:54.810
 along with cream the pozinho edible 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.370

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.040
 Look, we got a glass of water. 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.019
 filtered that every time we went 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
 put something on a platter of 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.010
 glass 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.440
 give it a cold thing 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.549
 we do so and we pass the water 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.120
 cold for not sticking 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:18.519

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.300
 minutes just to not give that cone 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.370
 and always give that cone like that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.330
