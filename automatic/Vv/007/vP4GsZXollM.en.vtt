piece<00:00:10.980> okay<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:12.269> make<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:12.840> I'm<00:00:13.049> using

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
piece okay to make this one I'm using

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.880 
piece okay to make this one I'm using
about<00:00:13.620> two<00:00:14.040> meters<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.610> paracord<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.890> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
about two meters of paracord and you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.620 
about two meters of paracord and you
want<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.190> start<00:00:17.430> off<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.820> by<00:00:18.000> finding<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
want to start off just by finding the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
want to start off just by finding the
center<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.279> forming<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> loop<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
center and forming a loop right at the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.439 
center and forming a loop right at the
center<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:23.130> take<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.939> right<00:00:24.180> hand

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
center and then take the right hand

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.490 
center and then take the right hand
strand<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:27.029> form<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.140> loop<00:00:28.320> down

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
strand and then just form a loop down

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
strand and then just form a loop down
the<00:00:28.710> bottom<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.130> another<00:00:29.580> loop<00:00:29.970> up<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.929> top

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the bottom and another loop up the top

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.720 
the bottom and another loop up the top
and<00:00:31.880> pinch<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.000> off<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.460> two

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and pinch that off so you now have two

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000 
and pinch that off so you now have two
loops<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> top<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.350> down<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> bottom

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
loops up the top and one down the bottom

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270 
loops up the top and one down the bottom
and<00:00:38.690> then<00:00:39.690> again<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> left<00:00:40.620> hand<00:00:40.829> strand

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
and then again with the left hand strand

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 
and then again with the left hand strand
do<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> exact<00:00:42.000> same<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.570> form<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.440> loop<00:00:43.680> down

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
do the exact same thing form a loop down

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.270 
do the exact same thing form a loop down
the<00:00:44.100> bottom<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.140> then<00:00:46.140> I'll<00:00:46.289> loop<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> top

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the bottom and then I'll loop up the top

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.090 
the bottom and then I'll loop up the top
and<00:00:48.770> now<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.829> should<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:51.649> three<00:00:52.649> loops<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and now you should have three loops up

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.479 
and now you should have three loops up
the<00:00:53.219> top<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.610> two<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> bottom<00:00:55.489> we

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the top and two down the bottom we

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.840 
the top and two down the bottom we
separate<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> left<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.579> hand

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
separate the left and the right hand

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.090 
separate the left and the right hand
strand<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:03.210> pinch<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:03.870> four<00:01:04.470> strands

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
strand and just pinch those four strands

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.410 
strand and just pinch those four strands
in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> middle<00:01:05.549> together<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:08.119> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.180> take

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
in the middle together I want to take

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.929 
in the middle together I want to take
this<00:01:09.720> left<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.530> over<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.220> top<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> those<00:01:11.640> four

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this left one over the top of those four

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.310 
this left one over the top of those four
strands<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:15.740> then<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:18.210> right<00:01:18.630> hand<00:01:18.900> strand

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
strands and then this right hand strand

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.940 
strands and then this right hand strand
over<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> left<00:01:24.830> behind<00:01:25.830> everything<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.950> then

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
over the left behind everything and then

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
over the left behind everything and then
up<00:01:29.189> through<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.640> loop<00:01:34.520> just<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.880> gently

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
up through that loop just put gently

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.750 
up through that loop just put gently
together

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.520 

doesn't<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.630> tied<00:01:42.990> at<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.260> stage

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
doesn't have to be tied at this stage

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.430 
doesn't have to be tied at this stage
just<00:01:44.479> pull<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> together<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> should

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
just pull it together and you should

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.010 
just pull it together and you should
have<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> loop<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> top<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.720> two<00:01:48.720> loops

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
have a loop up the top and two loops

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
have a loop up the top and two loops
down<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.800> bottom<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:51.330> once<00:01:51.510> we<00:01:51.690> get<00:01:51.840> this

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
down the bottom so once we get this

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.780 
down the bottom so once we get this
general<00:01:52.440> shape<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.159> need<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.610> is

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
general shape what we need to do is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
general shape what we need to do is
adjust<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.210> size<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.869> two<00:01:55.200> loops<00:01:55.440> down

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
adjust the size of these two loops down

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
adjust the size of these two loops down
the<00:01:55.890> bottom<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.580> we<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.180> size<00:01:57.600> of

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the bottom here and we want the size of

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.100 
the bottom here and we want the size of
the<00:01:57.869> loop<00:01:58.050> from<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:59.550> section<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.390> down<00:02:01.080> to

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the loop from this section here down to

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620 
the loop from this section here down to
the<00:02:01.440> end<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> same<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the end to be the same as the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.380 
the end to be the same as the
circumference<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.440> your<00:02:04.680> wrist<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:06.150> feed

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
circumference of your wrist and to feed

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
circumference of your wrist and to feed
in<00:02:06.570> slack<00:02:06.960> what<00:02:07.500> we're<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.130> is<00:02:08.429> this

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
in slack what we're going to do is this

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.260 
in slack what we're going to do is this
left-hand<00:02:09.509> strand<00:02:09.899> will<00:02:10.140> feed<00:02:10.500> slack<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.270> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
left-hand strand will feed slack in to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.270 
left-hand strand will feed slack in to
the<00:02:12.420> right<00:02:12.660> hand<00:02:12.959> loop<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.739> we'll<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.070> feed

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the right hand loop so we'll just feed

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.920 
the right hand loop so we'll just feed
some<00:02:14.520> slack<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.000> pinch<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> off<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.100> then<00:02:17.100> pull

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
some slack in pinch it off and then pull

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.210 
some slack in pinch it off and then pull
that<00:02:18.930> slack<00:02:19.350> out<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.560> measure

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
that slack out and then we can measure

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.940 
that slack out and then we can measure
that<00:02:23.489> with<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> ruler<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> exact

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that with a ruler and then do the exact

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.000 
that with a ruler and then do the exact
same<00:02:26.160> on<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.940> other<00:02:26.970> side<00:02:27.590> when<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.709> get<00:02:28.890> these

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
same on the other side when we get these

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.340 
same on the other side when we get these
loops<00:02:29.310> about<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> size<00:02:29.940> we<00:02:30.180> want<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:30.959> need<00:02:30.989> to

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
loops about the size we want we need to

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.770 
loops about the size we want we need to
get<00:02:31.530> these<00:02:31.830> two<00:02:32.250> loops<00:02:32.519> exactly<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.540> same

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
get these two loops exactly the same

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
get these two loops exactly the same
size<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.040> best<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
size and the best way to do that is to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.890 
size and the best way to do that is to
do<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.110> fine<00:02:37.410> adjustment<00:02:38.070> through<00:02:38.489> this

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
do the fine adjustment through this

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.840 
do the fine adjustment through this
Center<00:02:39.900> loop<00:02:40.080> here<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.800> top<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.340> put<00:02:41.820> a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
Center loop here the top just put a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.910 
Center loop here the top just put a
little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.269> slack<00:02:42.510> through<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.350> side<00:02:43.650> and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
little bit of slack through one side and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.789 
little bit of slack through one side and
then<00:02:44.820> pull<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.269> back<00:02:45.620> through<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> other

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
then pull it back through the other

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.430 
then pull it back through the other
until<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.610> get<00:02:47.820> these<00:02:48.000> two<00:02:48.329> loops<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.959> exact

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
until you get these two loops the exact

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.520 
until you get these two loops the exact
same<00:02:49.680> size<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.660> top<00:02:51.959> loop<00:02:52.200> should

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
same size and then this top loop should

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.750 
same size and then this top loop should
be<00:02:52.709> about<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.160> centimeter<00:02:53.760> or<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.610> once

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
be about a centimeter or so so once

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.910 
be about a centimeter or so so once
these<00:02:56.970> bottom<00:02:57.420> lip<00:02:57.630> sizes<00:02:58.110> are<00:02:58.260> finally<00:02:58.680> set

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
these bottom lip sizes are finally set

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.100 
these bottom lip sizes are finally set
that's<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.459> fiddly<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.360> out<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.720> way<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that's the fiddly bit out of the way and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
that's the fiddly bit out of the way and
now<00:03:01.530> we<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.829> want<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.130> make<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.730> top

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
now we just want to make sure this top

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.960 
now we just want to make sure this top
knot<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.510> nice<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.200> secure<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.860> then<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.820> can

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
knot is nice and secure and then we can

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.550 
knot is nice and secure and then we can
start<00:03:06.239> our<00:03:06.390> braiding<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.079> we'll<00:03:07.200> do<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.380> by

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
start our braiding and we'll do that by

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.520 
start our braiding and we'll do that by
just<00:03:07.739> taking<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.489> three<00:03:08.820> right<00:03:09.810> hand<00:03:10.110> strands

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
just taking the three right hand strands

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
just taking the three right hand strands
and<00:03:10.739> getting<00:03:10.980> them<00:03:11.100> out<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.400> our<00:03:11.519> way<00:03:11.930> we're

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
and getting them out of our way we're

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.330 
and getting them out of our way we're
going<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.140> start<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> left<00:03:13.799> hand<00:03:14.040> side

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
going to start with the left hand side

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.830 
going to start with the left hand side
and<00:03:14.640> which<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.030> going<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.209> do<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> normal

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
and which is going to do a normal

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800 
and which is going to do a normal
three-strand<00:03:16.260> flat<00:03:16.950> braid<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:18.390> by<00:03:18.600> taking

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
three-strand flat braid just by taking

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.170 
three-strand flat braid just by taking
the<00:03:19.049> left<00:03:19.230> over<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.829> center<00:03:20.220> strand<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.820> then

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the left over the center strand and then

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.220 
the left over the center strand and then
the<00:03:21.329> right<00:03:21.769> over<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.860> center<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.079> then<00:03:25.079> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the right over the center and then the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.180 
the right over the center and then the
left<00:03:25.470> over<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.829> center<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:28.829> right

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
left over the center and then the right

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.810 
left over the center and then the right
over<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> center<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:32.130> then<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.370> find<00:03:32.730> that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
over the center and then you find that

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.430 
over the center and then you find that
this<00:03:33.060> long<00:03:33.329> strand<00:03:33.660> starts<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> little

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
this long strand starts to get a little

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.670 
this long strand starts to get a little
bit<00:03:34.620> tangled<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.250> just<00:03:35.519> pull<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.440> free<00:03:37.440> from

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
bit tangled so just pull that free from

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.660 
bit tangled so just pull that free from
the<00:03:37.859> bottom<00:03:38.130> loop<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:40.670> continue<00:03:41.670> on<00:03:43.670> left

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the bottom loop and continue on left

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.940 
the bottom loop and continue on left
over<00:03:45.500> right<00:03:46.500> over

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
over right over

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.000 
over right over
left<00:03:48.790> over<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.180> center<00:03:49.630> right<00:03:50.350> at<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.620> center

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
left over the center right at the center

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.620 
left over the center right at the center
and<00:03:52.000> every<00:03:52.450> now<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.020> just<00:03:53.530> pull<00:03:54.100> that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
and every now and then just pull that

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.220 
and every now and then just pull that
longer<00:03:55.630> strand<00:03:56.080> through<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:58.110> continue<00:03:59.110> on

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
longer strand through and continue on

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.890 
longer strand through and continue on
until<00:03:59.410> you<00:03:59.590> get<00:03:59.800> to<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.070> bottom<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.460> this<00:04:00.670> loop

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.630 

so<00:04:04.900> once<00:04:05.230> we<00:04:05.410> get<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.830> end<00:04:05.980> we<00:04:06.190> want<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.460> get

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
so once we get to the end we want to get

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.460 
so once we get to the end we want to get
this<00:04:07.390> end<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.170> braid<00:04:08.410> quite<00:04:08.770> tight<00:04:09.130> so

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
this end of the braid quite tight so

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.460 
this end of the braid quite tight so
when<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.530> go<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.180> take<00:04:13.180> my<00:04:13.450> last<00:04:13.660> strand<00:04:14.230> over

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
when I go and take my last strand over

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.220 
when I go and take my last strand over
which<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.580> right<00:04:15.970> over<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.930> middle<00:04:17.230> here<00:04:19.230> that

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
which is right over the middle here that

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.760 
which is right over the middle here that
hole<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.709> going<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:20.980> be<00:04:21.100> pretty<00:04:21.640> small<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.590> what

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
hole is going to be pretty small so what

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.220 
hole is going to be pretty small so what
we<00:04:23.890> want<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.550> maybe<00:04:24.850> just<00:04:25.270> stick<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:25.930> pin

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
we want to do is maybe just stick a pin

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.770 
we want to do is maybe just stick a pin
or<00:04:26.260> something<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.800> there<00:04:27.150> just<00:04:28.150> to<00:04:28.330> open<00:04:28.660> that

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
or something in there just to open that

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
or something in there just to open that
hole<00:04:28.960> up<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.750> then<00:04:33.419> push<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:35.020> strand<00:04:35.380> through

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
hole up and then push the strand through

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.800 
hole up and then push the strand through
so<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.490> end<00:04:36.669> of<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.820> braid<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.300> nice<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
so the end of the braid is nice and

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.110 
so the end of the braid is nice and
tight<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.950> end<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.250> braid<00:04:42.490> should<00:04:42.820> finish

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
tight the end of the braid should finish

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.710 
tight the end of the braid should finish
up<00:04:43.650> looking<00:04:44.650> a<00:04:44.740> little<00:04:44.860> bit<00:04:45.010> like<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.250> and

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
up looking a little bit like that and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.820 
up looking a little bit like that and
then<00:04:46.720> we<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.050> want<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.290> repeat<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.680> process

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
then we just want to repeat the process

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.800 
then we just want to repeat the process
on<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:50.230> right<00:04:50.470> hand<00:04:50.710> side<00:04:51.390> we're<00:04:52.390> just<00:04:52.630> going

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
on the right hand side we're just going

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.510 
on the right hand side we're just going
to<00:04:52.870> finish<00:04:53.050> this<00:04:53.290> piece<00:04:53.530> off<00:04:53.770> with<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.040> domino

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
to finish this piece off with a domino

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.980 
to finish this piece off with a domino
and<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.940> tie<00:04:55.120> that<00:04:55.300> we're<00:04:55.510> going<00:04:55.630> to<00:04:55.690> make<00:04:55.840> an

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
and to tie that we're going to make an

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.890 
and to tie that we're going to make an
underhand<00:04:56.530> loop<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:01.240> then<00:05:01.419> with<00:05:01.570> our<00:05:01.600> other

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
underhand loop and then with our other

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.440 
underhand loop and then with our other
strand<00:05:02.290> we'll<00:05:02.500> come<00:05:02.710> underneath<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.580> loop

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.360 

we<00:05:07.450> go<00:05:07.600> over<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.650> then<00:05:09.220> under

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.030 

and<00:05:14.730> then<00:05:15.300> we're<00:05:15.480> going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.810> do<00:05:15.960> an<00:05:16.290> over<00:05:16.889> under

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
and then we're going to do an over under

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.510 
and then we're going to do an over under
over<00:05:17.810> weave<00:05:18.810> through<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.949> rest<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.400> not

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
over weave through the rest of the not

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:32.300 
over weave through the rest of the not
over<00:05:24.199> under<00:05:25.199> and<00:05:27.470> then<00:05:28.470> over<00:05:31.010> and<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.190> will

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
over under and then over and that will

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.000 
over under and then over and that will
be<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> Carrick<00:05:32.940> Bend<00:05:33.590> just<00:05:34.590> need<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.889> adjust

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
be a Carrick Bend just need to adjust

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.469 
be a Carrick Bend just need to adjust
that<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.520> bit<00:05:40.669> now<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.729> see<00:05:42.120> where<00:05:42.360> the

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
that a little bit now you see where the

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.770 
that a little bit now you see where the
center<00:05:42.840> of<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:42.990> knot<00:05:43.199> is<00:05:43.440> here<00:05:44.630> we're<00:05:45.630> going

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
center of the knot is here we're going

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.260 
center of the knot is here we're going
to<00:05:45.840> do<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.110> take<00:05:46.320> these<00:05:46.530> strands<00:05:47.430> around<00:05:47.580> and

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
to do is take these strands around and

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.590 
to do is take these strands around and
then<00:05:48.360> through<00:05:48.750> the<00:05:48.900> center<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.500> knot<00:05:50.600> so

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
then through the center of that knot so

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.390 
then through the center of that knot so
we<00:05:51.750> start<00:05:52.050> with<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:52.229> left<00:05:52.560> strand<00:05:52.950> will<00:05:53.220> go

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
we start with this left strand will go

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.310 
we start with this left strand will go
around<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:54.000> whole<00:05:54.180> knot<00:05:54.500> and<00:05:55.639> then<00:05:56.639> up

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
around the whole knot and then up

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:08.300 
around the whole knot and then up
through<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.470> center

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.520 

and<00:06:08.490> then<00:06:09.030> same<00:06:09.600> with<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:09.870> right<00:06:10.050> hands<00:06:10.260> round

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
and then same with the right hands round

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.000 
and then same with the right hands round
around<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.070> hole<00:06:11.250> not<00:06:12.530> up<00:06:13.530> through<00:06:13.889> the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
around the hole not up through the

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.340 
around the hole not up through the
center<00:06:15.590> grab<00:06:16.590> these<00:06:16.740> two<00:06:17.070> strands<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:18.350> then

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
center grab these two strands and then

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.480 
center grab these two strands and then
the<00:06:19.530> other<00:06:19.650> side<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:20.310> pull<00:06:21.860> and<00:06:22.860> we're<00:06:23.340> going

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
the other side and pull and we're going

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.420 
the other side and pull and we're going
to<00:06:23.520> have<00:06:23.669> to<00:06:24.320> pull<00:06:25.320> out<00:06:25.410> some<00:06:25.740> slack<00:06:26.070> from<00:06:26.250> the

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
to have to pull out some slack from the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.020 
to have to pull out some slack from the
knot<00:06:26.580> and<00:06:26.820> now<00:06:27.240> we<00:06:27.300> can<00:06:27.600> adjust<00:06:27.750> this<00:06:28.590> knot<00:06:29.030> we

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
knot and now we can adjust this knot we

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.640 
knot and now we can adjust this knot we
need<00:06:30.240> to<00:06:30.360> get<00:06:30.480> it<00:06:30.600> up<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.810> little<00:06:30.990> bit<00:06:31.110> closer<00:06:31.380> to

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
need to get it up a little bit closer to

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.500 
need to get it up a little bit closer to
the<00:06:31.770> braid<00:06:31.980> we<00:06:32.190> can<00:06:32.370> do<00:06:32.490> that<00:06:32.669> or<00:06:32.910> if<00:06:32.970> it's<00:06:33.270> good

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
the braid we can do that or if it's good

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.260 
the braid we can do that or if it's good
where<00:06:33.660> it<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:33.870> there<00:06:34.169> that's<00:06:34.560> fine<00:06:34.919> or<00:06:35.760> if<00:06:36.090> we

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
where it is there that's fine or if we

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.900 
where it is there that's fine or if we
need<00:06:36.419> to<00:06:36.450> take<00:06:36.720> it<00:06:36.870> down<00:06:36.900> this<00:06:37.169> way<00:06:37.910> depending

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
need to take it down this way depending

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.080 
need to take it down this way depending
on<00:06:39.000> how<00:06:39.180> long<00:06:39.840> your<00:06:40.110> bracelet<00:06:40.590> ended<00:06:40.890> up<00:06:41.090> just

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
on how long your bracelet ended up just

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.340 
on how long your bracelet ended up just
do<00:06:42.210> a<00:06:42.240> little<00:06:42.419> bit<00:06:42.600> of<00:06:42.660> adjustment<00:06:43.140> to<00:06:43.169> the

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
do a little bit of adjustment to the

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.480 
do a little bit of adjustment to the
knot<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:43.710> take<00:06:44.310> out<00:06:44.580> all<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:45.240> slack<00:06:46.190> so<00:06:47.190> once

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
knot and take out all the slack so once

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.190 
knot and take out all the slack so once
we<00:06:47.669> add<00:06:47.760> this<00:06:47.940> Dom<00:06:48.210> and<00:06:48.390> not<00:06:48.510> nice<00:06:48.750> and<00:06:48.960> tight

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
we add this Dom and not nice and tight

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.409 
we add this Dom and not nice and tight
then<00:06:49.590> all<00:06:49.830> that<00:06:50.010> remains<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.580> be<00:06:50.610> done<00:06:50.820> is<00:06:50.880> just

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
then all that remains to be done is just

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.270 
then all that remains to be done is just
to<00:06:51.630> cut<00:06:52.110> these<00:06:52.290> ends<00:06:52.620> nice<00:06:52.950> and<00:06:53.220> short<00:06:55.280> and

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
to cut these ends nice and short and

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:05.060 
to cut these ends nice and short and
then<00:06:57.260> carefully<00:06:58.260> singe<00:06:59.100> the<00:06:59.460> ends<00:07:02.300> and<00:07:04.070> press

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
then carefully singe the ends and press

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:11.869 
then carefully singe the ends and press
them<00:07:05.250> into<00:07:05.370> place

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.350 

and<00:07:12.179> then<00:07:13.759> that<00:07:14.759> should<00:07:14.789> be<00:07:15.029> your<00:07:15.179> finished

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
and then that should be your finished

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.659 
and then that should be your finished
bracelet
