fans many times and now would say this

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.520 
fans many times and now would say this

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.839 
standpoint I think it's a flawed tactic
to<00:01:54.880> even<00:01:55.209> hint<00:01:56.050> that<00:01:56.319> a<00:01:56.860> Metroid<00:01:57.340> game<00:01:57.550> could

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
to even hint that a Metroid game could

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:59.609 
to even hint that a Metroid game could

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
dollars let's do the math again

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.680 
dollars let's do the math again
and<00:03:33.069> if<00:03:33.160> we<00:03:33.280> were<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.549> exact<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.419> would<00:03:34.540> be

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
and if we were to be exact that would be

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.409 
and if we were to be exact that would be
98<00:03:35.650> million<00:03:35.949> seven<00:03:36.549> hundred<00:03:36.579> thousand

the king its line at $35 per copy okay

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.039 
the king its line at $35 per copy okay
let's<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.609> say<00:03:54.790> it<00:03:54.879> was<00:03:55.000> 35<00:03:55.419> just<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.780> kind<00:03:55.989> of

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
let's just say it was 35 just to kind of

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.589 
let's just say it was 35 just to kind of
get<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.799> when<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.459> was<00:03:57.489> discounted<00:03:58.030> players

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
get in when it was discounted players

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.319 
get in when it was discounted players
choice<00:03:59.079> with<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.190> actually<00:04:00.609> being<00:04:00.819> 50<00:04:01.150> bucks

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
choice with it actually being 50 bucks

choice with it actually being 50 bucks
at<00:04:01.510> loss<00:04:01.659> because<00:04:01.840> we<00:04:01.959> don't<00:04:02.139> know<00:04:02.260> how<00:04:02.470> much

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
could cost anywhere near that amount so

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.229 
could cost anywhere near that amount so
