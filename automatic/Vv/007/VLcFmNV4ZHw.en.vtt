rumors about some 10 millimeters crack
under<00:03:15.340> pressure<00:03:15.370> or<00:03:16.030> don't<00:03:16.239> work<00:03:16.389> out<00:03:16.599> so<00:03:16.840> will

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
under pressure or don't work out so will

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.259 
under pressure or don't work out so will
this<00:03:17.889> going<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.340> handle<00:03:18.639> it<00:03:18.760> that's<00:03:18.879> because

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
this going can handle it that's because

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.640 
this going can handle it that's because
it<00:03:19.480> has<00:03:19.599> a<00:03:19.629> fully<00:03:20.280> reinforced<00:03:21.280> barrel<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:23.530> a

it has a fully reinforced barrel it's a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.099 
it has a fully reinforced barrel it's a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
slot that's a slightly throated barrel

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.259 
slot that's a slightly throated barrel
so<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.859> helps<00:03:27.129> with<00:03:27.250> reliability<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.060> feeding

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
problem but the takedown on these is

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.280 
problem but the takedown on these is
very<00:03:33.310> similar<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.939> the<00:03:34.120> takedown<00:03:34.299> on<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.750> Kimber

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
it is a bushing --less system so you'll

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.330 
it is a bushing --less system so you'll
see<00:03:40.840> there's<00:03:40.989> no<00:03:41.170> barrel<00:03:41.530> bushing<00:03:41.859> to<00:03:41.889> push<00:03:42.159> in

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
see there's no barrel bushing to push in
