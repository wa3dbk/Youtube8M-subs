00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
in here because now you have there's a

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.550 
in here because now you have there's a
couple<00:04:34.620> issues<00:04:35.620> with<00:04:35.889> the<00:04:36.039> Ultron<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.560> the

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
couple issues with the Ultron and the

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.149 
couple issues with the Ultron and the
collector<00:04:39.099> was<00:04:39.310> in<00:04:39.490> here<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.830> from<00:04:41.830> there

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
collector was in here and from there

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.520 
collector was in here and from there
then<00:04:42.460> it<00:04:42.580> went<00:04:42.849> to<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.060> core<00:04:43.360> back<00:04:43.539> battle<00:04:43.990> and

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
then it went to the core back battle and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.839 
then it went to the core back battle and
the<00:04:44.620> quarterback<00:04:44.889> battle<00:04:45.189> is<00:04:45.400> probably<00:04:45.669> one

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
the quarterback battle is probably one

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.360 
the quarterback battle is probably one
of<00:04:45.879> the<00:04:46.030> best<00:04:46.240> battles<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:47.650> I've<00:04:47.770> write<00:04:48.159> as

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
of the best battles that I've write as

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.240 
of the best battles that I've write as
for<00:04:48.759> Avengers<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.169> sense<00:04:50.409> that<00:04:50.560> it's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
for Avengers just in the sense that it's

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.399 
for Avengers just in the sense that it's
basically<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.210> final<00:04:52.360> battle<00:04:52.810> took<00:04:52.960> place<00:04:53.020> in

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
basically the final battle took place in

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.499 
basically the final battle took place in
one<00:04:53.590> issue<00:04:53.770> ever<00:04:54.310> pretty<00:04:55.000> much<00:04:55.120> all<00:04:55.330> the

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
one issue ever pretty much all the

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.020 
one issue ever pretty much all the
Avengers<00:04:55.810> get<00:04:56.110> killed<00:04:56.349> and<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:57.400> happened<00:04:57.759> fast

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
Avengers get killed and it happened fast

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.629 
Avengers get killed and it happened fast
it<00:04:58.419> was<00:04:58.509> just<00:04:58.689> like<00:04:58.870> oh<00:04:59.400> there<00:05:00.400> goes<00:05:00.610> one

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
it was just like oh there goes one

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.700 
it was just like oh there goes one
Avenger<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.360> goes<00:05:01.509> cap<00:05:01.810> there<00:05:02.169> goes<00:05:02.349> Wonder

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
Avenger there goes cap there goes Wonder

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.559 
Avenger there goes cap there goes Wonder
Man<00:05:02.860> there<00:05:03.129> goes<00:05:03.250> vision<00:05:03.729> it's<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.449> know

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
Man there goes vision it's like you know

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:05.969 
Man there goes vision it's like you know
as<00:05:04.659> an<00:05:04.810> example<00:05:05.110> there's<00:05:05.409> one<00:05:05.500> right<00:05:05.860> after

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
as an example there's one right after

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.670 
as an example there's one right after
the<00:05:06.159> other<00:05:06.279> they<00:05:06.639> were<00:05:06.699> dying<00:05:07.029> and<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:08.349> you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
the other they were dying and if you

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.700 
the other they were dying and if you
know<00:05:08.800> obviously<00:05:09.960> everybody<00:05:10.960> got<00:05:11.110> resurrected

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
know obviously everybody got resurrected

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.700 
know obviously everybody got resurrected
at<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.919> end<00:05:12.159> but<00:05:13.000> they<00:05:13.779> did<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.169> such<00:05:14.409> a<00:05:14.439> way

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
at the end but they did it in such a way

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.309 
at the end but they did it in such a way
where<00:05:15.069> it's<00:05:15.639> not<00:05:15.879> like<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.569> twelve<00:05:16.930> issues

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
where it's not like the twelve issues

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.529 
where it's not like the twelve issues
just<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.919> get<00:05:18.129> to<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.430> punchline<00:05:18.789> type<00:05:19.300> thing

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
just to get to the punchline type thing

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.659 
just to get to the punchline type thing
so<00:05:22.229> we<00:05:23.229> could<00:05:23.409> say<00:05:23.590> this<00:05:23.800> is<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.159> you<00:05:24.279> really

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
so we could say this is if you really

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.499 
so we could say this is if you really
are<00:05:24.819> looking<00:05:25.090> for<00:05:25.240> something<00:05:25.389> that's<00:05:25.889> older

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
are looking for something that's older

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.119 
are looking for something that's older
something<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:28.719> had<00:05:28.930> good<00:05:29.560> fighting<00:05:29.860> and

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:30.129 
something that had good fighting and

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.269 
something that had good fighting and
fighting<00:05:30.909> in<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.589> something<00:05:32.589> that<00:05:32.770> actually

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
fighting in it something that actually

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.059 
fighting in it something that actually
told<00:05:33.430> a<00:05:33.550> story<00:05:33.819> rather<00:05:34.240> than<00:05:34.800> trying<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.889> sell

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
told a story rather than trying to sell

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.930 
told a story rather than trying to sell
issues<00:05:36.520> is<00:05:37.150> this<00:05:37.500> cell<00:05:38.500> shelf<00:05:38.860> space<00:05:39.009> you

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
issues is this cell shelf space you

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.300 
issues is this cell shelf space you
might<00:05:40.120> want<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.330> give<00:05:40.479> this<00:05:40.569> one<00:05:40.719> a<00:05:40.779> try<00:05:41.310> this

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
might want to give this one a try this

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.119 
might want to give this one a try this
is<00:05:42.460> probably<00:05:42.729> one<00:05:42.909> of<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.710> Avenger<00:05:44.710> titles

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
is probably one of the Avenger titles

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.700 
is probably one of the Avenger titles
that<00:05:45.339> I<00:05:45.370> can<00:05:45.520> say<00:05:45.729> that's<00:05:46.349> always<00:05:47.349> for<00:05:47.620> the

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
that I can say that's always for the

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.469 
that I can say that's always for the
trades<00:05:47.979> that's<00:05:48.279> not<00:05:48.460> really<00:05:48.879> I<00:05:49.060> don't<00:05:49.300> think

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
trades that's not really I don't think

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.409 
trades that's not really I don't think
it's<00:05:49.690> as<00:05:49.779> popular<00:05:50.909> as<00:05:51.909> some<00:05:52.120> of<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:52.240> other

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
it's as popular as some of the other

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:53.670 
it's as popular as some of the other
ones<00:05:52.629> like<00:05:52.810> for<00:05:52.930> an<00:05:53.020> example<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.409> police

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
ones like for an example the police

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.430 
ones like for an example the police
crawl<00:05:54.009> war<00:05:54.310> or<00:05:55.089> some<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:55.960> newer<00:05:56.169> ones

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
crawl war or some of the newer ones

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.839 
crawl war or some of the newer ones
because<00:05:56.800> this<00:05:56.889> is<00:05:57.039> I<00:05:57.099> think<00:05:57.159> this<00:05:57.339> is<00:05:57.490> one<00:05:57.699> that

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
because this is I think this is one that

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.279 
because this is I think this is one that
just<00:05:58.029> kind<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.270> feel<00:05:58.599> underneath<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.080> radar

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
just kind of feel underneath the radar

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.589 
just kind of feel underneath the radar
but<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.550> was<00:06:00.669> probably<00:06:01.029> they<00:06:01.150> said<00:06:01.389> it<00:06:01.479> was

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
but it was probably they said it was

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.140 
but it was probably they said it was
probably<00:06:01.719> one<00:06:02.259> of<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.439> better<00:06:02.620> ones<00:06:02.909> he<00:06:03.909> said

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
probably one of the better ones he said

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.089 
probably one of the better ones he said
I<00:06:04.180> read<00:06:04.419> when<00:06:04.599> I<00:06:04.659> was<00:06:04.689> growing<00:06:05.110> up<00:06:05.199> because<00:06:05.379> not

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
I read when I was growing up because not

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.589 
I read when I was growing up because not
only<00:06:06.159> do<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.520> have<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:06.789> Avengers<00:06:07.270> but<00:06:07.419> he<00:06:07.509> had

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
only do you have the Avengers but he had

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.779 
only do you have the Avengers but he had
the<00:06:07.689> guardians<00:06:08.020> of<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.139> galaxy<00:06:08.770> and<00:06:09.009> as<00:06:09.460> a<00:06:09.490> kid

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
the guardians of the galaxy and as a kid

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.519 
the guardians of the galaxy and as a kid
I<00:06:09.819> used<00:06:09.939> to<00:06:10.180> love<00:06:10.360> guardians<00:06:10.810> of<00:06:10.870> the<00:06:10.990> galaxy

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
I used to love guardians of the galaxy

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.610 
I used to love guardians of the galaxy
so<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.520> guess<00:06:12.759> I'm<00:06:13.180> kind<00:06:13.839> of<00:06:13.870> biased<00:06:14.050> on<00:06:14.379> the<00:06:14.469> way

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
so I guess I'm kind of biased on the way

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.790 
so I guess I'm kind of biased on the way
along<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.460> way<00:06:15.610> anyway<00:06:16.539> zone<00:06:16.810> it's<00:06:17.469> not<00:06:17.650> that

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
along the way anyway zone it's not that

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.679 
along the way anyway zone it's not that
expensive<00:06:18.099> it's<00:06:18.520> like<00:06:18.550> only<00:06:19.979> $35<00:06:20.979> so<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:22.539> can

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:22.689 
expensive it's like only $35 so you can

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.179 
expensive it's like only $35 so you can
probably<00:06:22.839> find<00:06:23.020> it<00:06:23.169> in<00:06:23.289> stock<00:06:23.710> trades<00:06:24.039> or

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
probably find it in stock trades or

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
with the government because their front

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.140 
with the government because their front
door<00:07:06.260> was<00:07:06.440> always<00:07:06.590> open<00:07:06.710> and<00:07:07.250> anybody<00:07:07.880> can
