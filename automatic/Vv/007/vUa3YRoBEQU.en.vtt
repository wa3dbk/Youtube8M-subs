water

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.080 

when<00:00:21.710> you're<00:00:21.859> talking<00:00:21.980> about<00:00:22.279> the<00:00:22.730> bottled

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
when you're talking about the bottled

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.939 
when you're talking about the bottled
water<00:00:23.150> industry<00:00:23.449> you're<00:00:24.439> talking<00:00:24.830> about

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
water industry you're talking about

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.670 
water industry you're talking about
virtually<00:00:25.789> no<00:00:26.090> testing<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:26.930> people<00:00:27.500> have

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
virtually no testing and people have

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.589 
virtually no testing and people have
just<00:00:27.859> assumed<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.789> what<00:00:29.090> we're<00:00:29.210> getting<00:00:29.329> is

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
just assumed that what we're getting is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.170 
just assumed that what we're getting is
safe<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.320> we<00:00:30.529> tested<00:00:30.980> over<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.669> thousand

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
safe so we tested over a thousand

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.540 
safe so we tested over a thousand
bottles<00:00:32.449> of<00:00:32.899> water<00:00:33.079> and<00:00:33.340> found<00:00:34.340> everything

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
bottles of water and found everything

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.630 
bottles of water and found everything
from<00:00:34.820> arsenic<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:36.010> leaching<00:00:37.010> from<00:00:37.129> plastic

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
from arsenic to leaching from plastic

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.060 
from arsenic to leaching from plastic
bottles<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.540> bacterial<00:00:39.170> contaminants<00:00:39.739> and

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
bottles to bacterial contaminants and

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.369 
bottles to bacterial contaminants and
really<00:00:40.940> what<00:00:41.239> we<00:00:41.360> learned<00:00:41.600> from<00:00:41.750> this<00:00:42.110> was

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
really what we learned from this was

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:43.810 
really what we learned from this was
that<00:00:42.410> you<00:00:42.620> really<00:00:43.040> don't<00:00:43.190> know<00:00:43.339> what<00:00:43.610> you're

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
that you really don't know what you're

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.910 
that you really don't know what you're
getting<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.170> course<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.470> bottled<00:00:45.829> water

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
getting and of course a bottled water

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.439 
getting and of course a bottled water
this<00:00:46.400> is<00:00:46.550> one<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.730> those<00:00:46.879> products<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.360> is

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
this is one of those products that is

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.450 
this is one of those products that is
consumed<00:00:48.019> on<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.350> go<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.010> people<00:00:49.280> don't

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
consumed on the go so people don't

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.310 
consumed on the go so people don't
bother<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.449> bring<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:50.900> all<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.019> way<00:00:51.170> home

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
bother to bring it all the way home

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.020 
bother to bring it all the way home
again<00:00:51.650> and<00:00:51.800> put<00:00:51.949> it<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.159> their<00:00:52.309> recycling<00:00:52.790> bin

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
again and put it in their recycling bin

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.920 
again and put it in their recycling bin
and<00:00:53.210> that's<00:00:53.899> 56<00:00:54.379> billion<00:00:54.949> containers<00:00:55.930> that's

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
and that's 56 billion containers that's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.220 
and that's 56 billion containers that's
an<00:00:57.079> awful<00:00:57.440> lot<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.620> just<00:00:57.980> give<00:00:58.190> up<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:02.719> plastic

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
an awful lot to just give up the plastic

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.930 
an awful lot to just give up the plastic
bottle<00:01:03.620> usually<00:01:04.009> ends<00:01:04.220> up<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.550> landfill

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
bottle usually ends up in the landfill

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.990 
bottle usually ends up in the landfill
but<00:01:05.239> some<00:01:05.810> gets<00:01:06.020> incinerated<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:07.039> lot<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.910> it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
but some gets incinerated a lot of it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.370 
but some gets incinerated a lot of it
ends<00:01:08.119> up<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.390> Pacific<00:01:08.869> Ocean<00:01:11.080> it's<00:01:12.080> called

mostly plastic which doesn't biodegrade
many<00:01:20.179> agree<00:01:20.539> changing<00:01:21.289> our<00:01:21.470> behavior<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
many agree changing our behavior is the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.999 
many agree changing our behavior is the
only<00:01:23.210> hope<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.780> planet<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.350> closed<00:01:24.710> system

so everything that happens on earth

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.410 
so everything that happens on earth
stays<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:27.799> earth<00:01:28.100> what<00:01:28.579> we<00:01:28.700> need<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.000> do<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.270> we

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
stays on earth what we need to do is we

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.929 
stays on earth what we need to do is we
need<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.630> accept<00:01:30.020> responsibility<00:01:30.400> at<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> local
