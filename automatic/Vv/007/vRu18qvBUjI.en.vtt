00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.500 
first 20 seconds we live for having a
corner<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> set<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.210> tone<00:01:12.360> for

having the majority of chances as well

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
having the majority of chances as well
Arsenal<00:01:21.720> didn't<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:22.080> about<00:01:22.920> many<00:01:23.220> chances

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Arsenal didn't have about many chances

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.580 
Arsenal didn't have about many chances
but<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.210> seem<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> take<00:01:24.900> them<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.560> more

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
but they seem to take them a lot more

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.070 
but they seem to take them a lot more
concisely<00:01:26.189> than<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.030> Liverpool<00:01:27.509> team<00:01:27.689> did

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
concisely than the Liverpool team did

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.710 
concisely than the Liverpool team did
themselves<00:01:28.579> but<00:01:29.579> anyway<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> first<00:01:30.360> real

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
themselves but anyway the first real

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.800 
themselves but anyway the first real
action<00:01:31.320> came<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.979> around<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.909> 15-minute<00:01:33.780> mark

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
action came in around the 15-minute mark

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
action came in around the 15-minute mark
where<00:01:35.570> Luis<00:01:36.570> Suarez<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.579> taken<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
where Luis Suarez was taken down in

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.380 
where Luis Suarez was taken down in
inverted<00:01:39.420> commas<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:40.290> Chesney<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.490> I've

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
inverted commas by Chesney and I've

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
inverted commas by Chesney and I've
looked<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.869> back<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.549> doesn't<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.820> look

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
looked it back and doesn't really look

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.730 
looked it back and doesn't really look
like<00:01:45.060> any<00:01:45.360> contact<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> looks<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
like any contact it looks like a bit of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
like any contact it looks like a bit of
a<00:01:46.890> disgraceful<00:01:47.490> die<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.149> anyway<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.049> penalty

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
a disgraceful die but anyway the penalty

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
a disgraceful die but anyway the penalty
was<00:01:49.649> given<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.780> all<00:01:51.780> respect<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> referee

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
was given but all respect to the referee

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.710 
was given but all respect to the referee
because<00:01:53.070> he<00:01:53.280> didn't<00:01:53.579> actually<00:01:53.700> call<00:01:54.119> Chesney

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
because he didn't actually call Chesney

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
because he didn't actually call Chesney
so<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.770> was<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> firm<00:01:56.430> fair

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so you know it was a bit of firm fair

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.789 
so you know it was a bit of firm fair
cuz<00:01:57.030> Chesney<00:01:57.780> could<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.049> been<00:01:58.170> sent<00:01:58.409> off<00:01:58.530> as

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
cuz Chesney could have been sent off as

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
cuz Chesney could have been sent off as
the<00:01:58.950> last<00:01:59.130> man<00:01:59.340> back<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.759> all<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.390> wasn't

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the last man back and all that it wasn't

Arsenal<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.350> think<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
Arsenal in this I think this was the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760 
Arsenal in this I think this was the
definitive<00:02:18.060> part<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> game<00:02:19.050> without<00:02:19.320> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
definitive part of the game without the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.140 
definitive part of the game without the
double<00:02:20.040> save<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.340> think<00:02:20.520> Arsenal<00:02:20.880> could<00:02:21.030> have

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
double save I think Arsenal could have

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.850 
double save I think Arsenal could have
really<00:02:21.480> been<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.750> trouble<00:02:21.930> because<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.410> mentem

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
a little bit better than he did but that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.880 
a little bit better than he did but that
was<00:04:11.310> how<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.790> am<00:04:12.120> how<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.020> ended<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:13.620> did

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.580 
target so one and three was asked I had
seven<00:04:59.909> on<00:05:00.000> target<00:05:00.449> that<00:05:00.599> was<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:01.349> only<00:05:01.440> thing

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
seven on target that was the only thing

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.070 
seven on target that was the only thing
which<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:02.130> can<00:05:02.370> say<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.360> our<00:05:03.479> sins<00:05:03.750> defense

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
which I can say in our sins defense

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.230 
which I can say in our sins defense
about<00:05:04.440> what<00:05:05.099> could<00:05:05.430> have<00:05:05.520> possibly<00:05:05.669> want<00:05:06.120> it

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
about what could have possibly want it

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.469 
about what could have possibly want it
to<00:05:07.139> be<00:05:07.199> fair<00:05:07.409> I<00:05:07.440> think<00:05:07.530> live<00:05:07.979> for<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.520> was

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
to be fair I think live for I was

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.089 
to be fair I think live for I was
listening<00:05:09.659> to<00:05:10.050> on<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.289> radio<00:05:10.470> and<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:10.889> think

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
listening to on the radio and I think

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.860 
listening to on the radio and I think
live<00:05:11.280> before<00:05:11.400> kind<00:05:11.789> of<00:05:11.909> deserved<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.330> win<00:05:12.509> but

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
live before kind of deserved the win but

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.490 
live before kind of deserved the win but
at<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.349> end<00:05:13.380> of<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.620> day<00:05:13.800> goal<00:05:14.130> is<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> goal<00:05:14.639> and

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
at the end of the day goal is a goal and

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.520 
at the end of the day goal is a goal and
so<00:05:16.500> yeah<00:05:16.710> I'm<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.569> little<00:05:18.569> bit<00:05:18.840> from<00:05:18.990> Douglas

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530
