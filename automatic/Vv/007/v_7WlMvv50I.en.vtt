problem and my issues with this LP are
pretty<00:02:41.800> much<00:02:41.950> limited<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:43.300> songwriting<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
pretty much limited to the songwriting a

pretty much limited to the songwriting a
little<00:02:44.710> bit<00:02:44.860> but<00:02:45.430> mostly<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.450> vocals<00:02:46.900> there

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
little bit but mostly the vocals there

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.260 
little bit but mostly the vocals there
are<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.560> few<00:02:47.740> tracks<00:02:48.070> where<00:02:48.340> Jack<00:02:48.610> white<00:02:48.910> throws

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.350 
this demonic chorus on his voice that
sounds<00:02:53.380> way<00:02:53.590> more<00:02:53.620> obnoxious<00:02:54.070> than<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:55.240> is

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
