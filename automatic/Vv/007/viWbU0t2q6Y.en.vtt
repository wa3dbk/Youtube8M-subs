00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello my name is tempo and today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.810
 Let's have a look at the game plan Moerser 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.420
 song watering warfare on the xbox one 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 That's what I look like to the hak 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.360
 I got a gameplay sent 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.769
 from my cox cox you know that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.420
 even the sink with me 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.730
 Partner were project with which I then 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.010
 have won in the end and the kolbs has 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 an xbox where to stand at home and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 I can record the whole stuff here 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.810
 many thanks for the link is to her 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.789
 her cross of course in the video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.970
 description as well as a link to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 own channel and I'll say something like that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.559
 I first thought I saw oh 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 my god is what fucked shit 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.930
 because then and who is playing something like that please 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 i plant my tommys against and totally 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 honestly i only knew this one so far 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 tower defense version that was on the pc 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 yes, there is this as a free game 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.450
 somehow you have not seen me 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.280
 sometimes ne long time so as 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.690
 bridging in between times always 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 somehow gambled but this one has 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.440
 nothing more to do with it and me 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 really mean nothing at all 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 and if I look at it this way 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.050
 that would be in principle a game which has a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.949
 So it would also play on the console 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 honestly so their classic 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.549
 shooter and there I am absolute pc 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.189
 friend you know 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.420
 and that's not for me but such a thing 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.000
 history like that yes it is in principle 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 such a kind of match mode does not work 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.299
 seen so in principle that is now yes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 which right here just interpret 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.850
 his team that some one the one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 against the others and vote for them 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.650
 most kills has wins on 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 In the end I personally think so 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.250
 appearance of the optics of the control 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.390
 describes everything you touch 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.390
 right in the head 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.780
 I do not know that fits in exactly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.520
 my kind of humor so a kind of 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 do not take it too seriously and that is exactly 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.210
 where I play most consoles 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.810
 actually there is a sorting there 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.770
 of course, also brutally honest and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 serious games whether that is now in 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 battlefield or in call of duty 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 no idea that is of course absolutely 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 Not the case if you plan here 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 Stock market and sun looks so even the wolf 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.509
 he clearly knows that this is one of the 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 most secret title or one of the most 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.740
 have had your title lately now 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.270
 That's why I think it's great 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.530
 that someday I'll get players from it 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.630
 can provide even if it is still 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.060
 a short is and what we see here 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.119
 is of course program 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 So the plant taxi is moving 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.410
 Of course I'll tell you a few 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.970
 It is equipped with special skills 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.430
 that they also go through for under ground 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.810
 can flit the area and if I do that 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.190
 Almost every one has seen correctly 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.840
 figure somehow hold such a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.989
 Additivity as here now 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.640
 additive ability mucus all white 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.410
 He modest so now you can transfer your 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.790
 against strike so if I have that 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.349
 that's basically nothing 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.140
 more than an art, I say now 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.340
 easier attacking afar and I want to now 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 not too much detail 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.630
 because I did not play it myself 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.160
 stupidly, if I had a xbox or 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.170
 or a console as I said 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.980
 this would certainly be one of the titles 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.690
 I'm definitely closer 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 We would first look at this 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.000
 train in my circle 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 or if there really bock 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.519
 have on it 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.319
 but what I'm doing out of here now 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.599
 distance can say that she ever 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.430
 really knows what belongs or 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.920
 there is probably still such a one 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.230
 few small problems what that record 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 if you have no capture card 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.209
 like one kind of another 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.790
 device 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 because a microsoft probably throws like that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.569
 small stones the way they say though 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.160
 you can record clips 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.079
 which they do not say so loud 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.920
 is one can stop the clips always only 75th 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.150
 for minutes 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.410
 that's why this video is here too 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.239
 first only four minutes 59 long and is 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.579
 in principle then stop directly over 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.500
 microsoft this upload studio rupp or 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.829
 like the whole thing is recorded 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.690
 been 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.269
 I always think it's a bit stupid 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.500
 if you are the manufacturer moderately on the 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.209
 one side says yes that works 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.150
 do not no problem could make 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.680
 it is not a topic but then under the stroke 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 yes, I'll tell you one then 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.340
 a let's play or a gameplay 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.980
 that you want to comment properly 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.690
 10 15 minutes then yes not the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.269
 opportunity I find honest 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.739
 said a little stupid so stupid 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.060
 Actually, I have indeed seen 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.100
 that it's kind of like that again 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.750
 work around but that is extreme 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.670
 a lot of effort and wants with the pc 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.260
 connected and is no solution then 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.760
 I'll say that one 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.139
 normal mortals gets in line 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.540
 that means one is also again 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.799
 compelled one which forced the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.959
 means one does not come here again 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.630
 around it a capture cards too 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.340
 so here is plans stock market like that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.200
 I have not said that before 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.790
 if the clip is over I would be over 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.799
 We will take a closer look 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.430
 just funny and as before 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.190
 already said that is true 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.139
 my kind of fun or humor 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.850
 or this comic style and 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.160
 here, too, this bus attacked the side 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.050
 yes, almost through the ground wants to attack 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.710
 i think it looks cooler they just 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.470
 cool in my eyes that was plan 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.820
 sotheby's the first small Rhine view 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.050
 we'll look at each other in the other one 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.880
 video soon something again 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.949
 another mode or then as 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.410
 from the point of view of zombies and how to 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:45.270
 But here the plants look easy 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.440
 won my name is jim rumen and 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.330
 not really a rating for 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.350
 this video is super happy i say thank you 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.599
 for watching and see you 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.599
 Of course, always next video 31
