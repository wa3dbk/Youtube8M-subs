00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.429 
and gagged and you know I'm gonna be
honest<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.270> thought<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> one<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
honest with you I thought this one was a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.200 
honest with you I thought this one was a
little<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:58.799> funnier<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.820> know<00:01:59.909> that's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
little bit funnier but you know that's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.350 
little bit funnier but you know that's
like<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:01.460> American<00:02:02.460> sense<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.969> humor

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
like you know American sense of humor

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.999 
like you know American sense of humor
but<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.259> said<00:02:04.290> man<00:02:04.740> when<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
but I think like I said man when you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.330 
but I think like I said man when you
talk<00:02:05.159> about<00:02:05.399> India

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
talk about India

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.430 
talk about India
and<00:02:06.430> women's<00:02:06.880> rights<00:02:07.180> over<00:02:07.659> there<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.140> just

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and women's rights over there I just

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.499 
and women's rights over there I just
don't<00:02:08.619> think<00:02:08.739> that<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.280> have<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.910> woman

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
don't think that you have a woman

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.199 
don't think that you have a woman
feature<00:02:10.989> being<00:02:11.770> bound<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.580> gagged<00:02:12.849> over

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
feature being bound and gagged over

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.180

WPP<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.900> know<00:02:29.019> they<00:02:29.260> don't<00:02:29.380> have

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
anything to do with these ads so not

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.470 
anything to do with these ads so not
saying<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.470> Ford<00:02:32.830> condones<00:02:33.459> these<00:02:33.849> ads<00:02:34.209> in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
saying that Ford condones these ads in

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.040 
saying that Ford condones these ads in
any<00:02:34.780> way<00:02:35.050> but<00:02:35.830> uh<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:37.060> just<00:02:37.300> sad

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
any way but uh you know it's just sad

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.410 
any way but uh you know it's just sad
when<00:02:38.500> something<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.340> actually<00:02:40.030> makes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
when something like this actually makes

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.670 
when something like this actually makes
it<00:02:40.630> to<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.989> Internet

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
it to the Internet

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640 
it to the Internet
now<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.730> agree<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.690> just<00:02:44.260> okay<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
now you know I agree that just okay to

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.140 
now you know I agree that just okay to
be<00:02:44.890> creative<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.519> come<00:02:45.730> up<00:02:45.790> with<00:02:46.000> these

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
be creative and come up with these

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.090 
be creative and come up with these
concepts<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.500> think<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.860> should<00:02:47.950> have

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
concepts but I think it should have

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.830 
concepts but I think it should have
stayed<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.519> boardroom<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.420> don't<00:02:49.600> think

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
stayed in the boardroom I don't think

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.280 
stayed in the boardroom I don't think
that<00:02:50.080> these<00:02:50.680> ads<00:02:51.670> should<00:02:52.569> have<00:02:52.690> been<00:02:52.840> able<00:02:53.080> to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that these ads should have been able to

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.559 
that these ads should have been able to
hit<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.769> internet<00:02:54.160> like<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.549> did<00:02:54.849> but<00:02:55.480> you

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
hit the internet like they did but you

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.030 
hit the internet like they did but you
