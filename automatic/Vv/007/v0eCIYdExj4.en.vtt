can have the one without so you take the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
can have the one without so you take the
sponge<00:02:03.450> send<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.229> piece<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.040> all

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
sponge send a piece out of it it all

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.499 
sponge send a piece out of it it all
depends<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:05.520> what<00:02:05.790> type<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.119> work<00:02:06.360> you're

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
depends what what type of work you're

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.139 
depends what what type of work you're
doing<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.099> what<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> feel<00:02:08.340> better<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
doing and what you feel better with I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.140 
doing and what you feel better with I
like<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.170> variant<00:02:10.760> okay<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
like this variant okay this is the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
like this variant okay this is the
16-inch

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
16-inch

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.559 
16-inch
I<00:02:14.150> think<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.569> come<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.959> sizes<00:02:16.170> like

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
I think because they come in sizes like

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.910 
I think because they come in sizes like
increments<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.690> two<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.230> three<00:02:19.500> inches<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
increments of two to three inches so

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.399 
increments of two to three inches so
they<00:02:20.250> go<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.640> about<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:21.299> dunno<00:02:21.959> will<00:02:22.379> think

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
they go up to about I dunno will think

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.399 
they go up to about I dunno will think
about<00:02:22.920> 26<00:02:23.760> inches<00:02:23.879> along<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.290> know

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
about 26 inches along this but you know

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.130 
about 26 inches along this but you know
you<00:02:25.560> need<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:26.340> trowel<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.239> long<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:27.930> or

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you need a trowel that long you know or

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.589 
you need a trowel that long you know or
power<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.489> good<00:02:29.700> thing<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:30.000> about

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
power to what the good thing is about

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.350 
power to what the good thing is about
them<00:02:30.840> they're<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:31.470> light<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.239> they're<00:02:33.239> not

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
them they're so light so they're not

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.000 
them they're so light so they're not
going<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.629> weigh<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.780> down<00:02:33.900> whatever<00:02:34.379> you

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
can little tips what I've done put my

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.400 
can little tips what I've done put my
own<00:03:25.919> little<00:03:26.040> twist<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.549> these<00:03:26.760> tools<00:03:27.419> if<00:03:28.019> you

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
own little twist on these tools if you

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.220 
own little twist on these tools if you
get<00:03:28.590> some<00:03:28.739> nicks<00:03:29.720> on<00:03:30.720> these<00:03:30.959> leading<00:03:31.349> edges

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
get some nicks on these leading edges

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.180 
get some nicks on these leading edges
basically<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.440> know<00:03:34.530> you're<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.799> pick<00:03:35.040> up

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
basically you know you're gonna pick up

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.740 
basically you know you're gonna pick up
so<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:35.489> catch<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.849> bead<00:03:36.090> with<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.450> or<00:03:36.569> whatever

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
so you catch a bead with it or whatever

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.020 
so you catch a bead with it or whatever
and<00:03:37.169> obvious<00:03:38.129> plastic<00:03:38.639> they're<00:03:38.819> gonna<00:03:38.910> be

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and obvious plastic they're gonna be

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.470 
and obvious plastic they're gonna be
easily<00:03:39.410> you<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.530> damaged<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.819> know<00:03:42.000> as

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
easily you know damaged but you know as

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.210 
easily you know damaged but you know as
long<00:03:42.720> as<00:03:42.900> they're<00:03:42.989> not<00:03:43.019> too<00:03:43.290> severe<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.040> knick

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
long as they're not too severe the knick

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.069 
long as they're not too severe the knick
on<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.579> leading<00:03:44.730> edge<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.599> can<00:03:45.840> do

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
on the leading edge is what you can do

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.099 
on the leading edge is what you can do
is<00:03:46.560> get<00:03:46.739> yourself<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:47.280> standard<00:03:47.790> oil<00:03:48.060> stone<00:03:48.419> put

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
is get yourself a standard oil stone put

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.220 
is get yourself a standard oil stone put
some<00:03:49.290> wd-40<00:03:49.949> on<00:03:50.280> your<00:03:50.459> oil<00:03:50.669> stone<00:03:51.120> I'm<00:03:51.930> just

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
some wd-40 on your oil stone I'm just

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.420 
some wd-40 on your oil stone I'm just
running<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.590> up<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.949> down<00:03:53.069> it

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
running this up and down it

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.699 
running this up and down it
it'll<00:03:53.819> take<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.540> plastic<00:03:54.780> filings<00:03:55.470> off

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
it'll take the the plastic filings off

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.159 
it'll take the the plastic filings off
it<00:03:55.919> and<00:03:56.129> be<00:03:56.370> back<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.879> back<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.690> normal<00:03:58.049> with

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
it and be back to back to normal with

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.439 
it and be back to back to normal with
them<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:59.190> you're<00:03:59.370> good<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.669> go<00:03:59.699> so<00:04:00.060> just

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:04.220 
them and you're good to go so just
because<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:01.079> put<00:04:01.260> Nick's<00:04:01.590> into<00:04:01.949> these<00:04:03.230> into

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
because you put Nick's into these into

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.319 
because you put Nick's into these into
the<00:04:04.440> plastic<00:04:05.040> leading<00:04:05.400> edge<00:04:05.549> doesn't<00:04:06.120> mean<00:04:06.209> to

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
the plastic leading edge doesn't mean to
