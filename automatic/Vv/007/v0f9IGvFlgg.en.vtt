00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.880

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.650
 Cocktail Recipes I 've seen it years 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 shared facebook 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.840
 For example, from Jerry's recipe or 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.880
 by eatons may be really delicious 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.350
 look at all the other recipes to the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.599
 I have not got over here now 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 but my face is blinded but are 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 also all linked in the infobox below 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.350
 yes and that is my version of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.640
 chef coaches a little different than that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.200
 classic but if you look 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 I want this delicious summer 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 Prepared recipe then stays simple 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.530
 time 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.270
 I have b cube here once you can 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 but also normal ice cubes 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.899
 high outside supermarket respectively 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.949
 a gas station and i go too 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.780
 Give me four pieces five here 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:04.260
 piece of rain about as much lust for life 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.150
 stand because these work immediately and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.200
 What are we going to do now? 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.700
 pure orange juice I would 100 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 still use organic percent 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.670
 for the simple reason that is ours 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.630
 body that is our base of the whole 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.400
 cockpit and of it we give four cl 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.840
 in 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.799
 Then I give my cherry juice and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.450
 Although this is Schattenmorellen resp 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.119
 karstadt 100 percent and that of this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.140
 percent really delicious but real 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.820
 expensive 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 from newer if you then nothing to say 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.990
 which is not welcome not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.649
 bad 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.329
 and if you do not consume the 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.280
 could not buy big language 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:00.509
 very simple and that's what we're going for 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.200
 Then we'll take four cl 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.130
 corrosion and of that we go two cl 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.820
 Here is a company 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:18.290
 Cream a bit and go with it 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.910
 ten milliliters, so a cl 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.490
 if she liked again partly on 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.740
 every case for now again locally 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:34.230
 send and then in mecklar filmpreis 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:38.100
 then we are ready and giving 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.930
 everything so clean and that's it 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.280
 already worth seeing this cherry coke 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.280
 and i would be quite christin martens 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.080
 his cocktail is simple now 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180
 not a bit for every water 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.510
 full-bodied work is really delicious 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.700
 and yes I would say do that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.550
 after writes the comments shares that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 video is very important and then I'm out 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.320
