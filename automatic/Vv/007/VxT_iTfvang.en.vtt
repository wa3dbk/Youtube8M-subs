00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.539
 hello youtube friends how are we today 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.110
 we are in a new word game 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.880
 hour this time as you are able to see 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.500
 This is a game because I 'm going to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.539
 comment is not a like I just 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.930
 do guys I'm going to explain the by 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.489
 what was playing in the joy game 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.339
 plot to record is with my colleague gabriel 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.870
 as always and we ourselves departure or 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.829
 game was not because it was a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 super game play 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.760
 I did not record the audio well I do not know why 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.100
 what are we doing right now I was not going to 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.659
 render and the audio was not pointed out to me 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.239
 then I say let's talk about a 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:55.539
 little and that's to raise the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.229
 Truth is that heading did not 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.930
 much 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.909
 webber changed a bit for the part of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.439
 up but let's see that what matters is 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.140
 what comes next about half of the 

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:08.170
 departure and good a long time ago 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.390
 I did not play the jaguar like you can be 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 seeing around this ministers' fund 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.830
 money we go first and if they were the 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.259
 first official step that I played the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.679
 truth is that for me it was amazing this 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 game was the revelation let's go for it 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.520
 People say it was modern warfare 1 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.610
 I did not play to 4.4 then I could not 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.289
 Savor the call of duty as much 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 people I savor it's worth for me this was 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.890
 my first call of duty and the truth is 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.709
 that I loved it and so where are you seeing 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 it's where a little poquillo begins to change 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.450
 it's good that I hope you forgive me 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.100
 a lot says 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.439
 let's change a little bit here 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 up we can take a small streak and 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.340
 the truth is that if I take it out there is a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.960
 moment of the game where I'm going to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.909
 catch the rocket launcher I think it's here 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 I said no one looks mira javi dÃ­az 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.810
 what I'm going to do and it's no longer worth 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.570
 here goes a triple I think it 's after 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.520
 when 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.600
 when I spend a little more departure 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.220
 now we will be able to see that it was 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.150
 when he came down here is when here here is 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.750
 when I get my spleen to walk 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.850
 of ypf and easy to say salt 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.380
 here then I go back to swell almost from 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.850
 kill the kid is already here super 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.850
 euphoric with gabri what a pity he did not know 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.800
 I was able to record sound sound 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:28.660
 in like because I was with flip do and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:30.760
 in opacity and 101 but let's go that was 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.739
 the boss is totally amazing if you 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.440
 that you are going to be able to see gives me a rage that 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.060
 you shit because it 's recording two audios 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 It is worth two games the other 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.290
 it was for so much it's worth and I have not 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.380
 recorded none of the two audios and that 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.360
 I would give an incredible jerk guys 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.800
 delegation I say that has happened to us 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.400
 I also hope that you have me in the 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.830

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.230
