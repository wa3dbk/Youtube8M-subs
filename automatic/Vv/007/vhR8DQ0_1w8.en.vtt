to be in the words and that totally
makes<00:02:22.980> sense<00:02:23.310> since<00:02:24.319> Samsung<00:02:25.319> wouldn't<00:02:25.709> want

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
makes sense since Samsung wouldn't want

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.280 
makes sense since Samsung wouldn't want

to be lagging behind Apple in this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890 
to be lagging behind Apple in this
respect<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:29.400> course<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:30.510> wouldn't<00:02:30.660> be

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
respect of course we wouldn't be

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.990 
respect of course we wouldn't be

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.809

turns<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.380> Snapdragon<00:02:35.220> power<00:02:35.459> one

he<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.060> traditionally<00:03:51.720> been<00:03:51.750> one<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.380> the

he have traditionally been one of the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
best in smartphones so we should

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.319 
best in smartphones so we should

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
definitely expect some great things out

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.470 
definitely expect some great things out
of<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.660> galaxy<00:03:58.260> s5s<00:03:58.680> camera<00:03:59.130> the<00:04:00.090> battery

part<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:01.410> know<00:04:01.530> we<00:04:02.310> should<00:04:02.489> probably<00:04:02.519> expect

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
part you know we should probably expect

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.090 
part you know we should probably expect
something<00:04:03.510> around<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.670> 2900<00:04:05.670> or<00:04:06.109> 3200<00:04:07.109> milliamp

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
something around a 2900 or 3200 milliamp

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.460 
something around a 2900 or 3200 milliamp
hour<00:04:08.310> mark<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.690> is<00:04:09.840> bigger<00:04:10.140> than<00:04:10.170> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
hour mark and this is bigger than the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.009 
hour mark and this is bigger than the
juice<00:04:10.829> bag<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.310> was<00:04:11.459> available<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.299> s4

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
juice bag that was available in the s4

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.430 
juice bag that was available in the s4
so<00:04:13.650> hopefully<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.459> will<00:04:14.670> deliver<00:04:15.090> at<00:04:15.420> least<00:04:15.660> at

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
so hopefully it will deliver at least at

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.690 
so hopefully it will deliver at least at
all<00:04:16.650> two<00:04:17.400> days<00:04:17.579> of<00:04:17.880> moderate<00:04:18.419> usage<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:19.700> course

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
all two days of moderate usage of course

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.240 
all two days of moderate usage of course
we<00:04:21.419> also<00:04:21.539> have<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> lot<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.229> rumors<00:04:22.620> about<00:04:22.650> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
we also have a lot of rumors about the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.000 
we also have a lot of rumors about the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
alleged fingerprint sensor

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.160 
alleged fingerprint sensor
current<00:04:26.250> what<00:04:26.430> not<00:04:26.640> about<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.540> basically

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
current what not about this so basically

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.650 
current what not about this so basically
the<00:04:28.470> sensor<00:04:28.980> might<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.580> built<00:04:29.850> into<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.450> home

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
the sensor might be built into the home

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.470 
the sensor might be built into the home

may<00:04:37.320> also<00:04:37.500> remember<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.100> there<00:04:38.520> was<00:04:38.820> also

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
may also remember that there was also

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.470 
may also remember that there was also
this<00:04:40.230> expectation<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:41.040> an<00:04:41.220> iris<00:04:41.730> scanner

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
this expectation of an iris scanner

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.740 
this expectation of an iris scanner
being<00:04:42.870> on<00:04:43.170> board<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.520> think<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.120> more

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
being on board but we think this is more

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.500 
being on board but we think this is more
on<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> far-fetched<00:04:46.800> side<00:04:47.250> now

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
on the far-fetched side now

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.180 
on the far-fetched side now
software-wise<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:49.110> new<00:04:49.230> galaxy<00:04:49.830> s5

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.360 
software-wise the new galaxy s5

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
should the more exciting part here is

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.040 
should the more exciting part here is

the add the new TouchWiz interface dad's
already<00:05:01.350> being<00:05:02.010> teased<00:05:02.430> by<00:05:02.640> Samsung<00:05:03.480> so<00:05:04.320> we

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
already being teased by Samsung so we

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.020 
already being teased by Samsung so we
are<00:05:04.710> now<00:05:04.860> almost<00:05:05.070> one<00:05:05.550> hundred<00:05:05.790> percent

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
are now almost one hundred percent

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.530 
are now almost one hundred percent
certain<00:05:06.570> that<00:05:07.110> es5<00:05:07.830> will<00:05:08.610> come<00:05:08.880> with<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> brand

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
certain that es5 will come with a brand

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.200 
certain that es5 will come with a brand
new<00:05:09.690> UI<00:05:10.140> and<00:05:10.620> that's<00:05:11.100> great<00:05:11.430> considering<00:05:12.180> that

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
new UI and that's great considering that

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.080 
new UI and that's great considering that
the<00:05:12.570> previous<00:05:12.810> TouchWiz<00:05:13.560> wasn't<00:05:14.100> exactly<00:05:14.460> fit

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
the previous TouchWiz wasn't exactly fit

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.150 
the previous TouchWiz wasn't exactly fit
for<00:05:15.420> everyone<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.230> this<00:05:16.560> brings<00:05:16.770> us<00:05:17.130> to

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
for everyone and this brings us to

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.980 
for everyone and this brings us to
what's<00:05:17.460> probably<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.000> most<00:05:18.330> interesting

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
what's probably the most interesting

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.410 
what's probably the most interesting
part<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.590> video<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.850> is<00:05:21.030> when<00:05:21.270> the

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
part of this video and that is when the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.490 
part of this video and that is when the
galaxy<00:05:21.870> s5<00:05:22.260> is<00:05:22.290> going<00:05:22.890> to<00:05:23.070> launch<00:05:23.930> okay<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:24.990> we

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
galaxy s5 is going to launch okay so we

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.130 
galaxy s5 is going to launch okay so we
can't<00:05:25.740> be<00:05:25.950> really<00:05:26.160> certain<00:05:26.670> about<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.630> but

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
can't be really certain about this but

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.010 
can't be really certain about this but
assuming<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.490> galaxy<00:05:30.060> s5<00:05:30.510> will<00:05:30.540> be

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
assuming that galaxy s5 will be

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.240 
assuming that galaxy s5 will be
announced<00:05:31.530> at<00:05:31.700> mwc<00:05:32.700> 2014<00:05:34.040> chances<00:05:35.040> are<00:05:35.220> that

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
announced at mwc 2014 chances are that

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.790

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
its market launch is going to happen
