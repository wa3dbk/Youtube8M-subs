00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 to me 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 hello or be late in welcome on channel 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.469
 and we bring here a background gameplay 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 that I'm really going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.260
 be here good that comment you then not 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.080
 we have advanced a lot the truth has not been 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.230
 advanced a lot since the last time 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.260
 he pulled one of the order of the lights 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.480
 etcetera etcetera and why not 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.700
 advanced and we're actually a bit 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.280
 lost a little bit lost by the 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.440
 theme d 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.989
 that there were certain things that we were 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.949
 based on finding the next step that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.489
 It was a lie, the man who said in 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.489
 the forums that there was a horse that put 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.339
 a poetry that said to transfer a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.159
 actually watered all that was lies 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.229
 the invention him and the truth that they were 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.530
 another side quite big many people 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.530
 He passed 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.080
 your search in those comments that said 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.940
 this man and good now that we have left 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.710
 what is it that is really what is 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.619
 that we know the interest is complete 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.940
 our full as the rhythm that does not 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
 It is complete that many although a lot 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.360
 people are saying yes it is 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.149
 complete but we have not jumped about 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.790
 steps and well I do not think we have 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.600
 skipped a few steps itself can be that 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.700
 I wanna say the creator of the 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.740
 zombies that said to tell you that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.360
 We are making order by order is that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.360
 the next step is not the one we are 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.909
 following like that of the lights that the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.440
 people were focusing on the door of 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.009
 the laundry before this man 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.479
 will speak it may be that if there is a 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.720
 trino gómez trino gómez system is not a 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.819
 man a little weird and if you can 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.780
 put the nascar because they are recordings 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.850
 that he took out of the same game to invent 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.369
 his ball but therefore they are 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.560
 recordings that nobody has heard in the 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.829
 game 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.250
 and quite new for us to 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.250
 we 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.300
 what are we going to find when we listen 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.970
 the recordings because supposedly put 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.569
 the nazca that we will achieve with that is my 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.569
 fucking idea 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 the point is that when we complete 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.710
 that system is supposed to brake the rest 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.620
 This can tell you more meter 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.930
 the nascar and will complete the system and a 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.870
 man will change something else you can 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.170
 unlock the best of the doors of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.300
 that of the lights I have no ideas 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.620
 truth is that it is quite interesting what 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.680
 I will investigate for them 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.170
 I'll put you here about this news 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.600
 topic that I discover and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.520
 good 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.910
 I will also start serving a series 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.970
 about the history of the transit neighbors 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.890
 but totally zombie to 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.490
 understand a little bit more about what it's all about 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.580
 this roll of more remains in how they have 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.860
 come up here what have been passed 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.050
 of fetera interests etcetera with the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.240
 creation of the zombies I hope that you 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.280
 like it and we'll see you in other videos 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.110
 you know that the favorite always helps 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.110
 So, I'll see you by now
