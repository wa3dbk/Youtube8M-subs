light that spins around and you get a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.180 
light that spins around and you get a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
whether I'll be using this pot and

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.770 
whether I'll be using this pot and
probably<00:03:09.660> will<00:03:09.840> give<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> trial<00:03:10.919> fit<00:03:11.780> let's

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
probably will give it a trial fit let's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.699 
probably will give it a trial fit let's
see<00:03:15.209> go<00:03:15.419> in<00:03:15.569> place<00:03:15.840> somewhere<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.680> that

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
see go in place somewhere like that

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.610 
see go in place somewhere like that
not<00:03:17.040> just<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.579> questions<00:03:17.880> still<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.389> enough

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
not just in questions still have enough

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.069 
not just in questions still have enough
