00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 how about movie friends james jones to a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.859
 more video from assassin's creed 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.639
 revelations on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 take out the achievement or dance trophy more than 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 thousand words which consists in that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 let's grab the 10 sheets that are here 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 scattered throughout the map of well 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:25.019
 we are in good manners 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 in Constantinople as you can see I'm going 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 be this taught where are I going 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.669
 to put the map makes it very small and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.369
 great for you to be more 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.010
 simple to find it and well then let's go 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 to be giving it and we hope that this will 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.720
 help also this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.720
 by putting these 10 together 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.580
 and good to be able to make a hidden challenge 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.510
 that also gives you a trophy achievement that if 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.720
 it does not leave anymore the memory is that of sacred 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.360
 This wisdom is to make a good 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.010
 to see in the other video but that is to do 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.410
 as who I challenge in less than 6 minutes 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.290
 If you want to do it 100% this is no longer 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.690
 affects a lot for your achievement or trophy 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.970
 have it to 100% memory that's already 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.770
 something like personal us if what 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.360
 we do one hundred percent and at the end of 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 there they give us the best armor of the game 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.240
 is the armor this, because never again 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.729
 it breaks then we do not have to 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.470
 spend on is repairing the and gives us the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.840
 life to the maximum which is also good 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.670
 father personally to me the only thing that 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.650
 I do not like this armor is that it 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.420
 cover the face but that is already 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.900
 matter of tastes still so although not 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.400
 is covering his face I think he looks 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.800
 incredible this is the shipowner is 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.850
 very beautiful and then to falar the want 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.880
 drink 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.619
 and well we do it here, I do not know 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.730
 worry if the first videos are 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.860
 says you've been 2 d 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.500
 if you were grabbing the first 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.420
 that's what I did because there I had a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.800
 small mistake follows but how are the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.960
 videos were corrected and of 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.210
 suddenly we come back to wait for her 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.590
 you who was initiated were 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.840
 for these things 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.340
 and we will continue here with the magic of 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.490
 edit to continue showing them where 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.290
 are the others 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.190
 You can find this factor are not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.560
 alternate 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 the leaves are what we are doing in the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.330
 center of the market as 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.750
 it can be in having run around 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.790
 from the outside and ready 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.320
 remember that the video helped them 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.300
 leave us some like for more 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.920

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.890

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.569
 answer them 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.370

 revelations of 3 of many other new 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.850
 more minecraft 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.980
 Over there 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.980
 and good 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.270
 I will continue with this I hope that you 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.270
 help and hopefully subscribe 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.940
 and I'm here I hope to be leaving 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.160
 very clear where 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.050
 more or less on the right side because here 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.370
 there are two pillars then it is the one on the side 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.890
 straight 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.890
 in less than how it looks here on the map 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.069
 highlight 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.939
 now we are doing this part 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.590
 above the map we are very close to 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.930
 where we started the game and where we do 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.180
 our first our first creed of 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.209
 murderers 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.069
 I was at the top of the fifth 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.800
 network goes up 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.000
 go Go 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.000
 we are very close 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.560
 and a little more a little more 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.930
 and ready 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.590
 well there are still several more to be taken 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.980
 here it was better when you take the how 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.980
 It is said that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.750
 in fact that's when we got to 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.670
 this the word and we are more or less 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.000
 same 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.380
 and I used a parachute on the part of the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.790
 previous part to go out and out there 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.830
 it also ends up being an achievement or trophy 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.450
 of which you can already see in the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.419
 past videos that we have been uploading 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.400
 we have a special part of the list 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.180
 for the achievements of other games this 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.350
 center revelations 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.410
 this is getting closer and closer to the film 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.630
 ok this is me better that I had gone up 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.670
 to the wrong tower 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.020
 they remember this place if they are 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.860
 seeing several of our lives because 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.680
 here we make several achievements or trophies 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.949
 from the pillar that is closest to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.849
 aqueduct that we use as shortcuts right now 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.839
 nothing else we are missing two pages 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.999
 then let's go down here to me here 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.229
 I had a problem because I believe that 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.819
 I was at the top and I'm 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.409
 looking for a ratote and then I realized 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.149
 that was in the part of up down 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.669
 because I thought that like parting 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:04.279
 I was here looking for him here yesterday and 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.419
 Well I hope that with this more value 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.420
 it is clear that they do not have any 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.480
 doubt 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.540
 let's continue and we go for the last page the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.640
 last page that makes it against 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.640
 just go map 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.270
 let's find just here 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.010
 exactly which side did you find yourself 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.350
 then we go around here we take it and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.600
 good in my case like the toy makers 70 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.330
 I like the achievement of worth more than a thousand 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.650
 words I hope you have helped them 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.440
 this thank you very much for having seen this 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.660
 video and recount schleck yes comments 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.800
 they help us a lot, they are very well and we 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.800
 we see in the following video
