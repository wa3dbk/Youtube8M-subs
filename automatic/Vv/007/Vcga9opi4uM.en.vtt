00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
it's a good strike I think you're should

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.050 
it's a good strike I think you're should
do<00:02:30.470> well<00:02:30.680> with<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.070> what<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> terrific

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
do well with it but what a terrific

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.059 
do well with it but what a terrific
this<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.450> look<00:02:32.989> at<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.170> technique<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:33.920> we

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
this is look at the technique there we

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.900 
this is look at the technique there we
can<00:02:34.220> see<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:36.140> wasn't<00:02:36.440> offside<00:02:36.980> Atkins<00:02:37.670> but

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
can see what wasn't offside Atkins but

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.550 
can see what wasn't offside Atkins but
wasn't<00:02:38.270> offside<00:02:38.630> because<00:02:38.989> he's<00:02:39.349> actually

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
wasn't offside because he's actually

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.770 
wasn't offside because he's actually

see<00:02:57.319> how<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.560> player<00:02:58.370> can<00:02:58.580> stand<00:02:58.880> in<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> middle

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
see how a player can stand in the middle

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.350 
see how a player can stand in the middle
of<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.420> goal<00:03:00.190> 23<00:03:01.190> yards<00:03:01.580> Max<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.090> weak<00:03:02.209> from<00:03:02.330> the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.559 
goalkeeper and not being fulfillment
plane<00:03:04.549> i<00:03:04.760> think<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.030> was<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.360> middle<00:03:05.510> of

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
plane i think it was in the middle of

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.300 
plane i think it was in the middle of
the<00:03:05.630> goal<00:03:05.780> post<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.380> he<00:03:06.890> jumped<00:03:07.130> over<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
the goal post and he jumped over the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.340 
the goal post and he jumped over the
board<00:03:07.549> mmm<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.299> boy<00:03:08.420> he<00:03:08.569> actually<00:03:08.720> jumps<00:03:09.140> over

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
board mmm the boy he actually jumps over

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.900 
board mmm the boy he actually jumps over
the<00:03:09.440> ball<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.830> think<00:03:10.280> if<00:03:10.370> he'd<00:03:10.549> have<00:03:10.640> been<00:03:10.760> in

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
the ball I think if he'd have been in

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.460 
the ball I think if he'd have been in
his<00:03:11.030> eye<00:03:11.060> line<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.750> he'd<00:03:11.840> have<00:03:11.959> been<00:03:12.080> in<00:03:12.230> front

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
his eye line and he'd have been in front

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.780 
his eye line and he'd have been in front
of<00:03:12.560> him<00:03:12.650> then<00:03:12.830> definitely<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.400> know<00:03:13.640> they'd
