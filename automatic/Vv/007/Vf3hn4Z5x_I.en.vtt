Ellie and the m27 IAR both of these LMGs

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
Ellie and the m27 IAR both of these LMGs
are<00:00:23.550> great<00:00:23.849> weapons<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.480> use<00:00:24.660> they<00:00:25.140> compare

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
are great weapons to use they compare

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.140 
are great weapons to use they compare
much<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> salt<00:00:26.430> rifle<00:00:26.759> so<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:27.029> you've

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
much like a salt rifle so if you've

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
much like a salt rifle so if you've
never<00:00:27.300> used<00:00:27.450> LMGs<00:00:28.110> and<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.650> thought<00:00:28.800> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
never used LMGs and you thought that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.139 
never used LMGs and you thought that
they're<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.579> slow<00:00:29.759> and<00:00:29.910> don't<00:00:30.029> do

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
they're just really slow and don't do

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.940

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
let's jump straight into the weapon

let's jump straight into the weapon
comparison<00:00:55.380> starting<00:00:55.740> off<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.130> MLE

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
comparison starting off of the MLE

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.760 
comparison starting off of the MLE
now<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> amalienborg<00:00:57.720> alum<00:00:58.290> geez<00:00:58.530> don't

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now the amalienborg alum geez don't

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.980 
now the amalienborg alum geez don't
actually<00:00:58.950> use<00:00:59.130> magazines<00:00:59.970> they<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.810> use

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
actually use magazines they actually use

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually use magazines they actually use
clip<00:01:01.410> size<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.340> MLE<00:01:02.610> actually<00:01:03.030> has<00:01:03.180> 100

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
clip size so the MLE actually has 100

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140 
clip size so the MLE actually has 100
rounds<00:01:04.170> per<00:01:04.439> clip<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.880> average

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
rounds per clip which is about average

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.300 
rounds per clip which is about average
is<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.869> get<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.200> most<00:01:07.530> LMGs<00:01:08.070> across

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
is what you get with most LMGs across

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890 
is what you get with most LMGs across
every<00:01:08.640> single<00:01:08.790> call<00:01:09.060> duty<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> has<00:01:09.540> come<00:01:09.750> out

a<00:01:10.110> few<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.799> less<00:01:11.039> but<00:01:11.340> those<00:01:11.490> are

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a few of them have less but those are

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
a few of them have less but those are
like<00:01:11.909> variants<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.539> LM<00:01:12.840> cheese<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.740> we're

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
like variants on LM cheese which we're

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
like variants on LM cheese which we're
not<00:01:14.069> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> talk<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.119> video

the<00:01:15.749> amela<00:01:15.960> does<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> most<00:01:16.649> damage<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:17.249> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the amela does the most damage out of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.669 
the amela does the most damage out of
all<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.939> LMGs<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> does<00:01:18.749> 50<00:01:19.170> damage<00:01:19.200> up

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
all of the LMGs it does 50 damage up

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.859 
all of the LMGs it does 50 damage up
close<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.729> max<00:01:20.999> distance<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
close and then it is max distance it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
close and then it is max distance it
does<00:01:22.049> 30<00:01:22.350> damage<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.069> it<00:01:23.369> doesn't<00:01:23.609> have<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
does 30 damage so it doesn't have a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
does 30 damage so it doesn't have a
steep<00:01:23.999> drop-off<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.749> not<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.109> steep<00:01:25.319> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
steep drop-off but it's not as steep it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
steep drop-off but it's not as steep it
was<00:01:25.740> actually<00:01:26.130> really<00:01:26.700> close<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.479> some

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
was actually really close to what some

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.840 
was actually really close to what some
of<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> SMGs<00:01:28.649> do<00:01:28.859> up<00:01:29.039> close<00:01:29.310> which<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.549> pretty

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of the SMGs do up close which is pretty

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.879 
of the SMGs do up close which is pretty
crazy<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.319> know<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.799> does

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
crazy but you know that's what it does

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:34.999 
crazy but you know that's what it does
50<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.549> close<00:01:32.850> 30<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> distance<00:01:34.109> because<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
50 up close 30 at a distance because it

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
50 up close 30 at a distance because it
does<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.249> a<00:01:35.280> ton<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.700> damage<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.240> close<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
does do a ton of damage of close it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.779 
does do a ton of damage of close it
actually<00:01:36.959> is<00:01:37.139> a<00:01:37.259> 2<00:01:37.319> to<00:01:37.740> 4<00:01:37.770> shot<00:01:38.280> kill<00:01:38.310> weapon

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
actually is a 2 to 4 shot kill weapon

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.459 
actually is a 2 to 4 shot kill weapon
you're<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.569> finding<00:01:39.899> yourself<00:01:39.990> killing

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
you're gonna be finding yourself killing

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:41.929 
you're gonna be finding yourself killing
people<00:01:40.679> really<00:01:41.009> quickly<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.700> weapon

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
people really quickly with this weapon

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.059 
people really quickly with this weapon
it<00:01:42.749> does<00:01:42.929> have<00:01:43.109> a<00:01:43.139> headshot<00:01:43.530> multiplier<00:01:43.709> of

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
it does have a headshot multiplier of

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.730 
it does have a headshot multiplier of
1.4<00:01:44.999> times<00:01:45.329> which<00:01:45.749> means<00:01:45.959> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.380> aim<00:01:46.590> for

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
1.4 times which means if you do aim for

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.020 
1.4 times which means if you do aim for
the<00:01:46.829> head<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.459> not<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.880> do

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the head it's not really gonna do

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
the head it's not really gonna do
anything<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.539> already<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:48.990> shot<00:01:49.020> weapon

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
anything it's already a two shot weapon

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.550 
anything it's already a two shot weapon
I<00:01:49.799> would<00:01:50.249> say<00:01:50.490> more<00:01:51.420> than<00:01:51.539> anything<00:01:51.810> since<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I would say more than anything since it

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.319 
I would say more than anything since it
does<00:01:52.709> have<00:01:52.859> a<00:01:52.889> 1.4<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.759> doesn't<00:01:54.029> really<00:01:54.149> do

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
does have a 1.4 it doesn't really do

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.029 
does have a 1.4 it doesn't really do
anything<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.200> try<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.439> aim<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> body

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
anything just try to aim for the body

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.349 
anything just try to aim for the body
you're<00:01:56.310> gonna<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.609> dropping<00:01:56.999> people<00:01:57.149> as

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
you're gonna be dropping people as

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.580 
you're gonna be dropping people as
opposed<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> trying<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> aim<00:01:58.109> for<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.289> head<00:01:58.409> if

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
opposed to trying to aim for the head if

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.010 
opposed to trying to aim for the head if
possibly<00:01:59.100> missing<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.090> MLE<00:02:00.359> has<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> pretty

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
possibly missing the MLE has a pretty

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.039 
possibly missing the MLE has a pretty
high<00:02:01.200> rate<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.439> fire<00:02:01.679> shoots<00:02:02.100> at<00:02:02.420> 631<00:02:03.420> rounds

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
high rate of fire shoots at 631 rounds

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.839 
high rate of fire shoots at 631 rounds
per<00:02:04.229> minute<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.859> actually<00:02:05.279> pretty<00:02:05.459> fast<00:02:05.700> for

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
per minute is actually pretty fast for

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.620 
per minute is actually pretty fast for
an<00:02:05.969> LMG<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
an LMG and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.330 
an LMG and
you<00:02:07.719> know<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.020> kind<00:02:08.380> of<00:02:08.470> spams<00:02:08.800> them<00:02:09.009> out<00:02:09.130> it's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
you know it kind of spams them out it's

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.100 
you know it kind of spams them out it's
a<00:02:09.429> really<00:02:09.670> good<00:02:09.819> weapon<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.209> spam<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.690> and

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
a really good weapon of spam with and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.440 
a really good weapon of spam with and
since<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.739> does<00:02:11.890> do<00:02:12.099> all<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.849> really<00:02:13.060> fast

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
since it does do all that really fast

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.240 
since it does do all that really fast
rate<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.750> fire<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.349> actually<00:02:14.709> has<00:02:14.860> medium

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
rate of fire it actually has medium

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.400 
rate of fire it actually has medium
recoil<00:02:15.670> it's<00:02:15.760> pretty<00:02:16.060> bad<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.989> know<00:02:17.110> every

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
recoil it's pretty bad you know every

recoil it's pretty bad you know every
LMG<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.920> kind<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.190> this<00:02:18.340> way<00:02:18.489> but<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:19.360> does<00:02:19.540> have

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
LMG is kind of this way but it does have

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.270

reloading but with that being said let's

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.789 
reloading but with that being said let's
move<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:47.110> actually<00:02:47.470> does<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
move on this actually does the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.009 
move on this actually does the
second-most<00:02:48.370> damage<00:02:49.030> out<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.209> all<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> LMGs

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
second-most damage out of all the LMGs

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.170 
second-most damage out of all the LMGs
it<00:02:50.170> does<00:02:50.290> 48<00:02:50.799> damage<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.280> close<00:02:51.519> and<00:02:51.790> drops

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
it does 48 damage of close and drops

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.030 
it does 48 damage of close and drops
down<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.540> 32<00:02:52.959> s<00:02:53.019> which<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.260> pretty<00:02:53.560> interesting

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
down to 32 s which is pretty interesting

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.740 
down to 32 s which is pretty interesting
it<00:02:54.370> doesn't<00:02:54.760> do<00:02:54.819> as<00:02:54.940> much<00:02:54.970> damage<00:02:55.390> up<00:02:55.720> close

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
it doesn't do as much damage up close

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.140 
it doesn't do as much damage up close
but<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> doesn't<00:02:57.069> have<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> steep<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.060> a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
but it doesn't have a steep of a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.240 
but it doesn't have a steep of a
drop-off<00:02:58.569> SD<00:02:59.110> MLE<00:02:59.650> which<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.069> pretty

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
drop-off SD MLE which is pretty

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.440 
drop-off SD MLE which is pretty
interesting<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:00.849> it<00:03:00.940> doesn't<00:03:01.150> do<00:03:01.209> as<00:03:01.299> much

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
interesting so it doesn't do as much

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.000 
interesting so it doesn't do as much
damage<00:03:01.480> up<00:03:02.049> close<00:03:02.260> but<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.620> does<00:03:02.739> more<00:03:02.980> damage

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
damage up close but it does more damage

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.800 
damage up close but it does more damage
at<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.459> distance<00:03:03.819> pretty<00:03:04.299> interesting<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
at a distance pretty interesting I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.270 
at a distance pretty interesting I
thought<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.049> was<00:03:05.140> something<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.470> guys<00:03:05.650> would

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
thought it was something you guys would

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.370 
thought it was something you guys would
kind<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.549> enjoy<00:03:06.849> because<00:03:07.599> it<00:03:07.870> does<00:03:08.019> do<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.200> lot

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
kind of enjoy because it does do a lot

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.770 
kind of enjoy because it does do a lot
of<00:03:08.620> damage<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.190> close<00:03:09.459> but<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:10.209> still<00:03:10.480> doesn't

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
of damage of close but it still doesn't

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.569 
of damage of close but it still doesn't
get<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.140> 50<00:03:11.530> mark<00:03:11.799> this<00:03:11.950> actually<00:03:12.370> makes

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
get to that 50 mark this actually makes

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.000 
get to that 50 mark this actually makes
it<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.880> 3<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.299> 4<00:03:13.510> shot<00:03:13.780> kill<00:03:13.810> weapon<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.829> you're

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
it a 3 to 4 shot kill weapon so you're

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.500 
it a 3 to 4 shot kill weapon so you're
not<00:03:15.130> gonna<00:03:15.280> be<00:03:15.400> killing<00:03:15.790> people<00:03:15.819> up<00:03:16.209> close

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
not gonna be killing people up close

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.970 
not gonna be killing people up close
faster<00:03:17.319> than<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.560> MLE

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
faster than the MLE

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.920 
faster than the MLE
but<00:03:18.400> definitely<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> distance<00:03:19.600> it's<00:03:19.750> where

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
but definitely at a distance it's where

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.380 
but definitely at a distance it's where
really<00:03:20.260> shines<00:03:20.560> since<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.980> does<00:03:21.190> fire<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.120> lot

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
really shines since it does fire a lot

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.449 
really shines since it does fire a lot
faster<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.350> also<00:03:23.530> has<00:03:23.889> a<00:03:23.920> little<00:03:24.370> bit

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
faster and it also has a little bit

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.809 
faster and it also has a little bit
higher<00:03:24.700> damage<00:03:25.600> at<00:03:25.989> its<00:03:26.139> max<00:03:26.410> distance<00:03:26.950> it

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
higher damage at its max distance it

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.400 
higher damage at its max distance it
does<00:03:28.030> also<00:03:28.239> have<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.660> same<00:03:28.930> headshot

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
does also have the same headshot

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.069 
does also have the same headshot
multiplier<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.889> 1.4<00:03:30.700> times<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.569> since<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
multiplier of 1.4 times and since it

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.229 
multiplier of 1.4 times and since it
does<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.380> 32<00:03:32.889> damage<00:03:33.340> it's<00:03:33.549> kind<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.819> really

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
does do 32 damage it's kind of really

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.460 
does do 32 damage it's kind of really
awesome<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.660> try<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.870> aim<00:03:35.049> for<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.290> head<00:03:35.440> of

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
awesome to try to aim for the head of

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.590 
awesome to try to aim for the head of
the<00:03:35.590> distance<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.220> can't<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:37.030> course<00:03:37.120> it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
the distance if you can't of course it

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.150 
the distance if you can't of course it
does<00:03:37.780> have<00:03:38.019> quite<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.290> bit<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.560> recoil<00:03:38.920> which

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
does have quite a bit of recoil which

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.069 
does have quite a bit of recoil which
we'll<00:03:39.310> talk<00:03:39.459> about<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.880> little<00:03:40.000> bit<00:03:40.150> but<00:03:40.900> if

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
we'll talk about in a little bit but if

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.390 
we'll talk about in a little bit but if
you<00:03:41.200> can<00:03:41.530> aim<00:03:41.769> for<00:03:41.799> the<00:03:42.010> head<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.280> you're

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
you can aim for the head if you're

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.460 
you can aim for the head if you're
really<00:03:42.790> good<00:03:43.299> at<00:03:43.510> doing<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.900> I'll<00:03:44.170> suggest

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
really good at doing that I'll suggest

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.629 
really good at doing that I'll suggest
that<00:03:44.739> you<00:03:44.829> do<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.069> since<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.280> are<00:03:45.400> gonna<00:03:45.549> be

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:45.639 
that you do it since you are gonna be

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.360 
that you do it since you are gonna be
able<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.910> cut<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.120> down<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.480> basically<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.980> 2

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
able to cut it down to basically a a 2

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.940 
able to cut it down to basically a a 2
to<00:03:48.790> 3<00:03:49.090> shot<00:03:49.329> kill<00:03:49.359> weapon<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:50.109> you<00:03:50.230> do<00:03:50.590> do<00:03:50.829> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
to 3 shot kill weapon if you do do it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.800 
to 3 shot kill weapon if you do do it
correctly<00:03:51.310> now<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.030> being<00:03:52.269> said<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.569> MLA

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
correctly now if that being said the MLA

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.890 
correctly now if that being said the MLA
shoots<00:03:53.170> at<00:03:53.430> 705<00:03:54.430> rounds<00:03:55.180> per<00:03:55.329> minute<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.780> is

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
shoots at 705 rounds per minute it is

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.710 
shoots at 705 rounds per minute it is
insanely<00:03:56.350> fast<00:03:56.739> for<00:03:57.040> an<00:03:57.400> LMG<00:03:57.940> which<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.269> pretty

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
insanely fast for an LMG which is pretty

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.080 
insanely fast for an LMG which is pretty
damn<00:03:58.900> crazy<00:03:59.230> but<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.400> course<00:04:00.700> since<00:04:00.970> we

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
damn crazy but of course since we

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.030 
damn crazy but of course since we
mentioned<00:04:01.269> this<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.600> with<00:04:01.930> DM<00:04:02.230> le<00:04:02.410> since<00:04:02.920> it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
mentioned this is with DM le since it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.559 
mentioned this is with DM le since it
does<00:04:03.190> shoot<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.549> fast<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.000> has<00:04:04.120> very<00:04:04.480> high

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
does shoot so fast it has very high

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.660 
does shoot so fast it has very high
recoil<00:04:05.230> you're<00:04:05.709> gonna<00:04:05.829> find<00:04:06.040> yourself<00:04:06.430> often

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
recoil you're gonna find yourself often

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.729 
recoil you're gonna find yourself often
as<00:04:07.060> well<00:04:07.420> trying<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.049> burst<00:04:08.200> fire<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.590> kill

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
as well trying to burst fire to kill

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.500 
as well trying to burst fire to kill
people<00:04:08.980> at<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.099> distance<00:04:09.190> which<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.120> course<00:04:10.329> if

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
people at a distance which of course if

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.330 
people at a distance which of course if
you<00:04:10.599> are<00:04:10.720> using<00:04:10.750> LMGs<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> want<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.920> always<00:04:12.130> be

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
you are using LMGs you want to always be

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.940 
you are using LMGs you want to always be
prone<00:04:12.970> or<00:04:13.239> crouching<00:04:13.540> since<00:04:14.319> it<00:04:14.470> allows<00:04:14.739> you

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
prone or crouching since it allows you

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.560 
prone or crouching since it allows you
to<00:04:15.069> account<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.370> lesson<00:04:15.759> that<00:04:15.910> recoil

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
to account a lesson that recoil

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.479 
to account a lesson that recoil
now<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.169> being<00:04:17.350> said<00:04:17.440> which<00:04:18.100> one<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.310> these

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
now that being said which one of these

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.190 
now that being said which one of these
two<00:04:18.699> LMGs<00:04:19.299> do<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.509> guys<00:04:19.660> like

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
two LMGs do you guys like

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.080 
two LMGs do you guys like
you<00:04:20.650> maybe<00:04:20.830> just<00:04:21.130> feel<00:04:21.340> better<00:04:21.580> using<00:04:21.910> one

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
you maybe just feel better using one

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.400 
you maybe just feel better using one
over<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.390> other<00:04:22.420> maybe<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.110> think<00:04:23.260> that

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
over the other maybe you just think that

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.740 
over the other maybe you just think that
one<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.800> statistically<00:04:24.580> more<00:04:25.090> powerful<00:04:25.600> than

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
one is statistically more powerful than

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.270 
one is statistically more powerful than
the<00:04:25.840> other<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.050> leave<00:04:26.230> it<00:04:26.350> as<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.740> comment<00:04:27.010> down

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
going to be the m27 IAR now even though

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.130 
going to be the m27 IAR now even though
the<00:04:39.280> amela<00:04:39.580> does<00:04:39.850> do<00:04:39.970> more<00:04:40.180> damage<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:41.020> does
