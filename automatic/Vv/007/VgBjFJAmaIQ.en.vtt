00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
it's a good point here to show about

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.550 
it's a good point here to show about
good<00:04:14.300> layering<00:04:14.630> techniques<00:04:15.170> it's<00:04:15.350> just<00:04:15.470> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
good layering techniques it's just the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.960 
good layering techniques it's just the
name<00:04:15.710> each<00:04:15.890> one<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.610> be<00:04:16.640> left<00:04:17.510> arrow

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970

this<00:04:19.970> one<00:04:20.209> cool<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.680> one<00:04:21.920> can<00:04:22.130> be<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.370> right

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
this one cool this one can be the right

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.130 
this one cool this one can be the right
arrow<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:24.760> there<00:04:25.760> we<00:04:25.880> go<00:04:26.030> right<00:04:26.330> but<00:04:26.840> also<00:04:26.990> the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
arrow and there we go right but also the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.020 
arrow and there we go right but also the
video<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.680> shows<00:04:27.920> originally<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.460> bevel<00:04:28.940> effect

FX down here on the layer FX blending
options<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.960> we'll<00:04:36.410> choose<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.800> bevel<00:04:37.780> which

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780

as<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.260> see<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.560> starts<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:39.950> apply<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
as you can see it starts to apply it to

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.680 
as you can see it starts to apply it to

each change the depth change the size

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.650 
each change the depth change the size
and<00:04:44.690> will<00:04:44.810> soften<00:04:45.080> sorge's<00:04:45.560> are<00:04:45.710> just<00:04:46.630> what<00:04:47.630> I

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
onto the other one and there we go

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.440 
onto the other one and there we go
I'd<00:05:07.340> say<00:05:07.640> specific<00:05:08.420> remake<00:05:08.870> just<00:05:09.620> for<00:05:09.950> up

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
I'd say specific remake just for up
