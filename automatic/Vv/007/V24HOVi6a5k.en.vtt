exercises are okay your body is not that
clever<00:02:04.620> it's<00:02:05.010> extremely<00:02:05.280> clever<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
clever it's extremely clever in some

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
clever it's extremely clever in some
ways<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.720> clever<00:02:06.930> in<00:02:07.110> other<00:02:07.260> ways<00:02:07.440> it<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
ways but not clever in other ways it is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.009 
ways but not clever in other ways it is
not<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> very<00:02:08.280> good<00:02:08.340> counter<00:02:08.879> okay<00:02:09.659> it<00:02:09.780> can't

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
not a very good counter okay it can't

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.309 
not a very good counter okay it can't
count<00:02:10.319> reps<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.280> well<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> small

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
count reps all that well so small

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.530 
count reps all that well so small
differences<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.980> exercises<00:02:14.730> are<00:02:15.000> not

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
differences in exercises are not

the<00:02:29.760> second<00:02:30.150> point<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:31.680> most<00:02:31.980> important

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the second point is the most important

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.000 
the second point is the most important
thing<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.640> success<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.269> consistency<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.110> I

genetics<00:02:43.409> whatever<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.659> you<00:02:45.659> just<00:02:45.959> have

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
genetics whatever that is you just have

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.080 
genetics whatever that is you just have
to<00:02:46.230> show<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.859> every<00:02:47.310> day<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.700> do<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.060> work

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to show up every day and do the work

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.809 
to show up every day and do the work
like<00:02:48.780> Woody<00:02:48.989> Allen<00:02:49.290> says<00:02:49.500> eighty<00:02:50.400> percent<00:02:50.489> of

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
like Woody Allen says eighty percent of

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.970 
like Woody Allen says eighty percent of
success<00:02:51.150> is<00:02:51.329> just<00:02:51.359> showing<00:02:51.629> up<00:02:51.959> okay<00:02:52.560> so

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
success is just showing up okay so

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.490 
success is just showing up okay so
consistency<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.060> much<00:02:54.689> more<00:02:54.900> important<00:02:55.349> than

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
consistency is much more important than

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.710 
consistency is much more important than
anything<00:02:55.859> else<00:02:56.189> even<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.329> go<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.689> gym

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
anything else even if you go to the gym

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.039 
anything else even if you go to the gym
and<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.980> have<00:02:59.159> just<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.819> so-so<00:03:00.060> work<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.720> maybe

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and you have just a so-so work out maybe

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.300 
and you have just a so-so work out maybe
you<00:03:01.170> forgot<00:03:01.319> your<00:03:01.620> sheet<00:03:01.889> and<00:03:02.069> kind<00:03:02.220> of

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
you forgot your sheet and kind of

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.399 
you forgot your sheet and kind of
muddled<00:03:02.549> around<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:03.180> doesn't<00:03:03.480> matter<00:03:03.569> you're

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
muddled around it doesn't matter you're

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.520 
muddled around it doesn't matter you're
at<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> gym<00:03:04.650> okay<00:03:05.639> and<00:03:05.849> if<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.359> do<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.750> every

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
at the gym okay and if you do that every

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.759 
at the gym okay and if you do that every
day<00:03:08.450> for<00:03:09.450> six<00:03:09.659> months<00:03:10.049> you're<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.650> be

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
day for six months you're going to be

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.000 
day for six months you're going to be
pretty<00:03:10.920> far<00:03:11.220> along<00:03:11.340> okay<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.680> consistency<00:03:13.680> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
pretty far along okay so consistency is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.210 
pretty far along okay so consistency is
much<00:03:14.819> more<00:03:15.030> important<00:03:15.450> than<00:03:15.540> anything<00:03:15.750> else

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
much more important than anything else

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.470 
much more important than anything else
we're<00:03:17.220> not<00:03:17.370> looking<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.939> perfect<00:03:18.120> reps

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
we're not looking for the perfect reps

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.030 
we're not looking for the perfect reps
and<00:03:18.629> sets<00:03:18.810> that's<00:03:19.049> just<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.500> doesn't<00:03:19.650> occur

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and sets that's just that doesn't occur

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.319 
and sets that's just that doesn't occur
