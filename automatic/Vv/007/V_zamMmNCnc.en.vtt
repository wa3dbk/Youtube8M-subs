00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
in the front of the brow and in short

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.840 
in the front of the brow and in short
strokes<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.690> start<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.500> fill<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:21.040> I'm

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
strokes just start to fill it in I'm

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.600 
strokes just start to fill it in I'm
just<00:03:22.269> following<00:03:22.660> my<00:03:22.780> natural<00:03:22.840> shape<00:03:23.590> and<00:03:23.890> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
just following my natural shape and the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.729 
just following my natural shape and the
reason<00:03:24.940> why<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.180> easier<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.660> me<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.840> you

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
reason why it's easier for me to you

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.290 
reason why it's easier for me to you
know<00:03:26.830> fill<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.130> my<00:03:27.250> eyebrows<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:28.150> I

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
know fill in my eyebrows is because I

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.870 
know fill in my eyebrows is because I
already<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:28.870> full<00:03:29.230> eyebrows<00:03:29.650> now<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.700> might

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
already have full eyebrows now you might

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.550 
already have full eyebrows now you might
not<00:03:31.030> be<00:03:31.330> able<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.630> use<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.900> technique<00:03:32.380> if<00:03:32.530> you

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
not be able to use this technique if you

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.350 
not be able to use this technique if you
don't<00:03:32.860> have<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.100> lot<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.400> eyebrows<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:34.000> my<00:03:34.150> mom

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
don't have a lot of eyebrows like my mom

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.300 
don't have a lot of eyebrows like my mom
has<00:03:34.959> really<00:03:35.290> light<00:03:35.620> eyebrows<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.250> she

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
has really light eyebrows so she

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.390 
has really light eyebrows so she
couldn't<00:03:36.670> use<00:03:36.910> this<00:03:37.120> technique<00:03:38.010> because<00:03:39.010> it's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
couldn't use this technique because it's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.830 
couldn't use this technique because it's
really<00:03:39.670> hard<00:03:39.940> for<00:03:40.120> me<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.300> even<00:03:40.360> see<00:03:40.690> her

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
really hard for me to even see her

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.780 
really hard for me to even see her
eyebrows<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.410> know<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:42.430> she<00:03:42.610> doesn't

difference here I'll get a little bit

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.809

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
closer so you can see this is the

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.339 
closer so you can see this is the
brother<00:06:23.000> it's<00:06:23.240> not<00:06:23.300> filled<00:06:23.720> in<00:06:23.840> and<00:06:24.050> this<00:06:24.199> is

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
brother it's not filled in and this is

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.260 
brother it's not filled in and this is
abroad<00:06:24.560> that<00:06:24.710> is<00:06:24.770> filled<00:06:25.190> in<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.910> difference

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
abroad that is filled in the difference

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.570 
abroad that is filled in the difference
is<00:06:26.449> very<00:06:26.599> subtle<00:06:27.080> but<00:06:27.229> it<00:06:27.620> does<00:06:27.889> put<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.220> whole

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 
is very subtle but it does put the whole

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.270 
is very subtle but it does put the whole
look<00:06:28.849> together<00:06:29.000> but<00:06:29.780> you<00:06:29.900> can<00:06:29.930> see<00:06:30.349> it's<00:06:30.590> the

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
look together but you can see it's the

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.860 
look together but you can see it's the
difference<00:06:31.639> like<00:06:31.789> this<00:06:31.819> maybe<00:06:32.180> I<00:06:32.599> don't<00:06:32.780> know

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
difference like this maybe I don't know

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.600 
difference like this maybe I don't know
but<00:06:33.380> it<00:06:33.500> just<00:06:33.710> pulls<00:06:34.069> the<00:06:34.250> whole<00:06:34.400> look

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
but it just pulls the whole look

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.279 
but it just pulls the whole look
together<00:06:34.759> I<00:06:35.030> think<00:06:35.210> and<00:06:35.720> I<00:06:35.780> really<00:06:36.199> really

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289
