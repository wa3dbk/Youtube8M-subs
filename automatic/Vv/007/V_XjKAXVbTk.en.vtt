in<00:00:43.909> cricket<00:00:44.150> clubs<00:00:44.360> well<00:00:45.019> we<00:00:45.110> know<00:00:45.199> that

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
in cricket clubs well we know that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.200 
in cricket clubs well we know that
cricket<00:00:45.619> is<00:00:45.739> thought<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.100> as<00:00:46.280> an<00:00:46.519> all-day<00:00:46.879> game

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.160 
and I think the key thing about this
project<00:00:49.100> is<00:00:49.549> it's<00:00:49.760> very<00:00:49.820> very<00:00:50.330> short<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.900> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
should have programs like this has a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:16.340 
should have programs like this has a
benefit<00:03:59.220> for<00:03:59.400> everybody<00:04:15.019> what<00:04:16.019> we're<00:04:16.199> hoping

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
benefit for everybody what we're hoping

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.779 
benefit for everybody what we're hoping
to<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.919> achieve<00:04:17.010> through<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.549> process

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
to do and achieve through this process

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.090 
to do and achieve through this process
is<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.359> gain<00:04:18.510> sufficient<00:04:18.810> funds<00:04:19.410> through<00:04:19.889> the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
is to gain sufficient funds through the

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.159 
is to gain sufficient funds through the
appeal<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.060> enable<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.510> project<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.139> be

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
appeal to enable this project to be

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.680 
appeal to enable this project to be
carried<00:04:22.530> through<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.740> 2015<00:04:23.580> if<00:04:23.970> we<00:04:24.210> don't<00:04:24.389> have

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
carried through to 2015 if we don't have

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.750 
carried through to 2015 if we don't have
it<00:04:24.720> then<00:04:25.440> we're<00:04:25.710> going<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.860> miss<00:04:26.340> out<00:04:26.520> on<00:04:26.729> a

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
it then we're going to miss out on a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.719 
it then we're going to miss out on a
huge<00:04:27.210> potential<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:28.139> people<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.490> otherwise

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
huge potential of people that otherwise

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.610 
huge potential of people that otherwise
that<00:04:30.419> they've<00:04:30.570> been<00:04:30.720> lost<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.169> game<00:04:31.350> and

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
that they've been lost to the game and

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.670 
that they've been lost to the game and
we<00:04:32.520> hope<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.789> from<00:04:33.449> this<00:04:33.660> project<00:04:34.110> maybe<00:04:34.530> the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
we hope that from this project maybe the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.710 
we hope that from this project maybe the
future<00:04:35.039> stars<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.000> game<00:04:36.030> will<00:04:36.479> come

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
future stars of the game will come

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.080 
future stars of the game will come
through<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.320> project<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.729> which

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
through a project like this and which

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.450 
through a project like this and which
