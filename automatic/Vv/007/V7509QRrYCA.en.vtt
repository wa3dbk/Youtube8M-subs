got<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.109> wrist<00:00:28.410> thing<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.640> which<00:00:29.820> I

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
got your wrist thing here which I

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.299 
got your wrist thing here which I
wouldn't<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:30.660> was<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> good<00:00:31.309> I'll

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
wouldn't really think was that good I'll

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.610 
wouldn't really think was that good I'll
get<00:00:32.460> more<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.850> in<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.059> bit<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.110> straight

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
get more into that in a bit so straight

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.479 
get more into that in a bit so straight
off<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.770> bat<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.760> wired<00:00:37.219> which<00:00:38.219> means

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
off the bat is wired which means

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
off the bat is wired which means
obviously<00:00:39.450> you've<00:00:39.600> got<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> wires<00:00:40.079> there

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
obviously you've got the wires there

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.959 
obviously you've got the wires there
which<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.309> disadvantage

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
which are going to be a disadvantage

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299 
which are going to be a disadvantage
over<00:00:42.570> other<00:00:42.719> gaming<00:00:42.989> keyboards<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> proper

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
over other gaming keyboards so proper

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
over other gaming keyboards so proper
ones<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> are<00:00:44.820> wireless<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.780> get

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
ones that are wireless but then you get

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.420 
ones that are wireless but then you get
you<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> lag<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.309> with

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
you don't get the lag that you get with

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
you don't get the lag that you get with
wireless<00:00:47.820> keyboards<00:00:49.640> it<00:00:50.640> feels<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
wireless keyboards it feels just like a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
wireless keyboards it feels just like a
normal<00:00:52.110> keyboard<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.829> no<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.129> special

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
normal keyboard there's no my special

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
normal keyboard there's no my special
keys<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.199> listen<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:56.719> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
keys like so if you listen to this it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.860 
keys like so if you listen to this it's
just<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.140> normal<00:00:58.350> keyboard<00:00:59.059> but<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.210> cheap<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
just a normal keyboard but it's cheap so

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
just a normal keyboard but it's cheap so
you're<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.289> paying<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.250> extra

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you're not really paying for an extra

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.969 
you're not really paying for an extra
like<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> black<00:01:03.030> widow<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.539> anything<00:01:03.979> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like a black widow or anything the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.980 
like a black widow or anything the
lights<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.299> downside<00:01:06.540> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
lights are all right one downside is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
lights are all right one downside is
space<00:01:07.860> borrowed<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.310> lights<00:01:08.460> up<00:01:08.670> half<00:01:08.850> way

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
space borrowed your lights up half way

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
space borrowed your lights up half way
than<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:11.189> like

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

week<00:02:37.980> maybe<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.790> it's<00:02:39.270> just<00:02:39.330> really

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
week maybe because it's just really

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.670 
week maybe because it's just really
so<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.760> prefer<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.270> use<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.570> raised<00:02:42.959> want<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.410> gel

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
so I prefer to use a raised want a gel

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.220 
so I prefer to use a raised want a gel
one<00:02:43.860> which<00:02:44.580> actually<00:02:44.790> actually<00:02:45.450> does<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.989> job

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
one which actually actually does the job

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.140 
one which actually actually does the job
not<00:02:46.830> one<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:47.880> it's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
not one that's like that because it's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.510 
not one that's like that because it's
just<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.480> same<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:48.780> night<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.050> what<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.830> isn't

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
it just makes a bit more comfortable but

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.560 
it just makes a bit more comfortable but
