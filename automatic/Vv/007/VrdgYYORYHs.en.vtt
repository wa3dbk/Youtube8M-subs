of the flash head itself and that's what

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.360 
of the flash head itself and that's what
softens<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.170> shadows<00:01:35.530> so<00:01:35.740> whether<00:01:36.220> you're

bounce off I'm going to take advantage

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.330 
bounce off I'm going to take advantage
of<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.690> opportunity<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.560> open<00:01:45.070> up<00:01:45.159> the

doors like this and what that allows is
about<00:01:47.799> 80<00:01:48.040> percent<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.580> light<00:01:48.729> to<00:01:48.850> go

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
about 80 percent of the light to go

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.550 
about 80 percent of the light to go
through<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.390> bounce<00:01:49.600> off<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.020> ceiling<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
through to bounce off the ceiling and

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.890 
through to bounce off the ceiling and
and<00:01:51.549> twenty<00:01:52.090> percent<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.570> light<00:01:52.750> to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
and twenty percent of the light to

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.719 
and twenty percent of the light to
bounce<00:01:53.049> back<00:01:53.380> into<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.710> subject<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.549> this

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
bounce back into the subject so this

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.370 
bounce back into the subject so this
situation<00:01:55.270> allows<00:01:55.450> you<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.720> go<00:01:55.810> from<00:01:55.930> ceiling

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
situation allows you to go from ceiling

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.109 
situation allows you to go from ceiling
bounce<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.979> ceiling<00:01:57.310> bounce<00:01:57.520> from

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
bounce to the ceiling bounce from

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.000 
bounce to the ceiling bounce from
horizontal<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.900> vertical<00:01:59.110> without<00:01:59.860> ever

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
horizontal to vertical without ever

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.219

taking<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.369> round<00:02:00.549> off<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.880> subject<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.930> in

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
taking the round off the subject so in

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.080 
taking the round off the subject so in
this<00:02:02.470> setup<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:02.979> this<00:02:03.040> if<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.580> camera<00:02:03.909> was

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
this setup like this if the camera was

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.050 
this setup like this if the camera was
set<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.299> daylight<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.909> available<00:02:06.909> light

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
set on daylight and the available light

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.999 
set on daylight and the available light
was<00:02:07.270> daylight<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.200> flash<00:02:08.439> is<00:02:08.649> balanced

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
was daylight and the flash is balanced

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.350 
was daylight and the flash is balanced
for<00:02:09.129> daylight<00:02:09.159> you're<00:02:09.879> good<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.179> go

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
for daylight you're good to go

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.449 
for daylight you're good to go
because<00:02:10.689> you're<00:02:10.840> filling<00:02:11.319> the<00:02:11.500> subject<00:02:12.340> and

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
because you're filling the subject and

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.699 
because you're filling the subject and
the<00:02:13.120> available<00:02:13.540> light<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:14.110> daylight

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
the available light with daylight

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.589 
the available light with daylight
balanced<00:02:15.069> light<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.849> what<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.269> were<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.510> a

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
balanced light but what if you were in a

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.660 
balanced light but what if you were in a
situation<00:02:16.919> where<00:02:17.919> the<00:02:18.040> lighting

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
situation where the lighting

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.790 
situation where the lighting
the<00:02:18.730> light<00:02:18.940> was<00:02:19.150> tunston<00:02:19.630> or<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.440> available

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the light was tunston or the available

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.830 
the light was tunston or the available
light<00:02:20.920> was<00:02:21.160> fluorescent<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.390> problem

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
light was fluorescent then the problem

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.570 
light was fluorescent then the problem
you'd<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.860> flash<00:02:24.099> is<00:02:24.130> set<00:02:24.459> up

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
you'd have is that the flash is set up

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.550 
you'd have is that the flash is set up
for<00:02:24.730> daylight<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.480> cameras<00:02:25.870> on<00:02:25.989> daylight<00:02:26.349> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
for daylight the cameras on daylight and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.740 
for daylight the cameras on daylight and
yet<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.860> available<00:02:27.400> light<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:28.150> say<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
yet the available light is say in the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
yet the available light is say in the
tungsten<00:02:28.989> or<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.770> fluorescent<00:02:30.370> case<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.760> green

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
tungsten or the fluorescent case a green

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.850 
tungsten or the fluorescent case a green
so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> got<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> little<00:02:32.140> bit<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.349> problem<00:02:32.590> so

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
so you got a little bit of a problem so

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.620 
so you got a little bit of a problem so
what<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.099> want<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.340> do<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.610> convert<00:02:34.120> your

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
convert your flash to tungsten so you

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.140 
convert your flash to tungsten so you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
with a green gel in it I would remove

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.580 
with a green gel in it I would remove
the<00:03:18.430> quick<00:03:18.640> bounce<00:03:22.890> and<00:03:23.940> install<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:26.049> F<00:03:26.140> extra
