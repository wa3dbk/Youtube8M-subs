00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
a dream and you have an idea just go for

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.360 
a dream and you have an idea just go for
it<00:03:41.840> because<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.650> end<00:03:42.860> you're<00:03:43.100> kind<00:03:43.280> of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
it because the end you're kind of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.590 
it because the end you're kind of
holding<00:03:43.580> yourself<00:03:43.700> back<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.420> that's

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
holding yourself back and that's

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600
