hi<00:00:00.900> I'm<00:00:01.140> Patrick<00:00:01.469> and<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:02.580> the<00:00:03.830> pickaxe

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
hi I'm Patrick and this is the pickaxe

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.460 
hi I'm Patrick and this is the pickaxe
computer<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.460> made<00:00:05.850> and<00:00:06.330> runs<00:00:06.839> an<00:00:07.080> operating

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
computer I made and runs an operating

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.240 
computer I made and runs an operating
system<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.919> program<00:00:08.370> plos<00:00:09.210> when<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.349> stands<00:00:11.190> for

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
system I program plos when it stands for

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.580 
system I program plos when it stands for
patroclus<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.179> operating<00:00:12.630> systems<00:00:13.049> as<00:00:13.410> you

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
patroclus or operating systems as you

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.820 
patroclus or operating systems as you
can<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.130> battery's<00:00:14.519> low<00:00:15.199> anyway<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.710> has

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
can see the battery's low anyway it has

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.760 
can see the battery's low anyway it has
a<00:00:16.859> text<00:00:17.369> editor<00:00:17.990> where<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.020> know<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> can

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
a text editor where you know you can

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.210 
a text editor where you know you can
type<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.250> then<00:00:21.060> save<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.680> case<00:00:22.949> as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
type and then save it in this case as

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.740 
type and then save it in this case as
YouTube<00:00:24.410> dot<00:00:25.670> txt<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.640> saves<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> an<00:00:30.359> SD

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
YouTube dot txt and it saves it to an SD

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.600 
YouTube dot txt and it saves it to an SD
card<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:32.369> anyway<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.059> also<00:00:33.239> has<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
card and then anyway it also has a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.000 
card and then anyway it also has a
calculator<00:00:35.610> where<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.690> math<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:38.629> 567

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
calculator where it can do math like 567

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.670 
calculator where it can do math like 567
divided<00:00:41.010> by<00:00:41.190> 5<00:00:42.290> which<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.730> 113<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.570> also<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
divided by 5 which is 113 it also has a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.979 
divided by 5 which is 113 it also has a
timer<00:00:47.219> where<00:00:47.700> say<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:48.450> set<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> count

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
timer where say you can set it to count

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.619 
timer where say you can set it to count
for<00:00:49.200> 5<00:00:49.469> seconds<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.449> count

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
for 5 seconds and then it will count

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.689 
for 5 seconds and then it will count
down<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> background

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
down it can do that in the background

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
down it can do that in the background
even<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.329> applications<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.289> running

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
even if other applications are running

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
even if other applications are running
and<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.789> sure<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.270> hear<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
and I'm not sure if you can hear it but

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.470 
and I'm not sure if you can hear it but
it's<00:00:57.719> sounding<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.500> alarm<00:00:58.590> sound<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.579> so

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it's sounding an alarm sound now so

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
it's sounding an alarm sound now so
anyway<00:01:00.750> let's<00:01:01.379> see<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.909> battery's

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
anyway let's see so now the battery's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.960 
anyway let's see so now the battery's
dead<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> give<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.400> inside

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
dead so I'm going to give you an inside

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:19.730 
dead so I'm going to give you an inside
look<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:18.380> inside<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
look and now you can see inside it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.450 
look and now you can see inside it
there's<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> CPU<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
there's this is the CPU which is a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.230 
there's this is the CPU which is a
pickaxe<00:01:23.970> 28<00:01:24.720> X<00:01:24.990> 2<00:01:25.290> microcontroller<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:27.030> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
pickaxe 28 X 2 microcontroller this is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.830 
pickaxe 28 X 2 microcontroller this is
the<00:01:27.680> keyboard<00:01:28.909> monitoring<00:01:29.909> 1<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> also

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the keyboard monitoring 1 which is also

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.249 
the keyboard monitoring 1 which is also
a<00:01:31.110> 28<00:01:31.650> X<00:01:31.860> 2<00:01:32.100> microcontroller<00:01:32.850> both<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.930> which<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
a 28 X 2 microcontroller both of which I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.740 
a 28 X 2 microcontroller both of which I
programmed<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> SD<00:01:36.509> card

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
programmed and then this is the SD card

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
programmed and then this is the SD card
reader<00:01:36.900> originally<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> had<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.100> cable<00:01:38.369> going

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
reader originally I had a cable going

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.350 
reader originally I had a cable going
outside<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.960> case<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
outside the case so you could and so you

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.649 
outside the case so you could and so you
could<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.280> could<00:01:44.520> access<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> SD<00:01:45.420> card

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
could so you could access the SD card

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.560 
could so you could access the SD card
from<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> outside<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.880> broke<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
from the outside but then that broke so

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.230 
from the outside but then that broke so
now<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.049> inside<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.040> here's<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
now I'm just inside it and here's the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.139 
now I'm just inside it and here's the
power<00:01:51.420> supply<00:01:51.869> three<00:01:52.350> double<00:01:52.770> A<00:01:52.860> batteries

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
power supply three double A batteries

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.030 
power supply three double A batteries
one<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.689> dead<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.500> swapping

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
one of which is dead so I'm swapping

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.460 
one of which is dead so I'm swapping
that<00:01:56.219> out

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.040 

and<00:01:59.710> then<00:02:00.070> over<00:02:01.030> here<00:02:01.060> yeah<00:02:01.800> Ethernet<00:02:04.050> that's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and then over here yeah Ethernet that's

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.290 
and then over here yeah Ethernet that's
not<00:02:05.260> Ethernet<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:06.340> just<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.640> get<00:02:06.790> eight<00:02:07.000> wires

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
not Ethernet but just to get eight wires

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.410 
not Ethernet but just to get eight wires
to<00:02:08.080> up<00:02:08.260> here<00:02:08.560> where<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.010> have<00:02:09.400> speakers<00:02:10.060> and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
to up here where I have speakers and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.550 
to up here where I have speakers and
then<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.230> display<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:12.040> serial<00:02:12.670> 20<00:02:13.090> by<00:02:13.240> 4<00:02:13.510> o<00:02:13.750> LED

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
then the display a serial 20 by 4 o LED

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.840 
then the display a serial 20 by 4 o LED
display<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:16.320> see<00:02:17.320> battery<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.860> now<00:02:18.070> good<00:02:18.430> and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
display and see battery is now good and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.750 
display and see battery is now good and
then<00:02:19.390> anyway<00:02:20.020> these<00:02:20.740> are<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.070> programming

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
then anyway these are the programming

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.740 
then anyway these are the programming
cables<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.830> this<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
cables and then this is the this is the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.840 
cables and then this is the this is the
cable<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:29.170> goes<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.950> keyboard<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.730> a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
cable that goes to the keyboard it's a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.960 
cable that goes to the keyboard it's a
ps/2<00:02:31.480> connector<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.650> now<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> have<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.670> put<00:02:33.850> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
ps/2 connector and now I have to put it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:47.820 
ps/2 connector and now I have to put it
back<00:02:34.120> together<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.260> I've<00:02:47.350> replaced<00:02:47.710> the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
back together now that I've replaced the

programmed with a headphone cable but

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.490 
programmed with a headphone cable but
you<00:04:19.390> can<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:20.010> here<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.940> has<00:04:22.500> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
you can see here that it has the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.370 
you can see here that it has the
headphone<00:04:23.979> extension<00:04:24.729> thing<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.990> allows

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
headphone extension thing that allows

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.990 
headphone extension thing that allows
you<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.680> do<00:04:27.610> that<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.300> yeah<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.229> then<00:04:29.789> anyway

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
you to do that and yeah and then anyway

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.480 
you to do that and yeah and then anyway
it<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.350> keyboard<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.830> program<00:04:33.250> through

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
notice multiple wires of that so then I

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.930 
notice multiple wires of that so then I
