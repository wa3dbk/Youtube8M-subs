00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:02.930 
the newer people but I honestly don't
know<00:03:01.230> much<00:03:01.470> about<00:03:01.500> el<00:03:01.799> m<00:03:01.920> ck<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.579> a<00:03:02.670> lot<00:03:02.849> of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
know much about el m ck just a lot of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.280 
know much about el m ck just a lot of
the<00:03:03.030> people<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.480> played<00:03:03.750> with<00:03:03.900> him<00:03:04.019> pink

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the people that are played with him pink

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.390 
the people that are played with him pink
are<00:03:04.560> nosy<00:03:05.280> day<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.500> that's<00:03:07.500> them<00:03:07.859> and<00:03:08.190> they're

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
are nosy day so that's them and they're

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.360 
are nosy day so that's them and they're
pretty<00:03:08.670> much<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.269> think<00:03:09.510> LM<00:03:10.440> ck<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.889> basically

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
pretty much I think LM ck is basically

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.610 
pretty much I think LM ck is basically
the<00:03:11.489> top<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:12.120> incline<00:03:12.870> killers<00:03:13.260> right<00:03:13.440> now

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the top of incline killers right now

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.259 
the top of incline killers right now
because<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.950> lot<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.220> people<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.579> first<00:03:14.849> roster

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
because a lot of people on first roster

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.839 
because a lot of people on first roster
enacted<00:03:15.810> because<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.230> was<00:03:16.349> a<00:03:16.380> while<00:03:16.650> ago

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
enacted because that was a while ago

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.610 
enacted because that was a while ago
elite<00:03:17.849> stopped<00:03:18.120> working<00:03:18.540> very<00:03:19.049> very<00:03:19.169> long

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
elite stopped working very very long

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.480 
elite stopped working very very long
time<00:03:19.859> ago

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
time ago

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.190 
time ago
that's<00:03:21.490> one<00:03:21.760> thing<00:03:21.790> about<00:03:22.000> second<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.960> then

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
that's one thing about second and then

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.130 
that's one thing about second and then
there's<00:03:23.380> third<00:03:23.590> roster<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.370> I<00:03:24.970> honestly<00:03:25.330> I'm

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
because like we'll beat them maybe three

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.579 
because like we'll beat them maybe three
or<00:05:01.610> four<00:05:01.909> times<00:05:02.149> and<00:05:02.629> then<00:05:02.990> they'll<00:05:03.229> just<00:05:03.379> post
