00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
recommendation is to choose the ones

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.359 
recommendation is to choose the ones
with<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:34.990> heart-healthy<00:01:35.649> fats<00:01:35.890> like<00:01:36.189> the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
with the heart-healthy fats like the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.690 
with the heart-healthy fats like the
olive<00:01:36.700> oil<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.090> canola<00:01:37.329> oil<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.280> then<00:01:39.579> of

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
course limit the amount because of the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.420 
course limit the amount because of the
calories<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.670> there<00:01:43.390> but<00:01:44.350> you're<00:01:45.189> right<00:01:45.369> that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430

if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:11.890> Italian<00:02:12.490> then<00:02:12.670> go<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.060> and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
if you like Italian then go for that and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.170 
if you like Italian then go for that and
access<00:02:14.360> me<00:02:14.800> Asian<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:16.100> think<00:02:16.310> any<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.610> those<00:02:16.940> are

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
access me Asian I think any of those are

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.040 
access me Asian I think any of those are
fine<00:02:18.160> but<00:02:19.160> turn<00:02:19.670> over<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.150> ingredients<00:02:20.810> label

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
fine but turn over the ingredients label

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.560 
fine but turn over the ingredients label
and<00:02:21.350> look<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.860> it<00:02:22.160> mostly<00:02:22.580> olive<00:02:23.000> oil<00:02:23.180> canola

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
and look is it mostly olive oil canola

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.650 
and look is it mostly olive oil canola
oil<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.140> definitely<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:25.190> choice<00:02:25.660> because

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
oil that's definitely my choice because

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.590 
oil that's definitely my choice because
people<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:27.770> diabetes<00:02:28.100> are<00:02:28.490> very<00:02:29.060> high<00:02:29.300> risk

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
people with diabetes are very high risk

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.320 
people with diabetes are very high risk
for<00:02:29.870> heart<00:02:30.380> disease<00:02:30.440> as<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:31.340> all<00:02:31.640> Americans

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
for heart disease as are all Americans

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.230 
for heart disease as are all Americans
so<00:02:33.080> when<00:02:33.470> you're<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.160> fat<00:02:34.430> go<00:02:35.000> for

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
so when you're going for the fat go for

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.080 
so when you're going for the fat go for
those<00:02:35.390> heart<00:02:35.960> healthy<00:02:36.380> ones<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.980> then<00:02:37.700> would

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
those heart healthy ones and then would

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.660 
those heart healthy ones and then would
start<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.480> think<00:02:38.510> about<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> quantity<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.640> I

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
start to think about the quantity so I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.190 
start to think about the quantity so I
wouldn't<00:02:41.150> use<00:02:41.240> more<00:02:41.690> than<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> couple

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
wouldn't use more than a couple

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.450 
wouldn't use more than a couple
tablespoons<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:43.150> salad<00:02:44.150> dressing<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.800> in

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
tablespoons of salad dressing and in

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.610 
tablespoons of salad dressing and in
fact<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.590> like<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.650> dip<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.790> stab<00:02:50.360> method<00:02:50.960> that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
fact I like the dip and stab method that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.250 
fact I like the dip and stab method that
I<00:02:51.650> learned<00:02:52.070> actually<00:02:52.250> from<00:02:52.610> patients<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.900> I

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
I learned actually from patients so I

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.260 
I learned actually from patients so I
would<00:02:54.560> measure<00:02:54.770> out<00:02:55.040> two<00:02:55.250> tablespoons<00:02:55.910> this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
would measure out two tablespoons this

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.760 
would measure out two tablespoons this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
is the recommendation for stretch

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.500 
is the recommendation for stretch
measure<00:02:58.010> out<00:02:58.250> two<00:02:58.460> tablespoons<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:59.150> salad

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
measure out two tablespoons of salad

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.830 
measure out two tablespoons of salad
dressing<00:02:59.540> and<00:03:00.050> then<00:03:00.500> dip<00:03:01.130> your<00:03:01.340> salad<00:03:01.820> tongs

did the did it the other way around the
different<00:03:26.750> stab<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.430> here's<00:03:29.030> one<00:03:29.360> more<00:03:29.510> thing

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
different stab so here's one more thing

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.080 
different stab so here's one more thing
many<00:03:30.080> people<00:03:30.170> try<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:31.520> know<00:03:31.640> in<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
many people try to you know in the

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.150 
many people try to you know in the
literature<00:03:32.540> says<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.870> vinegar<00:03:33.590> is<00:03:33.739> also

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
literature says that vinegar is also

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.449 
literature says that vinegar is also
good<00:03:34.340> for<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.820> diabetic<00:03:35.239> so<00:03:35.900> what<00:03:36.260> about<00:03:36.500> any

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
good for a diabetic so what about any

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.370 
good for a diabetic so what about any
salad<00:03:37.910> dressings<00:03:38.300> that<00:03:38.690> contains<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.230> good

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
salad dressings that contains a good

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.920 
salad dressings that contains a good
amount<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.770> vinegar<00:03:40.660> yes

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
amount of vinegar yes

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.210 
amount of vinegar yes
that<00:03:42.110> is<00:03:42.290> actually<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> very<00:03:42.680> good<00:03:42.980> point

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
that is actually a very good point

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.420 
that is actually a very good point
vinegar<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.860> thought<00:03:45.860> to<00:03:45.890> slow<00:03:46.280> down

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
vinegar is thought to slow down

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.259 
vinegar is thought to slow down
digestion<00:03:46.940> which<00:03:47.690> will<00:03:48.080> help<00:03:48.620> slow<00:03:49.070> down

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
digestion which will help slow down

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.060 
digestion which will help slow down
glucose<00:03:50.269> into<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.780> blood<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.650> some<00:03:51.890> people

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
glucose into the blood so some people

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.330 
glucose into the blood so some people
will<00:03:52.430> find<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.840> glycemic<00:03:54.260> index<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:55.280> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
will find that the glycemic index or the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.240 
will find that the glycemic index or the
glycemic<00:03:55.910> load<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.600> their<00:03:56.840> meal<00:03:57.140> goes<00:03:57.860> down

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
glycemic load of their meal goes down

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.479 
glycemic load of their meal goes down
when<00:03:58.790> they<00:03:58.940> add<00:03:59.120> vinegar<00:03:59.450> so<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:01.010> that's<00:04:01.280> with

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
when they add vinegar so and that's with

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.670 
when they add vinegar so and that's with
other<00:04:01.700> acids<00:04:02.180> as<00:04:02.330> well<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:02.810> even<00:04:02.840> lemon<00:04:03.470> juice

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
other acids as well so even lemon juice

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.710 
other acids as well so even lemon juice
I<00:04:03.950> like<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.760> make<00:04:04.910> my<00:04:05.060> own<00:04:05.209> salad<00:04:05.570> dressing

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
I like to make my own salad dressing

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.670 
I like to make my own salad dressing
because<00:04:06.620> it's<00:04:07.400> usually<00:04:07.790> healthier<00:04:08.780> fresher

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
because it's usually healthier fresher

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.350 
because it's usually healthier fresher
and<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.550> is<00:04:10.730> incredibly<00:04:11.720> easy<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.640> start

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
and it is incredibly easy so I I start

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.110 
and it is incredibly easy so I I start
with<00:04:15.070> olive<00:04:16.070> oil<00:04:16.220> generally<00:04:16.880> and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
and then I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.790 
and then I
pick<00:04:20.940> my<00:04:21.090> acid<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.110> would<00:04:22.230> either<00:04:22.350> be<00:04:22.500> lemon

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
pick my acid so it would either be lemon

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.120 
pick my acid so it would either be lemon
juice<00:04:23.190> or<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:24.450> really<00:04:24.870> good<00:04:25.140> quality<00:04:25.380> vinegar

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
juice or a really good quality vinegar

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.910 
juice or a really good quality vinegar
it<00:04:26.430> wouldn't<00:04:26.730> skimp<00:04:27.150> on<00:04:27.330> ingredients<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:28.650> think

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
it wouldn't skimp on ingredients I think

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.380 
it wouldn't skimp on ingredients I think
the<00:04:29.040> better<00:04:29.220> ingredients<00:04:29.940> make<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> better

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
the better ingredients make a better

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.380 
the better ingredients make a better
salad<00:04:31.200> dressing<00:04:31.590> so<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.340> could<00:04:32.640> start<00:04:32.970> with<00:04:33.090> a

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390

glycemic load of this whole salad is it
true<00:05:36.830> well<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:37.860> would<00:05:38.220> think<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.550> anytime<00:05:38.820> you

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
true well I would think that anytime you

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.570 
true well I would think that anytime you
add<00:05:39.330> something<00:05:39.750> you're<00:05:40.650> changing<00:05:41.310> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
add something you're changing the

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.120 
add something you're changing the
glycemic<00:05:42.180> load<00:05:42.540> any<00:05:42.900> anything<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:43.710> going<00:05:43.980> to

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
glycemic load any anything is going to

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.880 
glycemic load any anything is going to
change<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.550> glycemic<00:05:45.090> load<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.560> people

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
change the glycemic load and so people

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.000 
change the glycemic load and so people
add<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.210> stuff<00:05:48.450> and<00:05:48.690> they<00:05:48.840> think<00:05:49.050> is<00:05:49.230> like<00:05:49.770> I'm

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
add the stuff and they think is like I'm

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.090 
add the stuff and they think is like I'm
eating<00:05:50.190> everything<00:05:51.180> good<00:05:51.420> but<00:05:51.750> why<00:05:51.960> still<00:05:52.500> you

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
eating everything good but why still you

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.220 
eating everything good but why still you
know<00:05:53.220> it<00:05:53.730> doesn't<00:05:53.940> show<00:05:54.300> the<00:05:54.570> correct<00:05:54.780> results

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
know it doesn't show the correct results

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.430 
know it doesn't show the correct results
on<00:05:55.350> my<00:05:55.380> blood<00:05:55.710> sugar<00:05:56.040> so<00:05:56.450> well<00:05:57.450> look<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.200> see

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
on my blood sugar so well look to see

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.110 
on my blood sugar so well look to see
how<00:05:58.680> much<00:05:58.860> sugar<00:05:59.160> is<00:05:59.400> in<00:05:59.430> the<00:05:59.700> salad<00:06:00.060> dressing

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
how much sugar is in the salad dressing

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.360 
how much sugar is in the salad dressing
some<00:06:00.600> of<00:06:00.720> them<00:06:00.870> will<00:06:01.020> have<00:06:01.200> sugars<00:06:02.010> in<00:06:02.160> them

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
some of them will have sugars in them

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.610 
some of them will have sugars in them
some<00:06:03.060> will<00:06:03.210> have<00:06:03.390> high<00:06:03.780> fructose<00:06:03.990> corn<00:06:04.320> syrup

some will have high fructose corn syrup

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.550 
some will have high fructose corn syrup
and<00:06:05.070> some<00:06:05.490> have<00:06:05.670> honey<00:06:06.000> in<00:06:06.240> them<00:06:06.530> you<00:06:07.530> know

and some have honey in them you know
various<00:06:08.220> things<00:06:08.550> so<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.330> would<00:06:09.900> look<00:06:10.020> at<00:06:10.230> that

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
various things so I would look at that

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.290 
various things so I would look at that
and<00:06:10.800> Commission<00:06:11.400> you<00:06:11.490> count<00:06:11.760> that<00:06:11.940> as<00:06:12.030> part<00:06:12.240> of

actually<00:06:17.880> lower<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.360> blood<00:06:18.570> glucose<00:06:19.410> as<00:06:19.650> we

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
actually lower the blood glucose as we

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.040 
actually lower the blood glucose as we
said<00:06:20.160> because<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.640> the<00:06:20.760> vinegar<00:06:21.270> or<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.570> acids

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
said because of the vinegar or the acids

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.320 
said because of the vinegar or the acids
sometimes<00:06:22.620> does<00:06:22.920> that<00:06:23.190> a<00:06:23.430> lot<00:06:23.910> of<00:06:23.940> this<00:06:24.180> is

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
sometimes does that a lot of this is

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.540 
sometimes does that a lot of this is
trial<00:06:24.720> and<00:06:24.930> error<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:25.410> know<00:06:25.830> you<00:06:25.980> need<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.220> try

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
trial and error you know you need to try

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.700 
trial and error you know you need to try
it<00:06:26.610> out<00:06:26.820> and<00:06:26.970> see<00:06:27.270> how<00:06:27.960> it<00:06:28.200> works

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
it out and see how it works

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.879 
it out and see how it works
and<00:06:28.800> that's<00:06:29.010> hard<00:06:29.280> to<00:06:29.340> do<00:06:29.640> because

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
and that's hard to do because

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.800 
and that's hard to do because
you<00:06:31.099> have<00:06:31.249> to<00:06:31.370> do<00:06:31.490> it<00:06:31.550> more<00:06:31.699> than<00:06:31.759> once<00:06:31.909> to<00:06:32.629> get

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
you have to do it more than once to get

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.290 
you have to do it more than once to get
a<00:06:33.050> picture<00:06:33.379> of<00:06:33.650> what's<00:06:33.860> going<00:06:33.979> on<00:06:34.400> and<00:06:34.999> so<00:06:35.150> if

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
a picture of what's going on and so if

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.790 
a picture of what's going on and so if
you<00:06:35.449> want<00:06:35.689> to<00:06:35.780> know<00:06:35.930> how<00:06:36.169> a<00:06:36.199> certain<00:06:36.289> meal

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
you want to know how a certain meal

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.739 
you want to know how a certain meal
affects<00:06:37.189> equal<00:06:37.699> quantity<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.330> try<00:06:38.539> it<00:06:38.599> at

00:06:38.739 --> 00:06:38.749 
affects equal quantity to try it at

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.550 
affects equal quantity to try it at
least<00:06:39.080> twice<00:06:39.439> to<00:06:39.830> see<00:06:41.349> because<00:06:42.349> there's<00:06:42.499> just

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
least twice to see because there's just

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.399 
least twice to see because there's just
too<00:06:42.710> many<00:06:42.949> variabilities<00:06:43.909> but<00:06:44.509> specifically

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
too many variabilities but specifically

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.820 
too many variabilities but specifically
in<00:06:45.770> regard<00:06:46.129> to<00:06:46.219> salad<00:06:46.849> dressing<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:48.560> things

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
in regard to salad dressing the things

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.640 
in regard to salad dressing the things
that<00:06:49.009> I<00:06:49.039> would<00:06:49.159> look<00:06:49.430> at<00:06:50.139> try<00:06:51.139> to<00:06:51.199> limit<00:06:51.439> it<00:06:51.620> to

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
that I would look at try to limit it to

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.439 
that I would look at try to limit it to
about<00:06:51.740> two<00:06:52.069> tablespoons<00:06:52.490> look<00:06:53.240> at<00:06:53.360> the

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 
about two tablespoons look at the

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:54.820 
about two tablespoons look at the
calories<00:06:53.930> because<00:06:54.080> that<00:06:54.319> affects<00:06:54.650> your

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
calories because that affects your

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.610 
calories because that affects your
weight<00:06:55.039> for<00:06:55.310> most<00:06:55.460> look<00:06:56.360> at<00:06:56.479> the<00:06:56.689> type<00:06:57.199> of<00:06:57.229> fat

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
weight for most look at the type of fat

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.110 
weight for most look at the type of fat
in<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:57.949> because<00:06:58.249> that's<00:06:58.430> important<00:06:58.939> for<00:06:59.060> your

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
in it because that's important for your

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.769 
in it because that's important for your
heart<00:06:59.330> health

00:06:59.769 --> 00:06:59.779 
heart health

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:03.339 
heart health
so<00:07:00.020> again<00:07:00.710> olive<00:07:01.099> oil<00:07:01.279> canola<00:07:01.699> oil<00:07:02.120> other<00:07:02.930> oils

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:03.349 
so again olive oil canola oil other oils

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:05.050 
so again olive oil canola oil other oils
are<00:07:03.469> fine<00:07:03.680> too<00:07:03.949> but<00:07:04.189> those<00:07:04.400> are<00:07:04.550> my<00:07:04.639> first<00:07:04.939> two

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
are fine too but those are my first two

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.899 
are fine too but those are my first two
choices<00:07:05.360> I<00:07:05.750> think<00:07:05.779> sesame<00:07:06.500> oil<00:07:06.680> is<00:07:06.949> fine<00:07:07.610> now

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909 
choices I think sesame oil is fine now

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.480 
choices I think sesame oil is fine now
then<00:07:08.240> and<00:07:08.569> soybean<00:07:09.319> oil<00:07:09.590> as<00:07:09.919> fine<00:07:10.250> as<00:07:10.520> as<00:07:10.819> well

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
then and soybean oil as fine as as well

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.249 
then and soybean oil as fine as as well
look<00:07:13.490> at<00:07:13.729> how<00:07:14.029> much<00:07:14.180> carbohydrate<00:07:14.539> is<00:07:15.050> in

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:15.259 
look at how much carbohydrate is in

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.200 
look at how much carbohydrate is in
there<00:07:15.500> because<00:07:15.710> that<00:07:15.860> has<00:07:16.159> a<00:07:16.189> direct<00:07:16.789> effect

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
there because that has a direct effect

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.719 
there because that has a direct effect
on<00:07:17.569> your<00:07:18.110> blood<00:07:18.319> glucose<00:07:18.770> and<00:07:19.099> then<00:07:19.580> the

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 
on your blood glucose and then the

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:21.879 
on your blood glucose and then the
amount<00:07:19.879> of<00:07:20.029> sodium<00:07:20.270> some<00:07:21.259> of<00:07:21.409> them<00:07:21.560> are<00:07:21.740> going

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:21.889 
amount of sodium some of them are going

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:26.140 
amount of sodium some of them are going
to<00:07:22.009> be<00:07:22.539> just<00:07:23.539> crazy<00:07:23.990> high<00:07:24.439> in<00:07:24.800> sodium<00:07:25.219> you<00:07:26.029> know

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.150 
to be just crazy high in sodium you know

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.119 
to be just crazy high in sodium you know
not<00:07:26.360> just<00:07:26.389> a<00:07:26.750> couple<00:07:26.960> hundred<00:07:27.259> milligrams<00:07:27.919> but

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:28.129 
not just a couple hundred milligrams but

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.959 
not just a couple hundred milligrams but
several<00:07:28.520> hundred<00:07:28.819> milligrams<00:07:29.509> and<00:07:30.969> that

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:31.969 
several hundred milligrams and that

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.350 
several hundred milligrams and that
needs<00:07:32.210> to<00:07:32.419> be<00:07:32.449> taken<00:07:33.139> into<00:07:33.259> consideration<00:07:33.409> too

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
needs to be taken into consideration too

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.240 
needs to be taken into consideration too
that's<00:07:35.360> why<00:07:35.569> I<00:07:35.599> really<00:07:35.990> just<00:07:36.199> prefer<00:07:36.349> make<00:07:37.039> my

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.250 
that's why I really just prefer make my

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.179 
that's why I really just prefer make my
