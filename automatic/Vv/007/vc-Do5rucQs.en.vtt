now the aphids will kill this plant in

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.710 
now the aphids will kill this plant in
about<00:01:16.799> ten<00:01:17.189> days<00:01:17.220> if<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.970> don't<00:01:18.210> take<00:01:18.390> care<00:01:18.450> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
about ten days if we don't take care of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.899 
about ten days if we don't take care of
it<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.140> now<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:20.070> showing<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.820> little

that's at shiny haze that you see on the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.649 
that's at shiny haze that you see on the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like little white specks on the leaves

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
like little white specks on the leaves
these<00:01:36.509> are<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:37.200> seed<00:01:37.500> pods<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.220> egg<00:01:38.759> pods

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
these are actually seed pods or egg pods

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.480 
these are actually seed pods or egg pods
if<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:39.570> getting<00:01:39.869> ready<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> hatch<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
if you're getting ready to hatch this

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
if you're getting ready to hatch this
will<00:01:41.729> go<00:01:41.939> from<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.390> million<00:01:42.750> aphids<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> ten

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
will go from a million aphids to ten

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
will go from a million aphids to ten
million<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.210> matter<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.689> few<00:01:45.899> days

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
million in just a matter of a few days

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.139 
million in just a matter of a few days
so<00:01:46.530> we're<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.189> catching<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
so we're really catching this at the

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.569 
so we're really catching this at the
right<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.070> spray<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.460> on

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
right time you just want to spray it on

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.149 
right time you just want to spray it on
the<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.810> outer<00:01:51.990> leaves<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.649> catch<00:01:52.860> these

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the on the outer leaves to catch these

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.429 
the on the outer leaves to catch these
egg<00:01:53.399> pods<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:54.149> will<00:01:54.360> dissolve<00:01:54.750> them<00:01:55.140> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
egg pods this will dissolve them and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.859 
egg pods this will dissolve them and
then<00:01:56.310> underneath<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.969> leaves<00:01:57.360> we're<00:01:57.750> gonna

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
then underneath the leaves we're gonna

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.010 
then underneath the leaves we're gonna
have<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.259> hit<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.770> too<00:01:59.540> now<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
have to hit them here too now if it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
have to hit them here too now if it
comes<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> point<00:02:01.829> where<00:02:02.250> we<00:02:02.460> can't

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
comes to the point where we can't

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.870 
comes to the point where we can't
control<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:04.009> these<00:02:05.009> will<00:02:05.310> affect<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
control this these will affect the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.600 
control this these will affect the
entire<00:02:06.240> garden<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.170> gardens<00:02:07.680> around<00:02:07.829> us<00:02:08.310> here

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
entire garden and gardens around us here

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.800 
entire garden and gardens around us here
so<00:02:09.950> if<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.220> can't<00:02:11.489> knock<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.970> down<00:02:12.300> probably

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so if we can't knock this down probably

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.880 
so if we can't knock this down probably
the<00:02:13.110> best<00:02:13.319> thing<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the best thing that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.340 
the best thing that
at<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.310> point<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.420> go<00:02:15.780> ahead<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.170> cut

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
at this point is to go ahead and cut

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
at this point is to go ahead and cut
this<00:02:16.590> plant<00:02:16.890> down<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.970> kill<00:02:18.180> it

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
this plant down we don't have to kill it

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.199 
this plant down we don't have to kill it
but<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.290> need<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.770> cut<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> down<00:02:20.490> enough<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:20.910> we

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
but we need to cut it down enough so we

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.050 
but we need to cut it down enough so we
can<00:02:21.420> control<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:22.110> infestation<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.850> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
can control this infestation and so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
can control this infestation and so
literally<00:02:24.450> every<00:02:24.870> leaf<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.130> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
literally every leaf is going to have to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.780 
literally every leaf is going to have to
be<00:02:26.430> sprayed<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> underneath<00:02:27.660> side<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
be sprayed on the underneath side and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.340 
be sprayed on the underneath side and
and<00:02:29.840> kill<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.310> adults<00:02:32.310> or<00:02:33.170> actually<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
and kill the adults or actually the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.590 
and kill the adults or actually the
juveniles<00:02:34.860> that'll<00:02:35.250> turn<00:02:35.459> into<00:02:35.850> adults<00:02:36.000> that

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
juveniles that'll turn into adults that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.020 
juveniles that'll turn into adults that
will<00:02:36.810> become<00:02:36.959> airborne<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.890> these<00:02:38.730> will

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
will become airborne and these will

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
will become airborne and these will
affect<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.840> entire<00:02:39.959> garden<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> notice

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
affect the entire garden now I notice

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.190 
affect the entire garden now I notice
down<00:02:41.610> here<00:02:41.670> low<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.560> quite<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
down here low we don't have quite the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.479 
down here low we don't have quite the
infestation<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.560> did<00:02:46.739> up<00:02:46.920> on<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:47.190> upper

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
infestation that we did up on the upper

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.600 
infestation that we did up on the upper
part<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> plant<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.530> may<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.739> well

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
part of the plant so it may not well

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.440 
part of the plant so it may not well
this<00:02:51.090> one<00:02:51.300> has<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.690> pretty<00:02:51.870> good<00:02:52.170> too<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
this one has it pretty good too so

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.370 
this one has it pretty good too so
literally<00:02:54.450> we're<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.200> go

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
literally we're going to have to go

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.699 
literally we're going to have to go
through<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.269> spray<00:02:57.269> every<00:02:57.590> single<00:02:58.590> one

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
through here and spray every single one

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.759 
through here and spray every single one
of<00:02:58.890> these<00:02:59.010> leaves<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:03:00.570> able<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> knock<00:03:01.470> this

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
of these leaves to be able to knock this

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.220 
of these leaves to be able to knock this
problem<00:03:02.220> down<00:03:02.540> now<00:03:03.650> regardless<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.100> the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
problem down now regardless of what the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
problem down now regardless of what the
instructions<00:03:07.230> say<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.680> there<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.940> a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
instructions say on there this is a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.720 
instructions say on there this is a
fairly<00:03:09.360> tough<00:03:09.780> plant<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.400> every

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
fairly tough plant you can do this every

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.330 
fairly tough plant you can do this every
six<00:03:12.030> days<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.630> control<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.350> if<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:13.980> do<00:03:14.160> it

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
six days to control it if you do it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.160 
six days to control it if you do it
every<00:03:14.430> six<00:03:14.850> days<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.480> you'll<00:03:15.630> break<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
every six days and you'll break the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.310 
every six days and you'll break the
cycle<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> insect<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.989> rid

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
cycle of the insect and that you can rid

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.720 
cycle of the insect and that you can rid
them<00:03:19.470> completely<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.180> wait<00:03:21.420> two<00:03:21.690> weeks

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
them completely if you wait two weeks

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.490 
them completely if you wait two weeks
it'll<00:03:23.730> give<00:03:23.880> enough<00:03:24.209> time<00:03:24.480> for<00:03:24.810> eggs<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.350> be

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
it'll give enough time for eggs to be

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.110 
it'll give enough time for eggs to be
hatched<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:26.100> different<00:03:26.459> places<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.910> the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
hatched in different places of the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.150 
hatched in different places of the
gardening<00:03:27.750> you'll<00:03:27.959> never<00:03:28.200> you'll<00:03:28.680> never<00:03:28.739> get

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
gardening you'll never you'll never get

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.640 
gardening you'll never you'll never get
rid<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.400> them<00:03:29.670> they'll<00:03:29.880> just<00:03:30.060> constantly<00:03:30.870> be

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
rid of them they'll just constantly be

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.259 
rid of them they'll just constantly be
coming<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.160> at<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:34.760> let's<00:03:35.760> just<00:03:36.060> go

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
coming back at you so let's just go

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.300 
coming back at you so let's just go
ahead<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.750> finish<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.320> up<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.980> probably

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
ahead and finish this up and we probably

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.479 
ahead and finish this up and we probably
don't<00:03:41.579> have<00:03:41.760> enough<00:03:42.950> footage<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.459> film

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
don't have enough footage in the film

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.880 
don't have enough footage in the film
box<00:03:45.030> for<00:03:45.360> me<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.660> do<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> whole<00:03:46.019> plant<00:03:46.470> but<00:03:46.739> you

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
box for me to do the whole plant but you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.530 
box for me to do the whole plant but you
probably<00:03:47.130> get<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.640> idea<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:48.150> what<00:03:48.360> we're

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
probably get the idea of what we're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.690 
probably get the idea of what we're
doing<00:03:48.690> here<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.130> will<00:03:50.310> do<00:03:50.519> is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
doing here and what this will do is

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.900 
doing here and what this will do is
it'll<00:03:51.060> actually<00:03:51.810> dissolve<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.400> insect

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it'll actually dissolve the the insect

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.479 
it'll actually dissolve the the insect
with<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.269> oil<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.870> if<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.010> mix<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.340> properly

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
with the oil and if you mix it properly

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.020 
with the oil and if you mix it properly
you<00:03:56.970> will<00:03:57.180> not<00:03:57.360> get<00:03:57.600> any<00:03:57.780> burn<00:03:58.079> on<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.500> plant

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
you will not get any burn on the plant

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.960 
you will not get any burn on the plant
so<00:04:00.170> I'm<00:04:01.170> surprised<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.100> we<00:04:02.220> don't<00:04:02.489> see<00:04:02.760> any

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
so I'm surprised that we don't see any

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.229 
so I'm surprised that we don't see any
lady<00:04:03.540> bugs<00:04:03.900> in<00:04:04.170> here<00:04:04.350> generally<00:04:05.040> when<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.060> get

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
lady bugs in here generally when you get

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.560 
lady bugs in here generally when you get
this<00:04:06.450> kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.900> infestation<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:08.070> will<00:04:08.280> see

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
this kind of infestation you will see

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.360 
this kind of infestation you will see
ladybugs<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.810> here<00:04:10.079> now<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> notice<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.220> bee

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
ladybugs in here now I notice the bee

the bee with the neem and that's only
with<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> direct<00:04:22.950> hit<00:04:23.220> if<00:04:23.520> they<00:04:23.669> land<00:04:23.940> on<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
with the direct hit if they land on it
