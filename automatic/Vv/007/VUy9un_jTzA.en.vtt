the<00:02:32.670> design<00:02:34.400> kind<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.430> makes<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.730> seem<00:02:35.940> like

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the design kind of makes it seem like

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.560 
the design kind of makes it seem like
it's<00:02:36.240> running<00:02:37.820> but<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.850> guess<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> know
