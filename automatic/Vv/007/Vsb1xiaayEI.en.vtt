00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello everyone here we are close to 19 in 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.359
 this video of teaching how to make a 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.270
 small oil lamp for it we are going to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.020
 need a little tin of this is 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.160
 of cream for the cocoa classroom this 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.770
 simply what I have done has been 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.680
 fix it with a trevelin tail with a 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 Lima later will also need a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:28.100
 small house or a piece of a shirt 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.410
 old that we did not use well was a drill 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.260
 oil and logically to be what 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.149
 let's use combustion 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.399
 first of all we are going to make a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.730
 hole roughly in the center by 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.450
 here with the drill but a very 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 important 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 the progress thus goes from outside towards 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.989
 inside so we go there good once 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.020
 that we have made the hole to proceed 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.300
 to put gauze or work 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 towards the jungle they roll up a little 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.320
 compact it a bit more than we enter 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.360
 segments 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.780
 percent 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.229
 and now simply 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 let's put a trick to go 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.740
 putting them can be to take a polygon 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.740
 with tips 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.680
 and we are going like this 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.430
 once he got it a little bit simply 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.130
 I've seen when a little pokes 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.550
 down and stretch and we stay like that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.190
 let's leave so much out let's leave 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.290
 something like that and this stays locality 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.840
 inside the boat then now the only thing 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.110
 What we have left is to fill the boat with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.080
 a little oil and put them on let's 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.620
 close the lid expected on paper well 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.780
 in the gauze 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.600
 in for weight up here and already 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 just turn it on improbable like that 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.070
 what I am going to do 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.030
 good come to the oil custard and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.790
 now it is simply to put the 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.790
 in the cover a couple of hours 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.290
 yes 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.430
 I'll get to more is a matter of waiting 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.000
 that when we see that the advance was 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.480
 impregnated we can understand our 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.239
 oil lamp 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.150
 well once we have left 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.250
 rest an answer let the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.560
 oil to work as you see is already like this 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.720
 a little yellow we will have left some 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.950
 three hours out there you're ready to 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.590
 prove it 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.920
 no need is totally impregnated 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.000
 with it being more or less in half 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.000
 Specifically worth to test 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.840
 he can do the second test 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.790
 we have the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.659
 for oil and we're going to 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.659
 sunderland 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.060
 Hello 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.420
 oil that you liked favorite
