00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello everyone my name is john carlin 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.940
 I am one of the administrators of the forum 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.660
 and optimus one and this time I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.470
 how to install pes 2012 in the airis 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 tm 400 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.670
 well we have some previous things that 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.080
 do the first let's disable 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.140
 internet because reason to avoid a 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:34.400
 Possible self-activation of pes 2012 with 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.829
 what we could not use it anymore for 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.970
 that we go to the status bar 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.120
 we deactivate the collection of data for 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.360
 that can not be connected by the 3g already and 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.800
 the good wifi with that we no longer have 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.110
 Internet 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 the second check that we have to 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.309
 do is see that it is activated 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.550
 the one that applications can be installed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 from unknown origins for that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.739
 let's go to the menu button and choose 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.560
 adjust the system good this is in the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.750
 apex launcher those who still have the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 lyon the launcher that is the one that came by 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.060
 defect with the equipment can press 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.270
 also the menu button and access to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.189
 configurations 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.549
 well once we're here what 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.630
 we have to look for is security in 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.390
 security 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.039
 we look for unknown sources ie 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.649
 allow the installation of applications 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.719
 that are not marketing are not the 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.039
 market I already have it activated if 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:37.209
 you did not have the deactivated by 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.789
 please activate the good that 's all that 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:43.209
 we have to do before obviously 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.439
 we have to have lowered the two 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.399
 files that we need for the 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.530
 installation 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.259
 the apec proper that is the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.470
 2012 pes installer and a rar file 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.530
 that contains the data so you can 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.860
 run the program can already 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.569
 do directly in the irish or they could 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 do it on your pc and then copy the 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:07.390
 files on air with usb cable or with 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 the method that you want 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.340
 and I use for installation the is 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.630
 file explorer you can 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.640
 use the file manager 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.850
 who want let's open the ls 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.910
 file explorer was already I have 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.760
 open and I'm going to go to the folder where 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.550
 I have copied the files that I downloaded 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 what is download 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.810
 oh and I have the rap and I have the 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.250
 Rap installer can not open 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.260
 directly with the s explore of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.360
 files and extract it if they wish I already 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.670
 I extracted it took a little bit so I did not 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.510
 I'm going to do right now I'm going to 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.470
 install the fish 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.620
 I give tap alpes to the installer to the pk and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.560
 allows me to install the installation takes 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.490
 little second really is pretty 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.490
 pretty fast 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 and this one has already been installed, I'm not going to open the 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:08.930
 application I'm still going to give you ready 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.659
 perfect now I have to see the folder 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.260
 which is compressed from the radar that goes down that 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:19.670
 Carrillo is DWTP I open 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:23.799
 and here I have to point out the one with a 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.799
 a little longer pressure 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
 I've already pointed this out and I'm going to 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.959
 copy it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.269
 once I heard copy what I do is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.690
 open here the folder that supposedly 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.090
 I'm looking to choose micro sd 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.530
 that is here from SD card and the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.019
 I distinguish by the size that I have a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.349
 dedicated 8 gigs and the down the sd 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.780
 internal card then pressed here and 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.730
 open the folder inside android 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.290
 Android folder there is a folder called 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.629
 dates I open it again and this is where 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.760
 pasted the folder that I had copied 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.920
 previously then it starts to 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.560
 copy everything 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.830
 also this does not take much long 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.569
 it will be about 15 seconds or so 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.400
 already so let's wait a little while 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:17.030
 once it's finished it's going to be the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.989
 copy we already have the 2012 pes 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.989
 operative 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.750
 ready already copied let's go back well there 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.210
 is with konami already 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:35.650
 we go back to leave the explorer 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.730
 files and we will be able to open the fish 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:43.200
 without problems the 2002 weight the stage and 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.200
 it starts to charge 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.750
 konami 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.040
 ready both in evens was shown in 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.590
 anywhere 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.520
 and we are going to configure what is the language 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.520
 because it is in English 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.320
 let's go in and change the language to 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.139
 Spanish 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:33.120
 ready and we can leave the game 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.120
 activate the internet if we wish 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.989
 and if they want to reopen it, it's going to open 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.989
 Without inconveniences 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.690
 the files needed to exit 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:10.710
 installation either the installer applies 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:14.250
 or ico the data that is in a weird 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.130
 are in the description of this video and 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.530
 also in a post that I posted in 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.240
 the forum I do not think they have 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.720
 inconvenient to download them come down 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.620
 pretty pretty fast this young woman already 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.689
 we can enter to play without any 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:36.519
 inconvenient 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:36.519
 we're already going to the next and this 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.139
 I calculate that among you there are 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.629
 a lot of people who think about playing 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.680
 better than this game than me so 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.680
 I'm just going to show you that 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:52.710
 nothing else works 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.710
 please enter the forum 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.580
