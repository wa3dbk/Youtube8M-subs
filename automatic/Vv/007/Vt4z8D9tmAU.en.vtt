00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620 

now<00:00:53.920> this<00:00:54.130> was<00:00:54.370> probably<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.910> best<00:00:55.300> part<00:00:55.540> of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
now this was probably the best part of

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.940 
now this was probably the best part of
the<00:00:55.750> race<00:00:55.930> whereas<00:00:56.260> most<00:00:56.440> people<00:00:56.800> probably

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
the race whereas most people probably

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.310 
the race whereas most people probably
took<00:00:57.460> taxis<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.270> get<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.510> Times<00:00:58.750> Square<00:00:58.930> from

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
took taxis to get to Times Square from

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.890 
took taxis to get to Times Square from
here<00:00:59.460> this<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.610> where<00:01:00.790> public<00:01:01.210> transportation

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
here this is where public transportation

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.200 
here this is where public transportation
was<00:01:02.140> actually<00:01:02.560> faster<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.370> I<00:01:03.430> knew<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:04.000> best

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
was actually faster and I knew the best

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.840 
was actually faster and I knew the best
route<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:04.839> get<00:01:05.020> there<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.500> mean<00:01:06.250> that's<00:01:06.550> what<00:01:06.820> a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
route to get there I mean that's what a

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.460 
route to get there I mean that's what a
race<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.210> really<00:01:07.570> be<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.140> kind<00:01:08.350> of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
race you really be in this kind of

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.260 
race you really be in this kind of
situation<00:01:08.650> should<00:01:09.280> be<00:01:09.430> knowing<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:10.030> best

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
situation should be knowing the best

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
situation should be knowing the best
route<00:01:10.510> not<00:01:10.720> just<00:01:10.960> relying<00:01:11.290> on<00:01:11.590> taxis<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
route not just relying on taxis the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:21.240 
route not just relying on taxis the
