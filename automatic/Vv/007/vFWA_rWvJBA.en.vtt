00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.010
 hi charge here I am so rock and 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.930
 bones finished at 99% so just the lighting 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.949
 which is not yet functional and the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.140
 horn here is a vehicle that we 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.330
 have built in almost even 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.530
 a little over three years ago we started 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.829
 by the handlebars in December 2010 the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:38.829
 painting especially much dragged 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:41.350
 since a big level of painting is 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.719
 so a little summary of what has been 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.800
 done on this vehicle since the beginning 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.819
 so everything started with 3d plans 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.519
 that really looked really 

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:56.920
 exactly to that I 'll put a little 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:59.589
 photo in the video and so is big 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.690
 challenge on this vehicle since we had to 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.030
 have a frank house fork 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.820
 springer a homemade gift of course 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.399
 with bent tubes so we 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.310
 did not have a bender to center 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.420
 all the tubes of the old-fashioned frame 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.700
 that is, they were filled with 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.890
 sand welded two end plugs 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.030
 we had a little template for 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.020
 for each centering the little video of 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.270
 that I will put links other other 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.130
 change first 4-stroke engine for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.840
 we since we have always been so far 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.659
 two stages, especially 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.880
 chainsaws so here it's a breeze 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.070
 which originally made five horses which 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.289
 a little bit hurt before we got them 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.890
 recovered but we have a little boosted must 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.780
 not to do much healthier but 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.200
 how many these turns so yes especially 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:03.479
 bets a bit of carburetor breeze 22 mm 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.700
 then intake home made exhaust 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.200
 he too homemade 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.720
 when someone a nice pot for 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 the appearance and a pot with weekend 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.810
 thermal there labness handed over by pure 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.900
 gevrey every mans other novelty for 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:28.340
 us and where therefore no bicycle wheel here 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.380
 where before mopeds and rear wheel 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.140
 which is actually a wheel before 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.140
 scooter whose record has been preserved 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.540
 here is brake hydraulic disc brakes 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.670
 which comes from any 125 any 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.000
 idea that's all transmission by 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.239
 primary and secondary cross 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.739
 transmission let's talk about it with a 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.209
 variator so at the court is not the 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.250
 good 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.980
 he was a little shorter his outstanding 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.890
 of transmission commands which has us 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.950
 caused a lot of problems and that is 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.060
 really a pure happiness to use and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.940
 which works particularly well since 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.350
 that we added this magnificent 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.950
 belt guide another challenge of course the 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:31.540
 paint painting in a few a good 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:31.540
 level of finish has a lot of trouble 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.460
 and then good the sailing challenge to do this 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.630
 trick that debunks 1 that is to say that we 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.740
 usually we saw them on the internet 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.280
 the stuff that debunks and then there we 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.410
 see seeing the ducts here you go 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.610
 I hope you like it do not hesitate 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.380
