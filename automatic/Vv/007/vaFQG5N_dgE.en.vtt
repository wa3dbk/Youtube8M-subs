review of Marvel Universe abomination or
a<00:00:08.130> bomb<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.910> blue<00:00:09.150> variations<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.290> actually

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
a bomb the blue variations so I actually

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.860 
a bomb the blue variations so I actually
just<00:00:10.800> opened<00:00:11.309> him<00:00:11.429> up<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.790> kind<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.660> take<00:00:12.840> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
just opened him up to kind of take a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.320 
just opened him up to kind of take a
look<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.320> at<00:00:13.889> his<00:00:14.099> articulation<00:00:14.460> see<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.240> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
look at at his articulation see if I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.540 
look at at his articulation see if I
thought<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.750> was<00:00:15.990> worthy<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.010> doing<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> quick

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
thought he was worthy of doing a quick

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.099 
thought he was worthy of doing a quick
review<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.000> or<00:00:18.300> off<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.510> anything<00:00:18.750> different

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
review on or off or anything different

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.660 
review on or off or anything different
but<00:00:19.260> looking<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:19.949> him<00:00:20.039> up<00:00:20.130> close<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.550> thought

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
but looking at him up close I thought

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
but looking at him up close I thought
I'd<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.910> good<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.480> take<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> closer<00:00:22.109> look<00:00:22.199> so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I'd be good to take a closer look so

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
I'd be good to take a closer look so
first<00:00:22.980> off<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.460> you've<00:00:23.609> been<00:00:23.730> following<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
first off if you've been following the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.730 
first off if you've been following the
line<00:00:24.570> there's<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.320> green<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.939> blue<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
line there's the green and the blue and

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
line there's the green and the blue and
so<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.890> thus<00:00:29.070> far<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> blue<00:00:29.670> has<00:00:29.789> been<00:00:29.939> much

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so if thus far the blue has been much

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.730 
so if thus far the blue has been much
more<00:00:30.420> difficult<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.960> find<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.320> least<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.590> has

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
more difficult to find at least it has

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.860 
more difficult to find at least it has
been<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.189> Southern<00:00:32.640> California<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.570> so

SoCal Comic Con ting just got him home
and<00:00:48.539> thought<00:00:48.660> it'd<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.750> cool<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> look

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and thought it'd be cool to take a look

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.450 
and thought it'd be cool to take a look
at<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.520> think<00:00:50.850> he<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:52.160> exemplifies<00:00:53.160> some

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
at so I think he really exemplifies some

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.310 
at so I think he really exemplifies some
of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> best<00:00:53.850> things<00:00:54.090> about<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.960> Marvel

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
place and they're making some changes

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
place and they're making some changes
with<00:01:49.439> Marvel<00:01:49.799> Universe<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
with Marvel Universe and so it's a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
with Marvel Universe and so it's a
little<00:01:51.720> sad<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.180> know

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
little sad to think that you know

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
little sad to think that you know
characters<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.290> with<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> combination

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
characters like this with a combination

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.389 
characters like this with a combination
of<00:01:56.390> character<00:01:57.390> depth<00:01:57.630> sculpt<00:01:58.290> coloring<00:01:59.100> just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
of character depth sculpt coloring just

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.459 
of character depth sculpt coloring just
everything<00:02:00.180> about<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.810> might<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.259> getting

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
everything about it we might be getting

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
everything about it we might be getting
a<00:02:01.530> little<00:02:01.560> bit<00:02:01.770> lesser<00:02:02.219> quality<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> goes

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
a little bit lesser quality if it goes

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
a little bit lesser quality if it goes
the<00:02:03.180> same<00:02:03.210> way<00:02:03.600> as<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.469> we're<00:02:04.590> seeing<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.890> a
