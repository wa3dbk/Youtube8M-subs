drawing over their work showing them the

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.229 
drawing over their work showing them the
difference<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.920> also<00:02:57.640> something<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.090> I

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
difference and also something that I

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.470 
difference and also something that I
felt<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:59.770> mentors<00:03:00.250> gave<00:03:00.520> me<00:03:00.760> at<00:03:00.910> Disney<00:03:01.300> was

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
felt the mentors gave me at Disney was

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.110

always<00:03:02.110> trying<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.440> explain<00:03:02.890> how<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.580> works<00:03:03.850> so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
always trying to explain how it works so

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.479 
always trying to explain how it works so
that<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.299> could<00:03:04.600> help<00:03:05.080> myself<00:03:05.320> learn<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.310> that<00:03:06.459> I

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
that I could help myself learn so that I

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.370 
that I could help myself learn so that I
could<00:03:06.700> always<00:03:06.880> know<00:03:07.269> how<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.570> look<00:03:07.900> at<00:03:08.049> my<00:03:08.170> work

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
could always know how to look at my work

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.759 
could always know how to look at my work
how<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:10.360> self-critical<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> to

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
how to be self-critical and to

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.350 
how to be self-critical and to
understand<00:03:12.340> what<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.549> did<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.209> wasn't

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
understand what I did so that it wasn't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360 
understand what I did so that it wasn't
just<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.989> one<00:03:14.350> correction<00:03:14.920> on<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.040> drawing

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
just that one correction on a drawing

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:27.130 
just that one correction on a drawing
but<00:03:15.640> really<00:03:15.910> how<00:03:16.180> these<00:03:17.049> things<00:03:17.320> work

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.920 

it<00:03:27.710> almost<00:03:27.950> feels<00:03:28.370> like<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:28.940> more<00:03:29.330> worth<00:03:29.720> it

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
it almost feels like it's more worth it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.110 
it almost feels like it's more worth it
more<00:03:30.200> worth<00:03:30.410> all<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.980> time<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.580> dedication

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
more worth all the time and dedication

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.760 
more worth all the time and dedication
that<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.270> did<00:03:32.600> because<00:03:32.870> I<00:03:32.959> can<00:03:33.170> give<00:03:33.500> it<00:03:33.620> to

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
that I did because I can give it to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.949 
that I did because I can give it to
these<00:03:33.890> people<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.580> are<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:34.970> passionate<00:03:35.240> I

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
these people that are so passionate I

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.170 
these people that are so passionate I
just<00:03:36.620> find<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.130> much<00:03:37.459> more<00:03:37.640> rewarding<00:03:37.790> I

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
just find it so much more rewarding I

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.670 
just find it so much more rewarding I
just<00:03:38.360> feel<00:03:38.540> like<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.840> makes<00:03:39.050> everything<00:03:39.440> that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
just feel like it makes everything that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.150 
just feel like it makes everything that
I've<00:03:39.800> done<00:03:39.830> so<00:03:40.310> far<00:03:40.340> worthwhile
