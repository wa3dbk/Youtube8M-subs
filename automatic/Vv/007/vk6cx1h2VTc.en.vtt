Brooks Range saw that I've just gotten

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.800 
Brooks Range saw that I've just gotten
to<00:00:32.090> test<00:00:32.920> it's<00:00:33.920> a<00:00:34.329> collapsible<00:00:35.329> saw<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:38.450> far<00:00:38.660> my

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
to test it's a collapsible saw so far my

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.520 
to test it's a collapsible saw so far my
favorite<00:00:40.780> carrying<00:00:41.780> case<00:00:41.989> seems<00:00:42.290> really

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
favorite carrying case seems really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.939 
favorite carrying case seems really
durable<00:00:43.270> protects<00:00:44.379> contents<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.469> pack<00:00:45.680> from

durable protects contents the pack from
the<00:00:46.039> sharp<00:00:46.280> edges<00:00:46.629> so<00:00:47.629> I'm<00:00:47.750> doing<00:00:47.899> a<00:00:48.050> bit<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.260> a

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the sharp edges so I'm doing a bit of a

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.400 
the sharp edges so I'm doing a bit of a
compression<00:00:49.730> test<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.510> on<00:00:50.719> a<00:00:50.750> 30<00:00:51.079> centimeter

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
compression test here on a 30 centimeter

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.880 
compression test here on a 30 centimeter
wide<00:00:51.769> column<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.899> do<00:00:53.899> have<00:00:54.109> a<00:00:54.140> mark<00:00:54.440> real<00:00:54.680> nice

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
wide column I do have a mark real nice

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.790 
wide column I do have a mark real nice
there<00:00:55.250> 30<00:00:55.640> centimeters<00:00:56.269> it's<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.320> double<00:00:57.620> dark

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
there 30 centimeters it's a double dark

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.560 
there 30 centimeters it's a double dark
line<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:59.140> so<00:01:00.140> making<00:01:00.469> my<00:01:00.910> make<00:01:01.910> my<00:01:02.120> pie<00:01:02.329> wedge
