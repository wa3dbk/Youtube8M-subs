you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.480> strip<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.750> scene<00:03:04.049> down<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.560> basic

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you can strip the scene down to basic

you can strip the scene down to basic
basic<00:03:05.819> surface<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.750> light<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.560> surface<00:03:08.069> on

it say and that's quite straightforward
to<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.560> start<00:03:10.829> with<00:03:10.890> deferred<00:03:11.280> lights

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
to do so we start with deferred lights

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.850 
to do so we start with deferred lights
then<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:12.450> add<00:03:12.569> ambient<00:03:12.989> light<00:03:13.140> with<00:03:13.380> occlusion

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
then we add ambient light with occlusion

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.370 
then we add ambient light with occlusion
and<00:03:13.980> directional<00:03:14.819> lighting<00:03:15.260> followed<00:03:16.260> by
