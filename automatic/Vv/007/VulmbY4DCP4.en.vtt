some<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.750> turns<00:02:54.990> I'd<00:02:55.290> come<00:02:55.470> into<00:02:55.710> if<00:02:56.130> i<00:02:56.250> was

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
some of the turns I'd come into if i was

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400 
some of the turns I'd come into if i was
revving<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.910> second<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.960> was<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> little<00:02:58.290> bit

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
revving in second it was a little bit

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.170 
revving in second it was a little bit
too<00:02:58.530> much<00:02:58.650> if<00:02:58.800> i<00:02:58.920> shift<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.430> third<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
too much if i shift to the third and it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.180 
too much if i shift to the third and it
seemed<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.630> hold<00:03:00.990> third<00:03:01.320> throughout<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
seemed like a hold third throughout the

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.400 
seemed like a hold third throughout the
turn<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.000> straightaway<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.110> it<00:03:04.290> was

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
turn and down the straightaway so it was

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.530 
turn and down the straightaway so it was
kind<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.710> unique<00:03:05.130> for<00:03:05.160> a<00:03:05.430> 250f<00:03:06.000> usually<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
kind of unique for a 250f usually you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.330 
kind of unique for a 250f usually you
got<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.780> keep<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.170> one<00:03:07.650> gear<00:03:07.950> coming

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
when I got on the front brake like I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.860 
when I got on the front brake like I
said<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.740> power<00:03:40.920> is<00:03:41.130> good<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.790> tires<00:03:42.030> they

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
said the power is good the tires they

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.680 
said the power is good the tires they
come<00:03:43.050> now<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.650> MX<00:03:44.100> 51<00:03:44.550> laps<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.480> tires

come now with the MX 51 laps the tires

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.390 
come now with the MX 51 laps the tires
hooked<00:03:46.020> up<00:03:46.170> really<00:03:46.440> good<00:03:46.620> especially<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.310> at

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
hooked up really good especially here at

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.580 
hooked up really good especially here at
this<00:03:47.520> track<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.000> kind<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.300> someplace<00:03:49.200> muddy

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
this track it's kind of someplace muddy

tacky<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.489> also<00:03:50.790> blue<00:03:51.000> grooved<00:03:51.390> seemed<00:03:52.170> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
tacky and also blue grooved seemed to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.740 
tacky and also blue grooved seemed to
hook<00:03:52.410> up<00:03:52.590> pretty<00:03:52.830> good<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:54.030> overall<00:03:54.630> I

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
hook up pretty good but overall I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.390 
hook up pretty good but overall I
thought<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.140> bike<00:03:55.320> was<00:03:55.500> really<00:03:55.800> good<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.040> was

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400
