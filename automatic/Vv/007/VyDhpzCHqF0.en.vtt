remove a chain link you're going to need
a<00:00:07.589> tool<00:00:08.250> now<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.910> lot<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.150> multi<00:00:09.450> tools<00:00:09.660> already

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
a tool now a lot of multi tools already

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.700 
a tool now a lot of multi tools already
have<00:00:10.170> these<00:00:10.380> things<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.830> them<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
have these things on them so this is a

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
have these things on them so this is a
this<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> small<00:00:14.670> cool<00:00:15.000> tool<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:17.449> when<00:00:18.449> you

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this is a small cool tool and when you

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.470 
this is a small cool tool and when you
take<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.930> apart<00:00:19.820> it's<00:00:20.820> got<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> beats<00:00:21.359> you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
take it apart it's got the beats you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.359 
take it apart it's got the beats you
actually<00:00:21.779> need<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.410> order<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> job<00:00:23.220> if

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
actually need in order to do the job if

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
actually need in order to do the job if
you're<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.000> ride<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> you've<00:00:25.289> broken

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you're out on a ride and you've broken

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.339 
you're out on a ride and you've broken
your<00:00:25.769> chain<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.580> join<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:27.000> again

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
your chain you need to join it up again

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.120 
your chain you need to join it up again
so<00:00:29.480> these<00:00:30.480> things<00:00:30.660> all<00:00:30.840> basically<00:00:31.800> work<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
so these things all basically work the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.830 
so these things all basically work the
same<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> chain<00:00:34.500> sits<00:00:38.149> in<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> tool<00:00:39.600> like

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
same but the chain sits in the tool like

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.100 
same but the chain sits in the tool like
that<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.760> then<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
that and then all you have to do is to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.400 
that and then all you have to do is to
tighten<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.500> thing<00:00:47.100> which<00:00:47.460> pushes<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
tighten up this thing which pushes the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.560 
tighten up this thing which pushes the
derivative<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.190> side

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
derivative a through to the other side

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
derivative a through to the other side
I'm<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:53.539> better<00:00:54.539> tool<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
I'm going to use a better tool this is a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
I'm going to use a better tool this is a
dedicated<00:00:56.430> chain<00:00:56.820> tool<00:00:59.390> which<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> just

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
dedicated chain tool which is just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.599 
dedicated chain tool which is just
easier<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> use<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.469> easy<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> job

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
easier to use and easy to get the job

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.660 
easier to use and easy to get the job
done<00:01:02.670> properly<00:01:02.850> rather<00:01:03.510> than<00:01:03.719> dodging<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.670> so

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
done properly rather than dodging it so

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
done properly rather than dodging it so
I'll<00:01:06.030> undo<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:07.909> drop<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.150> chain<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:15.259> clip<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I'll undo it drop the chain in clip the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.350 
I'll undo it drop the chain in clip the
chain<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:18.320> hope<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.799> see<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.360> and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
chain in there hope you can see that and

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
chain in there hope you can see that and
then<00:01:21.479> I'll<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.659> tighten<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:25.610> here<00:01:26.610> cracking

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
then I'll just tighten out here cracking

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:38.960 
then I'll just tighten out here cracking
noise<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.799> dunga<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.340> file<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.729> end<00:01:38.850> up

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
noise and get dunga so file you end up

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.920 
noise and get dunga so file you end up
pushing<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.390> rivet<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pushing the rivet right out then back it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.200 
pushing the rivet right out then back it
off

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.500 

and<00:01:53.210> as<00:01:53.330> your<00:01:53.510> China<00:01:53.720> part<00:01:54.050> salted<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:56.270> put<00:01:56.420> it

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
and as your China part salted to put it

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.170

back<00:01:56.600> together<00:01:56.750> again<00:01:57.020> or<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.860> put<00:01:58.180> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
back together again or to put the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.150 
back together again or to put the
obviously<00:01:59.450> need<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.720> turn<00:02:00.260> things<00:02:00.470> around

making a video for dive undo that thing

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.940 
making a video for dive undo that thing
again<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:12.520> a<00:02:13.520> bit<00:02:13.880> weird<00:02:16.990> car<00:02:17.990> sounded<00:02:18.410> nice

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:35.830 

bun<00:02:24.950> that<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.520> again<00:02:34.480> if<00:02:35.480> you've<00:02:35.630> got<00:02:35.750> it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
bun that in there again if you've got it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.570 
bun that in there again if you've got it
all<00:02:35.870> lined<00:02:36.110> up<00:02:36.320> right<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:37.160> you're<00:02:37.280> all<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580

all lined up right and you're all you
need<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:37.880> tighten<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.420> thing<00:02:38.660> up

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
need to do is tighten that thing up

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.550 
need to do is tighten that thing up
again<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:41.150> can<00:02:41.300> feel<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.540> going<00:02:41.810> right<00:02:42.080> you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
again you can feel it going right you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.390 
again you can feel it going right you
can<00:02:42.709> feel<00:02:42.950> from<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.250> tension<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:45.340> on<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
can feel from the tension on the on the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.270 
can feel from the tension on the on the
handle<00:02:46.850> whether<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:47.720> working<00:02:48.080> well<00:02:48.410> and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
handle whether it's working well and

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.660 
handle whether it's working well and
what<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.550> end<00:02:49.580> up<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.600> your<00:02:51.500> rivet<00:02:51.860> push

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
what you end up with is your rivet push

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.760 
what you end up with is your rivet push
although<00:02:53.120> through<00:02:53.420> one<00:02:54.200> side<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.709> other

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
although through one side to the other

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.790 
although through one side to the other
and<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.880> end<00:02:56.000> up<00:02:56.030> with<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.239> stiff<00:02:56.510> link<00:02:56.810> will<00:02:57.590> be

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
and you end up with a stiff link will be

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280 
and you end up with a stiff link will be
stiff<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.580> what<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:58.820> then<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.239> do<00:02:59.480> is<00:03:00.080> to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
stiff so what you then have to do is to

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.890 
stiff so what you then have to do is to
massage<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:01.090> by<00:03:02.090> moving<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.540> side<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.750> side

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
massage it by moving it side to side

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.560 
massage it by moving it side to side
until<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.590> frees<00:03:03.890> up<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.160> bit<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.970> then<00:03:05.090> you're

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
until it frees up a bit and then you're

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.640 
until it frees up a bit and then you're
sorted<00:03:05.959> there<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.739> go<00:03:06.860> done
