00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.320 
now the actual search cost I can use
either<00:02:36.930> extreme<00:02:37.930> conditioning<00:02:38.470> or<00:02:38.680> recon

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
either extreme conditioning or recon

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.610 
either extreme conditioning or recon
which<00:02:40.330> currently<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.750> don't<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> pro<00:02:41.380> yet

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
which currently I don't have a pro yet

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.190 
which currently I don't have a pro yet
I'm<00:02:41.950> get<00:02:42.190> pretty<00:02:42.790> pretty<00:02:43.030> close<00:02:43.180> almost<00:02:43.750> there

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
I'm get pretty pretty close almost there

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.470 
I'm get pretty pretty close almost there
but<00:02:44.950> yeah<00:02:45.190> extreme<00:02:45.580> conditioning<00:02:46.000> or<00:02:46.180> econ

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
but yeah extreme conditioning or econ

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.600 
but yeah extreme conditioning or econ
sometimes<00:02:47.200> sleight<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> hand<00:02:47.739> if<00:02:47.950> I'm<00:02:48.340> early

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
sometimes sleight of hand if I'm early

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.300 
sometimes sleight of hand if I'm early
into<00:02:48.819> a<00:02:48.849> prestige<00:02:49.239> but<00:02:49.930> recon<00:02:50.680> are<00:02:50.950> extreme

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
into a prestige but recon are extreme

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.880 
into a prestige but recon are extreme
conditioning<00:02:51.819> and<00:02:52.150> then<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> swap<00:02:53.650> out

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
conditioning and then I like to swap out

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.380 
conditioning and then I like to swap out
a<00:02:54.580> quick<00:02:55.120> draw<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.720> assassin<00:02:56.170> or<00:02:56.290> hardline

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
a quick draw for assassin or hardline

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.699 
a quick draw for assassin or hardline
but<00:02:59.549> sitrep<00:03:00.549> kind<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.910> stays<00:03:01.090> there<00:03:01.690> sitrep<00:03:02.530> is

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
but sitrep kind of stays there sitrep is

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.710 
but sitrep kind of stays there sitrep is
just<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.549> probably<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.180> best<00:03:04.329> perk<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.660> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
just the probably the best perk in the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.350 
just the probably the best perk in the
game<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.989> my<00:03:05.079> opinion<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
game in my opinion on this is the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.599 
game in my opinion on this is the
general<00:03:07.720> setup<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.739> use<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.430> setup

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
general setup I use this is the setup

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.849 
general setup I use this is the setup
while<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.030> use<00:03:10.299> first<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.709> other

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
while it use first and then the other

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.120 
while it use first and then the other
alternatives<00:03:12.660> if<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.810> don't<00:03:14.019> have<00:03:14.170> recon<00:03:14.890> pro

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
alternatives if I don't have recon pro

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.530 
alternatives if I don't have recon pro
because<00:03:15.280> obviously<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.730> pro<00:03:15.910> variant<00:03:16.359> is

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
because obviously the pro variant is

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.949 
because obviously the pro variant is
what<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:17.319> really<00:03:17.470> want<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.130> but

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
what what you really want for it but

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.809 
what what you really want for it but
yeah<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.590> my<00:03:20.889> opinion<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.700> most

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
yeah this is in my opinion the most

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.220 
yeah this is in my opinion the most
powerful<00:03:22.650> search<00:03:23.650> class<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.850> in<00:03:25.750> terms<00:03:26.049> of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
powerful search class now in terms of

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.250 
powerful search class now in terms of
the<00:03:26.980> secondary<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.549> have<00:03:27.700> chosen<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:29.109> that

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
the secondary I have chosen I have that

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.990 
the secondary I have chosen I have that
it<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.560> particular<00:03:30.010> reason<00:03:30.160> because<00:03:30.760> I

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it for a particular reason because I

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.460 
it for a particular reason because I
don't<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.209> sleight<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> hand<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.019> don't<00:03:32.290> want

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
don't have sleight of hand I don't want

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.750 
don't have sleight of hand I don't want
to<00:03:32.560> use<00:03:32.739> any<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.100> machine<00:03:33.340> pistols

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
to use any of the machine pistols

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.009 
to use any of the machine pistols
because<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.329> quick<00:03:34.540> switch<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:34.959> what<00:03:37.019> would

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
because the quick switch is what would

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.129 
because the quick switch is what would
enable<00:03:38.230> me<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.500> use<00:03:38.859> a<00:03:39.480> machine<00:03:40.480> pistol<00:03:40.959> in

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
enable me to use a machine pistol in

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.110 
enable me to use a machine pistol in
case<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.560> run<00:03:41.859> out<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> ammo<00:03:42.310> my<00:03:42.489> first<00:03:42.700> gun<00:03:42.910> I

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
case I run out of ammo my first gun I

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.300 
case I run out of ammo my first gun I
can<00:03:43.329> switch<00:03:43.600> fast<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.739> still<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.250> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
can switch fast and still have the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.490 
can switch fast and still have the
high-powered<00:03:45.730> weapon<00:03:46.030> but<00:03:46.630> instead<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.380> use<00:03:47.470> a

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
high-powered weapon but instead of use a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.710 
high-powered weapon but instead of use a
handgun<00:03:47.859> because<00:03:48.130> without<00:03:48.850> sleight<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.480> hand

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
handgun because without sleight of hand

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.059 
handgun because without sleight of hand
you<00:03:49.810> still<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.170> quick<00:03:50.410> switch<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.920> a

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
you still have that quick switch and a

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.830 
you still have that quick switch and a
magnum<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.670> my<00:03:51.970> favorite<00:03:52.329> because<00:03:52.600> it's

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
magnum is my favorite because it's

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.680 
magnum is my favorite because it's
accurate<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.440> it's<00:03:53.620> most<00:03:53.799> powerful<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.690> some

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
accurate and it's most powerful on some

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.780 
accurate and it's most powerful on some
people<00:03:55.930> would<00:03:56.139> use<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> desert<00:03:57.069> eagle<00:03:57.190> but<00:03:57.549> I

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
people would use the desert eagle but I

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.970 
people would use the desert eagle but I
I<00:03:58.299> think<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.019> absolutely<00:03:59.230> terrible

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
I think it's absolutely terrible

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.080 
I think it's absolutely terrible
so<00:04:00.370> Magnum<00:04:01.090> is<00:04:02.010> my<00:04:03.010> handgun<00:04:03.430> of<00:04:03.639> choice<00:04:03.819> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
so Magnum is my handgun of choice and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.129 
so Magnum is my handgun of choice and
that's<00:04:04.239> why<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.389> have<00:04:04.569> that<00:04:04.599> there<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.019> my

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
that's why I have that there as my

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.220 
that's why I have that there as my
secondary<00:04:05.560> as<00:04:06.090> my<00:04:07.090> primary<00:04:07.359> as<00:04:07.810> much<00:04:07.989> as<00:04:08.139> you

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
secondary as my primary as much as you

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.569 
secondary as my primary as much as you
don't<00:04:08.410> want<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.590> hear<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.859> I<00:04:08.920> use<00:04:09.069> either<00:04:09.340> the

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
don't want to hear it I use either the

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.050 
don't want to hear it I use either the
ACR<00:04:10.030> or<00:04:10.349> mp7<00:04:11.349> mainly<00:04:11.769> because<00:04:12.370> they're<00:04:12.790> very

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
ACR or mp7 mainly because they're very

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.879 
ACR or mp7 mainly because they're very
multi-purpose<00:04:14.049> weapons<00:04:14.940> in<00:04:15.940> my

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
multi-purpose weapons in my

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.969 
multi-purpose weapons in my
you<00:04:17.009> can<00:04:17.189> get<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:18.079> short<00:04:19.079> medium<00:04:19.409> and<00:04:19.709> long

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
you can get a short medium and long

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.390 
you can get a short medium and long
range<00:04:20.689> encounter<00:04:21.689> and<00:04:21.930> still<00:04:22.169> be<00:04:22.560> able<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.770> do

range encounter and still be able to do

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.939 
range encounter and still be able to do
that<00:04:23.580> with<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:24.120> mp7<00:04:24.360> of<00:04:24.689> the<00:04:24.749> ACR<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.710> those

my<00:04:32.490> opinion<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.909> most<00:04:33.029> overpowered<00:04:33.599> search

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:33.779 
my opinion the most overpowered search

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:36.439 
my opinion the most overpowered search
class<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.259> can<00:04:34.439> switch<00:04:35.310> up<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.639> specialist<00:04:36.210> or

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
class you can switch up to specialist or

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.050 
class you can switch up to specialist or
-<00:04:36.900> or<00:04:37.939> assault

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.850 
I wouldn't recommend support because I
think<00:04:42.360> supports<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.050> stupidest<00:04:43.499> thing<00:04:43.680> to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
think supports the stupidest thing to

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.369 
think supports the stupidest thing to
