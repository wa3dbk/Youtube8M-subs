broken<00:03:14.849> if<00:03:15.000> um<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.569> could<00:03:16.470> just<00:03:16.739> have

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.030 
broken if um you could just have
anywhere<00:03:18.540> near<00:03:18.599> decent<00:03:19.290> control<00:03:19.650> at<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:19.859> bomb

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
anywhere near decent control at the bomb

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
anywhere near decent control at the bomb
rocks<00:03:21.290> but<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.319> like<00:03:22.560> broken<00:03:22.829> things<00:03:23.510> are

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
rocks but I like broken things are

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.930 
rocks but I like broken things are
usually<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:25.079> unfair<00:03:25.590> tactics<00:03:27.260> kibou<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.940> was

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
usually use unfair tactics kibou I was

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.680
