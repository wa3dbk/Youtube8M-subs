00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and games for grip the grip because as

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.219 
and games for grip the grip because as
recoil<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.090> gun<00:01:54.270> has<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.509> lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> recoil<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
recoil this gun has a lot of recoil and

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.130 
recoil this gun has a lot of recoil and
I<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> grip<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.850> why<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.750> using

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I like the grip so that's why I'm using

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
I like the grip so that's why I'm using
slope<00:01:58.469> hand<00:01:58.770> cuz<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.399> gun<00:01:59.640> doesn't<00:01:59.850> need

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
slope hand cuz this gun doesn't need

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.100 
slope hand cuz this gun doesn't need
scavenger<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.430> it's<00:02:02.430> pretty<00:02:02.850> heavy<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.420> it's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
scavenger and it's pretty heavy so it's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.719 
scavenger and it's pretty heavy so it's
