tutorial<00:00:02.970> in<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.810> video<00:00:04.110> we're<00:00:04.589> going<00:00:04.770> to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
tutorial in this video we're going to

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.889 
tutorial in this video we're going to
combine<00:00:05.250> all<00:00:05.520> parts<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.029> our<00:00:06.210> model<00:00:06.690> together

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
combine all parts of our model together

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.980 
combine all parts of our model together
first<00:00:07.550> we<00:00:08.550> need<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.849> convert<00:00:09.179> our<00:00:09.420> project

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
first we need to convert our project

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
first we need to convert our project
into<00:00:10.500> PNG<00:00:11.340> format

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.500 

save<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.540> a<00:00:18.750> transparent<00:00:19.320> background

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.960 

using<00:00:26.230> coral<00:00:26.560> for<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:26.890> bone<00:00:27.070> software<00:00:27.760> I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
using coral for the bone software I

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.110 
using coral for the bone software I
separate<00:00:28.750> all<00:00:28.960> bars<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.460> can<00:00:30.640> use<00:00:30.850> any

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
separate all bars you can use any

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.090 
separate all bars you can use any
software<00:00:31.390> you<00:00:31.750> like<00:00:31.960> but<00:00:32.260> it<00:00:32.349> should<00:00:32.560> be<00:00:32.590> able

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
software you like but it should be able

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000 
software you like but it should be able
to<00:00:33.250> save<00:00:33.460> PNG<00:00:34.150> files<00:00:34.450> with<00:00:35.110> transparent

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
to save PNG files with transparent

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.590 
to save PNG files with transparent
background

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:01:13.390 

you

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.150 

next<00:01:14.150> we<00:01:14.270> will<00:01:14.390> save<00:01:14.660> each<00:01:14.930> part<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.590> banjee

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
next we will save each part is a banjee

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.870 
next we will save each part is a banjee
file

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:41.310 

you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.040 

let's<00:01:41.950> run<00:01:42.160> animation<00:01:42.700> software<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.690> make

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
let's run animation software and make

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.540 
let's run animation software and make
first<00:01:44.410> frame<00:01:44.800> animated<00:01:45.730> sprite

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.720 

Lord<00:01:51.880> all<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.450> textures<00:01:52.930> one<00:01:53.440> by<00:01:53.680> one<00:01:53.950> and

Lord all the textures one by one and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:03.260 
Lord all the textures one by one and
then<00:01:55.090> we'll<00:01:55.570> make<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.840> first<00:01:56.290> frame

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.850 
in the next tutorial I will show you how
to<00:05:24.620> animate<00:05:25.010> this<00:05:25.400> model
