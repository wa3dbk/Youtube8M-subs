00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.800 
let's convert all of these items into
the<00:02:19.740> cache<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.280> yeah<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the cache and yeah there you have it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.900 
the cache and yeah there you have it
this<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> final<00:02:22.560> result<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:23.880> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this is the final result and actually I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.430 
this is the final result and actually I
cannot<00:02:24.210> see<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.600> cache<00:02:24.780> because<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.260> haven't

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
cannot see the cache because I haven't

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.070 
cannot see the cache because I haven't
sold<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.950> items<00:02:26.280> yet<00:02:26.520> but<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.540> guessing<00:02:27.930> it's

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
sold the items yet but I'm guessing it's

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.200
