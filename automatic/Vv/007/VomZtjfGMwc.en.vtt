00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.320
 Hello to you all as the beasts program 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.659
 about who people are today and leads 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.330
 spotted eublefar ziggy and speak for 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.650
 him i am eugenia thymine 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.750
 childhood is that happy time when 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.940
 night running away from the toilet, and is happy that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.920
 you are not eaten animals do not laugh 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.850
 this joke is not at all because they have 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.039
 no sense of humor 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.600
 a world animal acts is such 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.520
 tough couple when even your own 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.769
 parents can let me live to see 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.510
 adulthood infante op or murder 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.730
 cubs including their own 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.190
 in animals and quite ordinary thing we 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.530
 people with silence are so terrible for us 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.249
 children are holy animals like you at all 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.399
 you can 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:46.989
 but in the meantime, personally in the cannon if 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.449
 take a closer look and here we are now 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.579
 let's look first the dangers begin 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.289
 threaten cubs still in the womb 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.120
 Here, for example, zebra to 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.769
 escape from her pursuing predator 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.629
 can abort not directly on the run 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.960
 born child and so 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.909
 run away well such children serve mare 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 easier yes actually the wolves are fed 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.990
 in this case, the cub sacrifice for 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.970
 saving the life of an adult animal 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.190
 because the adult's life for the species 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.170
 always more valuable than baby life 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.060
 especially not born for us goods 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.720
 it sounds awful but if you look at 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.000
 statistics 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 abortions are not even for the purpose of saving just 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 make life easier it becomes clear 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.740
 that zebra in this plan we are very 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.750
 jumped 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.130
 besides their own mothers of childhood can 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.470
 radically spoil the coming 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.090
 relatives of public animals they 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.100
 generally are the most popular 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.080
 source of fungicide here for example 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.000
 look at the prairie dogs in such 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.900
 the rest is quite nice Georgians 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.030
 squirrel family 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.740
 Dogs do not live in large colonies in 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.630
 for security reasons all one 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.540
 relatives excellent alert system 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.310
 external threat beauty but the main 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.640
 danger lurks cubs inside 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.130
 colonies mother grows babies in the department 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 inari and leaves her only on at on 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.510
 own feeding and here it is 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.000
 its time like sister 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.790
 which neighbors on rails 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.550
 already age can get to her and 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.190
 strangle it and another nephew of 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.740
 opportunities we have it because children 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.840
 it is not only the flowers of life but also 30-40 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.320
 gram in nutrient easily digestible 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.740
 protein for her now is very important a 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.690
 press the nursing mother but extra 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.060
 the piquant situation gives what is in it 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.980
 it's about time but young people can 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.970
 get another doggy and thin out there 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.459
 her brood 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.780
 and quite possibly it will be mother only 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.090
 that killed a cub Shakespeare all 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.580
 competition for resources primarily for 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.550
 eating these are my magic kids must 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.470
 good to eat and not someone else but if 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.120
 the situation with food 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.170
 critical mother can eat her 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.760
 children herself 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.800
 Well, in general, it will also be enough 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.170
 logical because losing these she 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 just give birth to new ones but if the cubs 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.520
 your parents will be left without anything 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.350
 does not shine in human translation 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.750
 sound first put on your oxygen 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.090
 mask on themselves and then on the river 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.650
 I am of course sometimes an animal very 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.110
 selflessly protects his own 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.360
 progeny but if they do it at the cost 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.660
 own life from the perspective of this 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.940
 file besides infante cit can be 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.549
 provoked by stress but for example 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.290
 pets cats mittens and 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.290
 fish and with developed parent 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.790
 by instinct they often 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 eat their offspring and do it already 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.200
 not at all but hunger but simply because 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.180
 that well, that's all zadolbali watch 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.950
 sometimes in similar stressful situations 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.720
 mother dooms her hereditary 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.820
 death is not actively dangerous and just 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.440
 refusing to feed him and human 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.900
 analogue of such behavior postpartum 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.290
 depression with maternal reduction 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.650
 instinct denied child and 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.719
 all that and another popular her motive 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.849
 ends yes this is genetic selection this 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.969
 only my genes have to run here or che 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.549
 you are still popular with harem species 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.409
 such as lions and gorillas and another country 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.780
 among the singles there are bears 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.849
 lemmings and sometimes infante qi just 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.799
 regulates the desired ratio of hair 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.120
 for example in some species of ants 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.409
 prints get rid of newborns 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.010
 males and in india and china the opposite yes 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.590
 the kids 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.720
 no damn harsh and would like to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.940
 tell you cute kids it's all terrible 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.979
 sad but completely independent of 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.900
 your behavior so act like 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.630
 want because anyway already for that 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.210
 that Oriental but unfortunately even here 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.460
 not everything is so easy here look at 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.220
 baboon baboons social structure and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.240
 side as close as possible to 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.759
 primitive human community 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.800
 so here is when in harem babu minutes 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.860
 new hosts begin 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.720
 infante but selective at all 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.520
 little cubs that are still hanging on 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.120
 mother does not particularly manifest itself 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.039
 new males usually don't touch and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.560
 grown up babies who have already learned 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.080
 rules of hierarchical behavior are all here 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.970
 these are the complex rituals of dominant eyes 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.949
 don't look with your teeth 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.070
 indulge and all that they are also not 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.710
 touch but the cubs are middle aged 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.389
 which are quite active and motivated 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.610
 to communicate with adults but still 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.070
 have not learned the rules of the communication tour here they are 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.889
 just fall under the distribution that's just 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.010
 because they do not know how to behave and the angles in 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.440
 no savannah but chief biological 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.870
 sense of crowns yes of course prevention 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.159
 overpopulation when conditions 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.349
 just not designed for that amount 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.690
 individuals and a further increase in the number 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.900
 can just bring here in the new world 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.840
 does the whole population have nature 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.850
 some more humane 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.340
 renate you infinite prices some other 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.949
 ways to control the size of a species 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.490
 of course there are as many as 2 1 this 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.840
 asexuality order challenging 2 this 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.400
 homosexuality that is if u 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.830
 animals account ali gay parade they 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 were held under the motto give children 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.919
 chance 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.680
 but animals have no gay parades because 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:57.030
 they all understood so well with you 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.030
 It was all like beasts yet 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.639
 as
