keep<00:01:32.430> with<00:01:32.579> natural<00:01:33.000> colors<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.990> with

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
keep with natural colors don't go with

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
keep with natural colors don't go with
tones<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.770> are<00:01:34.799> obvious<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> Purple's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360

blues pinks those kind of families just

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.380 
blues pinks those kind of families just
because<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.710> look<00:01:41.430> fake<00:01:41.700> even<00:01:42.299> if

because they really look fake even if

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.149 
because they really look fake even if
they<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> rabbit<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.470> look<00:01:43.680> fake<00:01:43.860> so
