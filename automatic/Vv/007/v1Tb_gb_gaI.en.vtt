00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.700
 one in the s 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.060
 Rome Heiligendamm around and have to Kühlungsborn right up to the coast 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.319
 and were then tracked 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.629
 of police boats and Holger they have seen this with their own eyes or the 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.619
 Helicopter camera whose pictures we are currently watching for percent 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.259
 Just tell a little bit more about what happened in each case 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.679
 is and why it was even possible that this would be so close it is 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.119
 Part of it all was already a very spectacular action that is there 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.779
 has played right under our eyes 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.659
 "We finally saw life as the end of all this action when 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.269
 the boats are indeed from Heiligendamm got there 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.130
 trying to pass too long a petition that was prevented by 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.270
 the federal police 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 with those Aldi Wersen vehicles who used them in the 20 tours 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.910
 Percent inflatable boats and also a larger speedboat of the Federal Police 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.200
 what was used here and then directly behind our 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.090
 Back in Kühlungsborn, the boats were applied or it is one 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.300
 not exactly squeamish it was a boat capsized 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.820
 some Greenpeace activists are also overboard 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.110
 there was probably greenpeace information, especially since it was 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.820
 injured for the hard to know who does not care about the police has to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.640
 not voiced but it was already a spectacular action the Greenpeace there 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.549
 has been successful with previously said it was until 11 Bothe 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.430
 to have learned to invade this Security Council in the right way 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:18.780
 Keyword Holger 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.670
 around 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 they are more afraid of describing them as the safeguards on them 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.170
 look and whether it is plausible 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.090
 that itself was also used by the Greenpeace, in fact 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.740
 may or may not have been treated tactics 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.560
 was applied by traders 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.710
 So because the security zone he is very large, which goes far more than ten 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.130
 Kilometers to the open sea and also to both sides left and right or 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.370
 east and west of the venue 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.850
 it is a hard to imagine that the boats penetrated from the high seas 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 Seals of the seas are seasons of boats that he becomes security cell the area 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.460
 monitored from the air is monitored by the Navy and just by the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.740
 Police were supervised so unimaginably unthinkable seems the more plausible 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.500
 Possibility to say that the boats 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 In the exclusion zone on land per cent of water brought wondering were rumbled 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.450
 maybe a few sympathizers were hidden and then inside 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.460
 the exclusion zone went out to the open sea and then tried 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.970
 next to land in Heiligendamm what did not succeed but ultimately 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.220
 landed here before 50 9 percent so what would then speak for a very very 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.220
 long-planned long in advance planned no 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.609
 Plan b he Greenpeace People who have a feeling are obviously leading 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:33.069
 effective to maybe give a few words Holger offered himself with percent 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.389
 Wanted to be in the police was also better on duty today 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.470
 such amount strong and fast 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.740
 Percent special boats came back to use they are partly the same 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.449
 Inflatables with fixed construction the engines have up to 57 HP strong 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.669
 So the marriage can go a tremendous speed and was driven 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.609
 that's why Datterich was also good at costing Greenpeace 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.220
 Grote 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.030
 im catching up then also pölten a boat is yes make that in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.920
 Television pictures indirectly seen about that shared with Butt or Dangers 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.620
 So that was already enthralling of how to see each other again every day 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 Agenda sets the same picture vividly offers her Selma this 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.870
 To import pictures 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.619
 Aldi has on what has happened 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.999
 Hamborn's look together for about a minute you can see the pictures 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:17.689
 11 red flags Greenpeace 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.119
 so it managed in this they restricted areas 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.509
 then we are entering 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:26.509
 pursued by Pierer and messengers 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.870
 she is dating 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.140
 the police raced action presented facts presented company 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.500
 very clearly and clearly with our police what you expressed 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.380
 that we have to protect the PC here there are restricted areas here 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.499
 before Heiligendamm or Servant in the distance around Heiligendamm 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.289
 Accordingly, we drive the corresponding vehicles at about one percent 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.340
 after all, we bring to the summit 51 percent or water police 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.430
 Use that is not just a little bit about the back of the 

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:57.979
 Water Police supported in others 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:02.429
 While we are talking here, the dead man first came to the net in Speyer 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:06.989
 the sexy Weiskopf not yet solid but also Greenpeace member percent 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.369
 Thank you for learning that both of you are here in this debate 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
 I was firm that was the question to her the country shown in this action 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.180
 we demonstrated for 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.600
 the climate protection and have called on the 8 heads of government on tombs 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.070
 want to act with a petition finally acting and 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.990
 Percent ambitious goals to actually agree percent the situation is yes 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.020
 The political situation is often completely open 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.270
 A very weak compromise that really does not help the climate 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.699
 or actually percent more, she decides how to lower the target 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.470
 Co2 emissions by 30 percent by 2020
