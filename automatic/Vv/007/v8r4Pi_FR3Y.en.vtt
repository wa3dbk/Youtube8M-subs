00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.190 
I mean the best way to spray your screws
is<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.729> whatever<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.390> take<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> off<00:02:03.900> you're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
doing a big project just put it back on

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560 
doing a big project just put it back on
cause<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.290> damaged<00:02:08.149> then<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
cause I can't get damaged then at the

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.790 
cause I can't get damaged then at the
bottom<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:09.990> gonna<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.350> disconnect

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
bottom you're gonna have to disconnect

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.640 
bottom you're gonna have to disconnect
it<00:02:10.979> from<00:02:11.009> your<00:02:11.250> spark<00:02:11.520> plug<00:02:11.760> should<00:02:12.470> come<00:02:13.470> off

just before time there's no head gasket

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.350 
just before time there's no head gasket
I<00:02:29.040> took<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.370> off<00:02:29.489> when<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.790> went<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.239> get

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.930 
to the two different spots you here is
just<00:03:19.670> engine<00:03:20.600> basically<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:22.430> gotta<00:03:22.580> clean<00:03:22.820> all

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
just engine basically we gotta clean all

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.720 
just engine basically we gotta clean all
that<00:03:22.970> material<00:03:23.330> off<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.530> I'll<00:03:24.950> show<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730

that material off and I'll show you it
up<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.900> bit<00:03:27.650> batter<00:03:27.890> zoom<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:29.030> still

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
up in a bit batter zoom it's still

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.640 
up in a bit batter zoom it's still
pretty<00:03:29.390> good<00:03:29.600> it<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.020> still<00:03:30.350> see<00:03:30.530> the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
pretty good it you can still see the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.140 
pretty good it you can still see the
cross-hatching<00:03:31.100> in<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.760> think<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:32.000> guys

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
cross-hatching in it I think you guys

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.370 
cross-hatching in it I think you guys
can<00:03:32.360> see<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.570> don't<00:03:32.660> know<00:03:32.810> if<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.990> camera<00:03:33.320> will

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
can see I don't know if the camera will

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
can see I don't know if the camera will
focus<00:03:33.530> in<00:03:33.950> pretty<00:03:34.310> good<00:03:34.550> but<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.660> walls

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
focus in pretty good but and the walls

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.790 
focus in pretty good but and the walls
you<00:03:36.350> can<00:03:36.530> see<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:39.380> can<00:03:39.500> see<00:03:39.680> the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
you can see you can see the

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.320 
you can see you can see the
cross-hatching<00:03:40.250> still<00:03:40.760> and<00:03:41.030> it's<00:03:41.150> in<00:03:41.240> pretty

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
cross-hatching still and it's in pretty

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.690 
cross-hatching still and it's in pretty
good<00:03:41.480> condition<00:03:41.630> there<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.620> no<00:03:42.890> scoring<00:03:43.310> in<00:03:43.580> it

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
good condition there is no scoring in it

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.410 
good condition there is no scoring in it
but<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:45.110> wanted<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.620> this<00:03:45.800> for

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
but I just wanted to do this for

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.160 
but I just wanted to do this for
educational<00:03:47.420> purpose<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.080> I'm

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
educational purpose and because I'm

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.810 
educational purpose and because I'm
losing<00:03:48.470> compression<00:03:48.860> for<00:03:49.010> some<00:03:49.160> reason<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:49.790> I

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
losing compression for some reason so I

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.150 
losing compression for some reason so I
might<00:03:50.090> as<00:03:50.240> well<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:51.530> didn't<00:03:51.680> cost<00:03:51.800> me<00:03:51.980> too

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
might as well and it didn't cost me too

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.640 
might as well and it didn't cost me too
much<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.370> yeah<00:03:52.930> okay<00:03:53.930> now<00:03:54.080> we<00:03:54.140> can<00:03:54.290> stand<00:03:54.500> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
much so yeah okay now we can stand the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.920 
much so yeah okay now we can stand the
engine<00:03:54.950> up<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.130> we<00:03:55.490> can<00:03:55.670> take<00:03:55.880> off<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.480> bolts

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
engine up and we can take off the bolts

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.390 
engine up and we can take off the bolts
that<00:03:57.020> are<00:03:57.080> holding<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.470> crankcase<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:58.130> and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
that are holding the crankcase on and

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.760 
that are holding the crankcase on and
they're<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.210> in<00:03:59.420> hidden<00:04:00.080> in<00:04:00.230> you'll<00:04:00.440> find

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
they're just in hidden in you'll find

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.510 
they're just in hidden in you'll find
them<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.510> are<00:04:02.510> ten<00:04:03.260> millimeter<00:04:03.770> but<00:04:04.250> they're

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
them and are ten millimeter but they're

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.300 
them and are ten millimeter but they're
for<00:04:05.360> using<00:04:05.600> an<00:04:05.900> impact<00:04:06.710> you're<00:04:06.950> going<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.190> have

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
for using an impact you're going to have

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.630 
for using an impact you're going to have
to<00:04:07.460> use<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:08.980> 3/8<00:04:09.980> impact<00:04:10.520> or<00:04:10.820> just<00:04:12.490> downgrade<00:04:13.490> or

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
to use a 3/8 impact or just downgrade or

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:33.930 
to use a 3/8 impact or just downgrade or
something<00:04:14.860> get<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.010> cord<00:04:16.370> out<00:04:16.549> and<00:04:19.420> one<00:04:32.800> six

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
something get the cord out and one six

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.580 
something get the cord out and one six
okay<00:04:34.940> so<00:04:35.000> once<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.510> got<00:04:35.660> all<00:04:35.690> those<00:04:36.020> the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
okay so once you got all those the

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.960 
okay so once you got all those the
reason<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.920> say<00:04:37.100> you<00:04:37.160> should<00:04:37.340> use<00:04:37.490> a<00:04:37.520> magnet

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
reason I say you should use a magnet

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.700 
reason I say you should use a magnet
it'd<00:04:38.090> be<00:04:38.330> much<00:04:38.480> easier<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.960> just<00:04:39.170> go<00:04:39.350> like<00:04:39.470> that

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
it'd be much easier to just go like that

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.060 
it'd be much easier to just go like that
and<00:04:40.010> pull<00:04:40.730> them<00:04:40.880> all<00:04:41.060> out<00:04:41.440> why<00:04:42.440> is<00:04:42.500> there<00:04:42.680> screw

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
and pull them all out why is there screw

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.900 
and pull them all out why is there screw
on<00:04:43.220> there<00:04:43.450> there<00:04:44.650> there<00:04:45.650> there<00:04:46.390> there<00:04:47.650> and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
on there there there there there and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.380 
on there there there there there and
there

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
there

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.760 
there
now<00:04:51.260> you<00:04:51.320> can<00:04:51.500> put<00:04:51.650> those<00:04:51.800> in<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:52.040> magnetic<00:04:52.340> tray

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.930 

and<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.919> should<00:04:58.070> just<00:04:58.130> be<00:04:58.250> able<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.520> sign<00:04:58.790> it

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
and you should just be able to sign it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.640 
and you should just be able to sign it
note<00:04:59.390> if<00:04:59.600> you're<00:04:59.870> just<00:05:00.020> doing<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.440> three

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
note if you're just doing the three

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.710 
note if you're just doing the three
build<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.980> drained<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.310> oil<00:05:01.370> before<00:05:01.730> so<00:05:02.630> you

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
build I drained the oil before so you

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.750 
build I drained the oil before so you
guys<00:05:02.870> should<00:05:03.020> do<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.230> same<00:05:03.440> thing<00:05:03.680> or<00:05:03.860> you're

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
guys should do the same thing or you're

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.909 
guys should do the same thing or you're
gonna<00:05:04.880> lose<00:05:05.120> parts<00:05:05.450> everywhere<00:05:05.690> let's<00:05:06.680> just

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
gonna lose parts everywhere let's just

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:07.810 
gonna lose parts everywhere let's just
slide<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.310> off

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
slide it off

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.660 
slide it off
come<00:05:08.420> might<00:05:09.350> want<00:05:09.560> a<00:05:09.620> wiggly<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.190> see<00:05:10.400> it

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
come might want a wiggly you see it

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.000 
come might want a wiggly you see it
still<00:05:10.970> has<00:05:11.000> oil<00:05:11.510> in<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.810> but<00:05:12.650> that's<00:05:12.830> no<00:05:12.980> big

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
still has oil in it but that's no big

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.000 
still has oil in it but that's no big
deal

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
deal

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.050 
deal
alright<00:05:16.010> so<00:05:16.130> they<00:05:16.220> might<00:05:16.400> be<00:05:16.550> on<00:05:16.640> a<00:05:16.670> little

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
alright so they might be on a little

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.410 
alright so they might be on a little
tight<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:17.470> just<00:05:18.490> make<00:05:19.490> sure<00:05:19.670> it's<00:05:19.790> all<00:05:19.850> loosen

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
tight but just make sure it's all loosen

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.570 
tight but just make sure it's all loosen
I<00:05:20.600> was<00:05:21.500> up<00:05:21.650> late<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:24.440> just<00:05:24.710> you're<00:05:25.340> gonna<00:05:25.400> have

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
I was up late so just you're gonna have

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.180 
I was up late so just you're gonna have
to<00:05:25.670> use<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.850> quarter<00:05:26.060> in<00:05:26.240> traffic<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:27.190> another

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
to use a quarter in traffic this another

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.270 
to use a quarter in traffic this another
one<00:05:28.550> will<00:05:28.700> fit<00:05:28.940> in<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.650> will<00:05:30.710> take<00:05:31.070> some

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
one will fit in and I will take some

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.950 
one will fit in and I will take some
time<00:05:31.460> because<00:05:31.580> it's<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:31.940> really<00:05:32.060> tight<00:05:32.360> space<00:05:32.690> I

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
time because it's a really tight space I

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.130 
time because it's a really tight space I
guess<00:05:33.550> did<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.670> get<00:05:34.790> a<00:05:34.820> loose<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:35.690> cap<00:05:35.930> will

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
guess did you get a loose the cap will

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.870 
guess did you get a loose the cap will
fall<00:05:36.350> out<00:05:36.380> like<00:05:36.950> that

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
fall out like that

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.660 
fall out like that
you<00:05:38.780> don't<00:05:38.960> lose<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.440> screws<00:05:39.800> where<00:05:40.400> did<00:05:40.550> this

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 
you don't lose the screws where did this

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:50.500 
you don't lose the screws where did this
one<00:05:40.880> under<00:05:41.660> here<00:05:43.810> that's<00:05:44.810> on<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.170> ground<00:05:49.510> put

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
one under here that's on the ground put

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.590 
one under here that's on the ground put
it<00:05:50.600> over<00:05:50.720> there<00:05:51.080> not<00:05:51.620> to<00:05:51.830> get<00:05:51.950> the<00:05:52.070> piston<00:05:52.460> out

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
it over there not to get the piston out

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.550 
it over there not to get the piston out
what<00:05:53.600> you're<00:05:53.720> gonna<00:05:53.810> have<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.050> do<00:05:54.200> is<00:05:54.350> get<00:05:54.530> a

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
what you're gonna have to do is get a

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.310 
what you're gonna have to do is get a
wooden<00:05:54.860> dowel<00:05:55.220> or<00:05:55.520> something<00:05:56.030> or<00:05:56.630> if<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.170> can

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
wooden dowel or something or if you can

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.080 
wooden dowel or something or if you can
just<00:05:57.470> push<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.710> with<00:05:57.890> your<00:05:58.040> hand<00:05:58.370> but<00:05:59.030> you

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
just push it with your hand but you

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.450 
just push it with your hand but you
can't<00:05:59.530> and<00:06:00.530> you<00:06:00.650> just<00:06:00.770> want<00:06:00.950> to<00:06:00.980> push<00:06:01.190> it<00:06:01.340> off

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
can't and you just want to push it off

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.790 
can't and you just want to push it off
actually<00:06:02.330> I<00:06:02.630> can<00:06:02.930> get<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.140> with<00:06:03.230> your<00:06:03.350> hand<00:06:03.590> I

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
actually I can get it with your hand I

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.280 
actually I can get it with your hand I
don't<00:06:04.190> want<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:04.460> push<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.760> your<00:06:04.880> hardest

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.360 

friend<00:06:12.290> this<00:06:12.350> actually<00:06:12.650> a<00:06:12.680> good<00:06:12.770> idea<00:06:12.830> if<00:06:13.190> you

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
friend this actually a good idea if you

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.040 
friend this actually a good idea if you
have<00:06:13.400> room<00:06:13.940> you<00:06:14.180> can<00:06:14.330> remove<00:06:14.540> your<00:06:14.660> crankshaft

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
have room you can remove your crankshaft

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.710 
have room you can remove your crankshaft
just<00:06:15.500> like<00:06:15.650> that<00:06:15.940> just<00:06:16.940> put<00:06:17.120> that<00:06:17.210> on<00:06:17.270> inside

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
just like that just put that on inside

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.150 
just like that just put that on inside
but<00:06:17.750> now<00:06:18.050> it's<00:06:18.200> easier<00:06:18.560> to<00:06:18.680> get<00:06:18.830> your<00:06:18.950> piston

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
but now it's easier to get your piston

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.850 
but now it's easier to get your piston
up<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.970> I<00:06:23.060> should<00:06:23.240> just<00:06:23.390> pop<00:06:23.570> right<00:06:23.630> out<00:06:24.140> you

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
up and I should just pop right out you

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.770 
up and I should just pop right out you
got<00:06:25.010> a<00:06:25.040> bear<00:06:25.370> block<00:06:27.730> and<00:06:28.730> you<00:06:29.030> just<00:06:29.210> basically

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
got a bear block and you just basically

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.600 
got a bear block and you just basically
pretty<00:06:30.320> much<00:06:30.410> tore<00:06:30.770> your<00:06:30.890> whole<00:06:31.040> engine<00:06:31.370> apart

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
pretty much tore your whole engine apart

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.640 
pretty much tore your whole engine apart
we<00:06:31.790> just<00:06:31.970> have<00:06:32.060> to<00:06:32.150> get<00:06:32.270> the<00:06:32.390> valves<00:06:32.720> out<00:06:32.900> and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
we just have to get the valves out and

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.540 
we just have to get the valves out and
then<00:06:34.040> we're<00:06:34.220> done

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
then we're done

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
then we're done
so<00:06:35.150> yeah<00:06:35.300> let's<00:06:35.600> get<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:36.200> the<00:06:36.320> valves<00:06:36.650> now<00:06:37.570> want

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
so yeah let's get to the valves now want

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.140 
so yeah let's get to the valves now want
to<00:06:38.600> put<00:06:38.750> your<00:06:38.900> piston<00:06:39.320> and<00:06:39.550> crankshaft<00:06:40.550> off<00:06:40.970> to

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
to put your piston and crankshaft off to

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.170 
to put your piston and crankshaft off to
the<00:06:41.240> side

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180
