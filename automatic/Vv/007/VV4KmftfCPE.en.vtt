 McDonald's Germany is joining 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.950
 selected citizens on 100% of them 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.049
 mental beef why actually 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 to the peculiarities the origin of the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.710
 To explain emmentalers we make one 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.710
 travel through bavarian farms 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.550
 because mainly in southern Germany 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 the animals are in small and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.250
 kept small business like 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.320
 his family business in the fifth

 generation the cows are his 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.309
 Great-grandfather threatened and since then I have the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 race anchored in us and remains 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.129
 also francs 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.980
 They work together for several generations 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.440
 The company is located here 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.700
 southern oberbayern my 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.120
 Family business explored here and meter 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 height 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.789
 every bar says on other features im 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 space Simmental lexicon originally so 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.390
 Simmental Fleckvieh double use 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.160
 Let this be quiet and driven first 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
 meat at a very high level 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 The typical spot on the cow is a red one 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 covered cow with best pigment on 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 The eyes have about a life 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.939
 weight of 700 kilos 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.229
 she is also a tough cow or 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.979
 conscious animal that means the cows are 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.409
 healthier 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.689
 like other races they are all breed 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.950
 comes from the swiss alps and 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.360
 This owes its origin 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.630
 robustness and the balanced 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.369
 The character over 150 years ago was the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 Special cattle in the Swiss Simmental 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.130
 discovered and came across the alps 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.030
 Bavaria 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.829
 The march took a full 30 days 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.049
 This breed was in the whole of southern Germany 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.590
 desired and one changed the name into 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.509
 Fleckvieh today is at the breeding 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.149
 especially made sure that the cows 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.880
 give good milk and your meat best 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.079
 That's why quality is the Fleckvieh 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.340
 internationally in great demand 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.170
 descendants of our cows they 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
 meanwhile all over the world too 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.710
 but now find like five degrees here 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.650
 minus in snow or at 35 degrees in 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.410
 South must always be the same to this 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.459
 environmental conditions household and if it is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.050
 the cows are doing well 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.069
 works council like these are very important 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.069
 moments like
