00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.029
 Hi guys 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.650
 Today I wish you first of all 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.130
 Happy Easter to you and yours 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.930
 lots of families have arrived and emails 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.029
 who requested something more on the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.980
 weak world is also ours 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.399
 friend riina wanted to deepen 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.520
 the topic and here I am looking for 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.429
 explain everything then let's start from 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.359
 assumed to explain this to you 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:50.870
 what I thought of dividing the world 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.920
 of perfumes in three sets year the first 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.319
 together they are chemical perfumes 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.530
 commercial that we find for example 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:05.360
 lemons then we have the world of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:10.070
 natural and niche fragrances such as the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:14.890
 chrysalis and the ever-selective world of de 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.860
 molecular and the first world then here 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 for example we want to create a perfume 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.440
 what tastes of pink then we use 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:32.930
 chemical raw materials to represent 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.750
 a natural fragrance then in this 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.320
 case we use molecules that 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 chemically recreate the smell of the rose 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.280
 in the natural world in perfumeries 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 artistic in the chrysalis we want 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.520
 create a rose scent 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.670
 what the perfumers do instead 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.560
 collect millions of petals of 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.160
 rose are macerated and is created 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.430
 perfume that smells of rose then creates a 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.420
 excuse me then use materials 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.840
 subjects 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.930
 natural raw materials to create perfumes 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 the molecular world is a natural 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.520
 very special very special world 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.000
 then where today we talk about marcoules 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.709
 it is therefore a centric who is precisely me 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.160
 you first requested then 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.940
 we distinguish two things so the malls is 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 cool 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:49.870
 in this case of 0 1 from the eccentric 0 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:55.690
 2 the molecular scents the mall and cool 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:01.330
 they only contain perfumed molecules 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:05.630
 practically the nose fell in love 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:10.130
 of the smell that these did in nature 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.859
 molecules can enrique what it has 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:19.690
 fact has joined these molecules already 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:23.380
 scented natural raw materials 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.140
 so this is the first distinction between 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.600
 they enrique and mol is cool 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.340
 today we talk about ash enrique 02 mine 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.299
 favorite 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:42.350
 first to note that the packaging 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:45.950
 and the pieces are very modern indeed 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.390
 all do not contain do not have heels 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.540
 so you will find them so then centric 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.329
 0 2 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.620
 then the simple 02 we said that 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:04.670
 it has the molecular part plus the matter 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.080
 first the raw material in this case is 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.820
 musk and inventiveness 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.580
 but we get to the part immediately 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:19.220
 molecular because it is the molecular part 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:23.700
 it's so fascinating because the part 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.980
 molecular is the instinctive part is the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:32.910
 part that in contact with our skin 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:36.210
 smells spring therefore because it attracts 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:40.230
 so much the world of molecular le 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:44.460
 people because they are not traceable to 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.920
 nothing so killing it says but what 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.700
 taste pain but where it comes from not 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.380
 they can understand that perfume is not 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.710
 tied to nothing 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.700
 it is a smell that we personalize the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:03.390
 our skin characterizes it 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.120
 therefore a world of sensuality opens up 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.540
 fair hormones ie people who come 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.750
 attracted to what our skin a 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.880
 then, with these fragrances, it creates 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.780
 everyone asks us but what perfume to the ma 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.360
 what is it because they can't understand a 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:26.400
 cataloging it does not know of something that the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:30.690
 our nose recognizes is pure sensuality 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.820
 although instinct is not rational it fails 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.330
 not even to say good smell of 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.860
 lily of the valley that smells of good orange 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:43.350
 no sandalwood vanilla then smells 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.030
 I believe this is really the key 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.390
 of their success 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:52.410
 the fact that they are indecipherable and that 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.780
 if you want a smell like that you only have it then 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.780
 molecular with the cool rhythm stents 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.480
 fails to replace them with others 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.720
 if you want this 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:07.120
 use this if you want a family instead 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.280
 you can have 100 vanilla facets 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.240
 and choose the one that when you go 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.780
 more 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.580
 here these odors are only found 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.940
 in this world 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.030
 plus they are excellent enhancers 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:28.630
 also of other perfumes therefore combined 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:32.630
 to others you will miss the persistence 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:34.820
 I hope I have explained it well 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.640
 I invite you to try them I invite you to 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.680
 fall in love with this world 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.200
 wonderful and all information 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.630
 I'm always on our site 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.350
 still wishes for a happy Easter ciao 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.350
 boys
