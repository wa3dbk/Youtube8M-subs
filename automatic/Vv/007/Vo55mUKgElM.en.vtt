into three distinct groups one is

the<00:02:14.069> functionality<00:02:14.760> which<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:16.080> are<00:02:16.110> giving

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the functionality which is we are giving

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.770 
the functionality which is we are giving
as<00:02:16.560> much<00:02:17.130> as<00:02:17.370> 50%<00:02:18.209> marks<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.099> also<00:02:20.099> the

as much as 50% marks and also the

ceramic blanketing is being given a 25%
marks<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> judges<00:02:26.580> will

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
marks and I think that the judges will

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
marks and I think that the judges will
be<00:02:27.209> totally<00:02:27.690> fair<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.140> clear<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.860> their

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
be totally fair and clear in their

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.110 
be totally fair and clear in their
judgment<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.780> may<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> best<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.440> in

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
judgment and may the best look of in

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.180 
judgment and may the best look of in
what<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.239> important<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.110> see<00:02:34.410> when<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
what is important then you see when the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.650 
what is important then you see when the
whole<00:02:35.370> thing<00:02:35.580> should<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.790> uniformly<00:02:36.390> red

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
whole thing should be uniformly red

moment you see a black spot that's the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
moment you see a black spot that's the
time<00:02:39.180> where<00:02:39.420> they<00:02:39.600> were<00:02:39.630> full<00:02:40.019> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.410> the
