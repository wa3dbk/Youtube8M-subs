00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.959 
hey ladies today I did a look which I
consider<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.469> very<00:00:10.469> date<00:00:10.800> appropriate<00:00:11.639> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
consider to be very date appropriate and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.299 
consider to be very date appropriate and
since<00:00:12.450> valentine's<00:00:12.540> Day<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.380> coming<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:14.070> I
