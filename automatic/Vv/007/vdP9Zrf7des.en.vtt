00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
spring right here kind of somewhat G

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.190 
spring right here kind of somewhat G
shaped<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.149> guess<00:01:23.329> if<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.600> want<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.810> call<00:01:24.049> it

this end that sticks out at me put in

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.330 
this end that sticks out at me put in
this<00:01:29.960> angle<00:01:30.229> there<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.409> go<00:01:30.530> see<00:01:31.130> how<00:01:31.219> it

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
this angle there you go see how it

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.490 
this angle there you go see how it
sticks<00:01:31.490> out<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.729> little<00:01:31.790> bit

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
sticks out a little bit

sticks out a little bit
alright<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.619> part<00:01:33.799> goes<00:01:33.920> ahead<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.189> sticks

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
alright that part goes ahead and sticks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.310 
alright that part goes ahead and sticks
out<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.719> want<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.899> go<00:01:35.960> ahead<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.200> set<00:01:36.290> it

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
so that that part that's pointing up

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.520 
so that that part that's pointing up
toward<00:01:38.180> you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.820 
alright so come on focus yes
anyways<00:02:04.750> I'm<00:02:04.990> sure<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:05.320> see<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.440> spring

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
anyways I'm sure you can see that spring

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
anyways I'm sure you can see that spring
so<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.870> piece<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.229> here<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.979> have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
so with this piece right here you have

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110 
so with this piece right here you have
the<00:02:11.280> big<00:02:12.280> hole<00:02:12.400> right<00:02:12.550> here<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.850> go<00:02:12.940> into

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the big hole right here that go into

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.910 
the big hole right here that go into
this<00:02:13.330> pin<00:02:13.750> right<00:02:13.960> over<00:02:14.770> here<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.050> just

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
this pin right over here I know you just

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.280 
this pin right over here I know you just
pin<00:02:18.130> right<00:02:18.280> over<00:02:18.340> here<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:20.020> wanna<00:02:20.170> go

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
pin right over here so you wanna go

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.320 
pin right over here so you wanna go
ahead<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.640> try<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.820> line<00:02:21.970> them<00:02:22.060> at<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.240> same

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
ahead and try and line them at the same

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.970 
ahead and try and line them at the same
time<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.660> want<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.710> piece<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
time you want the the piece of the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710 
time you want the the piece of the
spring<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.400> go<00:02:24.520> through<00:02:24.700> this<00:02:24.820> hole<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.600> want

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
spring to go through this hole you want

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.420 
spring to go through this hole you want
this<00:02:25.840> pin<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.350> through<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:26.560> hole<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:27.310> can

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
this pin to go through this hole you can

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.960 
this pin to go through this hole you can
get<00:02:27.520> them<00:02:27.610> lined<00:02:27.760> up<00:02:27.850> perfectly<00:02:29.730> good<00:02:30.730> right

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
get them lined up perfectly good right

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.360 
get them lined up perfectly good right
so<00:02:31.480> both<00:02:31.630> things<00:02:31.690> are<00:02:31.960> in<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.140> holes<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.590> then

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
so both things are in the holes so then

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.180 
so both things are in the holes so then
you<00:02:33.940> want<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.990> end<00:02:35.200> right<00:02:35.260> here<00:02:35.650> into

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you want to get this end right here into

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.750 
you want to get this end right here into
this<00:02:36.700> notch<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.440> just<00:02:38.680> go<00:02:38.740> ahead<00:02:38.770> up<00:02:39.460> a<00:02:39.550> little

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
this notch so just go ahead up a little

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.520 
this notch so just go ahead up a little
pressure<00:02:39.910> on<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.090> spring<00:02:40.330> you'll<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.380> in

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
pressure on the spring you'll not get in

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.290 
pressure on the spring you'll not get in
there<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:44.140> try<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.380> keep<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.680> there

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
there just try to keep it in there

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.120 
there just try to keep it in there
this<00:02:46.300> videos<00:02:46.600> gonna<00:02:47.140> look<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.410> lot<00:02:47.530> easier<00:02:47.920> but

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
this videos gonna look a lot easier but

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.190 
this videos gonna look a lot easier but
it's<00:02:48.310> really<00:02:48.459> hard<00:02:48.700> after<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.450> all<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
it's really hard after you have all the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.140 
it's really hard after you have all the
parts<00:02:50.410> once<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.220> have<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> know<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:54.150> power

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
parts once you have you know the power

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.750 
parts once you have you know the power
tube<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.290> hammer<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.190> all<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.459> springs

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
tube and the hammer and all the springs

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.600 
tube and the hammer and all the springs
back<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.660> connects<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.770> stock<00:03:00.190> or

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
back here that connects to the stock or

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.220 
back here that connects to the stock or
back<00:03:01.240> piece<00:03:01.510> back<00:03:02.440> cap<00:03:02.680> back<00:03:03.130> here<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:04.230> it's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
back piece back cap back here just it's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.280 
back piece back cap back here just it's
gonna<00:03:05.350> be<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.530> little<00:03:05.650> more<00:03:05.800> difficult<00:03:06.190> but<00:03:06.580> um

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
gonna be a little more difficult but um

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.720 
gonna be a little more difficult but um
you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.680> course<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.370> sear<00:03:09.550> spring

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
you know of course the the sear spring

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.850 
you know of course the the sear spring
and<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> sear<00:03:10.360> have<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.900> get<00:03:11.019> all<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.500> you

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and a sear have to get all that in you

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.160 
and a sear have to get all that in you
know<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.180> would<00:03:13.360> be<00:03:13.450> probably<00:03:13.840> last

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
know I think this would be probably last

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.140 
know I think this would be probably last
you'll<00:03:14.620> go<00:03:14.739> ahead<00:03:14.950> you'll<00:03:15.550> get<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:15.970> there

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
you'll go ahead you'll get it in there

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.090 
you'll go ahead you'll get it in there
see<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.780> stuck<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.260> place<00:03:17.410> it's<00:03:17.650> not<00:03:17.709> popping

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
see a stuck in place it's not popping

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
see a stuck in place it's not popping
out<00:03:18.190> as<00:03:18.940> spring<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.269> on<00:03:19.750> there<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.170> little

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
out as spring is on there just a little

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.380 
out as spring is on there just a little
bit<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.739> pressure<00:03:20.970> that's<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.090> there<00:03:22.209> just<00:03:22.300> a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
bit of pressure that's on there just a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.800 
bit of pressure that's on there just a
little<00:03:22.630> bit<00:03:22.720> pressure<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.620> you'll<00:03:24.370> go<00:03:24.489> ahead

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
little bit pressure so you'll go ahead

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.520 
little bit pressure so you'll go ahead
you<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.019> other<00:03:26.200> receiver<00:03:26.519> half<00:03:28.530> line

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
you get the other receiver half line

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.090 
you get the other receiver half line
them<00:03:29.709> up<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:35.680> right

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
them up all right

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.220 
them up all right
after<00:03:36.940> you<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.300> there<00:03:37.450> before<00:03:37.900> you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
after you get it on there before you

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.530 
after you get it on there before you
tighten<00:03:38.560> any<00:03:38.800> bolts<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:40.090> wanna<00:03:40.239> make<00:03:40.390> sure

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
tighten any bolts up you wanna make sure

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.320 
tighten any bolts up you wanna make sure
it's<00:03:41.320> working<00:03:41.580> if<00:03:42.580> it's<00:03:42.730> not<00:03:42.850> working<00:03:43.030> this

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
it's working if it's not working this

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.270 
it's working if it's not working this
spring<00:03:43.540> will<00:03:43.660> not<00:03:43.780> come<00:03:43.959> up<00:03:44.140> if<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:44.950> just<00:03:45.070> stays

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
spring will not come up if it just stays

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.540 
spring will not come up if it just stays
down<00:03:45.550> or<00:03:45.940> flops<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.510> know<00:03:46.630> then<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:48.280> spring

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
down or flops you know then that spring

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.100 
down or flops you know then that spring
wasn't<00:03:48.820> put<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:49.030> right<00:03:49.180> or<00:03:49.690> something<00:03:49.959> went

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
wasn't put in right or something went

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.660 
wasn't put in right or something went
wrong<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.950> basically<00:03:51.190> want<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.459> be<00:03:51.519> able<00:03:51.580> to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
wrong so basically want to be able to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.300 
wrong so basically want to be able to
push<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.150> it<00:03:52.269> comes<00:03:52.420> right<00:03:52.480> back<00:03:52.810> up

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
push that and it comes right back up

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.970 
push that and it comes right back up
alright<00:03:54.480> now<00:03:55.480> another<00:03:55.780> thing<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.019> um<00:03:56.380> some

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
alright now another thing is um some

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.650 
alright now another thing is um some
people<00:03:57.130> don't<00:03:57.280> realize<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.760> that<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.420> boat

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
people don't realize is that the boat

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.300 
people don't realize is that the boat
that<00:03:58.690> goes<00:03:59.019> right<00:03:59.410> here<00:03:59.470> that'll<00:03:59.890> hold<00:04:00.130> both
