came<00:01:24.020> up<00:01:24.050> with<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.440> program<00:01:25.010> where<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
came up with this program where the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.910 
came up with this program where the
students<00:01:25.940> would<00:01:26.060> come<00:01:26.120> out<00:01:26.660> here<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.260> enhance

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
students would come out here and enhance

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
students would come out here and enhance
our<00:01:28.220> marsh<00:01:28.490> habitat<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:29.330> some<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:29.630> the

our marsh habitat for some of the
animals<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.290> are<00:01:30.380> here<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.490> do<00:01:31.640> anything

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
animals that are here we do anything

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.140 
animals that are here we do anything
from<00:01:32.270> cleanups<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.830> our<00:01:33.980> Marsh<00:01:34.310> enhancement

boxes<00:01:37.880> we<00:01:38.180> place<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.659> out<00:01:38.870> here<00:01:39.200> and<00:01:39.409> they

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
boxes we place them out here and they

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.130 
boxes we place them out here and they
even<00:01:40.070> go<00:01:40.370> as<00:01:40.520> far<00:01:40.550> as<00:01:40.970> developing<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.750> canoe

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
even go as far as developing a canoe

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.380 
even go as far as developing a canoe
trail<00:01:42.470> because<00:01:43.310> then<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.880> know<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.060> want

trail because then you know you want

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.430 
trail because then you know you want
people<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.930> see<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.890> work<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.159> you've<00:01:46.520> done

trees loss of old trees have caused a

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.179 
trees loss of old trees have caused a

swallows<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.269> what<00:02:32.480> we've<00:02:32.659> done<00:02:32.689> is<00:02:32.930> we've

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
swallows so what we've done is we've

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.339 
swallows so what we've done is we've
added<00:02:33.769> these<00:02:34.519> boxes<00:02:35.150> out<00:02:35.359> in<00:02:35.659> the<00:02:35.780> fields<00:02:36.260> and

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
added these boxes out in the fields and

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.649 
added these boxes out in the fields and
our<00:02:36.859> tree<00:02:37.219> swallows<00:02:37.670> have<00:02:37.879> come<00:02:38.180> back<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.569> it

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
our tree swallows have come back and it

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.360 
our tree swallows have come back and it
just<00:02:38.689> seems<00:02:39.079> that<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.409> more<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.859> these<00:02:40.040> nest

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
just seems that the more of these nest

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.539 
just seems that the more of these nest
boxes<00:02:40.849> we<00:02:41.030> put<00:02:41.329> out<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.379> more<00:02:42.620> tree<00:02:42.980> swallows

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
boxes we put out the more tree swallows

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.179 
boxes we put out the more tree swallows
we<00:02:43.879> have<00:02:44.150> it's<00:02:44.780> more<00:02:45.019> hands<00:02:45.409> on<00:02:45.500> definitely

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
we have it's more hands on definitely

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.819 
we have it's more hands on definitely
they've<00:02:47.060> brought<00:02:47.239> bottles<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.870> take<00:02:48.260> samples

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
they've brought bottles to take samples

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.520 
they've brought bottles to take samples
of<00:02:49.189> different<00:02:49.579> areas<00:02:49.840> samples<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.959> water<00:02:51.200> back

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
of different areas samples of water back

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.740 
of different areas samples of water back
to<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.549> building<00:02:52.879> and<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.599> going<00:02:53.720> to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
to to the building and we're going to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.809 
to to the building and we're going to
check<00:02:53.989> for<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.560> critters<00:02:54.889> and<00:02:55.159> microbes

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
check for little critters and microbes

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.170 
check for little critters and microbes
inside<00:02:56.359> the<00:02:57.169> water<00:02:57.379> and<00:02:57.730> check<00:02:58.730> out<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.000> water

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
inside the water and check out the water

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.780 
inside the water and check out the water
quality<00:02:59.510> as<00:02:59.900> well<00:03:00.169> so<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:00.889> hands-on<00:03:01.400> it's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
quality as well so it's hands-on it's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.759 
quality as well so it's hands-on it's
not<00:03:02.030> just<00:03:02.090> reading<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.659> from<00:03:02.810> books<00:03:03.019> it's<00:03:03.290> not

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
not just reading it from books it's not

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.369 
not just reading it from books it's not
doing<00:03:04.129> a<00:03:04.250> lab<00:03:04.459> where<00:03:04.959> we're<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.200> lab

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
doing a lab where we're in the lab

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.709 
doing a lab where we're in the lab
setting<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.549> lab<00:03:07.730> right<00:03:08.060> out<00:03:08.239> here<00:03:08.269> I

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
setting this is the lab right out here I

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.629 
setting this is the lab right out here I
think<00:03:09.500> it's<00:03:09.590> definitely<00:03:09.919> a<00:03:10.189> very<00:03:10.219> worthwhile

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
think it's definitely a very worthwhile

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.119 
think it's definitely a very worthwhile
project<00:03:11.450> it's<00:03:12.049> definitely<00:03:12.439> a<00:03:12.469> different

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
project it's definitely a different

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.069 
project it's definitely a different
experience<00:03:13.189> one<00:03:13.969> that<00:03:14.209> some<00:03:14.659> people<00:03:14.900> don't

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
experience one that some people don't

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.839 
experience one that some people don't
get<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.319> chance<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.709> experience<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:16.760> it's

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
get a chance to experience and it's

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.690 
get a chance to experience and it's
actually<00:03:17.000> pretty<00:03:17.510> fun<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.900> know<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.519> out<00:03:19.519> on

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 
bigger than you are I've always been

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.800 
bigger than you are I've always been
very<00:03:46.310> interested<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:47.030> science<00:03:47.479> and<00:03:47.659> learning

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
very interested in science and learning

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.349 
very interested in science and learning
because<00:03:48.650> science<00:03:49.609> is<00:03:49.699> of<00:03:49.819> course<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.090> study<00:03:50.299> of

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
because science is of course a study of

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.509 
because science is of course a study of
knowledge<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.019> my<00:03:51.620> favorite<00:03:51.889> thing<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.159> do<00:03:52.280> is

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
knowledge and my favorite thing to do is

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.369 
knowledge and my favorite thing to do is
learn<00:03:53.060> so<00:03:53.989> I'm<00:03:54.919> hoping<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:55.669> in<00:03:56.419> the<00:03:56.750> future<00:03:57.139> I

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
learn so I'm hoping with in the future I

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.839 
learn so I'm hoping with in the future I
can<00:03:57.620> do<00:03:57.769> things<00:03:58.159> with<00:03:58.310> environmental

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
can do things with environmental

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.179 
can do things with environmental
sciences<00:03:59.449> little<00:04:00.139> projects<00:04:00.560> like<00:04:00.709> this<00:04:00.859> all

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
sciences little projects like this all

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.649 
sciences little projects like this all
around<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.519> country<00:04:01.669> will<00:04:02.000> eventually<00:04:02.389> raise

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
around the country will eventually raise

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.149 
around the country will eventually raise
the<00:04:02.840> awareness<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.500> federal<00:04:03.799> government

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
the awareness of the federal government

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.099 
the awareness of the federal government
and<00:04:04.280> hopefully<00:04:05.030> they'll<00:04:05.629> be<00:04:05.659> able<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.989> see

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
and hopefully they'll be able to see

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.689 
and hopefully they'll be able to see
things<00:04:06.229> on<00:04:06.409> a<00:04:06.439> global<00:04:06.709> level<00:04:06.829> not<00:04:07.310> just<00:04:07.340> on<00:04:07.669> a

for our actions and through science we

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.949 
for our actions and through science we

things going on in the world now like

global warming and all the pollution
going<00:04:24.110> on<00:04:24.260> if<00:04:24.650> you're<00:04:24.949> aware<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.580> impact

going on if you're aware of the impact

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.310 
going on if you're aware of the impact
you're<00:04:26.090> making<00:04:26.360> on<00:04:26.449> your<00:04:26.600> environment<00:04:27.199> you're

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
you're making on your environment you're

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.290 
you're making on your environment you're
more<00:04:27.470> likely<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:27.889> help<00:04:28.070> out<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.729> children

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
more likely to help out and if children

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.030 
more likely to help out and if children
learn<00:04:29.660> about<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.110> i<00:04:30.169> think<00:04:30.260> they<00:04:30.590> are<00:04:30.620> more

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
learn about it i think they are more

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.379 
learn about it i think they are more
likely<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.370> make<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.610> difference<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:32.270> it's

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
likely to make a difference so it's

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.550 
likely to make a difference so it's
important<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.780> have<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.930> program<00:04:33.169> like<00:04:33.350> this

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
important to have a program like this

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.290 
important to have a program like this
that<00:04:33.889> makes<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.760> know<00:04:34.850> helping<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
that makes you know helping the

that makes you know helping the
environment<00:04:35.389> fun<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.440> joins<00:04:37.070> makes

environment fun and it joins makes

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.159 
environment fun and it joins makes
