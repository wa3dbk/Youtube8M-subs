00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.100
 using finished shoes or using 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.710

 I cut out now I put a leg and draw 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.260
 the bend on the platform is such a bend 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.330

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 platform ideally sat on a leg 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.729
 wrap gum around legs 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.570
 stitching back needle 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.149
 I cut off the excess and try on the leg 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.190
 what I did repeat twice 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.250

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 I put gum on scissors for my fingers 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 do not burn and stick sock repeat 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 for each shoe and that's what I have 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.539

 although niki three years set for four years 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.020

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.369
