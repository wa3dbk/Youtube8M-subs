00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
that one dipping got me the whole way

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.700 
that one dipping got me the whole way
around<00:06:25.330> there<00:06:25.720> now<00:06:28.050> you<00:06:29.050> you'll<00:06:29.440> use

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
around there now you you'll use

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.500 
around there now you you'll use
considerably<00:06:30.400> more<00:06:30.670> on<00:06:30.880> your<00:06:31.030> first<00:06:31.270> and

considerably more on your first and
second<00:06:31.870> coats<00:06:32.490> but<00:06:33.490> when<00:06:33.640> you<00:06:33.730> get<00:06:33.850> up<00:06:33.910> to<00:06:34.120> this

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
second coats but when you get up to this

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.160 
second coats but when you get up to this
stage<00:06:35.610> it's<00:06:36.610> just<00:06:36.700> really<00:06:37.600> easy<00:06:37.660> won't<00:06:38.020> get

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
stage it's just really easy won't get

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:44.390 
stage it's just really easy won't get
any<00:06:38.350> runs<00:06:39.720> get<00:06:40.720> any<00:06:40.840> hits<00:06:41.110> her<00:06:41.260> energy<00:06:41.740> on

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.750 

there<00:06:45.930> I'm<00:06:46.930> sure<00:06:47.170> you<00:06:47.260> get<00:06:47.380> the<00:06:47.500> grooves<00:06:47.860> but

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
there I'm sure you get the grooves but

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.890 
there I'm sure you get the grooves but
you'll<00:06:48.880> get<00:06:49.000> a<00:06:49.060> little<00:06:49.210> buildup<00:06:49.660> in<00:06:49.780> these

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
you'll get a little buildup in these

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.850 
you'll get a little buildup in these
corners<00:06:50.380> but<00:06:50.590> that's<00:06:50.830> that's<00:06:51.250> acceptable

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
corners but that's that's acceptable

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.690 
corners but that's that's acceptable
it's<00:06:53.860> not<00:06:53.980> noticeable<00:06:56.130> and<00:06:57.130> you<00:06:57.280> might<00:06:57.460> say

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
it's not noticeable and you might say

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.400 
it's not noticeable and you might say

get through and fix them if I find one
now<00:07:35.020> this<00:07:35.260> would<00:07:35.440> be<00:07:35.470> a<00:07:35.590> major<00:07:35.830> undertaking

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.630 
now this would be a major undertaking

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.420 
now this would be a major undertaking
because<00:07:37.630> you'd<00:07:38.020> have<00:07:38.200> to<00:07:38.320> get<00:07:38.440> down<00:07:38.620> and

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430 
because you'd have to get down and

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.270 
because you'd have to get down and
you'd<00:07:39.580> have<00:07:39.730> to<00:07:39.820> blend<00:07:40.180> in<00:07:40.470> the<00:07:41.470> five<00:07:41.710> six<00:07:42.040> cuts

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
you'd have to blend in the five six cuts

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.160 
you'd have to blend in the five six cuts
here<00:07:42.520> that<00:07:42.700> you're<00:07:42.850> putting<00:07:43.060> on<00:07:46.050> so<00:07:47.050> this
