00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
yep all week helping the guys out a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.490 
yep all week helping the guys out a
little<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.150> seeing<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.690> checking

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
little and just seeing the checking

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
little and just seeing the checking
their<00:02:16.710> protocols<00:02:17.580> are<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.820> place<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.390> ensure

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
their protocols are in place to ensure

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.870 
their protocols are in place to ensure
that<00:02:18.780> every<00:02:19.440> boat<00:02:19.650> goes<00:02:20.310> through<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> same

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
that every boat goes through the same

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.940 
that every boat goes through the same
process<00:02:21.390> when<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.690> gets<00:02:21.840> put<00:02:22.020> together<00:02:22.140> but

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
process when it gets put together but

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.470 
process when it gets put together but
see<00:02:23.070> what<00:02:23.280> while<00:02:23.580> he's<00:02:23.730> tip<00:02:23.940> down<00:02:24.120> let's<00:02:24.330> hop

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
see what while he's tip down let's hop

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.590 
see what while he's tip down let's hop
on<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.810> have<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> look<00:02:24.990> around<00:02:25.230> right<00:02:25.410> here

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
on and have a look around right here

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.880 
on and have a look around right here
so<00:02:27.600> let's<00:02:27.750> start<00:02:27.990> out<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> bow<00:02:28.650> huh

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
so let's start out up on the bow huh

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.370 
so let's start out up on the bow huh
yeah<00:02:29.340> check<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.880> out<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.540> pointy<00:02:31.260> end

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
yeah check it out from the pointy end

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.760 
yeah check it out from the pointy end
first<00:02:31.470> ten<00:02:32.370> jobs<00:02:32.580> amazing<00:02:33.060> isn't<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.740> over<00:02:34.740> a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
first ten jobs amazing isn't it over a

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
first ten jobs amazing isn't it over a
lot<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.160> detail<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.610> on<00:02:36.030> I've<00:02:36.270> seen<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
lot of detail going on I've seen to the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.120 
lot of detail going on I've seen to the
graphics<00:02:37.790> how<00:02:38.790> come<00:02:39.000> these<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.450> high<00:02:40.130> one

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
graphics how come these are so high one

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.290 
graphics how come these are so high one
foot<00:02:42.030> shocks<00:02:42.300> yeah<00:02:43.100> -<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.610> offer<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.970> lot<00:02:45.180> of

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
foot shocks yeah - they offer a lot of

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.970 
foot shocks yeah - they offer a lot of
structural<00:02:45.750> support<00:02:46.200> right<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.710> actually

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
structural support right and actually

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.010 
structural support right and actually
inside<00:02:47.580> here<00:02:47.850> you've<00:02:48.030> got<00:02:48.180> quite<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.690> lot<00:02:48.960> of

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
inside here you've got quite a lot of

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.140 
inside here you've got quite a lot of
ropes<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.950> there's<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> lot<00:02:50.280> less<00:02:50.580> things<00:02:50.850> to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
ropes so there's a lot less things to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.500 
ropes so there's a lot less things to
see<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.110> trip<00:02:52.410> over<00:02:53.030> apart<00:02:54.030> from<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.330> big

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
see the trip over apart from this big

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.690 
see the trip over apart from this big
thing<00:02:54.690> but<00:02:55.350> also<00:02:55.590> when<00:02:55.980> you're<00:02:56.130> moving<00:02:56.250> sails

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
thing but also when you're moving sails

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
thing but also when you're moving sails
around<00:02:57.090> up<00:02:57.270> here<00:02:57.410> less<00:02:58.410> chance<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.920> jamming

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
around up here less chance of jamming

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.310 
around up here less chance of jamming
some<00:02:59.550> rope<00:02:59.730> you<00:02:59.970> talked<00:03:00.450> about<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.930> content

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
some rope you talked about that content

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.500 
some rope you talked about that content
exactly<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.640> dagger<00:03:02.880> boards<00:03:03.270> have<00:03:03.420> an

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
exactly the dagger boards have an

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.060 
exactly the dagger boards have an
interesting<00:03:04.050> attachment<00:03:04.590> point<00:03:04.830> for<00:03:04.890> the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
interesting attachment point for the

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.710 
interesting attachment point for the
lift<00:03:05.280> line<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> middle<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
lift line it's in the middle of the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.660 
lift line it's in the middle of the
board<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.920> does<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.370> make<00:03:08.520> it

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
board and what this does is make it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.760 
board and what this does is make it
easier<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.270> raise<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.810> lower<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.290> board<00:03:10.530> you

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
easier to raise and lower the board you

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.250 
easier to raise and lower the board you
see<00:03:11.070> there's<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.400> guide<00:03:11.880> where<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:12.959> line

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
see there's a guide where this line

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.710 
see there's a guide where this line
actually<00:03:13.500> falls<00:03:13.950> into<00:03:14.190> okay<00:03:14.940> now<00:03:15.180> actually

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
actually falls into okay now actually

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.020 
actually falls into okay now actually
when<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.200> lift<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.620> up<00:03:16.709> use<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> direct

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
when you lift it up use a direct

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.210 
when you lift it up use a direct
vertical<00:03:18.630> pull<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.470> you're<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:19.709> pulling<00:03:20.010> out

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
vertical pull so you're not pulling out

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.150 
vertical pull so you're not pulling out
a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.900 
a
will<00:03:22.160> that<00:03:22.250> actually<00:03:22.550> ever<00:03:22.640> end<00:03:22.820> up

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
will that actually ever end up

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.000 
will that actually ever end up
underwater<00:03:23.180> no<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.410> water<00:03:24.620> line<00:03:24.830> will

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
underwater no so the water line will

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.500 
underwater no so the water line will
actually<00:03:25.310> being<00:03:25.520> very<00:03:25.730> close<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.210> this<00:03:26.300> point

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
actually being very close to this point

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.390 
actually being very close to this point
that<00:03:26.720> they<00:03:26.840> will<00:03:26.990> never<00:03:27.140> end<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.530> under<00:03:28.250> the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that they will never end up under the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.190 
that they will never end up under the
under<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> boat<00:03:29.060> itself<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.810> I'll<00:03:32.900> sue<00:03:33.050> this

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
under the boat itself so I'll sue this

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.600 
under the boat itself so I'll sue this
pit<00:03:33.410> area<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.830> what<00:03:33.950> makes<00:03:34.130> me<00:03:34.280> want<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.460> be<00:03:34.580> a

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
pit area it what makes me want to be a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.580 
pit area it what makes me want to be a
pit<00:03:34.820> man<00:03:35.000> well<00:03:35.480> makes<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.990> because<00:03:36.410> you're

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
pit man well makes you because you're

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.410 
pit man well makes you because you're
under<00:03:36.890> your<00:03:37.010> camera<00:03:37.340> dome<00:03:37.520> here<00:03:37.730> exactly

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
under your camera dome here exactly

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.500 
under your camera dome here exactly
no<00:03:38.630> but<00:03:38.810> this<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.860> actually<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:41.000> seen<00:03:41.240> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
no but this is actually it was seen a
