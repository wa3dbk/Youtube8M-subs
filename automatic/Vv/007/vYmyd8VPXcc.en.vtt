00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.950
 x 11 keep the video blog 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.469
 Just take a look and calculate the following five 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.630
 tasks in the head when they are 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.920
 finished note the stopped 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.920
 time and then click on next 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.270
 Attention opened and so it is still 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.100
 faster and easier part of the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 that is because they can already out come 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 the task gather to observe 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 Please follow the rule of the hundreds 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.170
 and one of you just reads off the one 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.370
 Teeth are the result of the cross sum 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:59.460
 So 304 and reading is already there 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 and then calculate three +4 and on 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.920
 say end 70 while you can speak 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.640
 you already calculate 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:20.450
 Another example 71x11 is 701 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:26.869
 and and now seven plus one is 80 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.869
 and now you is 32 x 11 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.330
 correct 3 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.760
 52 53 x 11 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 right 5 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.110
 80 is 62 x 11 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.090
 right 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 and 80 and 72x11 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.769
 also correct 792 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.629
 If you want you can still do it now 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.510
 the next five tasks in the 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:27.250
 they then hold the arithmetic 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.250
 video blog and stop again the time 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.140
 close, they were faster than at the beginning 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 is the cross sum greater than 10 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:58.780
 then you make a transfer 805 and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:03:02.410
 read and 905 and say eight +5 now 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.970
 calculate and then say 30 that is the 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:19.620
 three of the 13th 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:25.560
 another example 77 x 11 is correct 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:30.270
 807 and because he's seven plus 7 more than 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:37.530
 49 this is the four of the 14th 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.530
 and now you is 66 x 11 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.370
 right 726 58 x 11 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:09.450
 right 638 if you have a bigger number 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.380
 then want to multiply by eleven 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.090
 again use the plus lupe and 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:28.220
 let these in the spirit over the number 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:42.930
 run and read the result from 1.11 +0 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:49.560
 is equal to 10 + 3 is equal to 33 +4 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:55.440
 seven at the same time and finally the 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:05:11.270
 Four and the result is still complete 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:14.720
 a large number 22 2 plus 4 64 plus 1 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.720
 to 5 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:33.190
 One plus 8 is nine and it's still in the end 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:37.690
 the eight unfinished and now you 31,000 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.690
 124x11 is 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:06:11.540
 right 34 2 3 6 and 4 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:11.540
 and another 810,000 is 135 x 11 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:41.600
 right 8 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:43.759
 9 11 485 like the whole then still with 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.960
 Transmitted works experience in 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.860
 count my book without calculator 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.389
 further information on the topic 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.130
