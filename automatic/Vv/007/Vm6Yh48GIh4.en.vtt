00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.960
The wind is too strong to go fishing.. better to organize for another day

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.140
I show you my Arbalete

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:36.160
SEATEC SNAKE 90cm - 6.5mm shaft - Double circular 16mm Bands

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.540
Two advices

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:13.240
Put a protection on the ogiva in order to avoid the scratches on the arbalete body during the firing

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:26.740
If the shot is too low, put the plate of the shaft in the bottom, in this way the direction will be corrected
