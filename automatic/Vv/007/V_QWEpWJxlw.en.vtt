I<00:02:03.310> wasn't<00:02:03.880> fully<00:02:04.030> comfortable<00:02:04.270> at<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.600> time

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
I wasn't fully comfortable at the time

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.870 
I wasn't fully comfortable at the time
so<00:02:04.990> I<00:02:05.020> got<00:02:05.230> micro<00:02:05.590> braids<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.160> then<00:02:06.460> every<00:02:06.760> now

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
so I got micro braids and then every now

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.430 
so I got micro braids and then every now
and<00:02:07.120> then<00:02:07.210> I<00:02:07.450> would<00:02:07.600> eat<00:02:07.720> extensions<00:02:08.259> but

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
and then I would eat extensions but

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680 
and then I would eat extensions but
generally<00:02:08.979> I<00:02:09.280> would<00:02:09.580> get<00:02:09.729> curly<00:02:10.090> extensions

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
generally I would get curly extensions

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.400 
generally I would get curly extensions
