00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.910 

so<00:00:53.850> first<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.960> have<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.379> safety<00:00:55.949> advice<00:00:58.309> just

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
so first we have some safety advice just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.710 
so first we have some safety advice just
plain<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> easy<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.790> produce<00:01:02.940> from<00:01:03.480> pure

water more powerful forces of nature as
we<00:01:13.679> will<00:01:13.830> show<00:01:14.039> you<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:19.369> all<00:01:20.369> right

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.280 

yeah

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.050 

sorry<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:37.690> let's<00:01:38.380> see<00:01:39.960> experiments<00:01:42.060> as

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
sorry all right let's see experiments as

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.350 
sorry all right let's see experiments as
this<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:47.650> what<00:01:47.979> Utah<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:49.330> a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
this well this is what Utah is a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520 
this well this is what Utah is a
constant<00:01:50.020> circular<00:01:50.920> flow<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:52.990> may<00:01:53.229> say

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
constant circular flow now you may say

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.150 
constant circular flow now you may say
water<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.369> precious<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.619> water<00:01:56.800> inside

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
water is precious but the water inside

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.910 
water is precious but the water inside
is<00:01:57.369> not<00:01:57.550> wasted<00:01:58.030> at<00:01:58.119> all<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.930> stays<00:01:59.410> within<00:01:59.770> the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
is not wasted at all it stays within the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.219 
is not wasted at all it stays within the
circuit<00:02:00.550> and<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:01.180> mean<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.720> am<00:02:02.470> water<00:02:02.740> game<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:05.140> we

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
circuit and a mean I am water game so we

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.219 
circuit and a mean I am water game so we
have<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.530> natural<00:02:05.770> product<00:02:06.190> water<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.940> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
have this natural product water that is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.080 
have this natural product water that is
disassociated<00:02:08.229> split<00:02:08.920> up<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.310> then<00:02:09.759> when<00:02:09.970> it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
disassociated split up and then when it

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.910 
disassociated split up and then when it
recombines<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:11.020> becomes<00:02:11.320> water<00:02:11.530> game

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
recombines and becomes water game

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.160 
recombines and becomes water game
producers<00:02:14.970> all<00:02:15.970> right<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
producers all right so it's really

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:39.090 
producers all right so it's really
interesting<00:02:20.440> DVD<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:22.180> tell<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.920> live

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
interesting DVD I can tell you we live

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.850 
interesting DVD I can tell you we live
in<00:02:39.250> challenging<00:02:39.280> times<00:02:40.440> people<00:02:41.440> will<00:02:41.560> find

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
in challenging times people will find

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.729 
in challenging times people will find
each<00:02:41.980> other<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.459> their<00:02:42.820> own<00:02:43.000> volition<00:02:43.739> people

each other of their own volition people

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.009 
each other of their own volition people
do<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.340> click<00:02:45.670> with<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.060> will<00:02:46.360> disappear

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
do not click with you will disappear

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.740 
do not click with you will disappear

others that resonate with you will find
you<00:02:49.959> like<00:02:50.560> a<00:02:50.590> miracle<00:02:51.160> here<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.090> will<00:02:52.330> show<00:02:52.510> you

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
you like a miracle here I will show you

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570 
you like a miracle here I will show you
how<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.019> approximately<00:02:53.709> measure<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.310> amount

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
how to approximately measure the amount

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.270 
how to approximately measure the amount
of<00:02:54.700> gas<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.269> making<00:02:55.799> this<00:02:56.799> is<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.190> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
of gas we're making this is just a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.300 
of gas we're making this is just a
bottle<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.730> markings<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.390> millimeters

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
bottle with markings and millimeters

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.740 
bottle with markings and millimeters
technicians<00:03:00.310> will<00:03:00.489> laugh<00:03:00.850> at<00:03:01.090> us<00:03:01.180> when<00:03:01.480> they

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
technicians will laugh at us when they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.320 
technicians will laugh at us when they
see<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.549> volume<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> gas

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
see this because the volume of the gas

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.410 
see this because the volume of the gas
amount<00:03:04.810> depends<00:03:05.350> on<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.709> temperature<00:03:06.420> this

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
amount depends on the temperature this

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.750 
amount depends on the temperature this
is<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.019> show<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.350> an<00:03:08.709> estimation<00:03:09.220> of<00:03:09.549> how

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
is just to show you an estimation of how

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.870 
is just to show you an estimation of how
much<00:03:09.970> gas<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.540> are<00:03:10.570> making<00:03:11.019> here<00:03:11.549> in<00:03:12.549> summer

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
much gas we are making here in summer

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.820 
much gas we are making here in summer
you<00:03:13.120> will<00:03:13.239> appear<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.900> get<00:03:14.080> more<00:03:14.320> guests<00:03:14.799> than

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
you will appear to get more guests than

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.280 
you will appear to get more guests than
in<00:03:15.040> winter<00:03:15.220> simply<00:03:16.000> because<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.510> gas<00:03:16.690> expands

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
in winter simply because the gas expands

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
in winter simply because the gas expands
more<00:03:17.799> when<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.220> is<00:03:18.370> warmer<00:03:21.030> I'm<00:03:22.030> counting<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
more when it is warmer I'm counting the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.259 
more when it is warmer I'm counting the
seconds<00:03:22.840> here<00:03:23.019> nine<00:03:23.739> seconds<00:03:24.310> for<00:03:24.579> half<00:03:25.120> a

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
seconds here nine seconds for half a

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.140 
seconds here nine seconds for half a
liter<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.660> gas<00:03:25.870> 18<00:03:26.829> seconds<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.549> one<00:03:27.700> liter<00:03:27.880> of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
liter of gas 18 seconds for one liter of

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.250 
liter of gas 18 seconds for one liter of
gas<00:03:28.440> perhaps<00:03:29.440> 15<00:03:30.010> seconds<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.390> 4<00:03:31.810> liters

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
gas perhaps 15 seconds that is 4 liters

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.780 
gas perhaps 15 seconds that is 4 liters
per<00:03:32.470> minute<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.680> see<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.610> how

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
per minute so you see it this is how

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.310 
per minute so you see it this is how
they<00:03:37.000> measure<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.660> gas<00:03:37.870> output<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:40.320> really

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
they measure the gas output and really

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590 
they measure the gas output and really
interesting<00:03:41.829> it's<00:03:41.980> really<00:03:42.400> from<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> Praxis

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
interesting it's really from the Praxis

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.790 
interesting it's really from the Praxis
no<00:03:44.320> no<00:03:44.680> Theory<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.750> show

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
no no Theory just show
