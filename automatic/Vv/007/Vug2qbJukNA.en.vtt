pay for a routine vision care and so we

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.130

is<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> those<00:01:14.610> factors<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is is one of those factors that you can

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.820 
is is one of those factors that you can
get<00:01:15.570> involved<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.960> changing<00:01:16.110> kids<00:01:16.409> lives<00:01:16.530> I

mean the statistics are very clear that

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.499 
mean the statistics are very clear that
that<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> kid<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.299> able<00:01:21.390> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
that if you can get a kid to be able to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359
