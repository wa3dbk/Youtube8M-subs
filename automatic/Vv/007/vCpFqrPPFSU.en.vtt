good great so yeah multum wolfer to
since<00:02:30.180> blotting<00:02:30.600> black<00:02:30.810> ops<00:02:31.050> sensitivity<00:02:31.620> um

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
since blotting black ops sensitivity um

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.010 
since blotting black ops sensitivity um
14<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.900> kind<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.320> 10<00:02:35.310> more<00:02:35.400> for<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
14 it's kind of like 10 more for to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.100 
14 it's kind of like 10 more for to
sensitivity<00:02:37.100> nine<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.700> yeah<00:02:39.510> nine<00:02:39.780> eight

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
sensitivity nine or so yeah nine eight

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.440 
sensitivity nine or so yeah nine eight
or<00:02:40.290> nine<00:02:40.470> somewhere<00:02:41.190> around<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.730> then

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
or nine somewhere around there and then

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020 
or nine somewhere around there and then
the<00:02:43.050> molar<00:02:43.230> damn<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.980> lower<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.640> gets

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the molar damn you go the lower it gets

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.050 
the molar damn you go the lower it gets
so<00:02:45.450> maybe<00:02:45.840> 10<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.500> kinda<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.860> seven<00:02:47.400> or<00:02:47.550> six

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
so maybe 10 is kinda like seven or six

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.570 
so maybe 10 is kinda like seven or six
or<00:02:48.480> even<00:02:48.540> six<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.500> don't<00:02:49.950> know<00:02:50.010> why<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.370> make

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
or even six I don't know why they make

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.560 
or even six I don't know why they make
it<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:50.880> probably<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.420> like

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it they probably want to be like

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.600 
it they probably want to be like
specific<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.500> because<00:02:52.980> maybe<00:02:53.130> some<00:02:53.459> other

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
specific so because maybe some other

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.300 
specific so because maybe some other
people<00:02:53.910> likes<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.360> like<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.680> changes

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
people likes it like just little changes

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.050 
people likes it like just little changes
and<00:02:56.520> they<00:02:56.580> decide<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:56.940> maybe<00:02:57.390> put<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and they decide to maybe put that in

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.060 
and they decide to maybe put that in

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.009 
MC and by the way when you have UAV and
you<00:03:34.860> use<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.030> die<00:03:36.120> when<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.840> use<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
you use it you don't die when you use it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.740 
you use it you don't die when you use it
you<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.380> actually<00:03:37.500> get<00:03:37.769> UAV<00:03:38.430> assists<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.600> when

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
you can actually get UAV assists so when

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.270 
you can actually get UAV assists so when
your<00:03:39.870> teammate<00:03:40.230> kill<00:03:40.470> someone<00:03:40.799> using<00:03:41.250> your

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
your teammate kill someone using your

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640 
your teammate kill someone using your
UAV<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.840> assists<00:03:43.200> for<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.500> but

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
UAV you actually get assists for it but

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.140 
UAV you actually get assists for it but
once<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.950> die<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.190> don't<00:03:44.430> get<00:03:44.640> anymore<00:03:44.820> so

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
once you die you don't get anymore so

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.479 
once you die you don't get anymore so
don't<00:03:45.360> die<00:03:46.019> when<00:03:46.590> when<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.920> use<00:03:47.160> your<00:03:47.250> UAV

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
don't die when when you use your UAV

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.210 
don't die when when you use your UAV
then<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.299> get<00:03:48.510> your<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.410> assists

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
then we can get your get the assists

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.910 
then we can get your get the assists

it wait actually I think does but yeah
you<00:05:08.770> get<00:05:08.919> less<00:05:09.100> recoil<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.760> increases<00:05:10.450> your

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
you get less recoil and increases your

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.070 
you get less recoil and increases your
accuracy<00:05:11.020> that's<00:05:11.830> how<00:05:11.980> good<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.340> is<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:13.080> right

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
accuracy that's how good it is and right

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.740 
accuracy that's how good it is and right
