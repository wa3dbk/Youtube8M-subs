00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
make our set and we're expecting our

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.760

hand<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> most<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> time<00:01:03.270> we'll<00:01:04.019> get<00:01:04.199> his

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
hand and most of the time we'll get his

hand and most of the time we'll get his
entire<00:01:04.680> stack<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:06.810> thinking

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
entire stack and so now you're thinking

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
entire stack and so now you're thinking
well<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.150> make<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
well that's all well and good we make a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
well that's all well and good we make a
boatload<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.960> chips<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.159> lucky<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
boatload of chips when we get lucky and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
boatload of chips when we get lucky and
hit<00:01:12.060> our<00:01:12.180> 5<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:12.960> about<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> times

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
hit our 5 but what about all the times

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
hit our 5 but what about all the times
that<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.130> hit<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> 5<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.150> have

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that we don't hit the 5 and we just have

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
that we don't hit the 5 and we just have
to<00:01:15.390> fold<00:01:15.770> doesn't<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.860> make<00:01:17.009> set<00:01:17.280> farming

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to fold doesn't that make set farming

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.440 
to fold doesn't that make set farming
pretty<00:01:18.360> costly<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> long<00:01:19.350> run<00:01:19.590> well<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pretty costly in the long run well it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.390 
pretty costly in the long run well it
turns<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.930> hit<00:01:22.080> our<00:01:22.110> hit<00:01:22.710> our<00:01:22.799> set<00:01:23.040> 11

percent of the time and that's more than

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.330

enough<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.689> set<00:01:28.080> farming<00:01:28.530> extremely

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
enough to make set farming extremely

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
don't take my word for it let's go

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
don't take my word for it let's go
through<00:01:33.420> through<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:33.750> simple<00:01:34.170> math<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
through through some simple math to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.030 
through through some simple math to
demonstrate<00:01:36.090> why<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> case<00:01:37.040> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
demonstrate why this is the case so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710

easy here we're suspicious our opponent
has<00:02:53.910> aces<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.590> always<00:02:55.770> fold<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.570> we<00:02:57.570> just

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
has aces so we always fold and we just

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.840 
has aces so we always fold and we just
lose<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.140> original<00:02:58.230> 80<00:02:58.830> from<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.460> preflop

making<00:03:06.240> a<00:03:06.330> nice<00:03:06.570> profit<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:07.350> 106<00:03:08.070> dollars<00:03:08.280> and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
a great idea really profitable but

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.440 
a great idea really profitable but

there's a hidden variable that could be

there's a hidden variable that could be

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
that can be disastrous if you're not

that can be disastrous if you're not

the background and it's stack size in
this<00:03:28.980> experiment<00:03:29.640> our<00:03:29.790> stack<00:03:30.060> sizes<00:03:30.330> were

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
this experiment our stack sizes were

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.010 
this experiment our stack sizes were
1,500<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:32.310> let's<00:03:32.520> look<00:03:32.700> at<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.240> terms<00:03:33.300> of

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
1,500 but let's look at that in terms of

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.550 
1,500 but let's look at that in terms of
the<00:03:34.140> size<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.830> original<00:03:35.040> raise<00:03:36.260> which<00:03:37.260> in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
our case is a hundred so the stack size

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.590 
our case is a hundred so the stack size
we<00:03:39.780> could<00:03:39.930> say<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.490> 15<00:03:41.490> times<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.120> original

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
we could say is 15 times that original

we could say is 15 times that original
raised<00:03:42.780> 15<00:03:43.650> R<00:03:43.920> where<00:03:44.400> R<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:45.690> hundred<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.760> what

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
raised 15 R where R is a hundred so what

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.690 
raised 15 R where R is a hundred so what

just five R or in other words 500 chips
what<00:03:57.630> will<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.080> our<00:03:58.200> experiment<00:03:58.860> well

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
what will that do to our experiment well

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.520 
what will that do to our experiment well
let's<00:03:59.850> take<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> look<00:04:00.330> up<00:04:00.570> here<00:04:01.140> at<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.320> top

just<00:04:07.410> making<00:04:07.709> 500<00:04:08.580> from<00:04:08.760> our<00:04:08.910> opponents<00:04:09.390> stack

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
just making 500 from our opponents stack

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.250 
just making 500 from our opponents stack
plus<00:04:10.350> 10<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.800> small<00:04:11.040> blind<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.930> we<00:04:13.050> call<00:04:13.230> it

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
plus 10 in the small blind so we call it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.670 
plus 10 in the small blind so we call it
510<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.540> when<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.630> don't<00:04:15.810> hit<00:04:16.080> our<00:04:16.169> said<00:04:16.470> well

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
510 and when we don't hit our said well

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.740 
510 and when we don't hit our said well
this<00:04:16.830> is<00:04:16.950> easy<00:04:17.100> we're<00:04:17.580> still<00:04:17.970> losing<00:04:18.419> the<00:04:18.510> same

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
this is easy we're still losing the same

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.250 
this is easy we're still losing the same
80<00:04:19.080> from<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.040> preflop<00:04:20.430> call<00:04:20.720> now<00:04:21.720> notice<00:04:22.080> we

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
80 from the preflop call now notice we

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.350 
80 from the preflop call now notice we
make<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> lot<00:04:22.890> less<00:04:22.919> money<00:04:23.250> when<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:24.180> hit<00:04:24.300> our

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
make a lot less money when we hit our

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.590 
make a lot less money when we hit our
set<00:04:25.010> but<00:04:26.010> we're<00:04:26.190> losing<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.790> same<00:04:27.000> amount<00:04:27.300> of

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
set but we're losing the same amount of

you're reeling you're thinking well okay
we<00:04:44.250> make<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> ton<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:44.910> money<00:04:45.180> when<00:04:45.720> stack<00:04:46.020> sizes

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
we make a ton of money when stack sizes

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.770 
we make a ton of money when stack sizes
are<00:04:46.560> 15<00:04:47.070> times<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.610> original<00:04:47.670> raise<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.450> we

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
are 15 times the original raise and we

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.900 
are 15 times the original raise and we
lose<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:48.990> little<00:04:49.170> bit<00:04:49.440> when<00:04:50.220> stack<00:04:50.460> sizes<00:04:50.790> are

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
lose a little bit when stack sizes are

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.580 
lose a little bit when stack sizes are
five<00:04:51.120> times<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.630> original<00:04:51.690> raise<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.380> what's

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
five times the original raise so what's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.240 
five times the original raise so what's
the<00:04:52.740> answer

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
the answer

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.610 
the answer
where's<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.120> threshold<00:04:54.690> we're<00:04:54.990> set<00:04:55.230> farming

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
where's the threshold we're set farming

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.030 
where's the threshold we're set farming
is<00:04:55.710> profitable<00:04:56.220> well<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:56.940> turns<00:04:57.180> out<00:04:57.800> for<00:04:58.800> set

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
is profitable well it turns out for set

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.250 
is profitable well it turns out for set
farming<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.490> make<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.880> money<00:05:00.260> your

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260

opponent's<00:05:01.740> stack<00:05:01.980> size<00:05:02.280> has<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.730> be<00:05:03.150> at<00:05:03.390> least

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
opponent's stack size has to be at least

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.430 
opponent's stack size has to be at least
seven<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.790> half<00:05:05.820> times<00:05:06.300> his<00:05:06.990> original
