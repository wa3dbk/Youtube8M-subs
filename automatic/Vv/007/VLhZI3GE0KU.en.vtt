00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.499 

previously<00:00:02.730> we<00:00:03.149> have<00:00:03.389> covered<00:00:04.759> some<00:00:05.759> Chinese

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
previously we have covered some Chinese

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.440 
previously we have covered some Chinese
characters<00:00:07.140> strokes<00:00:07.589> so<00:00:08.460> namely<00:00:08.970> they<00:00:09.300> are

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
characters strokes so namely they are

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:21.050 
characters strokes so namely they are
the<00:00:10.110> N<00:00:14.809> heung-soo<00:00:17.210> PA<00:00:19.699> na

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the N heung-soo PA na

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.599 
the N heung-soo PA na
so<00:00:21.949> that<00:00:23.060> horizontal<00:00:24.170> vertical<00:00:25.609> left's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so that horizontal vertical left's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.990 
so that horizontal vertical left's
length<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:28.230> slant<00:00:28.590> strokes<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
length and right slant strokes so

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.990 
length and right slant strokes so
example<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> N<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.610> since<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.759> cover

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
example for the N and since we cover

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
example for the N and since we cover
some<00:00:33.239> letters<00:00:33.630> some<00:00:34.079> numbers<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:36.980> we<00:00:37.980> have

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
some letters some numbers here we have

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.290 
some letters some numbers here we have
number<00:00:38.850> six<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.750> three<00:00:40.530> dots<00:00:41.100> three<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
number six that use three dots three to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.959 
number six that use three dots three to
end<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:44.510> horizontal<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.969> vertical

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
end and horizontal as and vertical

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.220 
end and horizontal as and vertical
together<00:00:48.920> mix<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.250> number<00:00:50.820> ten<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:52.190> then<00:00:54.230> we

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
together mix the number ten and then we

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.670 
together mix the number ten and then we
have<00:00:56.059> seven<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.300> starts<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:58.140> horizontal

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
have seven that starts with a horizontal

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.540 
have seven that starts with a horizontal
and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.820> vertical<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> band<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
and then a vertical with a band and

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.250 
and then a vertical with a band and
eight<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> good<00:01:03.420> example<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:04.379> both<00:01:05.450> PA<00:01:06.450> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
eight is a good example for both PA and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
eight is a good example for both PA and
na<00:01:08.180> left<00:01:09.200> slant<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.619> riceland<00:01:11.250> strokes<00:01:11.670> so

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
na left slant and riceland strokes so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.200 
na left slant and riceland strokes so
that's<00:01:13.700> left<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.350> right<00:01:16.350> strokes<00:01:17.210> riceland

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's left and right strokes riceland

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's left and right strokes riceland
strokes<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:19.080> eight<00:01:19.560> ba<00:01:20.509> Leo<00:01:21.740> XI<00:01:23.030> Chi<00:01:24.350> ba

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
strokes that's eight ba Leo XI Chi ba

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.580 
strokes that's eight ba Leo XI Chi ba
and<00:01:26.509> here<00:01:28.009> next<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.560> talk<00:01:31.560> about

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and here next we are going to talk about

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
and here next we are going to talk about
more<00:01:32.280> strokes<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.420> three

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
more strokes that we have one two three

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.580 
more strokes that we have one two three
four<00:01:36.900> five<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.570> basic<00:01:40.049> strokes<00:01:40.290> in

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
four five here and the basic strokes in

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
four five here and the basic strokes in
Chinese<00:01:41.400> characters<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.450> use<00:01:44.180> eight<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.479> them

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
Chinese characters we use eight of them

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.190 
Chinese characters we use eight of them
so<00:01:45.689> three<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.500> strokes<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.750> these<00:01:48.750> are

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so three more strokes but these are

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.520 
so three more strokes but these are
three<00:01:49.439> more<00:01:49.649> strokes<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.340> different<00:01:50.939> angles

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
three more strokes in different angles

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.940 
three more strokes in different angles
could<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.979> review<00:01:53.549> more<00:01:53.990> introduction<00:01:54.990> than

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
could be a review more introduction than

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
could be a review more introduction than
these<00:01:56.490> basic<00:01:57.180> strokes<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.170> covered<00:01:58.560> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
these basic strokes that we covered in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.810 
these basic strokes that we covered in
Heung<00:01:59.340> soo<00:01:59.369> PA<00:02:00.360> now
