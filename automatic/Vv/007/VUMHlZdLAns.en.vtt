I've<00:00:43.700> had<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.090> for<00:00:44.210> about<00:00:44.329> eight<00:00:44.630> years<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.290> I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
I've had it for about eight years and I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:34.690 

just<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.030> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:56.570 

you<00:02:35.700> can<00:02:35.880> see<00:02:37.970> I'm<00:02:38.970> starting<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.420> clean<00:02:39.720> up

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.730 

there<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.270> go<00:03:00.200> turn<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.350> over<00:03:03.320> do<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.380> same

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
there you go turn it over do the same

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:31.660 
there you go turn it over do the same
thing<00:03:26.180> last<00:03:27.180> time<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:28.310> serving<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:29.460> a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.370 

rollup<00:03:33.200> but<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:35.480> think<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.600> file<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.380> best

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
rollup but I think the file is the best

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:58.210 
rollup but I think the file is the best
more<00:03:40.380> controls

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:35.939 

go<00:03:58.760> against<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.330> cutting<00:03:59.690> surface

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:46.469 

just<00:04:36.949> like<00:04:37.130> that

got<00:05:13.310> a<00:05:13.340> nice<00:05:13.520> straight<00:05:13.789> grain<00:05:14.090> in<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:15.069> but<00:05:16.069> some

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
got a nice straight grain in it but some

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.290 
got a nice straight grain in it but some
of<00:05:16.669> these<00:05:16.759> pieces<00:05:17.060> are<00:05:17.889> 24<00:05:18.889> inches<00:05:18.969> maybe<00:05:19.969> just

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
of these pieces are 24 inches maybe just

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.170 
of these pieces are 24 inches maybe just
to<00:05:20.389> hear<00:05:20.539> more<00:05:20.810> and<00:05:23.800> with<00:05:24.800> our<00:05:24.919> short<00:05:25.129> mole<00:05:25.460> we

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
to hear more and with our short mole we

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.790 
to hear more and with our short mole we
can<00:05:26.389> get<00:05:26.509> right<00:05:26.690> through<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.080> sometimes<00:05:27.500> it

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
can get right through it sometimes it

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.680 
can get right through it sometimes it
takes<00:05:28.009> two<00:05:28.190> or<00:05:28.219> three<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.610> pop<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:28.969> loose<00:05:29.120> you

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
takes two or three to pop it loose you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.779 
takes two or three to pop it loose you
want<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.960> big<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.349> but<00:05:30.500> eventually<00:05:31.370> get

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
want a big one but eventually get

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.120
