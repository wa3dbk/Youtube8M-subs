00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.880
 As I promised and to you when 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.969
 if you did, you would do a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.599
 Introductory video about it even because 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.900
 windows 8 is already using there already know 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.750
 but staff are quite sure 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.699
 You made a difference to your own 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.869
 werre t 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.380
 So I just bought the pro that only 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.969
 a small configuration on it 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.090
 so in this first video just for us 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.570
 make an overview on the after 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.000
 you are posting the questions I 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 make a video to answer the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 let's go surfing pro in fact we 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 can classify him as trabuco ki 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.070
 ta before launch and had a mimimi 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.890
 about the available space and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.859
 compared to it very much with the ipad 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 apple the ipad has x available space and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.560
 the pro ty effects 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.650
 but it's actually a little wrong 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.390
 Why is there pro surfing? 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.990
 it has to be compared to the blunderbuss 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.350
 ii or even with macbook pro or with 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.939
 the macbook is ok so i recommend it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 You read a story that your bid 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.970
 net 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.420
 Anything, I'll put a link to you. 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.049
 where it has been mathematically proven that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:36.509
 in fact who is charging more for 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.150
 giga and delivering - in fact the last 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.420
 is what it is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.049
 here just so you have an idea I 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 I bought install updates on it. 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 I installed the office proposed 2013 installation 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:02:04.829
 Full okay and disk space I 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:05.729
 I have now 86 points 2 gb until now 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.710
 finished 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.310
 I already clipped them here to my unit 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.020
 With the bitlocker, I'm going home. I miss it. 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.830
 no one has access to the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 data 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.220
 to then there is for those who are star wars and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.080
 I believe everyone will be there and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.810
 make updates himself was the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.080
 office in full mode ie all 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 lan chips can be left 86 we 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.130
 round to 85 g what can you do 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.910
 enough as the agent is in the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.590
 cloud season in believe that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.770
 nobody else gets saved in the machine 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.020
 music and photos is not if I were to save 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.190
 All the photos I have on skydrive 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.480
 in the machine 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.840
 I think 80 gig would not be enough 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 but as we have the skydrive 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:06.570
 so you do not need no looking 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:10.370
 here it really drops drive awd to 504 747 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:16.730
 This is going to update here. 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:20.310
 it will probably take an hour and then 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.970
 tomorrow is a point to think about this 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:29.040
 storage issue that changes the 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.380
 canopy made own frt the rt just will 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.420
 accepting applications store that is to 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.900
 you install the ct client application on 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.310
 in ana story search the application 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:45.570
 here, for example, is the cnn and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:51.830
 click on install on a being made for me 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.570
 I can here on the site for example from wrong 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.880
 download error install normal like 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:01.500
 People already do since windows 95 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.790
 The problem is no problem at all. 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.010
 who also works with you as the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.590
 name says you did offspring runs 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.360
 windows 8 pro so for those who need and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:21.390
 harper vi here makes it normal can only go up 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.190
 to see and care only for the whole pattern in the 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.500
 sir, did rtt because he runs in 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.640
 platform in the obvious what we do not 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.640
 Will you be able to do this? 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.000
 the coolest thing is too 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:42.410
 the staff has doubts about the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.410
 machine configuration is not here 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:05:00.740
 put here for you take a look 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:05:00.740
 You're seeing right here, right? 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:13.170
 151 points 7 earn 4 gb of ram system 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:15.900
 64-bit operational of la 10 points 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.750
 and full hd screen 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.430
 another cool thing 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.280
 You should have seen a video of 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:29.960
 god sony vaio it comes with 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.010
 pen to those who will work with a 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.160
 photoshop 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:43.170
 but even those who use it enough notice it as 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:51.120
 I think this pen can be cool to do. 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:53.840
 notes or suddenly pay 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.840
 notes 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.980
 cool huh suddenly there for those who only 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:14.750
 making quick notes to the planet 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:18.320
 responds well if it really was a 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:27.080
 real pen and how not any better 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:33.620
 right for us to do our notes is 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:35.090
 sure to lose nobody will have 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:42.170
 access because you will have to fight for bi 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:44.240
 It puts a nice thing that here in the 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.940
 has a magnetic charger right 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.690
 When will you use it when you can? 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.690
 put here 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.840
 then it stays if the machine is used that 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:15.850
 with the pen even coca 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.400
 the machine is is a little thicker than 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.400
 the brt 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.250
 I think it's cool that they are all 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.820
 heatsink in precise because 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:42.740
 after all it has 15 is not a processor arm 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:46.310
 like rt it uses the same type until 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:49.210
 cover the windows nt trt 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.210
 It's the middle of the system. 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:03.710
 It's cool, I think this is personal then. 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:07.520
 anyone who has any questions 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:09.620
 How can you always post there that I can? 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.170
 that post that I will do others 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.400
 videos for people and deepening each 

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.400
 topic thank you very much
