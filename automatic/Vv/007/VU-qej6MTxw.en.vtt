00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.419 

now<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.520> want<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> do<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> rendering<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.980> stripes

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
now I want to do a rendering of stripes

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.379 
now I want to do a rendering of stripes
and<00:00:08.820> I've<00:00:08.910> chosen<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.599> stripe<00:00:10.790> fabric<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.269> I'm

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
and I've chosen a stripe fabric that I'm

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.980 
and I've chosen a stripe fabric that I'm
going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> use<00:00:12.870> as<00:00:13.080> my<00:00:13.230> inspiration<00:00:14.900> and<00:00:17.990> I'm

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
going to use as my inspiration and I'm

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.900 
going to use as my inspiration and I'm
sort<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.439> winging<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.039> here<00:00:20.070> generally<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
sort of winging it here generally I

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.679 
sort of winging it here generally I
would<00:00:21.119> recommend<00:00:21.600> drawing<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:22.199> your<00:00:22.410> stripes

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
would recommend drawing in your stripes

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.810 
would recommend drawing in your stripes
but<00:00:24.689> because<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:25.710> wide<00:00:26.039> simple

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
but because this is a pretty wide simple

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.359 
but because this is a pretty wide simple
stripe<00:00:28.340> I'm<00:00:29.340> pretty<00:00:30.240> safe<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.369> going

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
stripe I'm pretty safe and just going

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.630 
stripe I'm pretty safe and just going
for<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> rendering<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.920> case<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.430> nice

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
for the rendering in this case it's nice

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
for the rendering in this case it's nice
to<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> marker<00:00:36.660> rather<00:00:37.020> than<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> q-tip

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to have the marker rather than the q-tip

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.880 
to have the marker rather than the q-tip
because<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> can<00:00:38.460> be<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.610> precise<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.530> see

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
because I can be very precise and see

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
because I can be very precise and see
I've<00:00:41.010> skipped<00:00:41.370> over<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.850> pocket<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I've skipped over my pocket because a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
I've skipped over my pocket because a
pocket<00:00:43.200> would<00:00:43.290> probably<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
pocket would probably be going in a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.560 
pocket would probably be going in a
separate<00:00:45.059> direction<00:00:47.239> ideally<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> probably

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
separate direction ideally I probably

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.990 
separate direction ideally I probably
would<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.809> started<00:00:49.260> from<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> center<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
would have started from the center to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
would have started from the center to
lay<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> those<00:00:51.539> those<00:00:51.960> stripes<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> bodice

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
lay in those those stripes on the bodice

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.240 
lay in those those stripes on the bodice
but<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> looks<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.030> good

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
but it looks pretty good

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.369 
but it looks pretty good
now<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> horizontal<00:00:57.480> stripe<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.199> I'm

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
now this is a horizontal stripe and I'm

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.770 
now this is a horizontal stripe and I'm
dealing<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> folds<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
dealing with a lot of folds so I have to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.260 
dealing with a lot of folds so I have to
give<00:01:01.140> some<00:01:01.590> feeling<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> those<00:01:02.520> folds<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
give some feeling of those folds as I

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
give some feeling of those folds as I
lay<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> stripe<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.939> breaking<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
lay in the stripe so I'm breaking the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
lay in the stripe so I'm breaking the
line<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.720> go

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.490 

it<00:01:14.400> doesn't<00:01:14.759> have<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.299> incredibly<00:01:15.720> precise

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it doesn't have to be incredibly precise

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
it doesn't have to be incredibly precise
that<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> give<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> feeling<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that you have to give a feeling of it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.410 
that you have to give a feeling of it
curving<00:01:19.110> around<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> folds<00:01:26.000> now<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.240> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
curving around the folds now these are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.350 
curving around the folds now these are
even<00:01:27.780> more<00:01:27.990> extreme<00:01:28.710> fold<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.210> have

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
even more extreme fold so I really have

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.969 
even more extreme fold so I really have
to<00:01:30.509> be<00:01:30.600> conscious<00:01:31.080> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> direction<00:01:31.740> in

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to be conscious of the direction in

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:46.080 
to be conscious of the direction in
which<00:01:32.039> they're<00:01:32.460> going

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.870 

and<00:01:46.630> now<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:47.259> my<00:01:47.619> fabric<00:01:48.130> had<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.399> little

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and now because my fabric had a little

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.649 
and now because my fabric had a little
stripe<00:01:49.329> I'm<00:01:49.689> using<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.259> my<00:01:50.409> Tuscan<00:01:50.920> red<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:52.450> lay

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
stripe I'm using it my Tuscan red to lay

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.859 
stripe I'm using it my Tuscan red to lay
in<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.960> very<00:01:53.200> fine<00:01:53.619> line<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:55.270> were<00:01:55.420> actually

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
in a very fine line there were actually

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.069 
in a very fine line there were actually
two<00:01:55.899> little<00:01:56.710> stripes<00:01:57.070> but<00:01:57.340> because<00:01:58.079> I'm

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
two little stripes but because I'm

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.529 
two little stripes but because I'm
limited<00:01:59.890> for<00:02:00.159> space<00:02:00.189> I<00:02:00.850> don't<00:02:01.149> want<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.390> make

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
limited for space I don't want to make

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:03.600 
limited for space I don't want to make
it<00:02:01.659> look<00:02:01.810> busy<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.470> going<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.799> just<00:02:03.159> do<00:02:03.369> one

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
it look busy so I'm going to just do one

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.399 
it look busy so I'm going to just do one
you<00:02:03.759> just<00:02:03.970> want<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.179> create<00:02:04.390> an<00:02:04.539> impression<00:02:05.020> of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
you just want to create an impression of

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.109 
you just want to create an impression of
your<00:02:05.560> fabric<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.189> does<00:02:06.369> not<00:02:06.549> have<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.000> be

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
your fabric it does not have to be

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.520 
your fabric it does not have to be
literally<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.979> exact<00:02:08.979> number<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.429> stripes

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520 

again<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:14.860> I'm<00:02:15.010> working<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.519> beige

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
again because I'm working on a beige

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.890 
again because I'm working on a beige
ground<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.549> lay<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.970> shadow<00:02:19.299> for

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
ground I can just lay in the shadow for

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.360 
ground I can just lay in the shadow for
my<00:02:20.110> figure

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.850 

creates<00:02:28.060> dramatic<00:02:28.690> lights<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.200> darks<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
creates dramatic lights and darks and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.640 
creates dramatic lights and darks and
I'm<00:02:30.819> choosing<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.360> hair<00:02:31.599> color<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.050> relates

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
I'm choosing a hair color that relates

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.500 
I'm choosing a hair color that relates
to<00:02:33.099> my<00:02:33.370> stripe<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.239> warm<00:02:34.709> reddish<00:02:35.709> tone

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.180 

it's<00:02:40.510> always<00:02:40.900> leaving<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.380> highlight<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.069> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
it's always leaving a highlight so the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.479 
it's always leaving a highlight so the
hair<00:02:42.400> looks<00:02:42.640> shiny<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:46.920> want<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:48.220> some

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
hair looks shiny I want to have some

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.940 
hair looks shiny I want to have some
shadow<00:02:48.819> shadow<00:02:49.330> always<00:02:49.630> creates<00:02:50.470> a<00:02:50.620> feeling

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
shadow shadow always creates a feeling

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.140 
shadow shadow always creates a feeling
of<00:02:51.280> dimension<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.470> I'm<00:02:53.590> using<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:56.459> beige<00:02:57.459> marker

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
of dimension so I'm using a beige marker

dark your ground is even if it's black I

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.710 
dark your ground is even if it's black I
tend<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.840> start<00:04:29.170> with<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.410> cool<00:04:29.950> gray<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:31.420> then

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
tend to start with a cool gray and then

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:41.880 
tend to start with a cool gray and then
add<00:04:31.990> blacks<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:39.910> darker<00:04:40.630> grey<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.110> shadow<00:04:41.410> and

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
add blacks a darker grey for shadow and

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.830 
add blacks a darker grey for shadow and
I<00:04:42.010> could<00:04:42.220> pull<00:04:42.430> out<00:04:42.460> my<00:04:42.790> details<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:43.630> my

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
I could pull out my details with my

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:55.020 
I could pull out my details with my
shadow

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.750 

and<00:04:55.900> this<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.320> be<00:04:56.440> even<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.770> darker<00:04:57.220> cool<00:04:57.490> gray

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
and this can be even a darker cool gray

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:06.580 
and this can be even a darker cool gray
or<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.240> can<00:04:58.390> be<00:04:58.540> black

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.260 

and<00:05:07.590> now<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.830> can<00:05:08.130> see<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.490> my<00:05:08.610> white<00:05:08.850> prison

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
and now you can see that my white prison

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.140 
and now you can see that my white prison
pencil<00:05:09.780> will<00:05:09.900> actually<00:05:10.350> show<00:05:10.590> up<00:05:10.880> pretty<00:05:11.880> well

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
pencil will actually show up pretty well

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:20.960 
pencil will actually show up pretty well
on<00:05:12.390> that<00:05:12.420> dark<00:05:12.900> ground<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:19.220> could<00:05:20.220> also<00:05:20.520> use<00:05:20.940> a

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
on that dark ground I could also use a

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.460 
on that dark ground I could also use a
very<00:05:21.300> fine<00:05:21.390> brush<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:22.350> gouache<00:05:24.290> but<00:05:25.290> this

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
very fine brush and gouache but this

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.559 
very fine brush and gouache but this
works<00:05:25.740> pretty<00:05:26.040> well

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.829 

I<00:05:31.919> can<00:05:32.919> use<00:05:33.099> my<00:05:33.279> black<00:05:33.550> Prisma<00:05:34.029> pencil<00:05:34.479> to<00:05:34.629> pull

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
I can use my black Prisma pencil to pull

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:45.610 
I can use my black Prisma pencil to pull
out<00:05:35.020> details<00:05:35.469> even<00:05:35.919> more

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.770 

because<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.460> front<00:05:46.700> of<00:05:46.850> the<00:05:46.940> dress<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.420> laced

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
because the front of the dress is laced

00:05:47.780 --> 00:06:04.180 
because the front of the dress is laced
I<00:05:49.510> can<00:05:50.510> add<00:05:50.750> the<00:05:51.020> lines<00:05:51.500> for<00:05:51.920> the<00:05:52.040> lacing

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.490 

I<00:06:04.280> keep<00:06:04.910> adding<00:06:05.150> shadow<00:06:05.630> to<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:05.930> feel<00:06:06.260> there's

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
I keep adding shadow to I feel there's

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.159 
I keep adding shadow to I feel there's
enough<00:06:06.560> contrast

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.110

marker and my Prisma pencils and then

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
marker and my Prisma pencils and then
parse<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:24.150> white<00:06:24.360> gouache<00:06:25.430> at<00:06:26.430> highlights

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
parse the white gouache at highlights

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:40.610 
parse the white gouache at highlights
pulls<00:06:27.660> out<00:06:27.840> the<00:06:28.020> edges

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.780 

my<00:06:41.130> lacing<00:06:41.639> becomes<00:06:42.000> more<00:06:42.240> visible
