00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
you notice that i placed a little box on

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.320 
you notice that i placed a little box on
the<00:00:16.260> ground<00:00:16.289> essentially<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> radio<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> what

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the ground essentially a radio and what

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.390 
the ground essentially a radio and what
allows<00:00:18.570> me<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.900> do<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.320> i<00:00:19.439> die<00:00:19.500> i<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.279> the

allows me to do is if i die i have the
option<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.820> spot<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.449> allies<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.199> this

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
option to spot on my allies or on this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
option to spot on my allies or on this
mobile<00:00:22.740> spawn<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.369> radio<00:00:23.670> beacon<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
mobile spawn this radio beacon and you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.390 
mobile spawn this radio beacon and you
don't<00:00:25.230> actually<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> place<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.250> down

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
don't actually have to place it down

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.339 
don't actually have to place it down
again<00:00:26.849> when<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.240> respawn<00:00:27.599> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.170> are

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
again when you respawn if you are

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.769 
again when you respawn if you are
familiar<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.800> modern<00:00:29.220> warfare<00:00:29.400> 2<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.570> can

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
familiar with modern warfare 2 you can

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
familiar with modern warfare 2 you can
just<00:00:30.929> place<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> down<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> die<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
just place it down and if you die you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
just place it down and if you die you
respawn<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> don't

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
respawn on it or you know and you don't

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.319 
respawn on it or you know and you don't
have<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.190> worry<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:35.489> putting<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.239> down

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
have to worry about putting it down

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
have to worry about putting it down
again<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.100> essentially<00:00:38.100> what<00:00:38.219> i'm<00:00:38.340> doing<00:00:38.550> in

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
again so essentially what i'm doing in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
again so essentially what i'm doing in
this<00:00:38.790> video<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:39.300> locking<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> right

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this video is I'm locking down the right

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
this video is I'm locking down the right
corridor<00:00:41.190> oh<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.600> sure<00:00:42.719> what

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
corridor oh really I'm really sure what

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
corridor oh really I'm really sure what
to<00:00:43.050> call<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.129> second<00:00:44.550> base<00:00:44.760> for

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to call it on the second base for

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.420 
to call it on the second base for
operation<00:00:45.629> metro<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> as<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:46.980> it's

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
operation metro and as you can see it's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.630 
operation metro and as you can see it's
a<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.000> effective<00:00:48.719> way<00:00:48.899> at<00:00:49.550> flanking<00:00:50.550> your

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
a very effective way at flanking your

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
a very effective way at flanking your
enemy<00:00:51.059> without<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.930> having<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.260> flank

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
enemy without actually having to flank

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
enemy without actually having to flank
them<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> good

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
them you just have to get into a good

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.150 
them you just have to get into a good
position<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.649> place<00:00:55.890> where<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
position and have a good place where you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.560 
position and have a good place where you
can<00:00:56.280> actually<00:00:56.430> place<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.969> radio<00:00:57.270> beeping

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
can actually place this radio beeping

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
can actually place this radio beeping
down<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.710> can<00:00:58.829> take<00:00:59.039> out<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
down and you can take out a lot of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.170 
down and you can take out a lot of
people<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.359> since<00:01:01.230> there<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:02.030> since<00:01:03.030> there

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
people and since there is since there

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.039 
people and since there is since there
are<00:01:04.549> killcams<00:01:05.549> i<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.299> tell<00:01:06.570> where

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
are killcams i can actually tell where

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.350 
are killcams i can actually tell where
the<00:01:07.290> enemy<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.650> located<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.240> out

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the enemy is located and take them out

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
the enemy is located and take them out
right<00:01:09.780> after<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.229> killed<00:01:10.500> me<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.159> my

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
right after they killed me and I in my

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.240 
right after they killed me and I in my
opinion<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.939> kinda<00:01:12.659> silly<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.860> also<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
opinion this is kinda silly and also I

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
opinion this is kinda silly and also I
know<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.909> we're<00:01:15.090> indoors<00:01:15.540> i'm<00:01:15.900> actually

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know because we're indoors i'm actually

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
know because we're indoors i'm actually
just<00:01:16.320> spawning<00:01:16.619> directly<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> spawn

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
just spawning directly on the spawn

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
just spawning directly on the spawn
beacon<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.630> heard<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.500> under<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
beacon and I heard and I'm under the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
beacon and I heard and I'm under the
assumption<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.330> on<00:01:21.570> larger<00:01:21.990> Maps<00:01:22.200> when

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
assumption that when on larger Maps when

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.260 
assumption that when on larger Maps when
you're<00:01:22.950> outside<00:01:23.100> you're<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
you're outside you're actually going to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.780 
you're outside you're actually going to
parachute<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.520> radio

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
parachute down on to where the radio

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
parachute down on to where the radio
beacon<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> allow

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
beacon is and this is going to allow

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
beacon is and this is going to allow
your<00:01:28.619> enemies<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.670> where<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
your enemies to actually know where you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
your enemies to actually know where you
are<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> can't<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:30.930> spawn

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
are and so you can't actually spawn

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.649 
are and so you can't actually spawn
pretty<00:01:32.159> much<00:01:32.340> directly<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> side<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.390> them

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
pretty much directly to the side of them

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.170 
pretty much directly to the side of them
without<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.290> knowing<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.180> so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
without them actually knowing and so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
without them actually knowing and so
hopefully<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:36.810> alleviate<00:01:37.200> some<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hopefully that will alleviate some of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.760 
hopefully that will alleviate some of
this<00:01:38.220> ridiculousness<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.049> cool<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
this ridiculousness it is cool but it is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
this ridiculousness it is cool but it is
I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.369> overpowered<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.150> needs

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
I think a little overpowered and needs

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.480 
I think a little overpowered and needs
some<00:01:42.479> tweaking<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.040> an<00:01:44.189> audio

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
some tweaking to it there is an audio

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.039 
some tweaking to it there is an audio
that<00:01:44.700> kind<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> notifies<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that kind of notifies you that there is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
that kind of notifies you that there is
a<00:01:46.200> radio<00:01:46.619> beacon<00:01:46.799> nearby<00:01:47.280> but<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> find<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
a radio beacon nearby but I find that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
a radio beacon nearby but I find that
the<00:01:48.479> audio<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:48.869> kinda<00:01:49.619> hard<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.159> hear<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.729> those

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the audio is kinda hard to hear in those

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
the audio is kinda hard to hear in those
situations<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:51.810> maybe<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.649> haven't

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
situations or maybe I just haven't

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
situations or maybe I just haven't
gotten<00:01:53.130> used<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.030> different<00:01:54.149> sounds

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
gotten used to all the different sounds

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
gotten used to all the different sounds
about<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> three<00:01:55.320> yet<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
about the three yet I think that if it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.420 
about the three yet I think that if it
was<00:01:57.390> maybe<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.380> distinct<00:01:58.829> sound<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.280> maybe

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
was maybe a more distinct sound or maybe

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.819 
was maybe a more distinct sound or maybe
it<00:01:59.670> was<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.420> louder<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.020> kind

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
it was just a little bit louder and kind

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.230 
it was just a little bit louder and kind
of<00:02:01.890> gave<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.340> better<00:02:02.549> indication<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
of gave you a better indication as to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670 
of gave you a better indication as to
where<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> might<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.200> maybe<00:02:04.320> take<00:02:04.530> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
where it might be you can maybe take it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340 
where it might be you can maybe take it
out<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.520> think<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.240> should<00:02:06.479> maybe<00:02:06.780> be

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
out I also think that it should maybe be

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.340 
out I also think that it should maybe be
a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.950> easier<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:09.090> spot<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
a little bit easier to to spot in

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.710 
a little bit easier to to spot in
small<00:02:10.710> locations<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.520> dark<00:02:11.700> locations<00:02:12.240> it's

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
small locations and dark locations it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.300 
small locations and dark locations it's
definitely<00:02:12.930> very<00:02:13.320> difficult<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> even<00:02:13.980> see

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
definitely very difficult to even see

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.670 
definitely very difficult to even see
the<00:02:14.490> radio<00:02:14.730> beacon<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.570> find<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.530> most

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the radio beacon so I find that most

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.990 
the radio beacon so I find that most
people<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.250> run<00:02:17.430> by<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.820> actually

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
people will just run by it and actually

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.940 
people will just run by it and actually
not<00:02:18.330> even<00:02:18.570> realize<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.650> radio

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
not even realize that it is a radio

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.040 
not even realize that it is a radio
beacon<00:02:20.160> ah<00:02:20.580> but<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> would<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> get<00:02:21.930> your

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
beacon ah but I would like to get your

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.780 
beacon ah but I would like to get your
guys's<00:02:22.380> opinion<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.580> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
guys's opinion on this do you think that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
guys's opinion on this do you think that
the<00:02:24.000> spawning<00:02:24.390> beacon<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:24.960> fine<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the spawning beacon is fine as it is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.140 
the spawning beacon is fine as it is
right<00:02:25.830> now<00:02:25.890> or<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.460> think<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.760> needs<00:02:26.940> some

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
right now or do you think it needs some

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580 
right now or do you think it needs some
tweaking<00:02:27.540> before<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.110> game<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.440> actually

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
tweaking before the game is actually

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.280 
tweaking before the game is actually
