00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hello everyone 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.400
 to grimaud for wii cohen co.fr and we 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 found today for the test of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 coop book in its version 2 it's 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.619
 always for yes cosin five that's 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.449
 always at protect screen points like 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.429
 you will see that there are some 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.579
 small differences with this one that I 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.130
 will test a few months ago so 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.659
 who is a karabagh and ayral co who is getting 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.919
 replace the back shell of the ricoh 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.560
 sing faye like the official coke 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.630
 mikko and who had a painting at 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 the back to his mates they have a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.180
 little cheap according to the words of some 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.220
 buyers of this product so today 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 we have a version to propose by protect 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.910
 screen points like that I'm going to you 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.060
 present directly so at first 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.590
 view there it changes nothing so we have the 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.450
 robot and the inner shell it's 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.040
 same and it's at the back that it's 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.980
 pass so you see we have an effect 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.350
 lacquered on this hull which gives a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.240
 brilliant effect rather nice so 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.560
 for once I think it's 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.049
 much prettier than the version 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.270
 previous and so I'm going directly to 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.219
 circle the smartphone in to show 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.899
 a little bit working even though in 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.270
 the first video is very very 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.759
 explicit 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.200
 that's it then you see that on a killer 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.819
 of samsung type and that you are 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 a lot to ask me how to install 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.590
 makes you a video very very soon 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.109
 for to show you if we're coming back 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.200
 on the cover so we have accessibility 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.289
 to the volume buttons across the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 reread or above no problem 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.850
 on it we have access to the power button 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.850
 right without problem 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.479
 a small hole is planned for the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.640
 ground microphone below the hull at 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.840
 on it we find an access for the jack 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 3.5 as well as the micro usb 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.940
 the camera as well as the flash are 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.619
 well there is no problem and we even have a 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210
 little 8 megapixel writing on the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.180
 shell what was not present on the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.350
 first version and has driven up 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.950
 speaker on the bottom of the hull 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.009
 the flap is well against the screen 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.569
 unlike official coke wiko as 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.300
 for the first version does not change 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.370
 not so be careful not to 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.870
 understand that europe is coming 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.430
 on the screen he just just tackled 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.160
 against there is no magnet system 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.680
 or not what allows the flap to 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.239
 stay glued to the screen 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.430
 So here I invite you to go 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.090

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.420

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.989
