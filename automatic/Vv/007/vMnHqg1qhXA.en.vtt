00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.149
 and it may be interesting to have him 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:13.849
 a look at the little animals bugs 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:13.849
 that jim in a normal home garden 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:21.050
 here we see 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.320
 a bug is probably a 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.230
 chinche besucona the famous and feared 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.920
 chinch besucona 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 although I have my doubts because the chinche 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.660
 besucona has 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.760
 an aspect that does not end up drying with 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.969
 this one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.969
 I dare not deny it or affirm it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.180
 we also see this little animal that 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:58.450
 The bee beetle is also very common 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.050
 there is no need to explain why 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.050
 it is commonly called bee beetle 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.270
 this spider that what interests me 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.330
 a lot of her is her attitude I'm not in 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 possibilities to say your name because 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.530
 There is a wide variety of spiders 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.619
 similar 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 I'm not in a position to say your 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:56.049
 name but his attitude really does not 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.500
 is afraid the camera approached about 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.509
 centimeters and never gave 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.240
 scary samples the most that came to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.660
 to do is turn your back 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.959
 but neither one nor anything regarding the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.209
 camera moves away a little bit the animal from 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.209
 again he put himself in aggressive attitude 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.579
 then this animal that is also more 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.909
 or less common they call it beetle 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.599
 elephant the people call him so he must be 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:37.600
 for his trunk but of course he does not have 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.980
 no resemblance to an elephant 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.069
 I think it can be a weevil 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:49.530
 of mallow is called so because these 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:52.430
 weevils usually eat from 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.530
 mauve flowers 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.870
 and some of them take the color 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.299
 yellow because the pollen of the flowers 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.910
 it sticks to their bodies and makes them come back 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.180
 yellows 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.079
 in this case they are eating 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.090
 a cactus and it is seen that they do a lot of damage 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.950
 fact they can be a plague 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.069
 most of these animals that 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.069
 we are seeing are or can be pests 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470
 and here we are showing our backs what 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.590
 which is very interesting because it 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:35.670
 get to see part of his call him 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.670
 abdomen of its lower part its belly 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:56.050
 the color of this butterfly or moth 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.050
 it's very special it 's black blue bear 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.590
 also in an attitude 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.590
 compromising 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.330
 and this other 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:15.490
 animal that for me is one of the most 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:19.200
 weird and weirder his appearance is 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.200
 really interesting 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:33.770
 it looks like the ones that people commonly 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:36.590
 called toritos because there are some of 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:41.480
 these little animals that are green and have 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.580
 some species of horns 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.210
 I guess that's what it's worth 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:50.420
 name of torito but this although it is not 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.150
 one of those toritos however is without 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.510
 doubt a family member very close to those 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.510
 insects 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:03.280
 obviously in a garden there is dust 

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:06.580
 earth there are plants 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.600
 so I hope you are seeing what 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.740
 interesting that is the insect 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.340
 and not the dust and grime that could 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.340
 have on my finger 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:40.770
 and this little monster that I found 

00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:43.800
 stuck in a 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.020
 in a trunk of a tree and is has 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.180
 however as it mimicked it is reached 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.180
 see check in your design 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:57.650
 good and this is in a normal garden of 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.650
 the most normal 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:07.510
 what will be in places 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:12.720
 away from the people in the jungle in 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.720
 in places of little excess for people
