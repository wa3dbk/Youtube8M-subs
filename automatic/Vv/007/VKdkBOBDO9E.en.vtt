this is what the right hand is doing I'm

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.020 
this is what the right hand is doing I'm
using<00:02:28.569> these<00:02:28.810> two<00:02:28.989> fingers<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:30.610> pluck<00:02:30.849> the

using these two fingers to to pluck the
strings<00:02:31.379> snap<00:02:32.379> them<00:02:32.530> up<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.680> little<00:02:32.799> bit<00:02:32.920> like

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
strings snap them up a little bit like

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.240 
strings snap them up a little bit like
that

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
that

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.179 
that
in<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.150> country<00:02:34.750> country<00:02:35.409> chicken<00:02:35.620> pickin

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
in the country country chicken pickin

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.710 
in the country country chicken pickin
style<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.609> guess<00:02:38.790> although<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> more<00:02:40.299> like

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
style I guess although this is more like

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.509 
style I guess although this is more like
a<00:02:40.750> rockabilly<00:02:41.170> type<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.069> groove<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:45.250> sounds

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
a rockabilly type of groove it sounds

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.010 
a rockabilly type of groove it sounds
nice<00:02:45.819> when<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.060> played<00:02:46.269> faster<00:02:46.629> of<00:02:46.689> course

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
nice when you played faster of course

00:02:47.020 --> 00:03:04.710 
nice when you played faster of course

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
so this lake has a mixolydian mode sound

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.229 
so this lake has a mixolydian mode sound
over<00:03:09.349> it<00:03:09.440> because<00:03:12.519> I'm<00:03:13.519> playing<00:03:13.819> the
