hello we are playing Minecraft and today

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
hello we are playing Minecraft and today
we<00:00:07.200> will<00:00:07.319> be<00:00:07.350> starting<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.890> new<00:00:08.010> video<00:00:08.639> series

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we will be starting a new video series

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.259 
we will be starting a new video series
of<00:00:09.530> Minecraft<00:00:10.530> build<00:00:10.889> ups<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.759> which<00:00:11.940> watch<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
of Minecraft build ups in which watch a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.759 
of Minecraft build ups in which watch a
video<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.750> will<00:00:12.809> challenge<00:00:13.259> each<00:00:13.500> other<00:00:13.620> to

challenge why should be resent me he
told<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> build<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.550> 10-block<00:00:41.550> high

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
told me to build a 10-block high

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.760 
told me to build a 10-block high
hourglass<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.379> drops<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.100> block<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.120> sand

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
hourglass that drops a block of sand

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.869 
hourglass that drops a block of sand
every<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.100> second<00:00:47.670> exactly<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.980> recycle

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
every one second exactly and to recycle

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.799 
every one second exactly and to recycle
the<00:00:51.149> sand<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.820> get<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> sand<00:00:54.149> back<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the sand and get the sand back up the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.360 
the sand and get the sand back up the
tent<00:00:55.320> walk<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:57.260> right<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.590> i<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
tent walk our right here i have the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.870 
tent walk our right here i have the
piston<00:01:00.359> o'clock

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.120 

and<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.170> redstone<00:01:04.920> hell<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> I

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
and this is the redstone hell so I

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
and this is the redstone hell so I
haven't<00:01:08.490> put<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> blocks<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.540> yet<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:12.950> for

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
haven't put the blocks in yet so for

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:23.040 
haven't put the blocks in yet so for
reasons<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:15.480> Norge<00:01:15.750> explain<00:01:16.140> later<00:01:18.890> great

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.820 

okay<00:01:23.830> so<00:01:24.790> as<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:25.000> can<00:01:25.090> see<00:01:25.330> it<00:01:25.450> works

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
okay so as you can see it works

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.400 
okay so as you can see it works
perfectly<00:01:26.830> well<00:01:27.750> until<00:01:28.750> I'll<00:01:28.840> say<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.110> get

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
perfectly well until I'll say you get

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.090 
perfectly well until I'll say you get
like<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> mini<00:01:29.890> lag<00:01:30.160> spike<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.560> problem<00:01:32.980> with

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
like a mini lag spike the problem with

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.130 
like a mini lag spike the problem with
building<00:01:33.460> such<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.700> complex<00:01:34.210> machine<00:01:34.450> is<00:01:35.080> that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
building such a complex machine is that

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.670 
building such a complex machine is that
the<00:01:35.920> Pistons<00:01:36.460> are<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:38.020> buggy<00:01:38.500> a<00:01:40.680> few

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
the Pistons are really buggy a few

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.820 
the Pistons are really buggy a few
frames<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.100> flag<00:01:42.310> will<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:46.780> off<00:01:47.020> set<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.590> timer

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
frames a flag will set off set the timer

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.470 
frames a flag will set off set the timer
for<00:01:47.980> some<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.430> Pistons<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.000> that<00:01:49.300> will

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
for some of the Pistons and that will

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.950 
for some of the Pistons and that will
destroy<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.930> blocks<00:01:50.170> or<00:01:50.410> push<00:01:50.680> them<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:52.360> place

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
destroy the blocks or push them in place

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.260 
destroy the blocks or push them in place
into<00:01:53.410> places<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:53.800> you<00:01:54.160> do<00:01:54.310> not<00:01:54.460> want<00:01:54.820> them<00:01:55.120> to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
into places that you do not want them to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.690 
into places that you do not want them to
be<00:01:55.420> that's<00:01:56.350> why<00:01:56.530> we<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.830> these<00:01:57.010> obsidian

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
be that's why we have these obsidian

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.870 
be that's why we have these obsidian
blocks<00:01:57.970> here<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.660> prevent<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.550> Pistons<00:02:00.930> from

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
blocks here to prevent the Pistons from

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.889 
blocks here to prevent the Pistons from
destroying<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.360> whole<00:02:05.610> clock<00:02:06.610> tower

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.259 

so<00:02:09.470> allow<00:02:10.099> us<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.429> follow<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:11.060> path<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
so allow us to follow the path of the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.020 
so allow us to follow the path of the
travel<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:17.060> brattle<00:02:17.420> pulls<00:02:17.629> down<00:02:18.819> goes<00:02:19.819> over

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
travel the brattle pulls down goes over

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.350 
travel the brattle pulls down goes over
here<00:02:20.239> gets<00:02:20.540> pushed<00:02:20.840> up<00:02:21.849> here

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.530 

gets<00:02:26.810> pushed<00:02:27.050> up<00:02:27.200> here

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.479 

please<00:02:37.239> excuse<00:02:38.239> me<00:02:38.360> that<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.489> eventually

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
please excuse me that is eventually

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.149 
please excuse me that is eventually
pushed<00:02:41.030> into<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.709> piston<00:02:42.709> mess<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.980> real

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
pushed into this piston mess the real

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.819 
pushed into this piston mess the real
challenge<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:47.060> vote<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.019> such<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.349> thing<00:02:48.620> is

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
challenge and vote on such a thing is

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.819 
challenge and vote on such a thing is
not<00:02:50.739> crossing<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.189> streams<00:02:53.120> of<00:02:53.659> redstone<00:02:54.560> and

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
not crossing the streams of redstone and

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.440 
not crossing the streams of redstone and
getting<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:57.980> time<00:02:58.250> because<00:02:59.060> if<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.269> don't

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
getting the time because if you don't

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.910 
getting the time because if you don't
get<00:02:59.629> timing<00:03:00.079> right<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.470> will<00:03:00.590> eventually

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
get timing right it will eventually

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.460 
get timing right it will eventually
destroy<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.879> blocks<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.439> screw<00:03:03.439> everything

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
destroy the blocks and screw everything

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:17.530 
destroy the blocks and screw everything
up<00:03:06.430> yeah<00:03:08.560> get<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> view<00:03:09.799> up<00:03:09.950> here

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.199 

so<00:03:18.110> this<00:03:18.590> actually<00:03:18.860> took<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.519> while<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> build

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
so this actually took a while to build

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.990 
so this actually took a while to build
there<00:03:20.840> wasn't<00:03:21.140> much<00:03:21.260> planning<00:03:21.620> since<00:03:22.579> it<00:03:22.879> was

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
there wasn't much planning since it was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.899
