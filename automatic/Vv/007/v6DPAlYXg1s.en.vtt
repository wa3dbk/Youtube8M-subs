for<00:00:07.710> developing<00:00:08.309> motor<00:00:08.519> skills<00:00:08.960> built<00:00:09.960> out<00:00:10.139> of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
for developing motor skills built out of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.709 
for developing motor skills built out of
wood<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:11.250> part<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.610> project<00:00:11.790> is<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.480> get

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
wood first part of the project is to get

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.129 
wood first part of the project is to get
a<00:00:12.960> sheet<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.530> plywood<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.490> something<00:00:15.139> similar

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
a sheet of plywood or something similar

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.099 
a sheet of plywood or something similar
and<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:17.550> gonna<00:00:17.670> cut<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:17.940> down<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.869> it's

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and we're gonna cut it down so that it's

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.620 
and we're gonna cut it down so that it's
even<00:00:20.010> on<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.310> side<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> needs<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.510> be

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
even on one side but it needs to be

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.290 
even on one side but it needs to be
about<00:00:22.080> six<00:00:22.410> inches<00:00:22.710> longer<00:00:22.980> or<00:00:23.369> whatever<00:00:24.000> size

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
about six inches longer or whatever size

about six inches longer or whatever size
balls<00:00:25.080> you're<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.380> use<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.099> gonna<00:00:26.250> use<00:00:26.430> one

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
balls you're gonna use I'm gonna use one

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.109 
balls you're gonna use I'm gonna use one
by<00:00:27.300> force<00:00:27.920> it's<00:00:28.920> gonna<00:00:29.070> give<00:00:29.310> us<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.640> depth<00:00:29.880> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
by force it's gonna give us the depth we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.260 
by force it's gonna give us the depth we
need<00:00:30.330> once<00:00:31.260> we're<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.679> lined<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.369> flush<00:00:33.059> with

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
need once we're all lined up flush with

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.979 
need once we're all lined up flush with
the<00:00:33.420> edges<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:34.710> are<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.480> glue<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> clamp

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the edges we are going to glue and clamp

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.360 
the edges we are going to glue and clamp
this<00:00:37.200> together

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
this together

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.580 
this together
so<00:00:40.030> we're<00:00:40.120> gonna<00:00:40.240> make<00:00:40.450> sure<00:00:40.690> these<00:00:40.960> are<00:00:41.200> flush

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
so we're gonna make sure these are flush

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:50.360 
so we're gonna make sure these are flush
with<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.510> edges<00:00:44.520> take<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.580> couple<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.120> clamps

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.250 

clamp<00:00:51.000> these<00:00:51.180> at<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.540> corner<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.110> they're

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
clamp these at the corner so they're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.250 
clamp these at the corner so they're
holding<00:00:52.410> both<00:00:52.740> pieces<00:00:53.040> down<00:00:53.720> she<00:00:54.720> can<00:00:54.810> set

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
holding both pieces down she can set

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.540 
holding both pieces down she can set
this<00:00:55.410> aside<00:00:55.620> for<00:00:56.130> a<00:00:56.220> minute<00:00:56.370> let<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> glue<00:00:57.090> dry

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
this aside for a minute let the glue dry

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.370 
this aside for a minute let the glue dry
once<00:00:59.550> you've<00:00:59.700> cut<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.090> doors<00:01:00.720> out<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> the
