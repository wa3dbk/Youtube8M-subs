00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and is going to make this video with my own 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.330
 voice but for circumstances that a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.450
 you do not mind, I decided to do it 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.940
 with what not lol as it is we go direct 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.980
 to the point I'm not an expert in animation 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.870
 but I have the feeling that the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.660
 animation of the series is superior to the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 of this movie like that landscapes and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.010
 details are not as good as in the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.099
 series itself especially in like 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.830
 as I said I 'm not an expert so 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 Maybe it's my tricks the second to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.579
 emphasize about the animation and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.739
 design is that I do not understand why in the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.260
 human world the ponies keep their 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.210
 original skin colors the festival 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 of colors in their hair is something 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 passable but the skin colors do not 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.140
 I see the point would have been better a color 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.809
 normal skin but at the same time 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 who cares after all is a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.399
 child series and nobody looks at that in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.530
 As for the plot and history there is no 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.050
 Much to say is the typical story 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.270
 where someone steals something and must travel 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.489
 to a parallel universe where you have a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.680
 time limit to achieve your mission or 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.979
 will be trapped forever or by 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.990
 a lot of time in a universe which does not 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.929
 affecting the cosmic balance and all that 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 mother added to this combine it with the 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:17.179
 typical story of schoolgirls with the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
 very overexploited coronation dance 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.409
 etcetera etcetera i am not very demanding 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.729
 with originality because at this point 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 of the story is practically 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.799
 impossible to do something that has not 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.990
 existed before I am one of those who if a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 cliché is well developed I do not have 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 problems 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 this movie combines two clichés what 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.939
 which makes it pretty mediocre for me 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.709
 what I do not understand is because they are set 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.319
 shimmer becomes a beast 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.479
 when it acquires the crown of twilight no 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.299
 I ask for realism but what a schoolgirl 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.969
 like to be a gargoyle like that is 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.829
 nothing else is supposed to be in the 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.170
 universe of the human does not exist 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.090
 magic so how is it that people at 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.459
 final is not in shock or something like that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.819
 because they are not shocked to know that 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.590
 there is magic because if the USA finds out 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.390
 they would take the villain along with the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.340
 prose and would lock them in a few 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.370
 secret facilities to investigate 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.170
 your powers and calm down I know it's a 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.200
 child movie so 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 does not count in conclusion equestrian girls 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.640
 joins the long chain of films 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.340
 mediocre that serve to frank serve and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.930
 is not no fun I guess the service 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.180
 have so much funk where the ponies 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.580
 humanized hasbro injury this as 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.400
 fill up here my opinion on the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.319
 movie now a couple of ads so 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.540
 I generally do not like to combine ads 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.780
 with these issues but then I will not have 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 time to notify one of the July 24 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.640
 I'm going on vacation so I do not 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.590
 they will know about me for two weeks and two given 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.600
 to which the bulletins on this page are 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.970
 a garbage since no one reads them 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.769
 notice that I made a facebook is a 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.019
 facebook new for everyone who likes 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.120
 interest and want to add me is a 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.160
 account out of my personal account already 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.650
 that I do not share it with people who do not 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.790
 I know in person up to here the video 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.790
