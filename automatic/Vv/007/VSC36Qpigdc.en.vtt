00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
he wanted it to function so it needed to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.470 
he wanted it to function so it needed to
be<00:03:41.530> rideable<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.280> then<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.910> next<00:03:42.940> thing<00:03:43.210> was

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
be rideable and then the next thing was

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.970 
be rideable and then the next thing was
he<00:03:43.630> wanted<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.990> make<00:03:44.080> a<00:03:44.140> statement<00:03:44.200> he<00:03:44.680> wanted

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
he wanted to make a statement he wanted

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.410 
he wanted to make a statement he wanted
to<00:03:45.070> have<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.220> one<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:45.610> one<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.150> kind<00:03:46.360> of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
to have a one of one of a kind of

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.060 
to have a one of one of a kind of
motorcycle<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:47.290> nobody<00:03:47.680> else<00:03:47.830> would<00:03:47.950> have

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
motorcycle that nobody else would have

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.600 
motorcycle that nobody else would have
so<00:03:48.880> those<00:03:49.480> two<00:03:49.780> gave<00:03:50.440> us<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.680> idea<00:03:50.710> of<00:03:51.100> what<00:03:51.430> to

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
so those two gave us the idea of what to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.030 
so those two gave us the idea of what to
do<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.000> design<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:53.080> have<00:03:53.260> pictures<00:03:53.560> on<00:03:53.740> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
do in design and I have pictures on the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.220 
do in design and I have pictures on the
on<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.280> wall<00:03:54.640> there<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:55.690> you'll<00:03:55.810> see<00:03:56.050> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
on the wall there that you'll see it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.590 
on the wall there that you'll see it
starts<00:03:56.560> with<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:56.770> sketch<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.610> what<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> did<00:03:58.390> that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
starts with a sketch and what I did that

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.810 
starts with a sketch and what I did that
that<00:03:58.780> top<00:03:59.020> picture<00:03:59.290> frame<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.890> sketched<00:04:00.580> out<00:04:00.760> a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
that top picture frame I sketched out a

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.820 
that top picture frame I sketched out a
little<00:04:01.030> design<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.720> then<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.260> probably

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
little design and then I probably

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.950 
little design and then I probably
sketched<00:04:03.190> out<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.490> three<00:04:03.700> designs<00:04:04.210> and<00:04:04.570> I

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
sketched out like three designs and I

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.630 
sketched out like three designs and I
showed<00:04:05.200> him<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.470> one<00:04:05.680> he<00:04:05.920> just<00:04:05.950> loved<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.520> I

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
go with so we start off with the sketch

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.080 
go with so we start off with the sketch
and<00:04:32.230> then<00:04:32.650> after<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.010> sketch<00:04:33.280> we<00:04:33.730> start

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
and then after the sketch we start

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.940 
and then after the sketch we start
giving<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.390> customers<00:04:34.840> up<00:04:35.020> paint<00:04:35.320> graphic

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
after that you start fabricating we

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.500 
after that you start fabricating we
fabricate<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.070> frame<00:04:51.370> we<00:04:51.910> fabricate<00:04:52.390> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
fabricate the frame we fabricate the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.140 
fabricate the frame we fabricate the
swing<00:04:52.780> arm<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.500> do<00:04:54.040> all<00:04:54.190> the<00:04:54.340> tin<00:04:54.520> naki<00:04:54.760> this<00:04:55.000> is

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
swing arm we do all the tin naki this is

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.340 
swing arm we do all the tin naki this is
all<00:04:55.330> Tim<00:04:55.830> oh<00:04:56.830> I<00:04:57.669> did<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.060> every<00:04:58.630> part<00:04:58.870> I<00:04:58.990> was<00:04:59.169> not

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
all Tim oh I did it every part I was not

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.970 
all Tim oh I did it every part I was not

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
completed we apply the graphics and then

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.200 
completed we apply the graphics and then
after<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.590> graphics<00:05:12.010> done<00:05:12.250> then<00:05:12.700> we<00:05:12.850> put<00:05:13.090> the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
after the graphics done then we put the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.940 
after the graphics done then we put the
motorcycle<00:05:14.020> back<00:05:14.140> together<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.620> we<00:05:14.710> start

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
motorcycle back together and we start

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.040 
motorcycle back together and we start
assembling<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:16.000> particular<00:05:16.360> customer

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
assembling it this particular customer
