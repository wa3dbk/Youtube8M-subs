Incarnation the doctrine of the
Incarnation<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.619> doctrine<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.909> God

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
Incarnation is not the doctrine that God

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
Incarnation is not the doctrine that God
somehow<00:01:06.630> turned<00:01:07.350> himself<00:01:07.770> into<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> human

somehow turned himself into a human
being<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:10.170> notion<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.250> much<00:01:11.580> more<00:01:11.880> akin<00:01:12.299> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
being that notion is much more akin to
