00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.320
 as I always tell you, there is no greater 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.930
 feeling and more enjoyable to get to 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.509
 your wardrobe find your clothes 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.570
 perfectly ironed and folded I am 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.549
 see box a greeting from Spain and in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.400
 this video I'm going to teach you how to double a 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.590
 pants when ironing stripe 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.590
 of everything 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.630
 I'm going 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.199
 we have the pants perfectly 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.270
 ironing now it's time to 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.739
 fold it to put it inside the closet 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.339
 We will continue the following 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.970
 movements we take the line of 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:49.089
 ironing and joining the seams 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.760
 outside with one another in a 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.519
 Forward 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.370
 we take again and the same movement 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.410
 we join the stripes of ironing one against 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 other 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.830
 we remove all the fabric that is here stuck 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.140
 inside and the pants are left 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.900
 completely folded look what 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.960
 movement easier and faster but 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 attention there is a detail that you can not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.330
 forget you and it's a very very very 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 important there are people who have the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.570
 custom of leaving buckled in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.120
 platelet zippers or buttons 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 to fold the pants watch this 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.600
 concrete detail when we are going to bend 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.500
 the pants 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.869
 all that tissue is inside and 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.600
 also wants to leave out post 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.299
 that is fastened that happens when 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.280
 you have the pants tucked in the closet 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.810
 several days the problem that you're going to 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.240
 find that you have all the front 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.700
 completely wrinkled is a detail that 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.799
 you can not afford what you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.190
 I recommend that to fold a pair of pants 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.830
 always unbuttoned the button either 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:05.280
 Brooch on the zipper and simply 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.280
 leave all the fabric inserted inside 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.470
 as witnesses tran 2 in this 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.870
 image you already have your pants 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.230
 perfectly ironed and from 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.370
 this moment is as always the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
 advice 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.560
 the trick with which we always abandon 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.870
 the videos the trick today is meant 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.280
 to people who do not have too much 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.950
 space in the closet 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 you have a lot of clothes a closet or 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.020
 closet very small in size you know that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.370
 I always insist that the pants and 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.350
 especially if they go with carvings 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.530
 ironed that I will recommend that the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.610
 mantengas hung instead of stacked 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.520
 as it is very usual then you go 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.280
 to use the following trick that I'm going to 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.770
 to comment to save a lot of space and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.140
 for this we are going to take a very perch 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.840
 fine in size in such a way that we can 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.760
 put many persia instead of hangers 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.750
 wider ones that will occupy us much 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.570
 more spaces we take the first pants 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.300
 we put it on the hanger and notice that the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.260
 pants their natural tendency to fall 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.330
 is going to be always down on the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.610
 area where she has more tissue 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.260
 well the next pants that 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.870
 let's hang what we're going to do is 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.570
 change the direction instead of 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.910
 hang it in the direction in which 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.700
 we have hung the first one we are going to 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.400
 put in the opposite direction of such 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.100
 way that the forces that are going to do 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.709
 of fall are going to counteract one to the 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.330
 another and it is almost impossible that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.400
 pants for a lot of movement that 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.100
 Do you really fall for it is a trick 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.750
 really sensational after having 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.790
 seen this video there may have been 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.390
 have any doubts have any advice 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.770
 or a good suggestion to make us 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.050
 just walk the video in the area 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.489
 the comments write us what 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.980
