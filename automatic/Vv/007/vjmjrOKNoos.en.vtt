fairly basic looking and doesn't really
matter<00:01:44.119> much<00:01:44.300> because<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> first<00:01:44.990> bit<00:01:45.110> of

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
matter much because the first bit of

these<00:01:47.000> options<00:01:47.479> anyway<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.050> so<00:01:48.560> after<00:01:48.800> you

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
these options anyway and so after you

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.080

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.780

but they can also be completely

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.770 
but they can also be completely
rearranged<00:03:17.250> which<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:18.120> nice<00:03:18.299> thing<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.599> that

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
rearranged which the nice thing is that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.020

you<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.139> use<00:03:19.319> nearly<00:03:19.739> any<00:03:19.980> key<00:03:20.250> as<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.549> quick

the<00:03:23.609> default<00:03:24.419> and<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.079> health<00:03:25.290> amana<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.889> on<00:03:26.430> D

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
the default and the health amana is on D

the default and the health amana is on D
and<00:03:26.879> F<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.359> kind<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.569> like<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.109> for<00:03:28.829> a

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
and F and I kind of like that so for a

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.530 
and F and I kind of like that so for a
little<00:03:29.099> while<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.370> set<00:03:29.790> mine<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.030> like<00:03:30.329> that

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
little while I set mine up like that

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.849 
little while I set mine up like that
until<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.900> gain<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.109> little<00:03:31.260> bit<00:03:31.379> more<00:03:31.470> skills

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
until I gain a little bit more skills

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.589 
until I gain a little bit more skills
there<00:03:32.459> already<00:03:32.699> looks<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.180> support<00:03:33.569> for

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
there already looks to be support for

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.270 
there already looks to be support for
game<00:03:33.900> pads<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.620> actually<00:03:34.769> looks<00:03:35.099> pretty

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
game pads and it actually looks pretty

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.770 
game pads and it actually looks pretty
easy<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.609> set<00:03:35.790> up<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:35.939> loadout<00:03:36.329> depending<00:03:36.689> on

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
easy to set up that loadout depending on

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.849 
easy to set up that loadout depending on
what<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.019> want<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.229> do<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:37.560> this

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
what you want to do and I think this

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.280 
what you want to do and I think this
game<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.459> set<00:03:38.790> up<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:40.019> where<00:03:40.139> it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
game actually is set up to where it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.140 
game actually is set up to where it
would<00:03:40.409> be<00:03:40.650> pretty<00:03:41.310> fun<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.669> play<00:03:41.819> on<00:03:41.879> a<00:03:41.939> game

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
would be pretty fun to play on a game

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.759 
would be pretty fun to play on a game
pad<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.930> would<00:03:43.049> at<00:03:43.139> least<00:03:43.169> have<00:03:43.439> better

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
pad you would at least have better

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.979 
pad you would at least have better
control<00:03:44.010> movement<00:03:44.879> around<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.479> camera

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
control movement around with the camera

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.020 
control movement around with the camera
opposed<00:03:46.439> to<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.609> keyboard<00:03:47.909> and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
opposed to you know the keyboard and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.550 
opposed to you know the keyboard and
mouse<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.479> might<00:03:48.659> want<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.049> choose<00:03:49.259> to<00:03:49.530> use

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
mouse you might want to choose to use

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.009

the<00:03:49.919> arrow<00:03:50.099> keys<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.759> move<00:03:51.150> around<00:03:51.299> therefore

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
the arrow keys to move around therefore

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.420 
the arrow keys to move around therefore
you<00:03:52.109> don't<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.470> much<00:03:52.709> control<00:03:53.069> over<00:03:53.220> your

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
you don't have much control over your

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.580 
you don't have much control over your
camera<00:03:53.819> at<00:03:53.909> that<00:03:54.030> point<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:55.079> after<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
camera at that point so after the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.899 
camera at that point so after the
tutorial<00:03:55.979> you<00:03:56.069> spent<00:03:56.280> about<00:03:56.340> three<00:03:56.759> minutes

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
tutorial you spent about three minutes

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.309 
tutorial you spent about three minutes
in<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.209> town<00:03:57.389> area<00:03:57.599> before<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.019> pick<00:03:58.139> up<00:03:58.229> the

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
in the town area before you pick up the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.929 
in the town area before you pick up the
first<00:03:58.590> quest<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.009> leads<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.459> into<00:03:59.699> an

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
first quest that leads you into an

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.349

anyway unless you're in the town area
and<00:04:35.330> I'd<00:04:35.780> also<00:04:35.990> say<00:04:36.259> the<00:04:36.410> same<00:04:36.530> thing<00:04:36.740> about

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
and I'd also say the same thing about

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.550 
and I'd also say the same thing about
the<00:04:37.099> in<00:04:37.280> instance<00:04:37.729> NPCs<00:04:38.360> a<00:04:38.389> ton<00:04:39.229> of<00:04:39.259> them<00:04:39.440> look

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
the in instance NPCs a ton of them look

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.200 
the in instance NPCs a ton of them look
like<00:04:39.590> they're<00:04:39.830> related<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.250> Luigi<00:04:40.820> for<00:04:41.000> some

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
like they're related to Luigi for some

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.999 
like they're related to Luigi for some
reason<00:04:41.539> and<00:04:42.500> they<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.979> different

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
reason and they just have different

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.170 
reason and they just have different
names<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:46.400> quests<00:04:46.699> are<00:04:46.789> somewhat<00:04:47.060> repetitive

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
names the quests are somewhat repetitive

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.909 
names the quests are somewhat repetitive
but<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.780> major<00:04:47.960> feature<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.470> game<00:04:48.500> gets

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
but the major feature the game gets

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.379 
but the major feature the game gets
introduced<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.490> you<00:04:49.610> pretty<00:04:49.880> quickly<00:04:50.150> which

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
introduced to you pretty quickly which

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.300 
introduced to you pretty quickly which
of<00:04:50.539> course<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.930> clone<00:04:51.320> slash<00:04:51.710> pet<00:04:52.070> system

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
of course is the clone slash pet system

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.879 
of course is the clone slash pet system
so<00:04:52.669> this<00:04:52.820> game<00:04:53.000> allows<00:04:53.300> players<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.169> clone<00:04:54.650> the

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
so this game allows players to clone the

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.920 
so this game allows players to clone the
DNA<00:04:55.310> of<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.759> mods<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.090> they<00:04:56.300> kill<00:04:56.509> and<00:04:56.780> make

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
DNA of the mods that they kill and make

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.839 
DNA of the mods that they kill and make
them<00:04:57.110> pets<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.470> will<00:04:57.740> fight<00:04:58.009> alongside<00:04:58.280> them

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
them pets that will fight alongside them

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.240 
them pets that will fight alongside them
it's<00:04:59.539> not<00:04:59.810> quite<00:05:00.110> as<00:05:00.259> interesting<00:05:00.710> as<00:05:00.889> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
it's not quite as interesting as you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.950 
it's not quite as interesting as you
know<00:05:01.340> capturing<00:05:02.030> dragons<00:05:02.509> and<00:05:02.630> Dragons

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
know capturing dragons and Dragons

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.270 
know capturing dragons and Dragons
probably<00:05:03.259> for<00:05:03.440> example<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:04.130> we're

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
probably for example but it we're

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.980 
probably for example but it we're
similar<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.759> crafting<00:05:05.150> systems<00:05:05.599> in<00:05:05.780> most

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
similar to crafting systems in most

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.379 
similar to crafting systems in most
games<00:05:06.199> you<00:05:06.860> get<00:05:07.009> DNA<00:05:07.190> by<00:05:07.550> killing<00:05:07.910> mobs<00:05:08.060> and

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
games you get DNA by killing mobs and

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.760 
games you get DNA by killing mobs and
there<00:05:08.479> are<00:05:08.570> different<00:05:08.900> drop<00:05:09.050> chances<00:05:09.530> based

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
there are different drop chances based

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.409 
there are different drop chances based
on<00:05:10.009> your<00:05:10.310> level<00:05:10.550> in<00:05:10.729> comparison<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.240> the

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
on your level in comparison to the

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.180 
on your level in comparison to the
monsters<00:05:11.840> level<00:05:11.990> so<00:05:12.320> it<00:05:12.530> makes<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.860> somewhat

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190

with a scroll to incubate now the clones

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.550

have a ranking system from v2a which is

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.290 
have a ranking system from v2a which is
essentially<00:05:34.009> their<00:05:34.190> rarity<00:05:34.639> and<00:05:34.849> also

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
essentially their rarity and also

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.969 
essentially their rarity and also

and<00:05:37.370> there<00:05:38.120> are<00:05:38.210> also<00:05:38.360> different<00:05:38.750> types<00:05:38.930> of

healer<00:05:42.650> it's<00:05:42.830> almost<00:05:43.009> like<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.340> class<00:05:43.729> for<00:05:44.030> them

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
healer it's almost like a class for them

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.240 
healer it's almost like a class for them
now<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:44.810> can<00:05:45.199> increase<00:05:45.440> their<00:05:45.710> ranking<00:05:46.130> by

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
now you can increase their ranking by

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.339 
now you can increase their ranking by
evolving<00:05:46.610> them<00:05:46.970> by<00:05:47.150> mixing<00:05:47.360> two<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.050> same

evolving them by mixing two of the same

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.890 
evolving them by mixing two of the same
clones<00:05:48.710> by<00:05:49.039> finding<00:05:49.490> more<00:05:49.610> DNA<00:05:50.030> which<00:05:50.300> can

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
clones by finding more DNA which can

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.659 
clones by finding more DNA which can
actually<00:05:51.050> be<00:05:51.229> pretty<00:05:51.470> hard<00:05:51.860> if<00:05:52.099> you're<00:05:52.340> higher

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
actually be pretty hard if you're higher

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:53.980 
actually be pretty hard if you're higher

ways to get the DNA or clones you're

ways to get the DNA or clones you're
looking<00:05:58.550> for<00:05:58.729> plenty<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.150> players<00:05:59.300> have<00:05:59.570> set
