like that alright let me know when you
get<00:04:06.290> your<00:04:06.470> radar<00:04:06.770> set<00:04:07.660> we're<00:04:08.660> good

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.130 

1:03<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:18.459> sounds<00:04:19.000> like<00:04:19.209> it's<00:04:19.420> going<00:04:19.600> like<00:04:19.840> hill

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
1:03 it sounds like it's going like hill

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.800 
1:03 it sounds like it's going like hill
but<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.530> radar<00:04:20.830> don't<00:04:21.100> lie<00:04:21.280> so<00:04:21.670> here<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.780> a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
but the radar don't lie so here is a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.630 
but the radar don't lie so here is a
perfect<00:04:23.410> example<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.920> using<00:04:24.100> their<00:04:24.280> own<00:04:24.310> prop

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
perfect example of using their own prop

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:41.150 
perfect example of using their own prop
did<00:04:25.180> not<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.510> enough<00:04:25.750> pitch<00:04:33.540> one<00:04:34.540> one<00:04:34.750> for

little bit about this motor is the
monster<00:06:45.610> jet<00:06:45.820> it<00:06:46.000> comes<00:06:46.210> in<00:06:46.390> two<00:06:46.540> different

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
monster jet it comes in two different

monster jet it comes in two different
flavors<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:47.550> 2,200<00:06:48.550> kV<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.930> 2400<00:06:50.740> kV<00:06:51.090> yes<00:06:52.090> I

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
flavors a 2,200 kV and a 2400 kV yes I

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.100 
flavors a 2,200 kV and a 2400 kV yes I
did<00:06:52.360> say<00:06:52.480> flavors

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
did say flavors

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.060 
did say flavors
now<00:06:53.800> the<00:06:54.430> 2,200<00:06:55.060> kV<00:06:55.360> is<00:06:55.620> supposed<00:06:56.620> to<00:06:56.650> be<00:06:56.740> used

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
now the 2,200 kV is supposed to be used

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.240 
now the 2,200 kV is supposed to be used
