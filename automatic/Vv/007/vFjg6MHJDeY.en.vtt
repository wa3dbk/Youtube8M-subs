very rare antiques or something like

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
very rare antiques or something like
that<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.750> they're<00:01:09.900> made<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.470> cotton<00:01:11.150> quite

a<00:01:12.180> nice<00:01:12.479> clean<00:01:13.439> white<00:01:13.770> fabric<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.909> thought

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
a nice clean white fabric and I thought

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
a nice clean white fabric and I thought
that's<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:16.110> cutting<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:16.950> two<00:01:17.310> fingers

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that's just cutting off two fingers

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.710 
that's just cutting off two fingers
should<00:01:18.270> produce<00:01:18.650> two<00:01:19.650> socks<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:21.330> try

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
should produce two socks so let's try

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.149 
should produce two socks so let's try
this<00:01:21.780> how<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.860> size

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this how they look about the right size

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
this how they look about the right size
they<00:01:23.400> should<00:01:23.610> fit<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.030> his<00:01:24.240> legs<00:01:24.479> quite<00:01:24.689> nicely

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they should fit on his legs quite nicely

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.760 
they should fit on his legs quite nicely

be<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.540> largest<00:01:48.990> part<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> cut<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
be the largest part I can cut up to is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
be the largest part I can cut up to is
just<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> curved<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.689> I'm<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just that curved there so I'm going to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:13.220 
just that curved there so I'm going to
carefully<00:01:52.200> cut<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.960> across

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.040 

like<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.459> think<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.360> meet<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.659> that<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:15.959> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
like so I think I can meet in that up a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.649 
like so I think I can meet in that up a
bit<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.379> as<00:02:16.500> well<00:02:16.680> nowadays<00:02:17.040> off<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.489> finger

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.420 

looks<00:02:24.659> pretty<00:02:24.930> good<00:02:25.110> might<00:02:25.739> be<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> little<00:02:26.159> bit

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
looks pretty good might be a little bit

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
looks pretty good might be a little bit
small<00:02:26.849> but<00:02:27.180> we'll<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.810> how<00:02:28.260> much<00:02:28.440> we

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
small but we'll have to see how much we

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.990 
small but we'll have to see how much we
can<00:02:28.799> stretch<00:02:29.159> that<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:30.390> sits<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.319> figure

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
can stretch that one sits on the figure

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
can stretch that one sits on the figure
so<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:33.299> are<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.599> fingers<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.200> I've<00:02:34.349> cut

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
so here are the fingers that I've cut

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
so here are the fingers that I've cut
off<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.099> see<00:02:35.400> they've<00:02:36.150> got<00:02:36.209> quite<00:02:36.480> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
off as you can see they've got quite a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.150 
off as you can see they've got quite a
lot<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.690> excess<00:02:37.200> fabric<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:37.860> finger

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
lot of excess fabric this is the finger

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.890 
lot of excess fabric this is the finger
turned<00:02:38.459> inside<00:02:39.000> out<00:02:39.030> there's<00:02:39.360> quite<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.690> lot<00:02:39.870> of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
turned inside out there's quite a lot of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.539 
turned inside out there's quite a lot of
excess<00:02:40.319> fabric<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.890> I'm<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.280> trim

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
excess fabric so I'm just going to trim

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.699 
excess fabric so I'm just going to trim
that<00:02:41.610> off<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.049> turn<00:02:43.349> these<00:02:43.470> back

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
that off and then I can turn these back

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.800 
that off and then I can turn these back
out<00:02:43.920> inside<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.390> there's<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.660> right<00:02:45.780> way

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
out inside out so there's a right way

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.869 
out inside out so there's a right way
around<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.379> we'll<00:02:46.739> try<00:02:46.980> them<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.489> the

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
around and we'll try them on that the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:57.500 
around and we'll try them on that the
Steve<00:02:48.480> Austin<00:02:48.840> doll<00:02:55.790> and<00:02:56.790> here<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.359> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
Steve Austin doll and here we have the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.000 
Steve Austin doll and here we have the
end<00:02:57.720> result<00:02:58.049> as<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.230> can<00:02:58.379> see<00:02:58.500> they're<00:02:58.680> not

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
end result as you can see they're not

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
end result as you can see they're not
quite<00:02:59.459> as<00:02:59.670> good<00:02:59.819> as<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.090> hoped<00:03:00.420> they<00:03:00.569> would<00:03:00.690> be

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
quite as good as I hoped they would be

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.130 
really short the fingers on those gloves
were<00:03:11.099> Justin<00:03:11.519> they<00:03:12.150> were<00:03:12.239> just<00:03:12.510> too<00:03:12.780> short

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.750 
were Justin they were just too short
really<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.920> hoping<00:03:14.129> that<00:03:14.220> they'd<00:03:14.430> be<00:03:14.549> sort

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
really I was hoping that they'd be sort

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.599 
really I was hoping that they'd be sort
of<00:03:14.790> more<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.359> man-sized<00:03:16.349> glove<00:03:17.250> they<00:03:17.430> obviously

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
of more a man-sized glove they obviously

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.970 
of more a man-sized glove they obviously

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
appear to be sort of lady size so the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.009 
appear to be sort of lady size so the
finger<00:03:20.430> length<00:03:20.609> was<00:03:20.819> just<00:03:21.180> too<00:03:21.450> short<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.900> as

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
finger length was just too short and as

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.960 
finger length was just too short and as
you<00:03:22.109> can<00:03:22.200> see<00:03:22.319> on<00:03:22.799> these<00:03:23.040> ones<00:03:23.280> here

you can see on these ones here

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.349 
you can see on these ones here
they<00:03:24.329> really<00:03:24.660> don't<00:03:24.959> quite<00:03:25.799> fit<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:26.819> I'm<00:03:27.150> gonna

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
they really don't quite fit so I'm gonna

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.750 
they really don't quite fit so I'm gonna
see<00:03:27.480> what<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.660> can<00:03:28.019> do<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.440> get<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.739> second<00:03:29.730> pair

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
see what I can do to get a second pair

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
see what I can do to get a second pair
that<00:03:30.090> has<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.269> longer<00:03:30.900> fingers<00:03:31.440> because<00:03:31.590> I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that has a longer fingers because I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.530 
that has a longer fingers because I
think<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.919> in<00:03:32.010> principle<00:03:32.579> it<00:03:32.880> should<00:03:32.940> work

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
think the in principle it should work

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.150 
think the in principle it should work
quite<00:03:33.840> nicely<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> show<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.500> mrs.<00:03:37.799> toy<00:03:37.950> boy

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
quite nicely so I show you mrs. toy boy

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.550 
quite nicely so I show you mrs. toy boy
the<00:03:38.519> socks<00:03:39.060> I'd<00:03:39.269> made<00:03:39.480> using<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.200> fingers

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the socks I'd made using the fingers

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.289 
the socks I'd made using the fingers
from<00:03:40.680> these<00:03:40.829> cotton<00:03:41.130> gloves<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.819> she<00:03:42.120> thought

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
from these cotton gloves and she thought

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.180 
from these cotton gloves and she thought
she<00:03:42.359> might<00:03:42.660> be<00:03:42.690> able<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:42.930> make<00:03:43.650> something

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
she might be able to make something

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.789 
she might be able to make something
better<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.959> she<00:03:45.959> took<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.260> fabric<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:46.680> was

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
better so she took the fabric that was

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.520 
better so she took the fabric that was
left<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.579> convent<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:49.079> backs<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.470> the

left out of the convent and backs of the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.250 
left out of the convent and backs of the
hands<00:03:49.739> area<00:03:50.099> and<00:03:50.400> she<00:03:50.669> cut<00:03:50.970> some<00:03:51.419> strips<00:03:52.049> of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
hands area and she cut some strips of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
hands area and she cut some strips of
fabric<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.650> were<00:03:53.010> about<00:03:53.910> 10<00:03:54.180> centimeters

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720

fabric that were about 10 centimeters
long<00:03:54.930> by<00:03:54.959> about<00:03:55.349> five<00:03:55.650> centimeters<00:03:56.400> wide<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970
