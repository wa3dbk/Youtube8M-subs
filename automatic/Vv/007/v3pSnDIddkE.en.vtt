feedback<00:01:03.760> time<00:01:04.509> is<00:01:05.259> also<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.740> temple<00:01:06.580> function

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
feedback time is also a temple function

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.219 
feedback time is also a temple function
on<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.509> stage<00:01:07.780> board<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:09.700> classic<00:01:10.479> spring

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
on the stage board and a classic spring

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.550 
on the stage board and a classic spring
type<00:01:11.649> reverb<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:13.479> actually<00:01:13.930> digital

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
type reverb it's actually digital

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.880 
type reverb it's actually digital
effects<00:01:15.070> but<00:01:15.790> those<00:01:16.570> effects<00:01:17.140> are<00:01:17.320> mixed<00:01:17.710> in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
effects but those effects are mixed in

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.150 
effects but those effects are mixed in
parallel<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.850> signal<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.690> all<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.740> signal

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
parallel to the signal so all the signal

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.359 
parallel to the signal so all the signal
in<00:01:21.729> our<00:01:21.970> signal<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:22.540> analog<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.890> effects

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
in our signal is analog and the effects

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.180 
in our signal is analog and the effects
are<00:01:24.610> added<00:01:25.090> on<00:01:25.569> top<00:01:25.929> in<00:01:26.259> parallel<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:27.069> the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
are added on top in parallel to the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.790 
are added on top in parallel to the
signal<00:01:27.610> so<00:01:28.149> this<00:01:28.360> provides<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.560> best

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
signal so this provides you the best

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.160 
signal so this provides you the best
punch<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.910> best<00:01:31.119> clarity<00:01:31.660> for<00:01:32.050> your

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
punch and the best clarity for your

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.190 
punch and the best clarity for your
sounds

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.560 

I<00:01:35.289> show<00:01:36.039> you<00:01:36.180> how<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> program<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.890> patch<00:01:39.700> so

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
I show you how to program one patch so

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.410 
I show you how to program one patch so
for<00:01:41.350> instance<00:01:41.710> let's<00:01:42.640> say<00:01:42.850> we<00:01:43.000> have<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.149> clean

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
for instance let's say we have a clean

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.660 
for instance let's say we have a clean
sound

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:03.170 

you<00:01:50.479> can<00:01:50.690> die<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.229> game

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.580 

what<00:02:03.990> about<00:02:04.080> some<00:02:04.790> delay<00:02:05.960> while<00:02:06.960> we<00:02:07.080> can<00:02:07.290> have

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
what about some delay while we can have

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.910 
what about some delay while we can have
it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
it

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:27.940 
it
tap<00:02:08.160> temple<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:14.130> maybe<00:02:14.400> some<00:02:14.990> chorus

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.430 

so<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.940> sound<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.510> hit<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.170> store

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
so I like that sound I hit the store

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.390 
so I like that sound I hit the store
button<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.240> address<00:02:33.240> one<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:34.590> my<00:02:34.980> preset
