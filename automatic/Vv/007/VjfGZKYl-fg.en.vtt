okay<00:00:01.849> so<00:00:02.270> the<00:00:02.360> first<00:00:02.570> thing<00:00:02.810> I<00:00:02.900> did<00:00:03.110> was<00:00:03.290> I<00:00:03.590> got

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
okay so the first thing I did was I got

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.110 
okay so the first thing I did was I got
this<00:00:05.090> music<00:00:05.480> box<00:00:05.630> thing<00:00:05.960> from<00:00:06.770> ThinkGeek<00:00:07.640> calm

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
this music box thing from ThinkGeek calm

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.870 
this music box thing from ThinkGeek calm
it<00:00:08.780> looks<00:00:08.960> like<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:09.230> I<00:00:09.550> sketched<00:00:10.550> a<00:00:10.700> few

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
it looks like this I sketched a few

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.209 
it looks like this I sketched a few
drawings<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.389> what<00:00:11.420> I<00:00:11.540> want<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.889> music<00:00:12.889> box<00:00:12.980> to

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
drawings of what I want the music box to

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.190 
drawings of what I want the music box to
look<00:00:13.340> like<00:00:13.550> then<00:00:14.179> I<00:00:14.300> calculated<00:00:14.809> some<00:00:15.080> of<00:00:15.139> the

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
look like then I calculated some of the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.590 
look like then I calculated some of the
dimensions<00:00:15.679> I<00:00:15.800> wanted<00:00:16.070> it<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.250> be<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.390> this<00:00:17.539> is

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
dimensions I wanted it to be so this is

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.109 
dimensions I wanted it to be so this is
going<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:17.960> be<00:00:18.110> a<00:00:18.140> nine<00:00:18.440> by<00:00:18.650> nine<00:00:18.890> music<00:00:19.820> box<00:00:20.000> I'm

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
going to be a nine by nine music box I'm

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.700 
going to be a nine by nine music box I'm
still<00:00:20.390> not<00:00:20.449> sure<00:00:20.510> how<00:00:20.720> high<00:00:21.170> to<00:00:21.230> make<00:00:21.440> it<00:00:21.590> I'm

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
still not sure how high to make it I'm

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.750 
still not sure how high to make it I'm
going<00:00:21.890> to<00:00:21.949> figure<00:00:22.070> that<00:00:22.250> out<00:00:22.310> later<00:00:22.430> but<00:00:22.670> I

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
going to figure that out later but I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.630 
going to figure that out later but I
think<00:00:22.970> it's<00:00:23.060> going<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.270> be<00:00:23.449> a<00:00:23.660> shortish<00:00:24.640> music

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
think it's going to be a shortish music

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.759 
think it's going to be a shortish music
box<00:00:25.820> I'm<00:00:26.180> making<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.869> nine<00:00:27.019> by<00:00:27.170> nine<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:27.650> it

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
box I'm making it nine by nine so it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.550 
box I'm making it nine by nine so it
fits<00:00:28.039> a<00:00:28.310> book<00:00:28.939> in<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:29.210> and<00:00:29.330> I've<00:00:30.109> kind<00:00:30.349> of

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
fits a book in it and I've kind of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.399 
fits a book in it and I've kind of
sketched<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.189> out<00:00:31.449> along<00:00:32.449> here<00:00:32.749> there's<00:00:33.289> the

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:33.409 
sketched that out along here there's the

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.500 
sketched that out along here there's the
music<00:00:33.559> box<00:00:33.710> book<00:00:33.979> I<00:00:34.190> think<00:00:34.609> I<00:00:34.879> want<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.149> be<00:00:35.239> four

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
music box book I think I want to be four

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.500 
music box book I think I want to be four
inches<00:00:35.629> tall<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.889> so<00:00:37.760> this<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:37.940> what<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.329> full

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
inches tall so so this is what the full

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.239 
inches tall so so this is what the full
thing<00:00:38.719> is<00:00:38.809> going<00:00:38.929> to<00:00:38.989> look<00:00:39.199> like<00:00:39.229> it's<00:00:40.069> going

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249 
thing is going to look like it's going

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.399 
thing is going to look like it's going
to<00:00:40.309> be<00:00:40.429> about<00:00:40.609> four<00:00:40.909> inches<00:00:41.179> tall<00:00:41.449> and<00:00:41.719> there's

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:42.409 
to be about four inches tall and there's

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.160 
to be about four inches tall and there's
going<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.589> be<00:00:42.649> a<00:00:42.710> nine<00:00:42.920> by<00:00:43.069> nine<00:00:43.280> base<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.170> on

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
going to be a nine by nine base and on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.379 
going to be a nine by nine base and on
this<00:00:45.920> side<00:00:46.129> I'm<00:00:46.219> going<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.399> put<00:00:46.459> a<00:00:46.579> book<00:00:46.789> I'm

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:47.389 
this side I'm going to put a book I'm

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.660 
this side I'm going to put a book I'm
going<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.569> put<00:00:47.719> a<00:00:47.749> wall<00:00:47.989> and<00:00:48.339> then<00:00:49.339> there's<00:00:49.549> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
going to put a wall and then there's the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.520 
going to put a wall and then there's the
music<00:00:49.879> box<00:00:50.120> with<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.389> music<00:00:50.690> strip<00:00:50.899> I'm<00:00:51.199> going

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
music box with the music strip I'm going

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.750 
music box with the music strip I'm going
to<00:00:51.589> tape<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.949> music<00:00:52.249> strip<00:00:52.459> so<00:00:52.639> it's

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
to tape the music strip so it's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:08.970 
to tape the music strip so it's
continuous

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.620 

it's<00:01:09.980> difficult<00:01:10.610> because<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:11.030> only<00:01:11.180> have<00:01:11.420> two

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
it's difficult because I only have two

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.570 
it's difficult because I only have two
octaves<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.140> work<00:01:12.380> with<00:01:12.620> I<00:01:12.830> just<00:01:13.280> finished

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
octaves to work with I just finished

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:37.280 
octaves to work with I just finished
writing<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.880> melody<00:01:14.330> into<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.230> paper<00:01:15.440> strip

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.780 

using<00:01:38.290> all<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.530> calculations<00:01:39.190> I<00:01:39.340> figured<00:01:39.640> out

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
using all the calculations I figured out

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.790 
using all the calculations I figured out
the<00:01:39.880> dimensions<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.870> box<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.350> want<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.650> be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
the dimensions of a box that want to be

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.030 
the dimensions of a box that want to be
it<00:01:42.010> need<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.310> be<00:01:42.400> seven<00:01:42.760> pieces<00:01:43.180> and<00:01:43.890> broken<00:01:44.890> up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
it need to be seven pieces and broken up

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.730 
it need to be seven pieces and broken up
in<00:01:45.250> half<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.000> book<00:01:46.990> or<00:01:47.200> something<00:01:47.470> can<00:01:47.620> go

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
in half so the book or something can go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.610 
in half so the book or something can go
here<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.760> box<00:01:48.940> itself<00:01:49.240> goes<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.720> and<00:01:49.840> so

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
here and the box itself goes here and so

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.990 
here and the box itself goes here and so
I<00:01:50.650> went<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.950> Lowe's<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.400> I<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.610> all<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.850> wood

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
I went to Lowe's and I got all the wood

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.850 
I went to Lowe's and I got all the wood
now<00:01:52.570> I've<00:01:52.750> got<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.080> sand<00:01:53.260> all<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.500> wood<00:01:53.650> down

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
now I've got to sand all the wood down

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.130 
now I've got to sand all the wood down
this<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:54.700> my<00:01:54.850> ghetto<00:01:55.120> facemask<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:55.900> don't

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
this is my ghetto facemask so I don't

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.710 
this is my ghetto facemask so I don't
breathe<00:01:56.320> in<00:01:56.500> yes<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:58.150> all<00:01:58.270> dust

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
breathe in yes it's all dust

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.290 
breathe in yes it's all dust
we've<00:01:59.290> got<00:01:59.440> goggles<00:01:59.760> let's<00:02:00.760> do<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:03.300> how

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
we've got goggles let's do this how

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.330 
we've got goggles let's do this how
unbelievably<00:02:04.930> hot<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.350> sandpaper<00:02:05.770> gets<00:02:06.130> when

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
unbelievably hot the sandpaper gets when

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.330 
unbelievably hot the sandpaper gets when
you're<00:02:06.430> sanding<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:06.970> down<00:02:07.180> it<00:02:08.080> hurts<00:02:08.290> so<00:02:08.709> bad

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
you're sanding is down it hurts so bad

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.680 
you're sanding is down it hurts so bad
hopefully<00:02:09.880> this<00:02:10.030> will<00:02:10.149> be<00:02:10.270> something<00:02:10.509> like

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
hopefully this will be something like

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.530 
hopefully this will be something like
the<00:02:11.050> final<00:02:11.290> product<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.300> see<00:02:13.420> I've

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the final product as you can see I've

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.590 
the final product as you can see I've
got<00:02:13.690> these<00:02:14.500> four<00:02:15.070> walls<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.239> I've<00:02:16.450> got

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
got these four walls and then I've got

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.080 
got these four walls and then I've got
this<00:02:16.780> piece<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.290> which<00:02:17.800> will<00:02:18.130> need<00:02:19.000> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
this piece right here which will need to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.500 
this piece right here which will need to
be<00:02:19.209> cut<00:02:19.420> out<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.489> spinny<00:02:22.270> thing

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
be cut out for this little spinny thing

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.979 
be cut out for this little spinny thing
so<00:02:23.410> there's<00:02:23.709> going<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> be<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> wall<00:02:24.160> there<00:02:24.400> and

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
so there's going to be a wall there and

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.229 
so there's going to be a wall there and
then<00:02:25.989> I've<00:02:26.260> got<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> top<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:28.000> this

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
then I've got the top and this

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.360 
then I've got the top and this
separating<00:02:29.020> wall<00:02:29.170> here<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.890> music<00:02:30.010> will

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
separating wall here and the music will

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.560 
separating wall here and the music will
play<00:02:30.810> by<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:32.080> cranking<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:33.450> it'll<00:02:34.450> be

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
play by just cranking this it'll be

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.930 
play by just cranking this it'll be
shorter<00:02:35.440> I'll<00:02:35.800> put<00:02:36.190> some<00:02:36.340> pegs<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.700> middle

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
shorter I'll put some pegs in the middle

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.180 
shorter I'll put some pegs in the middle
I've<00:02:37.690> got<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.020> stain<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.350> wood<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:39.010> wood

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
I've got to stain the wood this wood

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.729 
I've got to stain the wood this wood
looks<00:02:39.400> really<00:02:39.850> really<00:02:40.060> nice<00:02:40.269> now<00:02:40.620> put<00:02:41.620> the

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
looks really really nice now put the

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.410 
looks really really nice now put the
wood<00:02:41.860> stain<00:02:42.070> on

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
wood stain on

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.950 
wood stain on
all<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.440> left<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.770> do<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:46.030> put<00:02:46.240> a<00:02:46.510> little

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
all that's left to do is to put a little

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.790 
all that's left to do is to put a little
groove<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.530> one<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.890> these<00:02:48.010> three<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.650> make

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
groove in one of these three to make

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.210 
groove in one of these three to make
room<00:02:51.160> for<00:02:51.190> this<00:02:52.150> hole<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.630> needs<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.930> come<00:02:53.110> out

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
room for this hole it needs to come out

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.660 
room for this hole it needs to come out
so<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.490> guess<00:02:55.270> that's<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.600> next<00:02:55.720> step<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.370> did

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
so I guess that's the next step so I did

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.309 
so I guess that's the next step so I did
a<00:02:57.700> few<00:02:57.790> more<00:02:58.150> steps<00:02:58.420> than<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.780> probably<00:02:59.020> should

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
a few more steps than I probably should

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.120 
a few more steps than I probably should
have<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.709> this<00:03:00.370> tutorial<00:03:00.580> but<00:03:01.770> first<00:03:02.770> thing<00:03:03.010> I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
have in this tutorial but first thing I

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.940 
have in this tutorial but first thing I
did<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.030> made<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.300> notch<00:03:04.690> right<00:03:05.410> there<00:03:05.470> for

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
did was I made a notch right there for

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.970 
did was I made a notch right there for
this<00:03:06.160> part<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.810> cut<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.470> wood<00:03:08.680> with<00:03:08.950> a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
this part so I cut that wood with a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.510 
this part so I cut that wood with a
knife<00:03:09.840> then<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.230> started<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.190> gluing

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
knife then I just started kind of gluing

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.729 
knife then I just started kind of gluing
all<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.760> pieces<00:03:12.970> together<00:03:13.270> I<00:03:13.690> put<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.500> I

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
all the pieces together I put in I

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.170 
all the pieces together I put in I
screwed<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.820> music<00:03:16.120> box<00:03:16.239> part<00:03:16.570> itself<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
screwed in the music box part itself and

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.640 
screwed in the music box part itself and
this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.360> where<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> book<00:03:19.930> will<00:03:20.170> hopefully

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
this is where the book will hopefully

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.690 
this is where the book will hopefully
fit<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.190> as<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.590> can<00:03:23.709> see<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:24.190> part<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.489> kind

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
fit and as you can see this part is kind

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.070 
fit and as you can see this part is kind
of<00:03:24.820> sticking<00:03:25.150> up<00:03:25.300> a<00:03:25.330> little<00:03:25.540> that's<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.840> bit<00:03:25.989> of

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
of sticking up a little that's a bit of

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.550 
of sticking up a little that's a bit of
a<00:03:26.140> problem

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
a problem

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.130 
a problem
so<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.820> solution<00:03:28.120> what<00:03:28.870> I'm<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
so I have a solution what I'm going to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.920 
so I have a solution what I'm going to
do<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.530> I'm<00:03:29.650> going<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.800> stick<00:03:30.100> two<00:03:30.720> sticks<00:03:31.720> that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
do is I'm going to stick two sticks that

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.360 
do is I'm going to stick two sticks that
are<00:03:32.019> going<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.200> attach<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.650> these<00:03:32.769> walls<00:03:33.100> and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
are going to attach to these walls and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.820 
are going to attach to these walls and
one's<00:03:34.060> going<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.360> be<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.870> there<00:03:35.110> any<00:03:35.680> others

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
one's going to be down there any others

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.050 
one's going to be down there any others
going<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.040> be<00:03:36.130> down<00:03:36.280> there<00:03:36.400> it's<00:03:36.610> going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> be

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
going to be down there it's going to be

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.470 
going to be down there it's going to be
tense<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.110> it'll<00:03:38.350> make<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> rolly<00:03:39.010> and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
tense and it'll make like a rolly and

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.080 
tense and it'll make like a rolly and
it'll<00:03:40.480> stay<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.840> low<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.470> next<00:03:41.650> step<00:03:42.090> is

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
it'll stay that low so the next step is

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.550 
it'll stay that low so the next step is
to<00:03:43.269> put<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.959> top<00:03:45.900> see<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> put<00:03:47.260> up<00:03:47.350> all<00:03:47.470> the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
to put this on top see I put up all the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.470 
to put this on top see I put up all the
walls<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:47.920> everything<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.299> all

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
walls and everything and this is all

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.930 
walls and everything and this is all
good<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:50.530> morning<00:03:50.980> i<00:03:51.100> reglued<00:03:51.579> all<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
good this morning i reglued all the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.580 
good this morning i reglued all the
walls<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:52.840> going<00:03:52.989> to<00:03:53.079> be<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.260> little<00:03:53.410> bit

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
walls so it's going to be a little bit

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.500 
walls so it's going to be a little bit
stronger<00:03:53.920> but<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.790> see<00:03:54.970> there's<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.239> little

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
stronger but you see there's a little

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.819 
stronger but you see there's a little
bit<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.750> problem<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.230> there's<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.560> white

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
bit of a problem that there's this white

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.479 
bit of a problem that there's this white
edge<00:03:58.530> what<00:03:59.530> I'm<00:03:59.620> going<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.799> do<00:03:59.950> with<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.250> is

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
edge what I'm going to do with that is

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.670 
edge what I'm going to do with that is
after<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.790> put<00:04:01.000> this<00:04:01.120> top<00:04:01.390> on<00:04:01.540> I'm<00:04:01.810> going<00:04:02.560> to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
after I put this top on I'm going to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.850 
after I put this top on I'm going to
sand<00:04:03.280> it<00:04:03.430> down<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.850> I'm<00:04:04.090> going<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.269> restain

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
sand it down and I'm going to restain

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.650 
sand it down and I'm going to restain
and<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.070> we'll<00:04:06.220> see<00:04:06.370> if<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.640> fixes<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:07.180> but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
and so we'll see if that fixes it but

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.380 
and so we'll see if that fixes it but
today's<00:04:08.049> job<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:08.860> just<00:04:09.430> to<00:04:09.579> put<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.150> and

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
today's job is just to put this on and
