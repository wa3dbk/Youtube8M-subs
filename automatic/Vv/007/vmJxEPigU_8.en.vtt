00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:18.150
 Yes is a Hi cage is I thing it is today 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.240
 I bought a macbook pro so I bought a Mac this time 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.670
 I would like to 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:31.820
 By the way , as I increase through this course, how to connect to Big Online 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:34.160
 Is a way to customize the way the desktop of the Japanese language into how to update 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.390
 Then let's see 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.340
 The very first in that the first is that it is Well bought a Mac 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:46.700
 Let's lead to online yourself in wi-fi is here to lead to online 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.970
 So you can access the network of 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.480
 In my case, I could not do it from here either, so I made it to the system configuration 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.180
 It contains 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 Network 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.850
 If I connect to my network with wi-fi in my mouth 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.840
 I'm connected, but if you can't do it from the menu bar directly here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 I think it is good to go 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 Next time I'm connected to a car online, I'd like to enter Japanese. 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.200
 First since the English when determining the first etymology setting It is a case of I will not strike the Japanese 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.940
 Because 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:29.810
 I want to go to the source and text and add Japanese input 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.810
 By the way, because this Japanese input method was before, this method does not have that shop 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.090
 Well how 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.390
 If you want to know, I will make an annotation at the end of this course so I can see it there 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.670
 I will 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:47.229
 Let's update next when we can speak Japanese and can input Japanese 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 Software with Apple logo in the menu bar to check for updates 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:54.159
 Click Update 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:59.079
 Then the system will look for new updates 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.369
 The first update to buy a Mac is probably time consuming as there are many 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:05.350
 I will 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.290
 Since I don't think it's necessary to look at everything here , I skipped the download screen 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.270
 I will 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.400
 Without any of the installation to Let are usually you install After completion problem download 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.110
 I should be able to do it naturally 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.590
 Because there are many votes to update If you try to install at once 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.580
 An error has occurred, so it is a star. If you get an error when updating , divide it into several times. 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.280
 little by little 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.090
 Install 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.239
 let's do it 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.190
 It's annoying but if you get an error 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.190
 It is recommended to install the update one by one with detailed information 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.380
 Basically, this is the end of the update 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.420
 After that, customize your desktop to your favorite settings to make it easy for you to use 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.530
 I think it's good 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.930
 When you say whether to change anything if it is prima facie I 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:06.819
 Buzz changes mouse scroll direction 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.780
 And you can tap the click 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:16.019
 Of course, this is a personal preference, so I don't have to do it. 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.019
 If you want to change , please defeat in the environment setting 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.040
 Next is bluetooth and timemachine in the upper right menu bar 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.290
 I want to erase the ground 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:34.180
 These two are basically I do not use, I want to delete from the menu bar 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:34.180
 If there is a Decay Corps display, you can go back in the configuration again, so please delete it 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.790
 By the way, I did not mind, but if you want to turn off the display of the time and the date in the configuration settings 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.400
 I will erase it at the time 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.400
 The sound volume display and the battery display can save energy 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.500
 And lastly, right-click the document and download staff in the lower right corner and display the folder 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.460
 It will be changed to 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.380
 I also prefer the application folder over the document folder, so here too 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.380
 You can buy it in the application folder 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:24.630
 Well basically I think this is fine, but if more desktop customization 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:29.900
 If you want to the course Please also take a look, if good, because I did even before 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.900
 Well then this time is more than I want to finish 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.380
 me 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.490
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.490
 I am
