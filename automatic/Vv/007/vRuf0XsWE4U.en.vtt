00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I do not think it does not change much 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.020
 because in the other I think it does not have 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.269
 much difference does not have to come in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.320
 do the same thing I did and even 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.450
 best 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.610
 Look, I'm just going to repeat the question that I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.980
 I made it for the companion and it 's talking 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.710
 about that this persistence of neymar 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 what has been news worldwide is 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.510
 he and stay here in football 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.039
 when the trend is at least 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 for most of them would be that he 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.150
 leave at any moment and suddenly 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
 stay until 2014 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.820
 unlike what happened with 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.350
 other great soccer stars 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.730
 Brazilian in the past 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.829
 what can that represent 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.989
 From now on it he's a neymar 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.960
 Differentiated player is this everybody 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.510
 knows and he is very well advised a 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.270
 smart player too and I think 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.629
 he made the right choice to stay here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.699
 world cup will be here will be well 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.530
 seen is to have the same Brazilian football is 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.449
 better and I think it was a 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.589
 very intelligent decision of him and everything 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.600
 world is happy and especially the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.390
 people who can follow him closely 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.799
 because right player equal or márcio 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.460
 Surely Brazilian football feels 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.909
 I miss it if he leaves now but it's 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.220
 I think the plate that does not exist but the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.290
 how it was before playing in the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 europe or barcelona the real madrid by 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:32.280
 example would they refuse the proposal so 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.780
 Difficult to play hard to play on 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.990
 Europe is the dream of any player 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.450
 but it does not even begin 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 career now also he's new he's 19 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.780
 years and I'm starting my career too 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.490
 now it's something to think about 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.009
 he can propose five years from now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.509
 25 years still young, as I do not 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.490
 if enough time had to think 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.490
 happy in saints how to avoid as I am 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.030
 right 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.069
 Are you on the pre-list of the municipality? 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.569
 and will have the opportunity to play 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.930
 now against ceará 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.800
 This is the opportunity to ensure your 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.660
 your name on 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.040
 in the final list and is not among the seven 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.520
 which will be cut 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.900
 it is an opportunity the opportunity but 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.090
 This, I'll just work and wait for the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.670
 the Mauritian teacher's decision was to 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 very happy and I'm going to work and give my 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.080
 maximum to be on this list 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.900
 anderson you belong to a sector of the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.240
 team that today has great players and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.430
 You know this very well, so I'll do it for you. 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.000
 the same question I asked for vinícius 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.620
 also your partner in relation to 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.870
 eventually gain a chance at a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
 other team to have more experience 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.050
 to really show your football ee 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.990
 put in the media is what you have space 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.050
 that you have qualities 6 would be good for 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.790
 you are good 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.870
 Maybe it could be that it is not that 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.540
 It varies a lot, right? 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.190
 it may be that our team in a desert 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.250
 Could it be that I stay here? 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.530
 playing football is very dynamic, right? 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.200
 People never know what's going to happen anymore. 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 if this case the board reaches this 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.030
 A conclusion that would be better for me. 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.030
 Would you accept all that well?
