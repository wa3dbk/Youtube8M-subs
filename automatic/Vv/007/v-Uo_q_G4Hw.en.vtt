00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.170
 How about friends, I'm Ricardo Dominguez and 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.820
 we are in grace style in this 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.389
 program are you going to learn something very 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.550
 important style is not something with 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 what is born is something that is learned with 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.740
 the time and on the road 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.680
 this time I would like to talk with 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.960
 you about wines that are not 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.210
 Very popular are the sherries 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.370
 as such are wine wines for 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.320
 accompany the food or to drink as 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.850
 appetizer and have a series of 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.059
 characteristics that differentiate them 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.690
 clearly from other wines 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.970
 regions in fact is only called wine of 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 sherry that is produced just in 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 that area of Spain that is south of 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.930
 Andalusia is like cognac only is 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.690
 with jacques the one that occurs in the area 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.570
 of cognac is sherry only the one that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.320
 produces in the sherry area these 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.520
 wines are classified as different 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.940
 ways there is the fine there is the amontillado 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.490
 the oloroso the old stick and each one 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.899
 has different characteristics of 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.810
 made for example chamomile that is 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.240
 another of them is said to only be 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.429
 I wanted chamomile in sanlÃºcar de 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.220
 barrameda if it is raised elsewhere 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.950
 they say is not camomile 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.409
 geographical location of the Jerez area 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.530
 from Jerez de la Frontera 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.030
 is the first secret of these wines the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.219
 second secret comes from your process 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.750
 it's a different process from the others 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.420
 wines are harvested the grapes are pressed 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.959
 makes the first must and moves to the 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.140
 The barrels are American oak barrels 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.479
 and they are placed in three levels one on top 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.909
 from the other on this level to the top 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.450
 between the first must and when this 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.299
 first must is already prepared they are empty 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.829
 the contents at the second level of the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.650
 barrels and there has another process 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.140
 when the barrel is filled only to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.480
 five sixths and that camera is left 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.450
 of air is when the fine is generated and 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.910
 Chamomile why because at that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.269
 air chamber in that space on the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.690
 surface of the liquid is going to form a 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.329
 veil of flower they call them 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 it really is a veil that covers the wine and 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.440
 is generating breeding that's why these 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.490
 wines if you can take wines from 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.770
 breeding 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.140
 little producers are being created to 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.690
 little and they are trying to confirm 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.460
 the color and smell before passing them to 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.310
 third level which is the one in the 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.250
 floor and that third level is the one that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.380
 called solera soler is only the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.510
 wine that has been the ravaged of a 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.820
 third to a second level in barrels and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.820
 then at this level of the floor the others 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:04.640
 Sherry wines that are not even the finest and 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.790
 Chamomile are called oloroso 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.330
 dry stick and amontillado have 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 different intensities and these do 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.420
 oxidize through the year through a 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.100
 alcohol that is called vinous alcohol 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.800
 same that is poured in a sixth part 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.850
 of the barrel and that's what gives a 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.830
 taste an aroma and a different color to 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.560
 these wines that can be more generous 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.680
 that is to say more sweet because fine and 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.380
 Chamomile are characterized by being wines 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.500
 dry that are served cold us 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.280
 they have a little more sweetness in their flavor 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.290
 but all these sherry wines are 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.290
 lend to be combined with any 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.080
 kind of food with any kind of 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.840
 kitchens are not demanding in that sense 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.090
 They are very rich on the palate and are very 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.290
 generous as its name indicates with 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.360
 no self because it perverts the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.640
 taste of the food and leave one a 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.180
 intense hydrate taste in the mouth and in the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.069
 nose 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.599
 finally I will explain to you in a 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.000
 thing the wine glass of sherry is like a 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:17.030
 tequila horse is left to cool in 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.120
 a bowl of crushed ice is served 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.780
 the wine is allowed to cool the wine 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.840
