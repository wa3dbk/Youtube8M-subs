00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
first we'll start with a size floss

first we'll start with a size floss
about<00:00:03.030> 12<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.600> 18<00:00:03.629> inches<00:00:04.350> in<00:00:04.589> length<00:00:04.620> that<00:00:05.430> is

about 12 to 18 inches in length that is

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.130 
about 12 to 18 inches in length that is
pretty<00:00:05.819> important<00:00:06.390> because<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.870> fact

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
pretty important because of the fact

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
all I did was wrap it around the middle

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.290 
all I did was wrap it around the middle
fingers<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.230> couple<00:00:19.740> few<00:00:20.130> times<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.000> want<00:00:21.180> to

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
leave about a four-inch segment and then

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.660 
leave about a four-inch segment and then
I<00:00:24.090> put<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.390> thumb's<00:00:24.810> under<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:26.070> index

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
fingers on top to support it and you'll

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.730 
fingers on top to support it and you'll
see<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.550> taut<00:00:30.349> piece<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.500> floss

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
see that it's a very taut piece of floss

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.319 
see that it's a very taut piece of floss
at<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.130> point<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.640> full<00:00:32.880> control<00:00:33.030> over

at<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> arch<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.160> I'm<00:00:41.340> easing

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
at the back of the arch but I'm easing

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
at the back of the arch but I'm easing
it<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.120> scraping<00:00:42.450> down<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.170> side<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it and I'm scraping down the side of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580 
it and I'm scraping down the side of the
tooth<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:45.600> you're<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.899> between<00:00:46.020> teeth

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
tooth when you're in between teeth

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
tooth when you're in between teeth
you're<00:00:46.890> actually<00:00:47.370> easing<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.969> between<00:00:48.420> teeth

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you're actually easing it between teeth

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.950 
you're actually easing it between teeth
and<00:00:49.500> you're<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> ease<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.700> down

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
and you're just going to ease it down

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
and you're just going to ease it down
you'll<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.020> getting<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.520> surface<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.239> that

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you'll be getting on the surface of that

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.549 
you'll be getting on the surface of that
back<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> molar<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> front<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
back of that molar and on the front of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
back of that molar and on the front of
the<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.949> next<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.059> actually

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the one next to it so you're actually

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.139 
the one next to it so you're actually
scraping<00:01:00.989> each<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> every<00:01:01.949> tooth<00:01:02.219> surface

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
scraping each and every tooth surface

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.539 
scraping each and every tooth surface
there<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.780> again<00:01:04.500> you'll<00:01:04.680> ease<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.100> on

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
there and again you'll ease it back on

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
there and again you'll ease it back on
up<00:01:05.869> you'll<00:01:06.869> continue<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> you'll<00:01:07.799> proceed<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
up you'll continue and you'll proceed to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
up you'll continue and you'll proceed to
do<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.820> throughout<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.479> arch<00:01:09.689> again<00:01:10.880> there

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
do this throughout the arch again there

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.300 
do this throughout the arch again there
is<00:01:12.119> no<00:01:12.390> abutting<00:01:12.869> tooth<00:01:13.140> no<00:01:13.530> neighboring

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is no abutting tooth no neighboring

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
is no abutting tooth no neighboring
tooth<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.880> you're<00:01:15.030> still<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> scrape<00:01:16.110> up

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
tooth so you're still going to scrape up

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.260 
tooth so you're still going to scrape up
and<00:01:16.680> down<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.070> sides<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.640> those<00:01:17.909> teeth

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and down the sides of those teeth

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.830 
and down the sides of those teeth
they're<00:01:19.049> still<00:01:19.350> vulnerable<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:20.509> disease<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
they're still vulnerable for disease and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
they're still vulnerable for disease and
you'll<00:01:22.680> do<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.009> throughout<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> entire

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you'll do this throughout the entire

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
you'll do this throughout the entire
arch<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.750> again<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.460> want<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
arch and again what you'll want to do is

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.230 
arch and again what you'll want to do is
keep<00:01:27.450> changing<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.170> floss<00:01:29.869> by<00:01:30.869> wrapping<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
keep changing your floss by wrapping and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.170 
keep changing your floss by wrapping and
going<00:01:33.240> through<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:35.189> manner<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.850> you're

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
going through in that manner so you're

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
going through in that manner so you're
using<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.630> new<00:01:36.840> piece<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.110> floss<00:01:37.500> each<00:01:37.799> time

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
using a new piece of floss each time

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.960 
using a new piece of floss each time
that<00:01:38.280> you're<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.759> through<00:01:40.549> floss<00:01:41.549> holders

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that you're going through floss holders

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960 
that you're going through floss holders
you'll<00:01:42.210> note<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.280> enable<00:01:44.939> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you'll note do not and do not enable you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.670 
you'll note do not and do not enable you
to<00:01:45.119> do<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:46.020> using<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.470> same

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
to do that you would be using the same

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.700 
to do that you would be using the same
piece<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.040> floss<00:01:47.479> in<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.659> floss<00:01:48.899> holder<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.560> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
piece of floss in a floss holder so it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
piece of floss in a floss holder so it
would<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.950> important<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> moment<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
would be important in that moment that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
would be important in that moment that
you'd<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.110> by<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> sink<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.369> paper<00:01:53.670> towel<00:01:54.030> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you'd be by a sink and paper towel so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.200 
you'd be by a sink and paper towel so
that<00:01:54.329> you'd<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.600> able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.280> rinse<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.430> off<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that you'd be able to rinse that off and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.990
