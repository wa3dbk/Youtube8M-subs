00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
okay so we've got to eat talk down now

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.889 
okay so we've got to eat talk down now
where<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> showed<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.710> before<00:00:05.540> remove<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> cap

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
where I showed you before remove the cap

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.169 
where I showed you before remove the cap
and<00:00:07.340> then<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.550> will<00:00:08.760> review<00:00:10.610> the<00:00:11.610> crank<00:00:11.880> lock

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and then this will review the crank lock

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.460 
and then this will review the crank lock
position

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.370 

bolt<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:20.480> there<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> tool<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
bolt in there there is a tool that you

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.589 
bolt in there there is a tool that you
get<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.660> this<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.869> works<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.170> as<00:00:25.529> well<00:00:26.599> so

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
get but this one works just as well so

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.240 
get but this one works just as well so
once<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.650> place<00:00:28.890> check<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:31.250> lock

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
once that is that in place check it lock

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.870 
once that is that in place check it lock
it<00:00:32.430> down

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
it down

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
it down
you'll<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.230> tool<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.250> bit

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
you'll see that our tool is a little bit

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.630 
you'll see that our tool is a little bit
tight<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> end<00:00:36.860> okay<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:37.920> now<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> crank

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
tight on the end okay so now the crank

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090 
tight on the end okay so now the crank
is<00:00:38.820> locked<00:00:39.059> down<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.020> timing<00:00:40.739> mods<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
is locked down so the timing mods that

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.260 
is locked down so the timing mods that
we<00:00:41.309> spoke<00:00:41.520> about<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.719> place<00:00:43.050> again

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
we spoke about or now in place again

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
we spoke about or now in place again
automatically<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:46.020> we're<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.590> move<00:00:46.829> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
automatically now we're going to move to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
automatically now we're going to move to
the<00:00:47.640> camshaft<00:00:48.180> push<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> your<00:00:48.930> camshaft<00:00:49.489> then

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the camshaft push in your camshaft then

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.040 
the camshaft push in your camshaft then
you'll<00:00:50.820> see<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> lock<00:00:53.059> slot<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.360> there

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.150 

so<00:00:58.050> lock<00:00:58.350> slots<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.949> position<00:01:00.920> we're<00:01:01.920> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
so lock slots in position we're going to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.570 
so lock slots in position we're going to
use<00:01:02.340> eight<00:01:02.609> millimeter<00:01:03.059> shaft<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.430> stick<00:01:05.430> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
use eight millimeter shaft to stick it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820 
use eight millimeter shaft to stick it
in<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:05.880> another<00:01:06.350> camshaft<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.530> been

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
in there another camshaft has been

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.450 
in there another camshaft has been
locked<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:12.590> okay<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:13.830> sure<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.280> locked

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
locked down okay make sure it's locked

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
locked down okay make sure it's locked
into<00:01:14.880> position<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> put

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
into position then we're going to put

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.280 
into position then we're going to put
the<00:01:17.310> gear<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.610> you'll<00:01:18.479> see<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:19.080> just

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the gear on you'll see we just

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
the gear on you'll see we just
highlighted<00:01:19.650> them<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.100> back<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.420> two

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
highlighted them with back they are two

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
highlighted them with back they are two
marks<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> those<00:01:22.680> two<00:01:22.890> marks<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:23.580> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
marks and those two marks will have to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.640 
marks and those two marks will have to
correspond<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.570> these

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:36.830 

flat<00:01:28.650> surfaces<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.909> head<00:01:30.119> itself<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
flat surfaces of the head itself on the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.530 
flat surfaces of the head itself on the
inside<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> lips<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.640> bit

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
inside to the lips are a little bit

00:01:42.540 --> 00:02:04.340 
inside to the lips are a little bit
difficult<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.790> patient

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.960 

so<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> timing<00:02:05.830> chain<00:02:05.860> has<00:02:06.280> been<00:02:06.460> looking<00:02:06.820> at

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
so a timing chain has been looking at

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.940 
so a timing chain has been looking at
the<00:02:07.119> bottom<00:02:07.500> obviously<00:02:08.500> around<00:02:08.800> the<00:02:08.950> crank<00:02:10.950> in

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
the bottom obviously around the crank in

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:21.420 
the bottom obviously around the crank in
its<00:02:12.340> special<00:02:12.730> position<00:02:13.209> I<00:02:18.510> guess<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.870> win<00:02:20.430> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
its special position I guess I win it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:31.830 
its special position I guess I win it
slots<00:02:22.150> into<00:02:22.420> position<00:02:29.340> we<00:02:30.450> testing<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
slots into position we testing the

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.710 
slots into position we testing the
position<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.590> marks<00:02:32.950> now<00:02:33.299> just<00:02:34.299> obviously

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
position of the marks now just obviously

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.100 
position of the marks now just obviously
you<00:02:34.870> can<00:02:35.019> see<00:02:35.049> there<00:02:35.319> comes<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:37.600> has<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.959> be

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
you can see there comes one it has to be

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.479 
you can see there comes one it has to be
perpendicular<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.549> head<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:41.280> little<00:02:42.280> bit

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
perpendicular to the head a little bit

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.710 
perpendicular to the head a little bit
offset<00:02:42.730> because<00:02:43.420> when<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.720> put<00:02:43.900> your<00:02:45.720> game

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
offset because when you put your game

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.300 
offset because when you put your game
tensioner<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.380> there<00:02:47.560> or<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.769> cam<00:02:48.069> chain

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
tensioner in there or a cam chain

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.490 
tensioner in there or a cam chain
tensioner<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.140> move<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.350> little

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
tensioner it's going to move a little

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:12.240 
tensioner it's going to move a little
forward

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:22.630 

slide<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:13.489> your<00:03:18.190> game<00:03:19.190> spacer<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:22.340> we're

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
slide in your game spacer and then we're

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.490 
slide in your game spacer and then we're
going<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.910> put<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.660> cam<00:03:23.900> chain<00:03:24.400> tensioner

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
going to put in the cam chain tensioner

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.330 
going to put in the cam chain tensioner
obviously<00:03:27.500> it's<00:03:27.650> reloaded<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.400> real<00:03:28.610> and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
obviously it's reloaded and real and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.400 
obviously it's reloaded and real and
checked<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.640> it's<00:03:34.629> ready<00:03:35.629> to<00:03:35.720> be<00:03:35.930> able<00:03:36.260> to

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
checked so that it's ready to be able to

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.839 
checked so that it's ready to be able to
spring<00:03:36.890> into<00:03:37.040> position<00:03:39.549> basically<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.580> have<00:03:40.760> to

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
spring into position basically I have to

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:54.320 
spring into position basically I have to
take<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.150> preload<00:03:41.480> off

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.280 

all<00:03:54.810> right<00:03:54.990> so<00:03:56.120> that<00:03:57.120> done<00:03:57.390> we're<00:03:57.930> going<00:03:58.080> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
all right so that done we're going to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.230 
all right so that done we're going to
put<00:03:58.440> in<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.620> can<00:03:58.830> bolts<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.430> that's<00:04:00.060> where

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
put in the can bolts and that's where

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.240 
put in the can bolts and that's where
you<00:04:00.300> fine-tune<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:01.260> little<00:04:01.800> bit<00:04:02.010> left

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
you fine-tune it a little bit left

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.250 
you fine-tune it a little bit left
little<00:04:02.520> bit<00:04:02.730> right<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.270> then<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.960> can<00:04:04.080> also

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
little bit right and then you can also

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.200 
little bit right and then you can also
see<00:04:05.960> there<00:04:06.960> are<00:04:07.050> our<00:04:07.260> marks<00:04:07.620> one<00:04:08.610> of<00:04:08.730> them<00:04:08.910> is<00:04:09.150> a

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
see there are our marks one of them is a

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.440 
see there are our marks one of them is a
little<00:04:09.600> bit<00:04:09.720> higher<00:04:09.990> so<00:04:10.760> when<00:04:11.760> we<00:04:11.910> do<00:04:12.090> put<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
little bit higher so when we do put the

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.960 
little bit higher so when we do put the
tensioner<00:04:14.210> on<00:04:15.210> the<00:04:16.140> chain<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:17.130> snap<00:04:17.760> into

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
tensioner on the chain will snap into

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.820 
tensioner on the chain will snap into
position<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.200> going<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.500> pull<00:04:19.709> it

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
position and it's going to pull it

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.630 
position and it's going to pull it
straight<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.630> putting<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.110> cam<00:04:25.350> lock<00:04:26.310> cap

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
straight so putting in a cam lock cap

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.100 
straight so putting in a cam lock cap
again<00:04:27.800> closing<00:04:28.800> up<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.840> time<00:04:30.840> chain

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
again closing up the time chain

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.290 
again closing up the time chain
tensioner<00:04:31.680> from<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.550> side<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.910> see<00:04:33.180> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
tensioner from this side you can see the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.740 
tensioner from this side you can see the
tensioner<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:33.990> sitting<00:04:34.380> on<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:36.120> chain<00:04:36.450> and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:52.110 

it's<00:04:39.750> been<00:04:40.020> pillo<00:04:40.440> checked

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.380 

taking<00:04:53.120> out<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.630> cam<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.500> lock<00:04:57.100> and<00:04:58.390> dropping

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
taking out the cam to lock and dropping

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.230 
taking out the cam to lock and dropping
in<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.530> lock<00:05:00.740> at<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:00.980> back<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.820> now<00:05:04.970> if<00:05:05.090> you

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
in the lock at the back and now if you

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.110 
in the lock at the back and now if you
want<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.510> check<00:05:08.080> the<00:05:09.080> timing<00:05:09.820> that's<00:05:10.820> how<00:05:11.060> you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
want to check the timing that's how you

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.230 
want to check the timing that's how you
do<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.710> everything<00:05:13.310> seems<00:05:13.730> perfect<00:05:14.210> for

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
do it and everything seems perfect for

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:22.660 
do it and everything seems perfect for
now<00:05:19.240> we<00:05:20.240> rock<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.480> out
