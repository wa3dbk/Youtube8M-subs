many<00:02:21.350> ways<00:02:21.710> you<00:02:22.010> can<00:02:22.220> call<00:02:22.880> store<00:02:23.780> your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
many ways you can call store your

many ways you can call store your
collection<00:02:24.500> especially<00:02:24.890> with<00:02:25.490> efforts<00:02:26.060> and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
collection especially with efforts and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.600 
collection especially with efforts and
spare<00:02:26.570> parts<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:28.130> when<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.430> comes

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
spare parts and that but when it comes

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.030 
spare parts and that but when it comes
to<00:02:28.850> like<00:02:29.060> storing<00:02:29.450> your<00:02:29.600> actual<00:02:30.050> models<00:02:30.620> I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
to like storing your actual models I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.240 
to like storing your actual models I
find<00:02:31.940> some<00:02:32.360> lego<00:02:32.750> collectors<00:02:33.260> will<00:02:33.410> get<00:02:33.590> boxes

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
find some lego collectors will get boxes

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.240 
find some lego collectors will get boxes
like<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:35.390> stall<00:02:36.170> their<00:02:36.380> models<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:37.010> them

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
like this and stall their models in them

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.170 
like this and stall their models in them
and<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.870> how<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.580> store<00:02:40.580> everything<00:02:40.820> nice

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and that's how you store everything nice

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.620 
and that's how you store everything nice
and<00:02:41.210> safely<00:02:41.960> so<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.790> think<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.480> many

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
and safely so you can think of many

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.530 
and safely so you can think of many
other<00:02:44.930> ways<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.530> storing<00:02:45.710> stuff<00:02:45.950> there's<00:02:46.310> like
