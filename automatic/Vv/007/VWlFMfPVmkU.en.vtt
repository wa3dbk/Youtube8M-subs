00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.900
 In this presentation, I will solve additional examples about 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.880
 Simplify root phrases 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.990
 These include collection and subtraction 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.200
 Different radical expressions 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.850
 I think this tool is good 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.080
 If you have not seen it before 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.520
 So let's start 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.710
 Suppose I have a 3 x square root for 8 - has 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.836
 We previously learned that the square root of 

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.010
 8, or the square root positive for 8-- - 6 × 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.025
 Square root of 32 

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.950
 Now see what can be done to simplify the phrase 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.110
 First, the 8 can be typed in 2 x 4 format 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.605
 The 4 is a whole square, maybe you are 

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:37.400
 You realize that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.990
 They can be analyzed into 2 × 2 factors 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.940
 But I do not think we will need this step 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.770
 We can write 3 square root of 8 in this manner: 3 × 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 Square root of 4 × square root of 2 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.830
 This is the same as the square root of 4 × 2 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.490
 Ie square root of 8 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.220
 If this phrase is the same 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.890
 Then take a look at 32 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.050
 We want to find the square root of 32 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.650
 32 is 2 × 16 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.660
 Again, 16 words are a whole square, if 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 We can stop there 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.160
 If they do not realize this, they can be analyzed 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.230
 To the factors of 4 × 4 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.260
 Where you see that 4 times repeated 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.980
 We can continue and say that 4 is 2 × 2 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.940
 But as you see it's a full box, so 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.020
 We will stop at him 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.030
 This second phrase can be written -6 × 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 Square root of 16 × square root of 2 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.510
 These are here - I want to be clear - are the same 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.520
 Square root of 16 × 2 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 They can be separated as such 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.850
 Square root of 16 × 2 = square root of 16 × 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.000
 Square root of 2 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 We have seen that this is one of the characteristics of the foundations 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.000
 Now, what is the simplification of this phrase? 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.270
 This is 3 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.230
 These 2 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.050
 If we have 3 × 2 × square root for 2 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.060
 Ie 6 x square root of 2 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.880
 And here we start by saying - well, how much 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.790
 Result of this phrase? 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.260
 Positive 4 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.820
 If 6 × 4 = 24, × square root of 2 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.240
 We have not finished yet 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.780
 If I had 6 elements I wanted to subtract them 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.910
 24, how much do I have left? 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.290
 I have 6 square roots for 2 and I want to subtract them 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.780
 24 squared root for 2, well, this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.020
 Equals 6 - 24 = -18 square root of 2 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.420
 I hope this did not confuse you 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 And remember, if we have 6x - 24x, it will be output 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 -18x 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.870
 Now, we have a square root of 2 instead of x 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.090
 6 elements - 24 items equals 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 -18 element 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880
 Let's solve one another 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.300
 Suppose I have a square root of 180 + 6 × 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.470
 Square root of 405 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 This issue can be simplified 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.600
 Its roots, as we did before 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.250
 But you did not get enough exercise to do this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.230
 Let us then find factors 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.610
 this is 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.670
 If 180 is 2 × 90, 90 is 2 × 45 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.290
 And 45 = 5 × 9 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.860
 We can analyze the 9 to become 3 × 3 so realize it 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.550
 A whole square, but we can leave it that way 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.940
 If the first phrase can be written like this: 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.550
 Square root of 2 × 2 × square root of 5 × 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.420
 Square root of 9 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.120
 I will place the square root for 9 out 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.470
 If the square root of 2 × 2 × square root of 5 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.440
 × Square root of 9 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.360
 Now, how much is this second phrase? 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.900
 To analyze them to their causes 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.870
 405 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.670
 5 × - I think 81 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.970
 But even proved it, 405, 4 do not divide by 5 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.340
 Let 's move to 40 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.040
 40 5 5 = 8 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.340
 8 x 5 = 40 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 We ask 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.910
 We get 0 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.520
 Download 5 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.470
 5 5 5 = 1 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.100
 True, 81 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.290
 81 is 9 × 9 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.260
 We can analyze more if we want to extract 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.390
 The fourth root of this amount, but here we want 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.960
 Sqrt 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.910
 We have 9 and 9, and we do not need to extract more factors 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.360
 If this second phrase is 6 × 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.600
 Square root of 9 × 9 × square root of 5 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.260
 How much output? 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.140
 This is 3 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.710
 These 2 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.860
 This square root of 4 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.270
 If 3 x 2 is equal to 6 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.790
 If we have 6 square roots for 5 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.160
 + - How much is this product? 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.100
 Square root of 9 × 9 = square root of 81 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.380
 It is of course 9 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:09.190
 6 × 9 = 54, if +54 square root of 5 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.520
 And then, what do we have left? 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.120
 We have 6 + 54 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.050
 And equal to 60 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.400
 So 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.490
 Let's solve another issue and we will have some 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.750
 Shortcuts here 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.000
 Now we will deal with the variables 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.960
 I want it so I'll show you that 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.200
 Variables do not change anything 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.520
 Suppose we have a square root 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.300
 For 48a 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.830
 I want to add to it the square root of 27a 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.130
 Again, let's analyze 48 factors 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.930
 And we leave a alone 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.350
 If 48 are 2 x 24, 24 is 2 x 12 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.650
 Sorry, 2 × 12, and 12 = 3 × 4 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.250
 If we can write this first phrase 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.920
 Square root of 2 × 2 × square root of 4 × 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.590
 Square root of 3 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.520
 Maybe you will do this in a faster way 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.040
 You analyze it to 3 and 16 and notice it quickly 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.090
 To be 16 is a square full 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.190
 But I did it this way until I told you 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.470
 We will get the same output at the end 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.950
 Of course, not only the square root of 3, but also 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.210
 We have an extra square root for 3 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.910
 I will put the a here 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.060
 I can put them in a separate root, but both 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.710
 They are not full boxes, so I'll leave them under 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.250
 Root code 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.750
 Now the 27 is 3 × 9 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.040
 9 is a full box, we can stop here 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.480
 This is the second phrase, and we can rewrite it to become the square root 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.295
 For 9 × square root for 3a 

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:56.620
 They can both see - I jump on 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.750
 A middle step 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.970
 The middle step, I can write these 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.070
 The first expression is as: square root for 9 × 3a and then 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.130
 Go to this step 

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.210
 But I think you've got enough practice to realize that 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.510
 (9 × 3a) ^ 1/2 or that 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.970
 We take the square root, where all this is equal 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.130
 Square root for 9 × square root of 3a 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.080
 This is the step I jumped from 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.580
 But I hope, this did not confuse you much 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.140
 If this phrase becomes 2 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.990
 This term will become 2 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.220
 If it becomes our 4 × square root for 3a 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.840
 And then divide these on these, these 3 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.000
 We have + 3x square root for 3a 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.480
 4 + 3 = 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.930
 7 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.270
 Anyway, I hope this has helped you
