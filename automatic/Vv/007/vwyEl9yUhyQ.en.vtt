tank<00:00:27.439> up<00:00:28.439> upgrade<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.369> 55<00:00:29.910> gallon<00:00:30.349> my<00:00:31.349> up

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
tank up upgrade from a 55 gallon my up

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
tank up upgrade from a 55 gallon my up
created<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:32.099> three<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> four<00:00:32.759> months<00:00:33.090> ago

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
created about three to four months ago

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
created about three to four months ago
but<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> whole<00:00:34.260> system<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.800> technically

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
but the whole system is technically

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.090 
but the whole system is technically
about<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:35.700> years<00:00:35.880> old<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> looks

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
about two years old so I think it looks

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
about two years old so I think it looks
