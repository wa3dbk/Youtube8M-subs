chunk where this is kind of a medium
chunk<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:50.200> what<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:50.560> looks<00:01:50.830> like<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:52.150> take

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
chunk on what that looks like so take

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.440 
chunk on what that looks like so take
your<00:01:52.479> chunk<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.950> your<00:01:54.070> hair<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.270> to

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
just smooth through it a little bit put

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.260 
just smooth through it a little bit put
some<00:01:57.520> heat<00:01:57.970> in<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.299> I<00:01:58.540> drag<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.829> down<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.970> coil

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
some heat in it I drag it down the coil

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.120 
some heat in it I drag it down the coil
and<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:01.780> I'm<00:02:01.900> gonna<00:02:02.049> start<00:02:02.290> turning<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.920> as

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
and then I'm gonna start turning it as

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.700 
and then I'm gonna start turning it as
you<00:02:03.400> can<00:02:03.520> see<00:02:03.700> I'm<00:02:03.850> leaving<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.720> little<00:02:05.409> bit<00:02:05.619> of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
you can see I'm leaving a little bit of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.469 
you can see I'm leaving a little bit of
hair<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:06.280> at<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.520> end<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.030> doesn't<00:02:07.060> have

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
hair here at the end so it doesn't have

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.389 
hair here at the end so it doesn't have
a<00:02:07.509> perfect<00:02:07.900> look<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.769> don't<00:02:08.890> want<00:02:09.099> it<00:02:09.159> to<00:02:09.280> look

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
a perfect look you don't want it to look

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.390 
a perfect look you don't want it to look
like<00:02:09.459> you<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:09.759> curled<00:02:10.300> your<00:02:10.420> hair<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.310> you

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
like you just curled your hair so you

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.010 
like you just curled your hair so you
hold<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.880> there<00:02:13.060> as<00:02:13.209> if<00:02:13.360> you're<00:02:13.510> gonna<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.989> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
hold it in there as if you're gonna do a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.410 
hold it in there as if you're gonna do a
spiral<00:02:14.590> curl<00:02:15.069> but<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.819> thing<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.030> makes<00:02:16.270> it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
spiral curl but the thing that makes it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.820 
spiral curl but the thing that makes it
unique<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.020> different<00:02:17.349> than<00:02:17.470> gives<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
unique and different than gives that

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.970 
unique and different than gives that
beachy<00:02:18.069> look<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:19.480> final<00:02:19.840> part<00:02:19.959> here<00:02:20.410> which

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
beachy look is the final part here which

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.740 
beachy look is the final part here which
is<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.340> tricky<00:02:21.610> you're<00:02:22.270> gonna<00:02:22.420> pull<00:02:22.720> it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
is a little tricky you're gonna pull it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.900 
is a little tricky you're gonna pull it
out<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.319> instead<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.250> keep<00:02:24.459> pulling<00:02:24.700> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
out and instead of just keep pulling it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.580 
out and instead of just keep pulling it
out<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.239> actually<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.160> twist<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
out here actually going to twist the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.860 
out here actually going to twist the
curling<00:02:30.010> iron<00:02:30.069> twist<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.030> curling<00:02:31.300> iron<00:02:31.450> do

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
curling iron twist the curling iron do

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.860 
curling iron twist the curling iron do
not<00:02:32.430> move<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.849> curling<00:02:34.180> iron<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.599> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
not move the curling iron that's the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.660 
not move the curling iron that's the
confusion<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> lot<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.680> people<00:02:35.860> have<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.280> twist

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
confusion a lot of people have to twist

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.690 
confusion a lot of people have to twist
it<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:38.050> then<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.470> drag<00:02:38.770> those<00:02:39.069> ends<00:02:39.489> through

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
it and then just drag those ends through

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.900 
it and then just drag those ends through
so<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.150> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.480> has<00:02:40.690> an<00:02:41.910> imperfect

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
so that it kind of has an imperfect

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.089 
so that it kind of has an imperfect
bottom<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.629> it's<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:44.020> gonna<00:02:44.170> look<00:02:44.379> like<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
bottom there it's not gonna look like a

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.400 
bottom there it's not gonna look like a
perfect<00:02:45.550> girl<00:02:46.500> take<00:02:47.500> another<00:02:47.800> chunk<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.750> I'm

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
perfect girl take another chunk and I'm

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.650 
perfect girl take another chunk and I'm
actually<00:02:50.620> gonna<00:02:50.950> leave<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.700> good<00:02:52.120> amount<00:02:52.330> here

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
actually gonna leave a good amount here

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.510 
actually gonna leave a good amount here
at<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> bottom<00:02:53.319> just<00:02:53.530> again<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.129> kind<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
at the bottom just again to kind of

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.070 
at the bottom just again to kind of
differentiate<00:02:55.030> each<00:02:55.450> one<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:55.870> don't<00:02:55.959> want

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
differentiate each one you don't want

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.680 
differentiate each one you don't want
them<00:02:56.319> all<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.650> exactly<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.280> same<00:02:57.520> again<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
them all to be exactly the same again to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.150 
them all to be exactly the same again to
get<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:58.870> imperfect<00:02:59.680> look<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.099> you're

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
get that imperfect look that you're

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.970 
get that imperfect look that you're
going<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:01.650> make<00:03:02.650> sure<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.980> gets<00:03:03.069> hot<00:03:03.400> enough

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
going for make sure it gets hot enough

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.080 
going for make sure it gets hot enough
and<00:03:05.980> then<00:03:06.190> again<00:03:06.690> spiral<00:03:07.769> twist<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.700> curling

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
and then again spiral twist the curling

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.850 
and then again spiral twist the curling
iron<00:03:10.150> drag<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:11.019> through<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.379> as<00:03:11.500> bottom

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
iron drag it through that as bottom

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.820 
iron drag it through that as bottom
pieces<00:03:12.330> as<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.690> see<00:03:13.870> this<00:03:14.110> one<00:03:14.379> is<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
pieces as you can see this one is a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.759 
pieces as you can see this one is a
little<00:03:15.069> bit<00:03:15.250> bigger<00:03:15.459> than<00:03:15.760> this<00:03:15.910> one<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:17.530> I'll

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
little bit bigger than this one and I'll

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.030 
little bit bigger than this one and I'll
show<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.069> one<00:03:18.340> more<00:03:18.580> chunk<00:03:19.739> before<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.769> show

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
show you one more chunk before I show

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.430 
show you one more chunk before I show
you<00:03:21.069> how<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.280> finger<00:03:21.489> through

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.660 

leaving<00:03:29.190> some<00:03:29.490> there<00:03:29.880> at<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.150> bottom

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
leaving some there at the bottom

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.620 
leaving some there at the bottom
twisting<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> into<00:03:35.690> spiral<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.700> twisting<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
twisting it into spiral and twisting it

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.660 
twisting it into spiral and twisting it
out

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.860 

okay<00:03:43.670> so<00:03:43.730> you're<00:03:43.940> gonna<00:03:44.030> start<00:03:44.420> fingering

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
okay so you're gonna start fingering

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.000 
okay so you're gonna start fingering
through<00:03:45.140> these<00:03:45.350> waves<00:03:47.410> as<00:03:48.410> you<00:03:48.590> can<00:03:48.740> see<00:03:48.890> it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
through these waves as you can see it

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.100
