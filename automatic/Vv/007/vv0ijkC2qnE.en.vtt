intelligent one here he's the teacher of
the<00:02:10.160> Apes<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.670> I<00:02:11.060> really<00:02:11.330> feel<00:02:11.629> like<00:02:11.660> NECA<00:02:12.080> did

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the Apes and I really feel like NECA did

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.930 
the Apes and I really feel like NECA did
a<00:02:12.349> great<00:02:12.650> job<00:02:12.680> kind<00:02:13.069> of<00:02:13.159> capturing<00:02:13.610> all<00:02:13.760> that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
a great job kind of capturing all that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.970 
a great job kind of capturing all that
just<00:02:14.330> on<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> sculpt<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.110> guy<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.560> mean

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
just on the sculpt of this guy I mean

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.559 
just on the sculpt of this guy I mean
looking<00:02:16.280> at<00:02:16.400> his<00:02:16.489> face<00:02:16.670> he<00:02:16.879> just<00:02:17.090> doesn't<00:02:17.450> look

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
looking at his face he just doesn't look

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.630 
looking at his face he just doesn't look
as<00:02:17.720> mean<00:02:18.050> or<00:02:18.080> intense<00:02:18.620> as<00:02:18.860> some<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.519> other

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
as mean or intense as some of the other

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.940 
as mean or intense as some of the other
Apes<00:02:19.849> like<00:02:20.060> Koba<00:02:20.510> do

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.929 

all<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.280> let's<00:02:25.430> go<00:02:25.549> ahead<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:25.760> check

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939 
all right so let's go ahead and check

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.360 
all right so let's go ahead and check
out<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.120> articulation<00:02:26.959> on<00:02:27.049> Maurice<00:02:27.379> here<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
out the articulation on Maurice here the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.710 
out the articulation on Maurice here the
heads<00:02:28.549> on<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.700> joint<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.060> allows<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.599> turn

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
heads on a joint that allows you to turn

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
heads on a joint that allows you to turn
left<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.110> right<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:30.620> move<00:02:30.980> slightly<00:02:31.310> up<00:02:31.579> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
left and right and move slightly up and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.059 
left and right and move slightly up and
down<00:02:31.939> but<00:02:32.180> not<00:02:32.299> very<00:02:32.599> much<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.560> arms<00:02:33.829> are<00:02:33.950> on

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
down but not very much the arms are on

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.410 
down but not very much the arms are on
nice<00:02:34.250> ball<00:02:34.489> joints<00:02:34.790> at<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.879> shoulder<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.329> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
nice ball joints at the shoulder so the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.000 
nice ball joints at the shoulder so the
arms<00:02:35.569> can<00:02:35.689> go<00:02:35.720> outwards<00:02:36.260> forwards<00:02:36.890> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
arms can go outwards forwards and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.100 
arms can go outwards forwards and
backwards<00:02:37.220> he's<00:02:37.939> got<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> same<00:02:38.390> swivels<00:02:38.930> at

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
backwards he's got the same swivels at

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.869 
backwards he's got the same swivels at
the<00:02:39.290> elbow<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:39.920> well<00:02:40.069> as<00:02:40.159> a<00:02:40.190> standard<00:02:40.579> elbow

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
the elbow as well as a standard elbow

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.789 
the elbow as well as a standard elbow
bent<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.840> hands<00:02:42.049> are<00:02:42.200> also<00:02:42.349> on<00:02:42.560> ball

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
bent and the hands are also on ball

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.229 
bent and the hands are also on ball
joint<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.159> you<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.400> swivel<00:02:43.610> left<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.120> right

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
joint so you can swivel left and right

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.819 
joint so you can swivel left and right
as<00:02:44.420> well<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:44.930> rotate<00:02:45.319> them<00:02:45.440> all<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> way

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
as well as rotate them all the way

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.430 
as well as rotate them all the way
around<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:47.450> got<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:47.659> nice<00:02:47.900> swivel<00:02:48.260> at<00:02:48.349> the

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
around you got a nice swivel at the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.380 
around you got a nice swivel at the
torso<00:02:48.680> there<00:02:49.069> which<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.549> also<00:02:49.790> join<00:02:50.180> us<00:02:50.209> you

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
torso there which is also join us you

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.880 
torso there which is also join us you
can<00:02:50.450> kind<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.780> rock<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:50.989> around<00:02:51.319> though<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
can kind of rock it around though the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.440 
can kind of rock it around though the
long<00:02:52.040> fur<00:02:52.340> hanging<00:02:52.730> down<00:02:52.879> is<00:02:53.090> going<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.269> hinder

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
long fur hanging down is going to hinder

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.449 
long fur hanging down is going to hinder
the<00:02:53.599> movement<00:02:53.629> just<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.230> bit<00:02:54.409> same<00:02:55.220> goes<00:02:55.430> for

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the movement just a bit same goes for

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.979 
the movement just a bit same goes for
the<00:02:55.700> legs<00:02:55.909> you've<00:02:56.120> got<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.359> ball<00:02:56.540> joints

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
the legs you've got the ball joints

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.750 
the legs you've got the ball joints
underneath<00:02:57.409> the<00:02:57.620> fur<00:02:57.859> there<00:02:58.190> at<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.549> thighs

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
underneath the fur there at the thighs

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.640 
underneath the fur there at the thighs
but<00:02:59.450> because<00:02:59.840> of<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.019> fur<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.290> can't<00:03:00.470> really

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
but because of the fur you can't really

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.349 
but because of the fur you can't really
move<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.920> legs<00:03:01.099> outwards<00:03:01.519> very<00:03:01.730> much<00:03:01.909> but

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
move the legs outwards very much but

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.879 
move the legs outwards very much but
they<00:03:02.480> do<00:03:02.540> swivel<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.319> move<00:03:03.500> forwards<00:03:03.829> and

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
they do swivel and move forwards and

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.680 
they do swivel and move forwards and
backwards<00:03:04.069> slightly<00:03:04.459> you've<00:03:05.030> got<00:03:05.209> swivels

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
backwards slightly you've got swivels

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.149 
backwards slightly you've got swivels
just<00:03:05.900> above<00:03:06.139> the<00:03:06.290> knees<00:03:06.470> as<00:03:06.709> well<00:03:06.980> as<00:03:07.129> a

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
just above the knees as well as a

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.339 
just above the knees as well as a
standard<00:03:07.579> knee<00:03:07.760> bend<00:03:08.120> though<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.959> slightly

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
standard knee bend though it is slightly

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.839 
standard knee bend though it is slightly
hindered<00:03:09.829> by<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.159> for<00:03:10.400> hanging<00:03:10.700> down<00:03:10.819> over

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
hindered by that for hanging down over

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.849 
hindered by that for hanging down over
the<00:03:11.180> knee<00:03:11.299> once<00:03:11.510> again<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.049> then<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> feet

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
the knee once again and then the feet

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.649 
the knee once again and then the feet
just<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.579> hands<00:03:13.819> are<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.000> ball<00:03:14.299> joints

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
just like the hands are on ball joints

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.149 
just like the hands are on ball joints
so<00:03:14.989> you<00:03:15.049> can<00:03:15.200> rotate<00:03:15.409> them<00:03:15.709> all<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.069> way

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
so you can rotate them all the way

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.250 
so you can rotate them all the way
around<00:03:16.459> swivel<00:03:16.940> them<00:03:17.030> left<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.599> right

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
around swivel them left and right

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.110 
around swivel them left and right
so<00:03:18.650> overall<00:03:19.010> their<00:03:19.220> articulation<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.909> pretty

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
so overall their articulation is pretty

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.940 
so overall their articulation is pretty
good<00:03:20.239> on<00:03:20.299> this<00:03:20.480> guy<00:03:20.629> though<00:03:20.810> it<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.170> hindered<00:03:21.859> a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
good on this guy though it is hindered a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.589 
good on this guy though it is hindered a
little<00:03:22.310> bit<00:03:22.430> more<00:03:22.609> on<00:03:22.730> Maurice<00:03:23.090> than<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.420> was

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
little bit more on Maurice than it was

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.809 
little bit more on Maurice than it was
on<00:03:23.629> Caesar<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.409> Koba<00:03:24.769> because<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.579> longer

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
on Caesar and Koba because of the longer

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.420 
on Caesar and Koba because of the longer
fur<00:03:26.150> scopes<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.409> bad<00:03:27.650> he<00:03:28.160> still

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
fur scopes but not so bad he still

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.250 
fur scopes but not so bad he still
stands<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:28.940> looks<00:03:29.150> really<00:03:29.569> cool<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.810> you<00:03:30.230> can

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
stands it looks really cool and you can
