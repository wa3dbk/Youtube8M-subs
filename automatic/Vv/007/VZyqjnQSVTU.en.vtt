 pieces of 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.650
 it is estimated that we transfer two pieces 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.460
 to transfer 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.550

 cut out we find the feet 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.220
 of oval shape so that we remain as 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.220
 a magnetic 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.539

 and every day we will be bringing new 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.409
 ideas for us to make more winds 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.689
 cotillones while figures 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.789
 center of months many more details 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.329
 for children we cut our 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.329
 pieces 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.010
 already cut out all the pieces here the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.500
 I have cut 2 of the base of the portfolio 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.260
 two pieces of the handle of the portfolio one 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.440
 piece of 40 centimeters long by 8 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.440
 Wide 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.310
 and we are going to start at sea 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.620
 as my base of the portfolio and placed him 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.240
 silicon all along the shore does not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.520
 we put them all completely because 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.480
 then the silicone cools down and 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.510
 we started to hit our 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.560
 think we cut 40 centimeters 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.780
 So we put the villa on the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.610
 silicone / we can also have the rifle 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.200
 and with a cold only with silicone 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.220
 hot as always I recommend 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 hit faster 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.760
 and we already started hitting them 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.980
 we are doing it 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.439
 with the whole bank the portfolio we have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.129
 have patience because there is a 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.129
 little bit more 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.120
 difficult to put together but we can 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.190
 to elaborate 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.659
 because before it hits us well so that 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.640
 do not leave us to disarm at the moment 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.640
 that we put the trinkets or the m 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.950
 what we call the first 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.440
 based on the portfolio now let's paste 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.740
 the other 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.260
 we take our base and in the 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.260
 procedure we place silicone 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.030
 and we assemble it 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.610
 we go shopping makes me remember what 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.010
 this has to go well because it does not 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.490
 we have new supports where to join a 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.490
 comfortable 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.370
 you are solid that we are bringing you 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.849
 always so that they have variety for 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.849
 to elaborate 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.140
 elaborating the character they want in 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.269
 I'm going to do this with the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.910
 thematic of thorax of explorers with the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.610

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.340
 up to one meter which you can use 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.120

 we place the goodies 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:28.819
 I made some strips as indicated by 40 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.030
 centimeters by one centimeter wide 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:36.550
 to cover the details of the silicone that 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.550
 we always stay and place here 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.510
 and we paste it shows decorative strips 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:47.640
 so we cover the details 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.640
 that we left a silicone there 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.789
 always along the shore

 step by step how to make your figures 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.290
 since I also called you practical and 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.710
 materials so quick to 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.710
