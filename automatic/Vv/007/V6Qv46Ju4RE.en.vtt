00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
lot of windows a lot of windows used and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
lot of windows a lot of windows used and
it<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.880> connectable<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> another

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it is going to be connectable to another

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.499 
it is going to be connectable to another
building<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.610> show<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.270> guys

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
building so I will show that to you guys

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.210 
building so I will show that to you guys
in<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> later<00:01:31.229> video<00:01:32.060> yeah<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.509> now<00:01:33.540> I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
in a later video yeah for right now I

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
in a later video yeah for right now I
think<00:01:35.220> 3<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> probably<00:01:36.420> too<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.710> have

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
think 3 is probably too much but I have

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.520 
think 3 is probably too much but I have
put<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.390> together<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.590> sturdy

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
put them together and it is very sturdy

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.920 
put them together and it is very sturdy
this<00:01:43.530> area<00:01:43.950> right<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.270> I'm<00:01:45.270> also<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this area right here I'm also going to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.730 
this area right here I'm also going to
be<00:01:46.880> connecting<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> tiles<00:01:48.420> along<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> will

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
be connecting the tiles along so it will

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030 
be connecting the tiles along so it will
be<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.450> slightly<00:01:51.450> seamless<00:01:52.079> look<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.770> I

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
be a slightly seamless look to it I

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.240 
be a slightly seamless look to it I
guess<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.909> right<00:01:54.030> word<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
guess if that's the right word for it

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
guess if that's the right word for it
yeah<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:56.960> take<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> look<00:01:58.259> at<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.009> front

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
yeah so let's take a look at the front

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.510 
yeah so let's take a look at the front
basically<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.380> same<00:02:01.590> layout<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.369> other

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
basically the same layout as the other

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.469 
basically the same layout as the other
one<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.960> does<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> ATM<00:02:04.969> little<00:02:05.969> guy<00:02:06.119> with

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
one it does have the ATM little guy with

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.960 
one it does have the ATM little guy with
ATM<00:02:06.990> card<00:02:07.259> getting

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
ATM card getting

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.240 
ATM card getting
and<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.780> remember<00:02:10.050> fire<00:02:10.530> hydrant<00:02:10.979> came

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and I don't remember fire hydrant came

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.120 
and I don't remember fire hydrant came
with<00:02:11.460> this<00:02:11.670> set<00:02:11.880> or<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.210> but<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:13.080> either<00:02:13.890> took

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
with this set or not but I either took

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.630 
with this set or not but I either took
it<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:14.340> another<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:15.230> or<00:02:16.230> saw<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.710> online<00:02:17.010> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it from another one or saw it online and

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.300 
it from another one or saw it online and
decided<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.540> ahead<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:18.840> add<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.310> so

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
decided to just go ahead and add that so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.970 
decided to just go ahead and add that so
I<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.630> liked<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.200> my<00:02:23.130> guy<00:02:23.310> out<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> way

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
I really liked it my guy out of the way

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.080 
I really liked it my guy out of the way
so<00:02:25.980> this<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.220> actually<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.820> total<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.600> three

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
so this is actually a total of three

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.230 
so this is actually a total of three
Citibank<00:02:30.090> sets<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.720> believe<00:02:31.820> all<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.850> them<00:02:33.090> are

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
Citibank sets I believe all of them are

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.750 
Citibank sets I believe all of them are
off<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.770> various<00:02:34.770> online<00:02:36.410> websites<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.760> think

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
off of various online websites I think

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.699 
off of various online websites I think
bunch<00:02:39.270> over<00:02:39.420> two<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.900> them<00:02:39.989> -<00:02:40.170> at<00:02:40.440> least<00:02:40.590> two

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
bunch over two of them - at least two

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.440 
bunch over two of them - at least two

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
hallway on the second part I might

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.060 
hallway on the second part I might
actually<00:06:19.199> swap<00:06:19.949> out<00:06:20.190> this<00:06:20.880> window<00:06:21.360> right<00:06:21.389> here

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.840 

planning<00:06:25.280> on<00:06:25.310> having<00:06:25.460> like<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.730> little

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
planning on having like a little

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.430 
planning on having like a little
alleyway<00:06:26.480> back<00:06:27.110> here<00:06:27.470> so<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:29.600> might<00:06:30.080> make<00:06:30.140> that

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
alleyway back here so I might make that

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.110 
alleyway back here so I might make that
into<00:06:30.680> like<00:06:30.800> a<00:06:30.830> little<00:06:31.010> walkway<00:06:31.370> just<00:06:31.850> to<00:06:31.970> get

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
into like a little walkway just to get

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.620 
into like a little walkway just to get
there<00:06:32.950> obviously<00:06:33.950> this<00:06:34.190> is<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.970> corner

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
there obviously this is a corner

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.840 
there obviously this is a corner
building<00:06:35.870> so<00:06:37.570> it<00:06:38.570> will<00:06:38.810> be<00:06:39.670> anything<00:06:40.670> else

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
building so it will be anything else

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.270
