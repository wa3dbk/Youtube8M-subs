the effect that it has on a lay person

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
the effect that it has on a lay person
is<00:00:17.570> absolutely<00:00:18.570> unbelievable<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.320> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
will know lay people the magicians think

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
will know lay people the magicians think
totally<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> each<00:00:28.710> other<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.189> give

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
totally different to each other so give

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.049 
totally different to each other so give
this<00:00:29.460> trick<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.760> try<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.570> absolutely<00:00:31.349> amazing

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
this trick a try it's absolutely amazing

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.250 
this trick a try it's absolutely amazing
explain<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.270> spectators<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.110> want

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
explain to your spectators that you want

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
explain to your spectators that you want
to<00:00:34.350> give<00:00:34.469> them<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> demonstration<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.670> paradox

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to give them a demonstration in paradox

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
to give them a demonstration in paradox
so<00:00:37.079> get<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> card<00:00:37.649> signed<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> tell<00:00:38.879> your

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
so get a card signed and tell your

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
so get a card signed and tell your
spectators<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.629> you'll<00:00:40.079> cut<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.469> into<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
spectators that you'll cut that into the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.319 
spectators that you'll cut that into the
deck<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> you'll<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.059> shortly

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
deck and you'll get back to that shortly

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.389 
deck and you'll get back to that shortly
because<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.320> need<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> couple<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> other<00:00:44.100> cars

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
because you need a couple of other cars

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.389 
because you need a couple of other cars
to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> paradox<00:00:45.870> experiment<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.829> but

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to do this paradox experiment with but

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.979 
to do this paradox experiment with but
you<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.000> sure<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.539> explain<00:00:48.899> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
you have to make sure and explain that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
you have to make sure and explain that
the<00:00:49.079> top<00:00:49.350> card<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.980> their<00:00:50.160> card<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the top card is not their card the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.850 
the top card is not their card the
middle<00:00:51.510> card<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> card<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
middle card is not that card and the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.010 
middle card is not that card and the
bottom<00:00:53.250> card<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:54.000> their<00:00:54.210> card<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.780> if

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
bottom card is not their card but if

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
bottom card is not their card but if
they<00:00:58.230> think<00:00:58.289> it's<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> bottom<00:00:59.010> then<00:00:59.820> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
they think it's on the bottom then they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
they think it's on the bottom then they
know<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.270> sure<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> can't<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
know for sure that it can't be the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.460 
know for sure that it can't be the
middle<00:01:01.980> card<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.059> top<00:01:03.329> card<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.350> that's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
middle card or this top card and that's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
middle card or this top card and that's
of<00:01:04.650> course<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.979> want<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.330> seen

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of course you want it to be so they seen

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.120 
of course you want it to be so they seen
it<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> bottom<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.590> top<00:01:07.619> how<00:01:08.100> about

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it on the bottom and the top how about

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.539 
it on the bottom and the top how about
the<00:01:08.430> middle<00:01:08.790> map<00:01:09.710> yes<00:01:10.710> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> be

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the middle map yes if you want it to be

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.830 
the middle map yes if you want it to be
that's<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> interesting<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.780> about

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that's the interesting thing about

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's the interesting thing about
paradox<00:01:13.470> don't<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> think<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.700> hear

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
paradox don't you think they hear

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
paradox don't you think they hear
something<00:01:15.180> really<00:01:15.330> interesting<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.290> faces

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
something really interesting the faces

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
something really interesting the faces
of<00:01:16.860> these<00:01:16.979> cards<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:18.450> had<00:01:18.720> no

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of these cards actually they had no

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
of these cards actually they had no
identity<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.070> bottom<00:01:20.460> card<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.030> no<00:01:21.240> identity

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
identity the bottom card has no identity

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
identity the bottom card has no identity
of<00:01:22.229> course<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.890> top<00:01:23.130> part<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.640> no<00:01:23.880> identity

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of course the top part has no identity

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.330 
of course the top part has no identity
and<00:01:24.840> naturally<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> middle<00:01:25.740> card<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.130> both

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and naturally the middle card on both

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
and naturally the middle card on both
sides<00:01:26.670> has<00:01:26.939> no<00:01:27.150> identity

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
sides has no identity

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
sides has no identity
in<00:01:28.200> fact<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.650> quicker<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.880> turn

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
in fact it's quicker if you just turn

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.940 
in fact it's quicker if you just turn
round<00:01:30.240> say<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.780> none<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.470> cards

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
round say that none of these cards

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
round say that none of these cards
actually<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.640> any<00:01:32.820> identities<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
actually have any identities but this is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.590 
actually have any identities but this is
an<00:01:34.560> illusion<00:01:35.100> because<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.970> wrote<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
an illusion because if I wrote like this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
an illusion because if I wrote like this
the<00:01:36.810> identity<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:37.619> instantly<00:01:38.340> start<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
