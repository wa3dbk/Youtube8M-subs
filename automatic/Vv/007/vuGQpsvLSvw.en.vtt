00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 my audience is vaz, my name is Ruslan Rav and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.089
 I have long been on the Koran was not a review 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.890
 servers and today I found a server 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.189
 minecraft which is called ender 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.189
 craft 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.039
 the first thing we have in it is 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.810
 that it has 300 slots and here 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.880
 really high online for this 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160
 the moment just passed the wipe and 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.169
 there are very often clogged slots with you 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.180
 you can play with your friends 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.219
 This server has a flight 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.890
 available to anyone through the fly command 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.440
 now change the creative further what i wanted 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.390
 notice an important menu skiter 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.100
 it gives you a compass compass is already 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.589
 very interesting here you can 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.930
 back on spam join in any 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.610
 clan which is on the server go to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.879
 a store that is still being set up 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.860
 but he is very comfortable with consoles here 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.080
 on but it's only for administrators 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.549
 go to pvp 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.159
 go to work ie choose any 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.229
 work because of donat in general is the same 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.030
 on the server very often there is a hand I 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.189
 just come by for x and that's what i 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.560
 picked up on the server all the cool swords 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.600
 look like not enchanted is all 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.159
 especially for pvp probably also do 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.619
 the server keeps on its own 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.170
 hosting on your machine is also very 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.329
 good and it will fall less and all 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.789
 time will work online without lags 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.920
 as you can see no one twitches either 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.920
 shop in the shop is free 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.329
 diamonds so we went into shock on there 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.840
 buy menu sell menu 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.679
 an accomplishment let's go into the battle menu and 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.399
 what can we buy here in my menu 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:43.639
 material and there is a diamond for the price of 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.229
 1 dollar is very cheap but from the fact that 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:47.030
 I can't buy in creativity in general 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.340
 here diesel prices are cheap you 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.139
 you can buy something and it is only 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.969
 brief information about this server on 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:54.319
 there are still many other goodies in it 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.999
 Generally I think this this server 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.310
 great for those who love pvp 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.859
 fight and also for those who want 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.200
