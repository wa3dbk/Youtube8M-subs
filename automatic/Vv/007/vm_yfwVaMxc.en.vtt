00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
and that was just something that I kind

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.930 
and that was just something that I kind
of<00:03:57.650> think<00:03:57.860> that<00:03:58.070> anyone<00:03:58.459> could<00:03:58.640> have<00:03:58.760> taken

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
of think that anyone could have taken

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.310 
of think that anyone could have taken
away<00:03:59.209> from<00:03:59.270> this<00:03:59.510> episode<00:03:59.959> I<00:03:59.990> thinking

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
away from this episode I thinking

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.890 
away from this episode I thinking
something<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.680> Illustrated<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:02.209> liked<00:04:02.630> it

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
something it Illustrated and I liked it

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.740 
something it Illustrated and I liked it
the<00:04:03.350> last<00:04:03.620> piece<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.300> awesome<00:04:05.300> character

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
the last piece of awesome character

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.660 
the last piece of awesome character
development<00:04:06.140> that<00:04:06.320> I<00:04:06.410> loved<00:04:06.740> in<00:04:06.920> this<00:04:07.070> was

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
development that I loved in this was

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.090 
development that I loved in this was
toward<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.120> beginning<00:04:08.209> was<00:04:09.080> from<00:04:09.350> Ren<00:04:09.590> when

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
toward the beginning was from Ren when

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.250 
toward the beginning was from Ren when
he<00:04:10.220> handed<00:04:10.760> go<00:04:11.140> his<00:04:12.140> dad's<00:04:12.500> photo<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.570> I<00:04:14.570> mean

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
he handed go his dad's photo and I mean

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.620 
he handed go his dad's photo and I mean
it<00:04:15.380> was<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:15.530> such<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.520> know<00:04:16.640> 30<00:04:17.090> second

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
it was so such a you know 30 second

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.020 
it was so such a you know 30 second
thing<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.200> anime<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:19.580> massive

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
thing in the anime but it's so massive

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.260 
thing in the anime but it's so massive
because<00:04:20.959> his<00:04:21.140> entire<00:04:21.590> goal<00:04:22.040> for<00:04:22.340> swimming<00:04:22.640> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
because his entire goal for swimming to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.500 
because his entire goal for swimming to
become<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.020> good<00:04:24.380> has<00:04:24.950> been<00:04:25.310> one<00:04:25.730> Haruka<00:04:26.330> but

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
become so good has been one Haruka but

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.320 
become so good has been one Haruka but
mainly<00:04:26.840> his<00:04:27.290> dad<00:04:27.620> he<00:04:28.310> wanted<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.820> honor<00:04:29.030> his

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
mainly his dad he wanted to honor his

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.390 
mainly his dad he wanted to honor his
dad's<00:04:29.720> memory<00:04:30.320> he<00:04:30.530> wanted<00:04:30.830> to<00:04:30.890> be

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
dad's memory he wanted to be

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.700 
dad's memory he wanted to be
his<00:04:31.520> dad<00:04:31.729> wanted<00:04:32.270> him<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.540> be<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.900> he<00:04:33.410> kind<00:04:33.650> of

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
his dad wanted him to be and he kind of

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.320 
his dad wanted him to be and he kind of
felt<00:04:33.919> like<00:04:33.979> a<00:04:34.070> failure<00:04:34.340> when<00:04:34.790> Australia

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
felt like a failure when Australia

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.850 
felt like a failure when Australia
didn't<00:04:35.630> go<00:04:35.810> with<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.050> exact<00:04:36.410> way<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.830> think

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
didn't go with the exact way and I think

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.120 
didn't go with the exact way and I think
that<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.669> past<00:04:37.880> he's<00:04:38.150> kind<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.509> connected

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
that in the past he's kind of connected

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.430 
that in the past he's kind of connected
beating<00:04:40.130> haruka<00:04:40.789> is<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.060> only<00:04:41.270> way<00:04:41.720> that<00:04:42.229> I

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
beating haruka is the only way that I

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.980 
beating haruka is the only way that I
can<00:04:42.500> live<00:04:43.039> up<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.250> what<00:04:43.430> my<00:04:43.850> dad<00:04:44.210> wanted<00:04:44.720> me<00:04:44.780> to

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
can live up to what my dad wanted me to

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.800 
can live up to what my dad wanted me to
be<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.100> I<00:04:46.610> think<00:04:46.669> that<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.090> know<00:04:47.210> passing<00:04:47.509> on

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
be and I think that you know passing on

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.779 
be and I think that you know passing on
to<00:04:47.930> go<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.259> saying<00:04:48.560> literally<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.070> don't<00:04:49.490> need

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
to go and saying literally I don't need

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.110 
to go and saying literally I don't need
it<00:04:49.940> anymore<00:04:50.180> means<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.530> he's<00:04:51.919> gotten<00:04:52.759> over

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
it anymore means that he's gotten over

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.330 
it anymore means that he's gotten over
and<00:04:53.270> decided<00:04:53.690> that<00:04:53.870> that's<00:04:54.530> not<00:04:54.919> what<00:04:55.160> defines

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
and decided that that's not what defines

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.700 
and decided that that's not what defines
him<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.330> he's<00:04:56.690> going<00:04:56.960> to<00:04:57.050> be<00:04:57.229> what<00:04:57.440> pushes

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
him that he's going to be what pushes

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.360 
him that he's going to be what pushes
him<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.550> he's<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:59.060> going<00:04:59.419> to<00:04:59.449> use<00:05:00.320> just<00:05:00.979> some

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
him that he's not going to use just some

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.790 
him that he's not going to use just some
obstacle<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.690> push<00:05:02.900> him<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.259> he's<00:05:03.440> going<00:05:03.650> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
obstacle to push him that he's going to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.400 
obstacle to push him that he's going to
do<00:05:03.919> it<00:05:03.949> himself<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.570> obstacles<00:05:06.110> there

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
do it himself and the obstacles there

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.529 
do it himself and the obstacles there
but<00:05:06.650> that's<00:05:06.919> just<00:05:07.190> extra<00:05:07.639> drive<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.389> that's

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
but that's just extra drive but that's

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.600 
but that's just extra drive but that's
not<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.900> reason<00:05:08.930> he's<00:05:09.590> doing<00:05:10.039> it<00:05:10.190> he's<00:05:10.370> doing

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
not the reason he's doing it he's doing

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.469 
not the reason he's doing it he's doing
it<00:05:11.000> for<00:05:11.240> him<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.900> his<00:05:12.710> dad<00:05:12.979> but<00:05:13.370> not<00:05:13.850> just<00:05:14.300> his
