now
I<00:01:18.270> highly<00:01:18.630> recommend<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.470> start<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I highly recommend that you start up a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.609 
I highly recommend that you start up a
pumpkin<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.939> melon<00:01:21.659> farm<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.409> use

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
pumpkin or a melon farm and then use

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
pumpkin or a melon farm and then use
those<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.280> research<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> cuisine<00:01:24.060> because

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
those as research in the cuisine because

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.660 
those as research in the cuisine because
it'll<00:01:24.630> boost<00:01:24.810> your<00:01:25.020> chances<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.770> 6<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> then

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it'll boost your chances to 6 and then

it'll boost your chances to 6 and then
9%<00:01:27.479> respectively<00:01:28.460> so<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.540> now

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
9% respectively so what do we do now now

lots<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.720> lots<00:03:04.959> of<00:03:05.170> paint<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.940> are<00:03:07.000> you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
lots and lots of paint so what are you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.789 
lots and lots of paint so what are you
gonna<00:03:07.299> do<00:03:07.510> about<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.780> paint<00:03:08.200> we<00:03:08.379> need<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.560> way

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
gonna do about that paint we need a way

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.610 
gonna do about that paint we need a way
to<00:03:08.829> monitor<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.970> because<00:03:10.480> it's<00:03:10.959> not<00:03:11.140> good<00:03:11.410> to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
to monitor it because it's not good to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.650 
to monitor it because it's not good to
have<00:03:11.739> an<00:03:11.890> area<00:03:12.129> completely<00:03:12.609> painted<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.540> the

first thing we're so the next thing
we're<00:03:14.950> gonna<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.220> we're<00:03:15.609> gonna<00:03:15.670> make<00:03:15.879> a<00:03:15.910> vis

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
we're gonna do is we're gonna make a vis

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.569 
we're gonna do is we're gonna make a vis
