00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
for one round I've also been asked will

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.750 
for one round I've also been asked will
I<00:01:46.430> be<00:01:46.490> trying<00:01:46.820> for<00:01:46.909> 200<00:01:47.509> again<00:01:50.050> No

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.450 
I definitely will not be after this game
and<00:01:56.300> it's<00:01:57.290> not<00:01:57.470> because<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:57.830> don't<00:01:58.010> think<00:01:58.070> I<00:01:58.310> can

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
and it's not because I don't think I can

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.000 
and it's not because I don't think I can
do<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.610> I<00:01:58.940> don't<00:01:59.540> feel<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.230> possible<00:02:00.770> at<00:02:00.860> this

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
do it I don't feel it's possible at this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.920 
do it I don't feel it's possible at this
point<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:02.750> xbox<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:04.600> since<00:02:05.600> there's<00:02:05.780> too

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
point on on xbox it since there's too

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.260 
point on on xbox it since there's too
many<00:02:06.050> factors<00:02:06.620> that<00:02:06.680> I<00:02:07.280> would<00:02:07.730> probably<00:02:07.940> get<00:02:08.240> a

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
many factors that I would probably get a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.100 
many factors that I would probably get a
new<00:02:08.390> reset<00:02:08.780> before<00:02:08.990> ever<00:02:09.710> hitting<00:02:10.070> 200<00:02:11.110> in

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
new reset before ever hitting 200 in

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.610 
new reset before ever hitting 200 in
this<00:02:12.320> game<00:02:12.530> for<00:02:12.710> example<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.220> feel<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.700> I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
this game for example I feel like I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.810 
this game for example I feel like I
played<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.770> as<00:02:15.860> best<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.220> could<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.490> don't<00:02:16.610> have

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
played it as best I could I don't have

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.190 
played it as best I could I don't have
any<00:02:16.910> regrets<00:02:17.090> about<00:02:17.360> as<00:02:17.630> I've<00:02:17.750> played<00:02:17.960> it<00:02:18.050> as

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
any regrets about as I've played it as

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.360 
any regrets about as I've played it as
fast<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.710> I<00:02:18.830> could

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
fast as I could

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.390 
fast as I could
I<00:02:19.570> put<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:21.350> much<00:02:21.560> time<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.190> possibly

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
I put in as much time as I possibly

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.420 
I put in as much time as I possibly
could<00:02:22.880> into<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.480> use<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.500> fastest<00:02:24.980> strategy

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
could into it I use the fastest strategy

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.000 
could into it I use the fastest strategy
I<00:02:25.460> could<00:02:25.700> think<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.650> still<00:02:27.650> after<00:02:27.800> all

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I could think of and still after all

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.030 
I could think of and still after all
that<00:02:28.250> only<00:02:28.610> got<00:02:28.760> 198<00:02:32.080> when<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.350> reset<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
that only got 198 when I was reset the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.940 
that only got 198 when I was reset the
stream<00:02:34.340> chat<00:02:34.640> went<00:02:35.000> absolutely<00:02:35.560> nuclear<00:02:36.560> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
stream chat went absolutely nuclear and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.580 
stream chat went absolutely nuclear and
disbelief<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.580> what<00:02:37.730> has<00:02:37.880> happened<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.470> was

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
disbelief on what has happened that was
