00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.700
 the knowledge there is an article on the cover 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.190
 of the newspaper the Washington post titled 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.040
 for clinton for hillary clinton and the 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.460
 boeing the aircraft manufacturer a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.189
 beneficial relationship and inside there is more than 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.800
 half a page of text in essence what 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.390
 says this note is that in the year 2009 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.280
 when hillary clinton to the secretary 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.560
 of state went to Russia accompanied 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.050
 and asked that some private companies 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.670
 as the buoy will help finance thing 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.640
 current in the USA a pavilion 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.360
 US promotional at a fair 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.530
 business in Russian territory the hbo in 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.720
 that was going to put a million dollars 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.630
 ended up putting 2 million dollars 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.410
 It was the company that contributed the most 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.870
 then it announced an agreement in 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.900
 russia there was a russian airline and the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.480
 well the company of the Russians bought 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.269
 aircraft for 3,700 million dollars 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.309
 I repeat 3 thousand 70 million dollars and 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.150
 two months later after the good one 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.790
 gave to the Bill Clinton Foundation 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 clinton 900 thousand dollars to build 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.090
 houses in haiti country devastated by 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.010
 natural phenomena recently and it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 talks about that the boy could do good 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.770
 contributions to the hillary clinton campaign 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.370
 is all this ethical here clearly it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370
 is violating 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.719
 it's not ethical what happens is that I 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.299
 gives the impression that you can not 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.039
 blame only this possible 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.200
 candidate of this situation because this 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.610
 is common in the politics of the USA with 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.579
 what we are surely going to see that the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.039
 boeing if hillary concurre is going to give 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.619
 a good envelope of money under the table or 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.240
 above but also to the candidates 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.890
 Republicans although there is one thing 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.829
 important to determine how you know the 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.439
 Boeing is headquartered in Seattle State 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.299
 from washington ali on the coast 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.170
 west in the northwest of this country that is 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.209
 a is an important democrat flank and 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.039
 That means that if you sÃ­a the go 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.689
 things go well and continues to build 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.849
 planes there 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.489
 there is a nest of important votes that the 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.110
 Democratic party wants to keep though 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.840
 it also fits that there has been a great 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.209
 problem because the workers of that 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.250
 company intend to join and that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.560
 state does not allow that and have threatened 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.150
 with going to south carolina which is a 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.459
 southern state where the republicans 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.660
 they have more options with what attention 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.650
 what can happen with this matter 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 but for what you ask me 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.549
 yes it is immoral but it is common to what 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.860
 better is that since I live here I'm already 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.959
 immunized from these barbarities to me what 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.840
 what do you let me tell you about all 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.640
 ways that what has lifted me the most 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.110
 curiosity of this note is that this 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.329
 lady went to russia to do these 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.970
 things in 2009 prospect well maybe 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.859
 remember that on that trip this lady 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:55.319
 They put a big one on the table 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:57.849
 red button that he pressed and said reset 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.060
 relations with drugs is to say that the 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.590
 relationship with Russia is new and is in 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.470
 foot is again and we are very good friends 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.170
 insurance with what we have in ukraine and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.260
 that photo I assure you that he will see her 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.680
 you every week in the environments 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.349
 Republicans from here to 2016 without stopping and 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.980
 it's going to be an allegory of the disability 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.269
 from hillary clinton to do anything 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.200
 important in front of the department of 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.840
 been because if you can name me 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.159
 some some compress something that really 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.349
 it's the east clinton apartment and 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:37.019
 I did with her as a boss she reminds me 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.019
 please because I swim
