00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 but I believe that another wins but be 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820
 the tie will be good 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.490
 already prophesies that it will be 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.950
 a well-opened game well you can see 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.599
 You're a superstitious person one day. 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.930
 As a game importance has a 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.170
 does not have this business of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 shipment any kind instead only 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.580
 closes use my faith that has decimated in 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 relation to this issue of his statement 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.470
 if it is usually spoken in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.030
 relation to the rival's question is this 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 statement that gave more prominence is 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.730
 easy to talk about it could not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.219
 take off even more pepper talking 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 thing is it that goes from the interpretation of 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.010
 each one takes care of fortitude what I 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 I also followed the violence quoting 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 I need to take care of myself, even Sunday. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
 will play up 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.680
 we need to win right now 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.579
 this was even part of worse things 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.620
 in football i never went to make gesture 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.750
 obscene for all the goals I made 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.760
 I always celebrated with people, even never 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.830
 I sent beijing as some speak only without 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.049
 record record show 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 I never did it again caused 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.979
 fan 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.860
 as much as the field leader football 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.380
 that there will be an extension of a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
 sound you our word like take care 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.979
 fortress 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.850
 I do not see any citations to violence 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.740
 a time parameter of the first game but 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.930
 that committed but can not be 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.369
 committed in that second to which the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.909
 To this end you spoke of the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.650
 five-time champion was a silly mistake in this 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.180
 first game there the ball strolled in the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.479
 first goal the genilson defender did the 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.880
 second flight mazela also in a bid 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 silly I missed the ball in the middle of the field 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.350
 came it took everything well but we took the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.290
 goal 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.270
 Finally, this parachute ball we have 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.119
 to be more careful no doubt they will 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 want to take advantage of business lady 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.630
 It's the dead ball. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.560
 This is normal for the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.810
 coaches 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 on the other hand we are also looking for 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.629
 all the good time nÃ© 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.599
 so it's only if police more on this question 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.310
 and from standing balls and the rest ahead goes 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:26.550
 be a very well- organized game where 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.440
 It will be scored if you told us you were 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.450
 crazy crazy to score a new 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 unfortunately the goal did not leave but the team 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.480
 won the title I'm sure it stayed 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
 Happy, anyway, I have nothing to do. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.349
 made his goal but that was delayed 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.720
 for this Sunday will be that he stayed 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:44.020
 postponed to the state final 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:49.450
 in all the game I always try to score 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:52.690
 in the last game I had one of the 23 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.710
 chance, the goalkeeper was well defended 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.540
 another time and dribble the defender there 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.280
 About leaving, you're always looking for 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.900
 I also hope that my companions as 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:08.560
 always put me in a way 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.720
 better on the face of the goal and that I go 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.620
 look here the last game I did 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.920
 against him 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.880
 I hope you have the opportunity in 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.880
 I won more open
