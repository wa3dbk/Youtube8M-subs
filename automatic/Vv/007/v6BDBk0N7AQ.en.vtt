00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.700
 as twin is reduced 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.700
 who 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 is 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 naxos 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.610
 soan 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.610
 better 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.630
 m 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.030
 I 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.360
 you know the Haussmannian Paris 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.810
 these reporting buildings and its large 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.240
 arteries 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.160
 leaving the heart of the capital for 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.590
 the suburbs the urban landscape offers 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.840
 more variety neighborhoods are being done 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.490
 more intimate see bucolic and 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.790
 a few houses even in the 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.790
 decor 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 in Paris there are 27 thousand houses 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.450
 individual numbers 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 important because basically if you 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.799
 count 4 people by individual mendy 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.890
 you still have it right away 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:19.399
 hundred thousand people who live there then 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.710
 these houses date from the late 19th or 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.240
 twentieth century following neighborhoods that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.750
 was obviously out of the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.070
 Haussmann reconstruction is in 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.560
 fact that correspond to suburbs 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.899
 which were annexed in the second 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.979
 half of the 19th century 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.149
 in any case today in the 20 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.979
 peripheral districts 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.110
 we have a lot of movements 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.580
 digoin if most houses 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 Parisians are part of the landscape 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.179
 urban for more than a century 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.560
 architects built this always 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.479
 today 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.399
 but the free parcels have become 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.409
 rare foods in the 20th 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.240
 rounding off a fallow land 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.149
 allowed the construction of a house to 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 looks very contemporary so he 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.130
 it's a very small plot 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 118 square meters and which combines 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.409
 corner quote at the corner of the two streets 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.780
 as the views of the north facade are 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.900
 far away there is one of the spaces 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.740
 landscaped a great distance and so 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.310
 this facade 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.200
 she was chosen very open very 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.450
 transparent opening on this landscape 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.090
 plant is far from time while the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 Other facade of the west south facades 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.280
 it is very close and so it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 had to manage the vis Ã  vis the views 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.560
 reciprocal and so it's passades 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.769
 in which the openings are 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.330
 treated the way much more accurate 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.840
 ways to manage the opposite 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.390
 views the anti mites and residential the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.150
 each of the already one pieces counts 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.430
 given the smallness of the plot there 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.890
 was very 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.939
 is this important debian position the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.959
 vertical circulation systems 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:03.189
 to avoid reducing the capacity of the 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.170
 plateau that was already limited to actually 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.450
 the choices of the meters the staircase on a 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.250
 side of the house the moors to adjoin 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.489
 at wanted a circulation system 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.629
 extremely clear accurate that distributes 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.000
 obviously every floor we have 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.519
 a cut that allows you to see the totality 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 volume 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.409
 and then a circulation space that is 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.310
 a glazed space on both sides so 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:35.799
 entirely through it's a plan 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.980
 very fluid with the possibility of 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.250
 move from living room to dining room 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:45.099
 divert the kernel moors kernel here 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.680
 which is a strong 17- story elements 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.719
 then probably from the house that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.669
 brings together all the equipment 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:57.220
 techniques - xinjian all use the 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.620
 materials for what they are in the air 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 constructive truth and expression of 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.959
 materials and so in most of my 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.099
 projects you will see materials that 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.019
 are left in the rough 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.189
 and then at the dishes a contract for a 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:15.310
 year to obtain contrasts dd2 of 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:18.400
 very heavy and very light satin 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.240
 matte with materials like 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:25.830
 furniture items that are designed 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.960
 express for for this house and who 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.210
 spoke finished by their finishing by 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.880
 their texture come to contrast with 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.880
 the raw materials plus read
