00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
go and then we're gonna fold these down

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.980 
go and then we're gonna fold these down
and<00:02:39.920> then<00:02:40.550> one<00:02:40.730> more<00:02:40.970> piece<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.630> I'm<00:02:41.780> just

and then one more piece and I'm just
gonna<00:02:42.110> keep<00:02:42.380> going<00:02:42.650> till<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.100> end<00:02:43.310> up<00:02:43.550> with<00:02:43.730> a

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
gonna keep going till I end up with a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.410 
gonna keep going till I end up with a
weave<00:02:44.330> of<00:02:44.660> bacon<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:46.910> I'm<00:02:47.240> gonna

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
weave of bacon and then I'm gonna

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.600 
weave of bacon and then I'm gonna
microwave<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.820> flap<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:54.460> eventually<00:02:55.460> what

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
microwave this flap and eventually what

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.850 
microwave this flap and eventually what
if<00:02:55.730> semi-cooked<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:56.930> going<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.380> shape<00:02:57.680> it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
if semi-cooked I'm going to shape it

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.330 
if semi-cooked I'm going to shape it
over<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.610> form<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.450> bowl<00:02:59.750> or<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.140> measuring<00:03:00.620> cup<00:03:03.340> so

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
over a form a bowl or a measuring cup so

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.090 
over a form a bowl or a measuring cup so
there<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.670> have<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.940> my<00:03:05.510> attempt<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.620> tightly

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
there you have it my attempt to tightly

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.870 
there you have it my attempt to tightly
weave<00:03:07.250> a<00:03:07.280> lattice<00:03:07.730> of<00:03:07.910> bacon<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:09.440> my

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
weave a lattice of bacon and in my

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.699 
weave a lattice of bacon and in my
omnipresent<00:03:10.880> need<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.420> buy<00:03:11.570> quality<00:03:12.140> food<00:03:12.440> i

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
omnipresent need to buy quality food i

omnipresent need to buy quality food i
got<00:03:13.100> gorgeous<00:03:13.489> thick<00:03:14.060> cut<00:03:14.330> slab<00:03:14.690> bacon<00:03:14.959> i'm

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
got gorgeous thick cut slab bacon i'm

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.229 
got gorgeous thick cut slab bacon i'm
thinking<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.160> this<00:03:16.250> project<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.820> might<00:03:17.000> be

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
thinking for this project you might be

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.750 
thinking for this project you might be
better<00:03:17.420> off<00:03:17.570> with<00:03:17.780> cheap<00:03:18.440> more<00:03:18.890> uniform<00:03:19.430> thin

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
better off with cheap more uniform thin

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.060 
better off with cheap more uniform thin
bacon<00:03:20.239> but<00:03:20.660> let's<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.110> keep<00:03:21.320> going<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.830> see

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
bacon but let's just keep going and see

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.130 
bacon but let's just keep going and see
how<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.430> works<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:23.300> I'm<00:03:23.420> gonna<00:03:23.510> do<00:03:23.780> now<00:03:23.930> is

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
how it works so what I'm gonna do now is

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.110 
how it works so what I'm gonna do now is
put<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.530> parchment<00:03:24.950> paper<00:03:25.370> with<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.820> bacon

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
put this parchment paper with the bacon

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.060 
put this parchment paper with the bacon
lattice<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.810> on<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.260> microwave-safe<00:03:27.800> plate

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
lattice on it on a microwave-safe plate

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.790 
lattice on it on a microwave-safe plate
and<00:03:28.610> I'm<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.330> microwave<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:29.959> at<00:03:30.260> 10<00:03:30.590> for

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
and I'm going to microwave it at 10 for

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.260 
and I'm going to microwave it at 10 for
10<00:03:30.980> minutes<00:03:31.340> at<00:03:31.459> 50%<00:03:32.209> power

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.750 

so<00:03:35.930> my<00:03:36.290> Bacon's<00:03:36.740> been<00:03:36.950> cooking<00:03:37.340> for<00:03:37.370> 10

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so my Bacon's been cooking for 10

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.940 
so my Bacon's been cooking for 10
minutes<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.210> you<00:03:38.300> have<00:03:38.330> 2%<00:03:38.630> power<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.800> what<00:03:39.920> I

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
minutes if you have 2% power and what I

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.610 
minutes if you have 2% power and what I
want<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.490> now<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:41.090> blot<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.020> with<00:03:42.350> paper

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
want to do now is blot it with paper

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.610 
want to do now is blot it with paper
towels<00:03:43.130> because<00:03:43.580> obviously<00:03:44.080> it's<00:03:45.080> rendering

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
towels because obviously it's rendering

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.400 
towels because obviously it's rendering
a<00:03:45.710> lot<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:46.040> grease<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.850> it's<00:03:47.180> hot<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:48.050> when<00:03:48.260> you

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
a lot of grease now it's hot so when you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
a lot of grease now it's hot so when you
do<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.830> either<00:03:48.980> wearing<00:03:49.310> oven<00:03:49.760> mitt<00:03:49.940> or<00:03:50.180> use

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
do this either wearing oven mitt or use

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.440 
do this either wearing oven mitt or use
a<00:03:50.690> lot<00:03:51.020> of<00:03:51.050> paper<00:03:51.410> towels<00:03:51.700> or<00:03:52.700> just<00:03:52.880> can<00:03:53.030> get<00:03:53.300> up

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
a lot of paper towels or just can get up

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.450 
a lot of paper towels or just can get up
the<00:03:53.630> grease<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.170> sort<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.800> flatten<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
the grease and sort of flatten the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.070 
the grease and sort of flatten the
lattice<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.210> then<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:56.600> going<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> cook<00:03:56.930> it

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
lattice and then I'm going to cook it

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.050 
lattice and then I'm going to cook it
for<00:03:57.260> another<00:03:57.380> 10<00:03:57.980> minutes<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.760> then<00:03:58.910> I'm

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
for another 10 minutes and then I'm

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.600 
for another 10 minutes and then I'm
going<00:03:59.240> to<00:03:59.300> invert<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.750> onto<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.530> wall<00:04:00.860> the<00:04:01.430> right

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
going to invert it onto a wall the right

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.450 
going to invert it onto a wall the right
size<00:04:01.910> Bowl<00:04:02.440> which<00:04:03.440> I'm<00:04:03.590> not<00:04:03.770> really<00:04:03.950> sure<00:04:04.280> of

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
size Bowl which I'm not really sure of

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.860 
size Bowl which I'm not really sure of
yet<00:04:04.700> but<00:04:04.940> I'll<00:04:05.090> figure<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.630> ok<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:06.620> here<00:04:07.160> is

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
yet but I'll figure out ok so here is

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.630 
yet but I'll figure out ok so here is
the<00:04:08.870> baking<00:04:09.230> after<00:04:09.530> it's<00:04:10.010> been<00:04:10.250> microwaved

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
the baking after it's been microwaved

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.140 
the baking after it's been microwaved
twice<00:04:11.630> for<00:04:12.440> 10<00:04:12.650> minutes<00:04:13.040> blotting<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.850> grease

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
twice for 10 minutes blotting the grease

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.720 
twice for 10 minutes blotting the grease
in<00:04:14.390> between<00:04:14.810> now<00:04:15.470> what<00:04:15.650> I<00:04:15.680> want<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.280> is

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
in between now what I want to do is

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.320 
in between now what I want to do is
invert<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.390> onto<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.959> bowl<00:04:19.060> that's<00:04:20.060> the

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
invert it onto a bowl that's the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.190 
invert it onto a bowl that's the
appropriate<00:04:20.600> size<00:04:22.690> speaking<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:23.870> it's<00:04:24.020> gonna

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
appropriate size speaking so it's gonna

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.810 
appropriate size speaking so it's gonna

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
becoming the shape of a bowl so I'm

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.710

as I said I've never done this before
you<00:05:25.700> can<00:05:25.850> probably<00:05:26.120> tell<00:05:26.660> but<00:05:27.260> that's<00:05:27.470> ok

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
you can probably tell but that's ok

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.790 
you can probably tell but that's ok
we'll<00:05:27.980> make<00:05:28.130> it<00:05:28.190> work<00:05:28.520> put<00:05:29.510> it<00:05:29.600> there<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.560> then

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
we'll make it work put it there and then

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.100 
we'll make it work put it there and then
because<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.640> really<00:05:32.060> want<00:05:32.240> it<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.390> make<00:05:32.720> a<00:05:32.750> ball

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
because I really want it to make a ball

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.960 
because I really want it to make a ball
I'm<00:05:33.410> going<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.690> maybe<00:05:36.310> put<00:05:37.310> another<00:05:37.340> bowl<00:05:37.790> on

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
I'm going to maybe put another bowl on

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.180 
I'm going to maybe put another bowl on
top<00:05:38.000> I'm<00:05:38.540> not<00:05:38.600> sure

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
top I'm not sure

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.580 
top I'm not sure
yeah<00:05:39.370> I'm<00:05:39.700> just<00:05:39.880> gonna<00:05:40.090> gently<00:05:40.980> shape<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:43.590> and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
yeah I'm just gonna gently shape it and

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.170 
yeah I'm just gonna gently shape it and
see<00:05:44.950> if<00:05:45.130> it<00:05:45.250> looks<00:05:45.460> like<00:05:45.640> it's<00:05:45.790> gonna<00:05:45.940> adhere

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
see if it looks like it's gonna adhere

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.850 
see if it looks like it's gonna adhere
to<00:05:46.630> that<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:51.160> let's<00:05:51.430> see<00:05:51.670> if<00:05:51.790> that'll<00:05:52.000> work<00:05:52.150> I

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
to that and let's see if that'll work I

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.860 
to that and let's see if that'll work I
think<00:05:53.860> I<00:05:54.070> put<00:05:54.550> in<00:05:54.640> another<00:05:54.850> bowl<00:05:55.120> on<00:05:55.330> top<00:05:55.510> it

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
think I put in another bowl on top it

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.900 
think I put in another bowl on top it
would<00:05:55.990> help<00:05:56.230> but<00:05:56.560> I'm<00:05:57.100> just<00:05:57.340> gonna<00:05:57.460> put<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:57.790> in

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
would help but I'm just gonna put it in

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.610 
would help but I'm just gonna put it in
the<00:05:57.970> microwave<00:05:58.090> like<00:05:58.450> that<00:05:58.840> for<00:05:59.140> another<00:05:59.320> five

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
the microwave like that for another five

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.990 
the microwave like that for another five
minutes<00:05:59.920> and<00:06:00.070> then<00:06:00.190> I<00:06:00.220> might<00:06:00.520> put<00:06:00.730> another

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
minutes and then I might put another

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.750 
minutes and then I might put another
bowl<00:06:01.240> on<00:06:01.420> top<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:02.620> there<00:06:02.770> you<00:06:02.800> have<00:06:03.100> it<00:06:03.310> a<00:06:03.460> bowl

made<00:06:04.030> of<00:06:04.180> beacon<00:06:04.600> I'm<00:06:04.930> just<00:06:05.260> gonna<00:06:05.380> let<00:06:05.620> it<00:06:05.650> get

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
made of beacon I'm just gonna let it get

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.240 
made of beacon I'm just gonna let it get
good<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.370> crisp<00:06:06.970> before<00:06:07.780> I<00:06:08.010> turn<00:06:09.010> it<00:06:09.160> upside

down to let it drain and then you let it
cool<00:06:13.450> completely<00:06:13.510> and<00:06:14.050> it'll<00:06:14.560> look<00:06:14.650> really
