00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
as I stand here I see Ann Arbor here and

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.640 
as I stand here I see Ann Arbor here and
Ann<00:02:20.220> Arbor<00:02:20.550> down<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.060> there<00:02:22.050> echoing<00:02:22.410> each

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
Ann Arbor down there there echoing each

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260 
Ann Arbor down there there echoing each
other<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.099> was<00:02:23.250> your<00:02:23.400> intent<00:02:23.730> with<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.060> I

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
other what was your intent with that I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.320 
other what was your intent with that I
like<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.110> create<00:02:25.500> rooms<00:02:25.980> outside<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.970> idea

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
like to create rooms outside the idea

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
like to create rooms outside the idea
that<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:28.200> move<00:02:28.470> from<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.980> place<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.610> another

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that we move from one place to another

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
that we move from one place to another
through<00:02:30.540> different<00:02:30.959> passageways<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
through different passageways so the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160 
through different passageways so the
metaphor<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> passages<00:02:33.540> people<00:02:33.930> move

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
metaphor of the passages people move

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.589 
metaphor of the passages people move
from<00:02:34.440> one<00:02:34.890> level<00:02:35.159> to<00:02:35.310> another<00:02:35.519> well<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.480> know

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
from one level to another well you know

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.089 
from one level to another well you know
the<00:02:36.780> other<00:02:36.930> way<00:02:37.109> you've<00:02:37.319> done<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.709> what<00:02:38.069> I

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
the other way you've done that what I

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.830 
the other way you've done that what I
see<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:39.090> dealt<00:02:39.299> with<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> slope

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
see is that you dealt with the slope

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.559 
see is that you dealt with the slope
really<00:02:40.170> well

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
really well

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.599 
really well
slopes<00:02:40.749> can<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.079> real<00:02:41.319> challenge<00:02:41.349> but<00:02:42.129> what

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
slopes can be a real challenge but what

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:43.979 
slopes can be a real challenge but what
I<00:02:42.640> see<00:02:42.939> you've<00:02:43.090> done<00:02:43.299> is<00:02:43.450> you've<00:02:43.569> got<00:02:43.719> a<00:02:43.749> couple

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
I see you've done is you've got a couple

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.199 
I see you've done is you've got a couple
of<00:02:44.170> steps<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.709> then<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.189> level<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.909> in<00:02:46.120> a

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
of steps and then a level and in a

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.270 
of steps and then a level and in a
couple<00:02:46.359> of<00:02:46.569> steps<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.079> then<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.379> level<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:47.889> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
couple of steps and then a level and the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.429 
couple of steps and then a level and the
pathway<00:02:48.819> just<00:02:49.150> pulls<00:02:49.480> me<00:02:49.749> through<00:02:49.780> from<00:02:50.409> one

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
pathway just pulls me through from one

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.349 
pathway just pulls me through from one
level<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> next<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:51.459> want<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.909> see<00:02:52.090> what's

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
level to the next I want to see what's

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:58.890 
level to the next I want to see what's
happening<00:02:52.780> down<00:02:52.959> there<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:57.629> love<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.780> way

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.589 
and I see stone explain to me what this
is<00:03:56.349> this<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.459> metaphor<00:03:57.879> for<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.329> river

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
is this is a metaphor for a river

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.439 
is this is a metaphor for a river
flowing<00:03:59.049> down<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.859> studio<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.729> lot<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.299> my

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
flowing down to the studio a lot of my

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.300 
flowing down to the studio a lot of my
clients<00:04:01.750> have<00:04:02.049> wanted<00:04:02.379> me<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.620> put<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:02.919> a<00:04:03.040> water

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
clients have wanted me to put in a water

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.670 
clients have wanted me to put in a water
element<00:04:03.849> but<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.329> doesn't<00:04:04.720> feel<00:04:04.840> natural<00:04:05.109> here

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
element but it doesn't feel natural here

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.390 
element but it doesn't feel natural here
so<00:04:06.189> using<00:04:06.759> stones<00:04:07.209> as<00:04:07.629> that<00:04:07.959> metaphor<00:04:08.680> feels

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
so using stones as that metaphor feels

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.349 
so using stones as that metaphor feels
more<00:04:09.609> congruent<00:04:10.269> for<00:04:10.509> me<00:04:11.729> Ellen<00:04:12.729> I<00:04:12.879> noticed

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
more congruent for me Ellen I noticed

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.699 
more congruent for me Ellen I noticed
that<00:04:13.389> a<00:04:13.479> lot<00:04:13.659> of<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.900> plants<00:04:14.199> you<00:04:14.319> have<00:04:14.500> the

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
that a lot of the plants you have the

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.379 
that a lot of the plants you have the
salvia<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.579> various<00:04:15.819> other<00:04:15.970> things<00:04:16.060> are

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
salvia is and various other things are

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.449 
salvia is and various other things are
very<00:04:16.659> low<00:04:16.930> water<00:04:17.229> plants<00:04:17.769> why<00:04:17.979> did<00:04:18.159> you<00:04:18.190> use

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
very low water plants why did you use

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.180 
very low water plants why did you use
those<00:04:18.699> the<00:04:19.690> same<00:04:19.959> reason<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.739> didn't<00:04:20.949> want<00:04:21.130> to

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
those the same reason I didn't want to

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.939 
those the same reason I didn't want to
put<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.400> water<00:04:21.669> element<00:04:22.180> it<00:04:22.690> feels<00:04:23.409> unnatural

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
put a water element it feels unnatural

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.010 
put a water element it feels unnatural
to<00:04:24.370> me<00:04:24.400> to<00:04:24.759> be<00:04:24.849> using<00:04:25.210> lots<00:04:25.389> of<00:04:25.570> water<00:04:25.780> on<00:04:25.990> the
