00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.410
Cornus florida - Flowering Dogwood - is one
of the iconic native american flowering trees.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:22.340
Its native range is from the New England to
northern Florida west through... well almost

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.820
to the Mississippi River really, and even
beyond.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.070
It is a lovely spring flowering tree.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.960
It's great when you're traveling through the
Smoky Mountains and the Blue Ridge Parkway

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.390
this time of year, these and the redbuds are
often blooming together so it's a wonderful

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.390
display.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.710
Flowering dogwood is a small tree, a small
flowering tree, it tops out at maybe thirty

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.780
to thirty five feet in the wild, often smaller
than that under cultivation, with a spread

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.270
that's about two thirds or almost equal to
that.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.060
It's a wide spreading mounded tree.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.600
Its branches often droop right to the ground
which it is an indication that it wants to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899
protect its root zone.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.210
When I see that in a tree, whether it's a
beech tree or a flowering dogwood, that is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.970
an indication that it's sensitive to root
zone incursions so you want to protect that

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.220
area around its base very carefully.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.640
Here at the garden we have used a lot of mulch
rings and other ways to protect this from

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.860
mowers.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.530
There are several disease problems that are
associated with dogwoods, anthracnose is one

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.530
of them.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.670
When we have an extended, cool, rainy spring
this disease affects the flowers and also

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.729
can affect the leaves all summer long.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.330
But generally if you plant them in morning
sun, where the sun helps to dissipate the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.720
moisture and the dew from the leaves that
is advantageous for this tree.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.189
And then some afternoon shade is also good
to give it a break from the heat of the day.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.189
They're an age of the woods native.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:12.069
Think of them as growing next to the deciduous
woods so you want to make sure there's plenty

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.580
of moisture in the ground if it's growing
in full sun.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.040
Flowering dogwood is a member of the it's
own family Cornaceae.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.739
There are dogwoods worldwide, different species
worldwide.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.540
The Cornelian cherry dogwood - Cornus mas
is from Asia.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.629
But this lovely American native also has a
fabulous fall color.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.909
They tend to be in the dark red to purple
range sometimes you find a lighter red on

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.359
them in the fall.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.230
They're great when planted with Witch-hazels
which turn a wonderful yellow color, they're

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.919
great companion plants.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:58.620
My favorite cultivar of these is Cherokee,
it's a nice pink color.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.349
There are some varieties with darker red and
of course most of them are this wonderful

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.689
white collar as well.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.449
Great fall color, wonderful flowering, it's
even got a wonderful shape during the winter

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.209
time when no leaves are on the tree.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:23.659
This part of the flower will become a nice
red berry like arrangement and if the squirrels

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.769
don't get them they will stay on the tree
well into the fall, adding a little bit of

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.849
extra interest.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.810
Cornus florida - Flowering Dogwood.
