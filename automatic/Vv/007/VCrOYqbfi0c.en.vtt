 lemon pineapple avocado base peppermint 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.480
 and also to accompany it with a cake 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.670
 with a snack that is low in calories and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.010

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.890
 time to eat it or the juliana vélez 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.810

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 like healthy eating with everyone 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.900
 is that it is something very important and is that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.600
 if we do not take care of ourselves young we're going to have 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.340
 an old age but consuming all 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.430
 medicines and for having certain 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.720
 and that's how it is through feeding 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.060
 take care of ourselves for health because only 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.490
 when we are sick we say there is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.860
 We could have done it to see how to avoid 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.110
 these things then feeding and 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 everything that comes from the earth more 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.140
 healthy is precisely all that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.580
 will allow us to strengthen our 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.290
 health the future 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.570
 many women can say for the 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.900
 avocado in a smoothie this knows 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.370
 delicious also the avocado is something that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.160
 It has properties that help us 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.670
 prevent cholesterol has vitamin s 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.950
 not so is the avocado in a smoothie is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.530
 ideal because many times the shakes 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.940
 they can also fill us up and then they 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.460
 they can turn like a snack 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.230
 healthy then for people who 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.300
 maybe they find it very strange 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.190
 avocado can be mixed with a fruit 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.140
 that if they like it a lot and so as 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 that is not going to feel like so 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.160
 strong in the smoothie okey here we have 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.220
 all the ingredients of the avocado 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.540
 pineapple mint and lemon the chop 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.000
 we put them in the blender 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.640
 we introduce to the blender with trunk 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.450
 of ice and it is spectacular we are going to 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.730

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.170
 that 90% of women but right now 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.050
 there are foods that are low in calories 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.940
 low in sugar that diabetics what 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.960
 they can consume and it is that I have water 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.710

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.130
 I will give a feeling of one being 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.990
 eating like a sweet but not the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.820
 chocolate sometimes that maybe ends 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.340
 having a lot of sugar but the same 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.680
 fruit is for example has apples and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.020
 has nuts then makes it like 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.240
 a sweet little snack that goes very 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.600
 well with a smoothie and that makes us 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.970

 able to play with our children that 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.790
