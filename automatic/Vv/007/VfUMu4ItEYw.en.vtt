00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello girls today I'll show you how 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.230
 They painted their nails with a teddy bear that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.320
 was in its opening for it we're going to 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.420
 need pink and white you can use 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 the colors that you want in this case I 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm going to use this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.700
 for what we are going to do is painting the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.410
 nail 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.410
 a rose and the next white 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.010
 break down sure that it will have to give 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.000
 several layers to make it look stronger 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.000
 same as white 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.719
 so it will stand out much more 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.030
 what we are also going to need are 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.030
 matches 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.189
 now draw 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.399
 we already have them all painted what 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.219
 let's do now is to pick up a toothpick 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.679
 and we're going to make points where pink 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.069
 we make them white and where they are 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.069
 white 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.400
 it is the very easy stick to make the points 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.580
 and that's how we 're going to stay and now we do what 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.580
 same but with these 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.300
 - in this one here that we're going to do 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.300
 an equal bear with this white cloth 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.530
 and now again as we will do 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.530
 little white dots 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.640
 Well, the nails are almost cool 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.640
 they are super original 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.770
 we leave it and now we continue with the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.770
 pink 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.430
 and now we do the same with the other 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.430
 hand 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.669
 while we let it dry what we are going to 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.669
 Brighten the other nails 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.939
 but it is with the white stick 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.960
 make the tip as if it were 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.960
 logical 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.490
 in the other side 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.529
 to be a little better as age to the 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.529
 light 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.849
 and now what we're going to do is catch 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.809
 another stick 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.809
 let's make the pieces 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.910
 the little eyes that are going to go black 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.910
 so what we 're going to do is 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.770
 the black padilla and what we are going to do 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.770
 make him two eyes 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.550
 and what we have done in the white point 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.550
 we are going to change him 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.630
 let's wet it well 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.939
 and that's how the teddy bear is 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.590
 and we are going to do the same with the other 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.590
 way 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.870
 to passion 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.850
 I hope you liked him a 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.430
 Needle if you liked it and do not forget 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.460

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.889

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.830
