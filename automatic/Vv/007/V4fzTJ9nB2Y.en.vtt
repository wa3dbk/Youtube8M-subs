00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Welcome to planet 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.179
 today we are going to wrap a gift in shape 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.769
 of candy for it we're going to need 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:14.740
 gift wrap a bow and scissors 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.750
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.900
 gift that we want to wrap 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.720
 we have taken a shirt we folded it and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.220
 with it we make a loop if we do not have 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.669
 something that can be molded as a 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.079
 T-shirt we can catch any roll or 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.829
 put it inside a roll of paper 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.649
 hygienic so that it takes the tubular form 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.270
 once we have this form we pass 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.579
 to paper 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.649
 What we do is roll up the gift 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.760
 until we see that it closes well for 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 that then we do not stay short 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.410
 and cut the wrapping paper 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.650
 this is a very simple way of 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.410
 wrap a gift without the need for zeal 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.690
 and also you will be the most original 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.100
 once we have cut the paper we press 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.820
 in the extremes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 so that the candy closes well 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.530
 with a ribbon 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.530
 we cut it in half 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.780
 and we're just going to knot it if we do not 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.610
 we have tape we can do it with zeal 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.430
 just roll it up and we're around 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.260
 and it is already 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.990
 but since we have the tape, it's going to 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.360
 Be much more original with the ribbon 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.590
 we make a very strong knot so that 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.590
 open 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.870
 and on the other side we will do exactly what 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.870
 same 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.770
 You can also have wrapped it with a 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 decorated paper that is not for paper 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.730
 smooth and so if you do it with lines 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.400
 it will look like the candies that we found 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.440
 in the candy stores 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.430
 We can cut this down if it has 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.430
 stayed a little long 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.490
 and we can also cut the loop or 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.259
 well do a loop or leave it 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730
 simply with the knots like more 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.010
 like 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.140
 and here our craft today 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.210
 see you later planetariums 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.420
