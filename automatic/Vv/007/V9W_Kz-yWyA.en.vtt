but my view is that marriage itself is a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.320 
but my view is that marriage itself is a
relationship<00:03:02.130> between<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.610> man<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> woman

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
and and that's that's my own preference

and and that's that's my own preference
I<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:05.610> other<00:03:05.850> people<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.630> differing<00:03:07.050> views
