00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.119

of<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.190> med<00:00:57.460> bag<00:00:57.670> and<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.540> med<00:00:58.780> bag<00:00:58.989> goes<00:00:59.559> to

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
of the med bag and the med bag goes to

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.850 
of the med bag and the med bag goes to
support<00:01:00.850> players<00:01:01.149> very<00:01:01.899> similar<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.440> how<00:01:02.680> it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
support players very similar to how it

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.670 
support players very similar to how it
worked<00:01:03.070> in<00:01:03.340> bad<00:01:03.579> company<00:01:03.850> 2<00:01:04.300> and<00:01:04.660> I<00:01:05.289> think<00:01:05.350> that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
worked in bad company 2 and I think that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.850 
worked in bad company 2 and I think that
that<00:01:05.860> could<00:01:06.009> be<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.520> really<00:01:07.149> good<00:01:07.360> switcher<00:01:07.960> now

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
that could be a really good switcher now

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.650 
that could be a really good switcher now
we<00:01:08.920> can<00:01:09.220> look<00:01:09.340> at<00:01:09.460> this<00:01:09.640> from<00:01:10.149> lots<00:01:10.509> of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
we can look at this from lots of

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.120 
we can look at this from lots of
different<00:01:10.720> angles<00:01:11.380> so<00:01:11.530> let's<00:01:11.680> start<00:01:11.920> at<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
different angles so let's start at the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.279 
different angles so let's start at the
beginning<00:01:12.539> recently<00:01:13.539> visceral<00:01:13.990> released

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
beginning recently visceral released

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.560 
beginning recently visceral released
information<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:15.039> say<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.520> RPGs<00:01:16.270> are

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
information to say that the RPGs are

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.960 
information to say that the RPGs are
being<00:01:17.200> removed<00:01:17.380> from<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.250> engineer<00:01:18.759> class

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
being removed from the engineer class

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.850 
being removed from the engineer class
because<00:01:19.390> they<00:01:19.539> don't<00:01:19.840> fit<00:01:20.200> with<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.530> police

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
because they don't fit with the police

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.399 
because they don't fit with the police
and<00:01:21.100> robbers<00:01:21.550> style<00:01:21.880> battlefield<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.229> have

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
and robbers style battlefield and I have

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.840 
and robbers style battlefield and I have
to<00:01:23.560> agree<00:01:23.680> i<00:01:23.979> think<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.369> was<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> good<00:01:24.700> decision

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
to agree i think it was a good decision

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.899 
to agree i think it was a good decision
and<00:01:25.360> this<00:01:25.900> will<00:01:26.170> replace<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.560> RPG<00:01:27.369> with<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
and this will replace the RPG with a

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.630 
and this will replace the RPG with a
grenade<00:01:28.119> launcher<00:01:28.840> RPGs<00:01:29.680> are<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:30.189> battle

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
grenade launcher RPGs are now battle

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.210 
grenade launcher RPGs are now battle
pickups<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:32.110> obviously<00:01:32.590> removed<00:01:33.070> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
pickups this obviously removed the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
pickups this obviously removed the
grenade<00:01:33.549> launcher<00:01:33.970> from<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.240> assault<00:01:34.570> class

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
grenade launcher from the assault class

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.140 
grenade launcher from the assault class
which<00:01:35.080> leaves<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.619> fairly<00:01:36.100> small<00:01:36.400> hole<00:01:36.700> in<00:01:36.970> that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
which leaves a fairly small hole in that

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.760 
which leaves a fairly small hole in that
class<00:01:37.420> overall<00:01:37.780> I<00:01:37.869> don't<00:01:38.170> really<00:01:38.439> think<00:01:38.590> it

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
class overall I don't really think it

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.109 
class overall I don't really think it
affects<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.220> balance<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:39.729> much<00:01:39.880> for<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
affects the balance that much for the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.149 
affects the balance that much for the
assault<00:01:40.390> class<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:41.110> does<00:01:41.320> definitely<00:01:41.619> give

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
assault class but does definitely give

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.100 
assault class but does definitely give
the<00:01:42.310> engineers<00:01:42.880> something<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.390> work<00:01:43.600> with<00:01:43.630> if

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
the engineers something to work with if

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.200 
the engineers something to work with if
you<00:01:44.860> then<00:01:45.100> work<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:45.729> fact<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
you then work in the fact that the

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.600 
you then work in the fact that the
assault<00:01:46.570> class<00:01:46.780> now<00:01:47.080> has<00:01:47.320> ammunition<00:01:48.130> instead

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
assault class now has ammunition instead

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.670 
assault class now has ammunition instead
of<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.850> med<00:01:49.060> bag<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:50.079> support<00:01:50.530> class

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
of the med bag and the support class

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.190 
of the med bag and the support class
takes<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.310> along<00:01:51.640> with<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.850> D<00:01:52.030> fibs<00:01:52.329> I<00:01:52.570> think

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
takes that along with the D fibs I think

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.990 
takes that along with the D fibs I think
we've<00:01:53.350> got<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.680> really<00:01:54.009> nice<00:01:54.280> balance<00:01:54.579> there

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
we've got a really nice balance there

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.090 
we've got a really nice balance there
and<00:01:55.180> as<00:01:55.240> I've<00:01:55.390> said<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.869> mimics<00:01:56.409> bad<00:01:56.650> company

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
and as I've said it mimics bad company

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.359 
and as I've said it mimics bad company
two<00:01:57.310> very<00:01:57.880> very<00:01:58.030> closely<00:01:58.600> if<00:01:59.170> we<00:01:59.770> then<00:01:59.979> look<00:02:00.250> at

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
two very very closely if we then look at

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.179 
two very very closely if we then look at
the<00:02:00.579> classes<00:02:00.820> overall<00:02:01.570> my<00:02:02.380> style<00:02:02.799> of<00:02:03.040> the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
the classes overall my style of the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.770 
the classes overall my style of the
assault<00:02:03.490> player<00:02:03.759> is<00:02:04.030> somebody<00:02:04.360> who<00:02:04.540> moves

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
assault player is somebody who moves

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.749 
assault player is somebody who moves
around<00:02:05.049> all<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.380> time<00:02:05.409> who's<00:02:06.130> aware<00:02:06.430> of<00:02:06.490> his

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
around all the time who's aware of his

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.060 
around all the time who's aware of his
surroundings<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.689> is<00:02:08.110> always<00:02:08.440> there<00:02:08.679> trying

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
surroundings and is always there trying

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.370

to<00:02:09.130> fight<00:02:09.459> whoever's<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.090> front<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.570> them<00:02:10.690> for

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
to fight whoever's in front of them for

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.590 
to fight whoever's in front of them for
that<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.920> need<00:02:12.070> ammunition<00:02:12.549> and<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.269> run<00:02:13.450> out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
that you need ammunition and you run out

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.360 
that you need ammunition and you run out
of<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.870> quite<00:02:14.200> quickly<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.799> battlefield<00:02:15.310> 4

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
of that quite quickly in battlefield 4

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.310 
of that quite quickly in battlefield 4
if<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.790> can<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.269> kill<00:02:16.510> streak<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.989> and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
if you can get a kill streak going and

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.650 
if you can get a kill streak going and
you<00:02:17.739> have<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.100> rely<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.640> support<00:02:19.090> player<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you have to rely on a support player to

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.030 
you have to rely on a support player to
come<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.959> your<00:02:20.079> aid<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.530> give<00:02:20.769> you<00:02:20.890> their

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
come to your aid and give you their

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
come to your aid and give you their
ammunition<00:02:21.900> moving<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.049> ammo<00:02:23.260> pack<00:02:23.590> onto

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
ammunition moving that ammo pack onto

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.979 
ammunition moving that ammo pack onto
the<00:02:24.130> assault<00:02:24.459> class<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.000> think<00:02:25.329> facilitates

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
the assault class I think facilitates

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.990 
the assault class I think facilitates
the<00:02:26.200> class<00:02:26.440> much<00:02:26.860> better<00:02:27.190> than<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.520> med<00:02:27.760> pack

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the class much better than a med pack

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
the class much better than a med pack
and<00:02:28.270> defibs<00:02:28.810> because<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.470> assault<00:02:29.770> player

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and defibs because the assault player

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.160 
and defibs because the assault player
always<00:02:30.310> wants<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> be<00:02:30.819> moving<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:32.020> that's

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
always wants to be moving I think that's

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.520 
always wants to be moving I think that's
the<00:02:32.260> way

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
the way

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.750 
the way
that<00:02:32.680> you're<00:02:32.800> supposed<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.250> pay<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.550> class

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
that you're supposed to pay the class

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.309 
that you're supposed to pay the class
you<00:02:33.970> may<00:02:34.120> play<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.420> differently<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.930> me<00:02:35.080> but

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
you may play it differently to me but

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.170 
you may play it differently to me but
hey<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> think<00:02:36.160> this<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> good<00:02:36.640> idea<00:02:36.700> you

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
hey I think this is a good idea you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.170 
hey I think this is a good idea you
might<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.510> it's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.930> horrible<00:02:38.440> idea<00:02:38.709> and

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
might think it's a horrible idea and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.670 
might think it's a horrible idea and
moving<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.300> medic<00:02:40.630> kit<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> D<00:02:41.410> fifth

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
moving the medic kit and the D fifth

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.530 
moving the medic kit and the D fifth
back<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.130> support<00:02:42.459> class<00:02:42.640> which<00:02:42.940> tends<00:02:43.300> to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
back to the support class which tends to

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.740 
back to the support class which tends to
be<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.930> slower<00:02:44.440> role<00:02:44.860> overall<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.180> fits

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
be a slower role overall I think fits

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.510 
be a slower role overall I think fits
much<00:02:47.050> better<00:02:47.110> because<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.920> you've<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
much better because then you've got the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.070 
much better because then you've got the
time<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> think<00:02:49.030> whether<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.480> want<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> revive

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
time to think whether you want to revive

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.479 
time to think whether you want to revive
somebody<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.800> want<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.130> throw<00:02:51.340> that

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
somebody if you want to throw that

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.400 
somebody if you want to throw that
health<00:02:51.760> down<00:02:52.030> overall<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.080> play<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
health down overall if you play the

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.540 
health down overall if you play the
support<00:02:53.770> class<00:02:53.920> you're<00:02:54.160> going<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.340> be<00:02:54.430> playing

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
support class you're going to be playing

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.979 
support class you're going to be playing
with<00:02:54.760> heavy<00:02:55.120> weapons<00:02:55.239> you're<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> be

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
with heavy weapons you're going to be

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
with heavy weapons you're going to be
weighed<00:02:56.230> down<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.860> don't<00:02:57.430> really<00:02:57.580> think<00:02:57.670> that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
weighed down I don't really think that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.100 
weighed down I don't really think that
that's<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.300> be<00:02:58.420> represented<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:58.989> the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
that's going to be represented in the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.470 
that's going to be represented in the
game<00:02:59.319> but<00:02:59.650> at<00:03:00.130> least<00:03:00.400> subconsciously<00:03:01.000> you're

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
game but at least subconsciously you're

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.180 
game but at least subconsciously you're
thinking<00:03:01.870> as<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> support<00:03:02.410> player<00:03:02.590> wow<00:03:02.980> I'm

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
thinking as a support player wow I'm

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.430 
thinking as a support player wow I'm
holding<00:03:03.850> this<00:03:03.940> lmg<00:03:04.390> here<00:03:04.600> it's<00:03:04.720> quite<00:03:04.989> heavy<00:03:05.140> I

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
holding this lmg here it's quite heavy I

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.990 
holding this lmg here it's quite heavy I
might<00:03:05.950> want<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.190> take<00:03:06.340> things<00:03:06.519> a<00:03:06.670> little<00:03:06.820> bit

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
might want to take things a little bit

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.850 
might want to take things a little bit
slower<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.050> think<00:03:08.260> with<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.440> medic<00:03:08.709> bag

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
slower and I think with the medic bag

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.259 
slower and I think with the medic bag
and<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.130> D<00:03:09.280> fibs<00:03:09.550> you've<00:03:09.730> got<00:03:09.910> time<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.239> think

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
and the D fibs you've got time to think

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.690 
and the D fibs you've got time to think
about<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.959> and<00:03:11.140> ultimately<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.519> suits

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
about that and ultimately it just suits

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.630 
about that and ultimately it just suits
the<00:03:12.940> class<00:03:13.180> much<00:03:13.510> better<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:15.250> really<00:03:15.519> you

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
the class much better but really you

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.830 
the class much better but really you
need<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.880> let<00:03:16.000> me<00:03:16.150> know<00:03:16.269> what<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.600> think

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
need to let me know what you think

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.570 
need to let me know what you think
because<00:03:17.050> I<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:17.920> could<00:03:18.100> be<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.220> really

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
because I think this could be a really

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.160 
because I think this could be a really
good<00:03:18.790> idea<00:03:18.850> for<00:03:19.300> battlefield<00:03:19.690> hardline<00:03:20.050> it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
good idea for battlefield hardline it

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.210 
good idea for battlefield hardline it
would<00:03:20.260> change<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.769> gameplay<00:03:21.160> from

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
would change up the gameplay from

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.220 
would change up the gameplay from
battlefield<00:03:21.850> 4<00:03:22.090> because<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> lot<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.750> people

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
battlefield 4 because a lot of people

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.559 
battlefield 4 because a lot of people
have<00:03:23.739> been<00:03:23.769> saying<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.519> hard<00:03:24.790> line<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.300> very

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
have been saying that hard line is very

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.330 
have been saying that hard line is very
similar<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.200> battlefield<00:03:26.709> 4<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.010> I'd<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
similar to battlefield 4 and I'd have to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.250 
similar to battlefield 4 and I'd have to
agree<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.790> looks<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.330> very<00:03:28.660> similar<00:03:29.019> but<00:03:29.140> in

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
agree it looks it is very similar but in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.949 
agree it looks it is very similar but in
gameplay<00:03:29.560> terms<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.459> feels<00:03:30.940> very<00:03:31.090> different

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
gameplay terms it feels very different

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.020 
gameplay terms it feels very different
and<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.500> think<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:33.069> these<00:03:33.340> changes<00:03:33.640> would

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
and I think that these changes would

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.210 
and I think that these changes would
help<00:03:34.269> even<00:03:34.600> further<00:03:34.900> set<00:03:35.319> hardline<00:03:35.830> apart

some really heavy damage to that vehicle

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.750 
some really heavy damage to that vehicle
you<00:04:37.810> could<00:04:37.990> also<00:04:38.110> fire<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.800> at<00:04:38.830> infantry<00:04:39.520> which

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
you could also fire it at infantry which

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.540 
you could also fire it at infantry which
just<00:04:40.000> simply<00:04:40.360> lit<00:04:40.570> them<00:04:40.720> up<00:04:40.810> on<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.110> minimap

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
just simply lit them up on the minimap

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.830 
just simply lit them up on the minimap
didn't<00:04:42.550> really<00:04:42.729> do<00:04:42.849> a<00:04:42.880> huge<00:04:43.180> amount<00:04:43.240> else<00:04:43.599> but

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
didn't really do a huge amount else but

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.360 
didn't really do a huge amount else but
if<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.080> were<00:04:44.260> marking<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.800> target<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.340> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
if you were marking a target and you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.650 
if you were marking a target and you
have<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.729> time<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.210> fire

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
have the time to fire

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.420 
have the time to fire
shot<00:04:46.810> at<00:04:46.930> somebody<00:04:47.350> then<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.070> could<00:04:48.280> do<00:04:48.400> that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
shot at somebody then you could do that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.850 
shot at somebody then you could do that
as<00:04:48.700> well<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:49.840> good<00:04:50.020> thing<00:04:50.050> about<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.590> tracer

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
as well the good thing about the tracer

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.530 
as well the good thing about the tracer
dart<00:04:51.160> was<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.610> you<00:04:51.700> never<00:04:51.910> then<00:04:52.150> had<00:04:52.390> to

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
dart was that you never then had to

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.690 
dart was that you never then had to
spend<00:04:52.810> your<00:04:52.960> time<00:04:53.170> re<00:04:53.530> spotting<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.280> vehicle

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
spend your time re spotting the vehicle

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.760 
spend your time re spotting the vehicle
that<00:04:54.730> you'd<00:04:54.970> already<00:04:55.150> spotted<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.470> we<00:04:56.620> know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
that you'd already spotted and we know

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.530 
that you'd already spotted and we know
that<00:04:56.800> sometimes<00:04:57.160> in<00:04:57.580> certain<00:04:57.760> servers<00:04:58.210> that

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
that sometimes in certain servers that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.900 
that sometimes in certain servers that
vehicles<00:04:59.020> can<00:04:59.290> get<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.590> little<00:04:59.920> bit<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.310> don't

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
vehicles can get a little bit I don't

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.910 
vehicles can get a little bit I don't
know<00:05:01.000> overpowered<00:05:01.900> if<00:05:02.020> somebody's<00:05:02.350> a<00:05:02.380> really

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
know overpowered if somebody's a really

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.800 
know overpowered if somebody's a really
good<00:05:03.130> attack<00:05:03.460> chopper<00:05:03.850> pilot<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.390> I<00:05:04.450> remember

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
good attack chopper pilot and I remember

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.600 
good attack chopper pilot and I remember
this<00:05:04.930> from<00:05:05.110> my<00:05:05.230> days<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.620> bad<00:05:05.800> company<00:05:06.220> 2<00:05:06.400> that

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
this from my days and bad company 2 that

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.700 
this from my days and bad company 2 that
they<00:05:07.300> can<00:05:07.510> just<00:05:07.690> completely<00:05:08.050> dominate<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
they can just completely dominate the

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.350 
they can just completely dominate the
map<00:05:08.920> and<00:05:09.190> there's<00:05:09.460> no<00:05:09.640> way<00:05:09.820> for<00:05:09.880> you<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.120> take

map and there's no way for you to take

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.240

class<00:05:34.210> within<00:05:34.540> hardline<00:05:35.080> so<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.620> one<00:05:35.800> we

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
class within hardline so that one we

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.770 
class within hardline so that one we
were<00:05:36.040> talking<00:05:36.070> about<00:05:36.490> where<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.150> can't<00:05:37.510> gain

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
were talking about where you can't gain

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.410 
were talking about where you can't gain
access<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.320> RPGs<00:05:38.950> anymore<00:05:39.400> you<00:05:39.880> simply<00:05:40.300> have

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
access to RPGs anymore you simply have

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.240 
access to RPGs anymore you simply have
the<00:05:40.870> grenade<00:05:41.260> launcher<00:05:41.680> well<00:05:41.860> you're<00:05:42.130> going

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
the grenade launcher well you're going

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.430 
the grenade launcher well you're going
to<00:05:42.310> be<00:05:42.430> able<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.820> use<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.150> track<00:05:43.420> a<00:05:43.450> dark<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:44.260> I

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
to be able to use to track a dark and I

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.900 
to be able to use to track a dark and I
think<00:05:44.650> that's<00:05:44.800> really<00:05:45.010> good<00:05:45.280> as<00:05:45.430> well<00:05:45.460> because

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
think that's really good as well because

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.760 
think that's really good as well because
it<00:05:46.030> kind<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.300> fits<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:46.690> mechanic<00:05:47.110> role<00:05:47.350> you're

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
it kind of fits the mechanic role you're

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.140 
it kind of fits the mechanic role you're
going<00:05:47.890> to<00:05:47.950> be<00:05:48.040> trying<00:05:48.220> to<00:05:48.370> take<00:05:48.550> out<00:05:48.730> vehicles

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
going to be trying to take out vehicles

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.880 
going to be trying to take out vehicles
all<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.360> time<00:05:49.540> so<00:05:49.690> it<00:05:49.780> makes<00:05:50.050> sense<00:05:50.170> that<00:05:50.440> you

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
all the time so it makes sense that you

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.480 
all the time so it makes sense that you
can<00:05:51.130> mark<00:05:51.400> them<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:53.050> overall<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.980> seems<00:05:54.040> that

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
can mark them so overall it seems that

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.130 
can mark them so overall it seems that
visceral<00:05:54.820> are<00:05:55.000> really<00:05:55.300> trying<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.660> take<00:05:55.900> some

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
visceral are really trying to take some

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.530 
visceral are really trying to take some
steps<00:05:56.170> in<00:05:56.770> order<00:05:56.890> to<00:05:57.130> differentiate<00:05:57.670> hardline

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
steps in order to differentiate hardline

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.020 
steps in order to differentiate hardline
from<00:05:58.870> battlefield<00:05:59.410> 4<00:05:59.680> as<00:06:00.190> I've<00:06:00.430> said<00:06:00.580> a<00:06:00.640> lot<00:06:00.910> of

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
from battlefield 4 as I've said a lot of

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.880 
from battlefield 4 as I've said a lot of
people<00:06:01.360> had<00:06:01.540> complaints<00:06:02.200> that<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.440> game<00:06:02.620> was

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
people had complaints that the game was

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.560 
people had complaints that the game was
far<00:06:03.160> too<00:06:03.190> similar<00:06:03.640> that<00:06:03.880> it<00:06:04.000> could<00:06:04.210> just<00:06:04.360> be<00:06:04.480> a

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
far too similar that it could just be a

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.900 
far too similar that it could just be a
DLC<00:06:05.230> I<00:06:05.470> mean<00:06:05.980> I<00:06:06.100> don't<00:06:06.310> agree<00:06:06.490> with<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:06.700> in

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
DLC I mean I don't agree with that in

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.640 
DLC I mean I don't agree with that in
the<00:06:06.940> first<00:06:07.210> place<00:06:07.330> but<00:06:07.690> but<00:06:08.200> maybe<00:06:08.410> it's<00:06:08.590> just

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
the first place but but maybe it's just

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.350 
the first place but but maybe it's just
because<00:06:08.890> I'm<00:06:09.190> a<00:06:09.280> battlefield<00:06:09.580> fanboy<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.330> I

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
because I'm a battlefield fanboy that I

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.240 
because I'm a battlefield fanboy that I
don't<00:06:10.630> agree<00:06:10.840> with<00:06:10.930> that<00:06:11.080> but<00:06:11.470> but<00:06:12.040> that's

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
don't agree with that but but that's

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.280 
don't agree with that but but that's
really<00:06:12.430> besides<00:06:12.880> the<00:06:12.970> point<00:06:13.270> what<00:06:14.020> do<00:06:14.169> you

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
really besides the point what do you

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.230 
really besides the point what do you
guys<00:06:14.500> think<00:06:14.560> about<00:06:15.010> these<00:06:15.370> sort<00:06:15.640> of<00:06:15.700> changes

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
guys think about these sort of changes

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.940 
guys think about these sort of changes
that<00:06:16.480> we've<00:06:16.630> seen<00:06:16.870> to<00:06:17.050> battlefield<00:06:17.500> hardline

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
that we've seen to battlefield hardline

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.159 
that we've seen to battlefield hardline
so<00:06:18.190> far<00:06:18.460> don't<00:06:19.210> forget<00:06:19.450> the<00:06:19.660> game<00:06:19.810> is<00:06:20.050> still

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
so far don't forget the game is still

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.409 
so far don't forget the game is still
quite<00:06:20.980> a<00:06:21.010> long<00:06:21.280> way<00:06:21.460> from<00:06:21.520> release<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.150> probably

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
quite a long way from release I probably

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.420 
quite a long way from release I probably
say<00:06:22.690> maybe<00:06:22.930> four<00:06:23.560> or<00:06:23.590> five<00:06:23.950> months<00:06:24.220> from

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
say maybe four or five months from

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.770 
say maybe four or five months from
release<00:06:24.760> at<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:24.970> moment<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.419> this<00:06:25.510> is<00:06:25.660> why

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
release at the moment and this is why

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.630 
release at the moment and this is why
we're<00:06:25.990> seeing<00:06:26.140> all<00:06:26.350> these<00:06:26.470> changes<00:06:26.770> they've

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
we're seeing all these changes they've

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.130 
we're seeing all these changes they've
got<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.000> time<00:06:28.210> to<00:06:28.240> make<00:06:28.540> these<00:06:28.690> changes<00:06:28.930> and

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
got the time to make these changes and

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.380 
got the time to make these changes and
see<00:06:29.440> how<00:06:29.620> things<00:06:29.890> fit<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:30.910> ultimately<00:06:31.300> I

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.390 
see how things fit and ultimately I

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.909 
see how things fit and ultimately I
think<00:06:31.480> they're<00:06:31.780> doing<00:06:31.870> a<00:06:32.050> really<00:06:32.320> good<00:06:32.530> job<00:06:32.590> at

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
think they're doing a really good job at

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.200 
think they're doing a really good job at
the<00:06:32.980> moment<00:06:33.160> but<00:06:33.610> let<00:06:33.820> me<00:06:33.850> know<00:06:33.940> down<00:06:34.150> below
