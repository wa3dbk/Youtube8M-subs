00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.190
 video in this is about the topic 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
 overcome the training plateau 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.389
 how can I get it out of the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.010
 stagnation come out so that i 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.929
 Continue with muscle volume increase 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.830
 or my power on 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.540
 can increase 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 what is meant by one? 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.930
 Training space a workout space is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 a condition in which the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.949
 efficiency does not continue 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 improved and you literally up 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.689
 the spot occurs that can be in the reason 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.109
 depending on the goal in two points noticeable 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.880
 do 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 at the first point it is the muscle 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 volume which does not increase further 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 For example, the upper arm circumference remains 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.020
 40 cm and he just will not be anymore 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.059
 the second point in which is a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 training course can be noticeable 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.079
 the force because this did not strike 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 Continue with, for example, the bench press 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 you just can not get over the 80 kilo 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 stay here and just create one 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.289
 few repetitions 85 kilo are to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.789
 example is not possible and 90 is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.469
 not to think at all 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.239
 so in these two points can be 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.710
 make a training plateau noticeable 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 about a training place in bodybuilding 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 or training to overcome there are 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 the most different approaches 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.939
 and each one has its own special one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.229
 a right to exist in fashion 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.850
 a possibility in my opinion 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.860
 probably also the best out of the trainings 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 To come out of stagnation is for one 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 few weeks the training plan too 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.409
 For example, change from one to two 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.119
 or three split on one 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.350
 Change whole body workout or 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.119
 of course the other way around 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.759
 This simply gives you the opportunity 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.950
 to put new stimuli and the body out 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.750
 to get out of the habit 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 also it is not wrong for a few 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.680
 weeks to change the training method 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.700
 and thereby new stimuli in the musculature 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.350
 to put 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 there is a possibility after the hit 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 To train the system you can do the five 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.570
 use five system or times 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.979
 to train for pid france 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.049
 There are different training methods 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.970
 which you should try out for yourself 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.500
 should discover and just something 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.530
 should experiment 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.659
 and definitely for a few weeks around 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 easy to determine if it is 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.939
 a slightly and thereby bring 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.680
 muscle volume or the force rises 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.630
 further possibility a possible 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.819
 It is the training ground to overcome 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 current training schedule more intense too 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.180
 shape 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.340
 here are the most diverse 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.230
 For example, you can add options 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.480
 put some exercises with great 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.640
 work this is already done 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.500
 to apply the pyramid model 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.719
 This already can happen 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.670
 you try putting it with rob 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.469
 these are different ways around 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.900
 Just keep the current training plan 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.450
 make it more intensive and thus new 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.189
 Stimulate the trained muscles 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.319
 also put a variation of the 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.150
 Repetitive number can be a positive 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.530
 effect on the training and to do so 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.139
 lead that one to a training place 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.489
 For example , you overcome one 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.530
 longer time with heavy weights 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.260
 but results for some repetitions 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030
 Maybe it's the training 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.280
 reduce weight and for that the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.560
 to increase repetition numbers 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.169
 If necessary, this can be the yes 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.299
 Muscle endurance improves what it does 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.980
 that leads to a two week stay 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.200
 rehabilitated and then back to his 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.030
 original aggravating enix weight 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.069
 the training returns with this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.870
 easier and therefore easy 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 jump to an even heavier weight 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.829
 It is also easier to make a change 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.750
 Exercise order can lead to that 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.129
 one overcomes a training course he 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.019
 because now just yours 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.659
 training plan backwards or else 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.180
 starts a workout with the muscle group 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.849
 her normally always first at the end 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.409
 your training is already training this 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.239
 Simple steps can lead to it 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.849
 that your body is out of habit 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.859
 despite bringing out and putting new stimuli 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.989
 exchanging individual exercises 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:38.030
 or the variations of these 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.500
 in the current training plan can also 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.019
 cause a workout 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.939
 stagnation overcomes, for example 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.829
 Instead of the dumbbell, just press the bench 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.019
 time for a few weeks dumbbells 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.729
 press perform or instead of that 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.069
 training at the place just moved to the 

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.139
 Pull up the bar because you can go with it 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.030
 different exercises the same 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.879
 Muscle groups work out though 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.979
 slightly changed movements 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.079
 and benefits from it 

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:05.840
 body tremendous you can put new stimuli 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.419
 which will eventually restore the muscle 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.280
 volume can increase or the force in 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.669
 increase the individual muscle groups 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.989
 can 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.120
 also a change of the current ones 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.949
 Diet can have a positive effect 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.019
 to have the training and that 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.320
 For example, performance levels increase 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.810
 Just a few weeks to one 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.640
 caffier performs or one itself 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.680
 to feed some vegetarian time 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.930
 also the change of three big ones 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.240
 meals a day at six small 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.640
 meals can already have a positive 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.320
 effect on the performance level 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.570
 through the changed diet you have 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.300
 maybe just the advantage that you 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.220
 have more energy available and you 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.710
 This really makes training easy 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.720
 could afford more to last, too 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.260
 so supplements 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.790
 Dietary supplements can help 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.510
 help a training place too 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.430
 overcome 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
 admittedly they have only a small one 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.570
 impact on the actual training 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.220
 but then maybe one will benefit 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 or another of them if once a club 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.840
 like creative bcs or one 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.970
 workout booster before a workout 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.040
 Consumption also consumes a switch to 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.910
 new protein powder can be of advantage 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.530
 his 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.480
 I know about supplements can be 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.860
 argue there are two large groups 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.370
 the for the others are individually 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.680
 on the other hand 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.110
 I for my part but have quite 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.330
 positive experience with the one or 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.740
 other product in terms of my 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.160
 training made it important though 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.010
 knowledge 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.020
 Clemente are no miracle cure 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.300
 to overcome the training ground is not 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.180
 difficult because you have to really only know 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.770
 that new incentives put in training 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.930
 There must be different ones 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.070
 to approach there are different ones 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.960
 possibilities 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.310
 I've listed you a few now 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.930
 Now I want to know about you 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.450
 have you ever been under one 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.760
 Training course suffered if so like 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.920
 her overcome this writes like times 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.390
 As a comment under the video would me 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.140
 and many others I think burning 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.910
 interest 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.080
 otherwise if you have questions about the topic 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.540
 Training tracks overcome 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 you also like to leave a comment below
