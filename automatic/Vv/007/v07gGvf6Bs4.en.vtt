00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.869
 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.820
 mass effect Today I show you as you 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.310
 on the new family borgia den 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.240
 gets the ultimate lightning start and yes 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.699
 , the first thing you've got to 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.640
 of course build the lightning start and then 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.349
 you have to go here in crazy place and go 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.789
 to solve and that is how you can see there 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.470
 are lines with points in it and 2000 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.380
 the notes I have you as times 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.020
 help here what you want 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.280
 but that's all 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.720
 times because you are not needed now 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.130
 think that it is the same with you 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.120
 of course, but it can also be 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.890
 to be different every time 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.930
 yes it is actually easy to understand 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.490
 up there you can read or 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.020
 or read and you have to 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.080
 then just on the keyboard 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 Transfer and then you have to stop that 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.950
 right the lower one i connect 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.490
 say triangles are the white keys 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.440
 the black keys are the upper ones 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.830
 triangle and the whole challenged 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.210
 because n 21 23 we have together 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.670
 together the easter egg solved now 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.860
 a few days earlier 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.659
 and yes, since he played the piano at the time 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.520
 he knew directly what that is 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.290
 and I find it pretty cool always 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.080
 great if you can do that 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 and yes that was it already hears 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.310
 her right sound yes if 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.470
 you heard that everything was right and now 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.940
 still semeta yes if you talk this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.130
 you managed strode need for it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.540
 outside so out of the crazy place 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.790
 and now you find such everywhere 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.560
 Electricity generators that spark and make 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.140
 Noise you have to disable 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.060
 the first generator is tuning off 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.000
 when stemming at the machine, the second 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.350
 generator is under the church of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.030
 third generator is at the top of the church 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.610
 in there and it is not bad if 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.350
 the times over so you can you 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 twisting you from time to time 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.290
 in any case must be the part at the end of 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.120
 be so 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860
 sometimes they do not spark as well 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.660
 now in this case the spark just 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.950
 not but you hear the noise then 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.330
 you just have to pay attention to that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.149
 Noise goes after we turned 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.050
 yes, the fourth is here at the gallop 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:17.200
 vending machine to the entrance of wind the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:21.290
 fifth is initially room the sixth is 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.930
 the tank station is the seventh in the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.580
 workshop but that is mostly off so 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.470
 For me he has been out every now and then 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.880
 now even in this case is the off 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.420
 It may be that it is always so I know 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.930
 it not 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.280
 yes and the last eighth generator is yes 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.170
 next to packet yes betrays this noise 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.640
 you see everything is right now 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.140
 her a blue ray from the air 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.820
 come and now you have to be in the middle 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.680
 around in this fast and there is now 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.880
 your ball under such rotary plates 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.980
 then you have to do that with yours 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.660
 died and the plates all in the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.300
 Turn right color to the right one 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.640
 Turn color in this case 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.380
 and yes you have to go to the crazy place 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.770
 your life and young zombies died 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.930
 kill the bar fills up with halls and 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.650
 this symbol betrays you that the bar 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.050
 Charged it is framed in red and yes 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.180
 now you can take the bar and the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.950
 stab is now the ultimate flash 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.049
 died kaymers thing 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.180
 I played the most with me and 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.130
 I hope you like it as he likes me 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.060
 also like and I know thank 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.470
 to look for me i wish you 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.070
 have fun much success in zombies 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.780
 children and how to want to subscribe to 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.780
 the kid can she do it wonderfully
