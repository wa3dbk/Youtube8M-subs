00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.530 
around and I say if you don't want her
to<00:04:45.620> engage<00:04:45.770> just<00:04:46.430> kind<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.670> ignore<00:04:47.000> her<00:04:47.240> and

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
to engage just kind of ignore her and

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.200 
to engage just kind of ignore her and
usually<00:04:48.500> they'll<00:04:48.620> say<00:04:48.770> no<00:04:48.920> no<00:04:49.130> it's<00:04:49.310> cute<00:04:49.520> but

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
usually they'll say no no it's cute but

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.490 
usually they'll say no no it's cute but
I<00:04:50.240> think<00:04:50.450> as<00:04:50.570> long<00:04:50.600> as<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:50.930> kind<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.170> make<00:04:51.320> that

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
I think as long as you kind of make that

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500 
I think as long as you kind of make that
effort<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.160> we<00:04:52.610> haven't<00:04:52.880> had<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.120> use<00:04:53.300> them

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
effort and we haven't had to use them

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.570 
effort and we haven't had to use them
but<00:04:53.630> we<00:04:53.690> do<00:04:54.110> bring<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.740> ear<00:04:54.890> plugs<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.520> a
