 I learned with you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.360
 to know the data of the moon 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.670
 I learned with you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 that your presence does not change it 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 any 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.740
 I learned 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:43.890
 It makes greater joy nor counted 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.750
 and all the hours I lived with you 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.720
 Y 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.780
 i 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.780
 and I lived it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.410
 Continue like this 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.990
 your presence 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.200
 and illuminates 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.200
 yes 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.250
 s next to you 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.250
 not everything is wrong 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.610
 and I learned 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.610
 and the good things 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:46.930
 I felt myself and with you I learned that I 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.230
 I was born 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.230
 the day I met you 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.360
 do not 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.270
 I learned 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.030
 that it was a kiss to be more 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.790
 and the deepest 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.790
 I can leave tomorrow 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.670
 your good things that with you 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.670
 I learned 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.250
 that I was born 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.250
 since I met you 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.230
 Gentile 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.310
 when I decided 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 and when 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.200
 I learned with you 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.140
 we are going to face commercial so that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.940
 we can deliberate and then the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.530
 sentence as with key 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.110
 by maintaining characters destroyed the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.210
 song that is with you I learned what 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.920
 we have all in the mind there is in good 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.180
 marked but good I have 15 seconds left 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.840
 to take advantage of telling him that tomorrow 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.940
 I'm in Piura on the starboard bottom 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.010
 nothing else today I did not think it was a good 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.990
 trio thank you very much but nando mari 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.820
 carmen we listen very well jose jose 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.880
 it was in the timbre of voice of joseph joseph 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.710
 but we never go in time 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.340
 Christina alone were not in the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.740
 note 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.930
 I did not like your participation and I 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.750
 roll simply complied with the part 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.040
 that touched him on the subject in general 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.169
 disapproved in this trio very many 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.610
 thanks mari carmen ricardo your opinion 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.979
 because we are going to be repeated letter of the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.410
 song three thousand times on the blackboard i 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.910
 I have to say the time and I wonder why 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.770
 what do we make ourselves through this our 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.389
 artists that are all so talented the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.490
 challenge of this and we do not explain it to 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.169
 principle is that it is learning a 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.940
 song on the day this song you 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.660
 they have learned today they have rehearsed 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.220
 today and present it today and 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.450
 Sometimes they are successful sometimes not so much 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.040
 because the challenge is to maintain the 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.470
 imitation I feel that everyone has 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.050
 I tried a little bit, I think José José and I 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.800
 of roll and christina have faced 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.449
 the song and I think that for me all have 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.580
 disapproved unequally then 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.180
 I think where it came out equally badly in 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.440
 the recoil 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.480
 thank you very much jury gentlemen 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.360
 all right sir I ask you please 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.260
 take a seat while I tell you something 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.260
 very important
