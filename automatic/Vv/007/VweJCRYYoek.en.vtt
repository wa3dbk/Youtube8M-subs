 the one that won three times and that to be fixed in him deposited in him 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.880
 And social peace and that of the team I know that this disappoints 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.050

 watch video a ball 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.260
 and then they had a country 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 We have been working in the Peruvian Amazon 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 in a community 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.950
 amazon is withered otta 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.420
 and at this point we have already seen the subsistence modes we have seen as 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.860
 demonstrated with another table but also the environmental problems and difficulties 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 that faces

 yes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.110
 6 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.120
 they are part of this 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.040
 we want to open a space for reflection 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.910
 in both France and Argentina 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.220
 to discuss dialogue about the possible problems of consumerism 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.480
 in industrialized societies 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.550
 i 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.000
 I can write here discuss about the relationship between man nature and 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.520
 how natural resources are used in this society 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.300
 and compare it with 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.560
 a social 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 native the slaughter 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 to share the results of our research 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.730
 we have designed participative and playful workshops that 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.779
 we will be missing in argentine france as to who quotes other 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:22.939
 we also have planned to organize some traveling photographic exhibitions 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.379
 pain 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 on a note 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.919
 according to a broad 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.669
 legend 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.339
 amazonian 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.339
 who says that the soul of a person exists 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.409
 when it is reflected 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:05.680
 in the pupil 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.329
 from someone else 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.889
 then with this we understand 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.649
 of an accident 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.649
 because they existed if one does not know the other
