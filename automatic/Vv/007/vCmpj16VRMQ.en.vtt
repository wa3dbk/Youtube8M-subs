00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:11.219
 well this is a recording test 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.219
 with the iphone 6 plus we will see the time 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.450
 It's a quarter past eight until a little 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.450
 fucking mother on her own and in low light 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.700
 that yes they do it very well 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.690
 I notice 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.840
 I shake a lot my hand fuck 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.530
 I find it hard to keep the phone without 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.060
 that I shake at times the hand due to 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.660
 big phone size and weighing 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.780
 quite 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.290
 fucked up the good thing that it has is that it has 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.940
 an acojonant stabilizer as you have 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.860
 could see in the previous video where 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 engraving of the day 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.970
 about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and stabilizes 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.370
 let's go to death I think I can say that 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.980
 from the phone with better stabilized 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.989
 the one that tested to date 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.399
 and that over while stabilizing the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.399
 image is still seeing very well 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.100
 we will wait 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.600
 I do not 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.650
 or not 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.950
 all dogs that have way assumes 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.150
 the only bad thing is the microphone that I think 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.160
 records looser than other terminals the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.110
 theme of video recording and audio 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.440
 it comes out more weaker than others 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.810
 terminals also cancels quite 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.730
 noise when heard weaker but I 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.110
 almost that I'd rather have a volume 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.120
 high 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.490
 and even if it picks up more outside noise 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.340
 you know why the voice even sometimes 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 when it sounds I'm a bit windy 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.020
 I'm very weak voice so I do not know 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.840
 that depends on tastes there are people who 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.550
 he prefers to be heard is weaker and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.650
 less the wind and there are people who prefer 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.120
 that the loudest voice is heard but 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.520
 you also see a little more noise 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.240
 environment I am more than the second 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.940
 opinion anyway there is nothing that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.630
 discuss the stabilizer of this camera 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.810
 iphone 6 plus is great is more me 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.150
 Now I'm walking and I see the screen 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.670
 I'm hitting little boats, I do not know 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.770
 will destabilize with little light equal to 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.160
 well that by day now I will see it when 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.930
 upload to youtube but during the day it stabilized 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.620
 very well and you see that the light that there 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.140
 here is a bit shit 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.980
 if the little and the time then 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.959
 as you can see the 8 20 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.330
 and it is that I autofocus quite well the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.870
 I am now a car focused but good if 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.870
 Yes now 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.680
 Well, nothing, I think it's good 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.200
 this night recording test for 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.520
 that you see how it is that I record 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.520
 try to do a little zoom 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.700
 so you can see 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.080
 that even so it records well 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.050
 well I think it's fine as a test 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.050
 it's worth a greeting and until the next video
