but<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.270> reason<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.600> had<00:03:24.690> kept<00:03:24.900> putting<00:03:25.110> it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
but the reason we had kept putting it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.220 
but the reason we had kept putting it
off<00:03:25.490> getting<00:03:26.490> 3d<00:03:26.970> esses<00:03:27.270> is<00:03:27.390> because<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:28.110> know

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
off getting 3d esses is because you know

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.750 
off getting 3d esses is because you know
we<00:03:28.350> were<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.620> get<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.460> know<00:03:29.490> we<00:03:29.670> were

we were going to get to you know we were

we were going to get to you know we were
both<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.270> get<00:03:30.390> them<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.840> then<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:32.040> know

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
both going to get them and then you know

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.830 
both going to get them and then you know
we<00:03:32.280> probably<00:03:32.520> only<00:03:32.760> own<00:03:33.180> one<00:03:33.210> of<00:03:33.510> each<00:03:33.630> game

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.280 
except for things like Animal Crossing
so<00:03:35.520> we<00:03:35.610> could<00:03:35.730> play<00:03:35.850> together<00:03:36.050> but<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.170> be

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
so we could play together but to be

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.740 
so we could play together but to be
perfectly<00:03:37.440> honest<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.430> don't<00:03:39.240> think<00:03:39.480> we're

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
perfectly honest I don't think we're

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.900 
perfectly honest I don't think we're
going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.960> get<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.320> think<00:03:40.500> having<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.580> is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
going to get to I think having one is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.820 
going to get to I think having one is
fine<00:03:42.240> because<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.690> only<00:03:42.840> reason<00:03:43.410> we<00:03:43.650> would

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
fine because the only reason we would

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.910 
fine because the only reason we would
need<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.960> game<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.320> Animal

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
need to is for a game like Animal

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.290 
need to is for a game like Animal
Crossing<00:03:47.010> or<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.760> know<00:03:47.850> games<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.210> we

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
Crossing or you know games that we

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.840 
Crossing or you know games that we
wanted<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.600> play<00:03:48.810> together<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.580> actually<00:03:50.580> in

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
wanted to play together and actually in

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.100 
wanted to play together and actually in
the<00:03:50.910> case<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.150> Animal<00:03:51.420> Crossing<00:03:51.480> Mouse<00:03:51.840> said

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the case of Animal Crossing Mouse said

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.530 
the case of Animal Crossing Mouse said
that<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.620> have<00:03:52.800> two<00:03:53.580> different<00:03:53.940> guys<00:03:54.060> in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that we can have two different guys in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.750 
that we can have two different guys in
the<00:03:54.780> same<00:03:54.990> cart<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:56.010> live<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.580> same

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
the same cart like you live in the same

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.460 
the same cart like you live in the same
house<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.210> I<00:03:57.240> could<00:03:57.330> still<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.380> know

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
house so I could still you know

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.320 
house so I could still you know
essentially<00:03:59.010> play<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.610> if<00:03:59.910> there's<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.150> really

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
essentially play and if there's a really

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.950 
essentially play and if there's a really
cool<00:04:00.570> game<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.930> comes<00:04:01.140> out<00:04:01.380> for<00:04:01.950> 3ds<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:03.810> have

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
cool game that comes out for 3ds we have

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.770 
cool game that comes out for 3ds we have
one<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:05.100> we<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:05.850> we<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:05.970> play<00:04:06.210> it<00:04:06.330> it'd<00:04:06.750> be

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
one so we can so we can play it it'd be

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.160 
one so we can so we can play it it'd be
kind<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.080> cool<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.290> own<00:04:07.530> another<00:04:07.740> one<00:04:08.100> but<00:04:08.280> I

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
kind of cool to own another one but I

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
kind of cool to own another one but I
don't<00:04:10.170> know<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.320> would<00:04:10.560> rather<00:04:10.739> take<00:04:11.160> that

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.710 
which I think a majority of people are
but<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.100> cool<00:04:26.360> just<00:04:27.360> can't<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:27.630> over

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

Excel talk about how gigantic they are
because<00:05:31.240> I<00:05:31.570> guess<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.560> don't<00:05:33.130> know<00:05:33.190> it's

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
because I guess I don't know it's

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.280 
because I guess I don't know it's
different<00:05:33.460> holding<00:05:34.150> it<00:05:34.270> like<00:05:34.480> in<00:05:34.750> your<00:05:35.110> hand

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
different holding it like in your hand

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.620 
different holding it like in your hand
maybe<00:05:35.440> I<00:05:35.560> have<00:05:35.770> played<00:05:36.040> one<00:05:36.250> in<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:37.030> in-store

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
maybe I have played one in the in-store

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.840 
maybe I have played one in the in-store
display<00:05:37.990> but<00:05:38.200> actually<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:38.860> guess<00:05:39.430> having<00:05:39.640> it

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
display but actually I guess having it

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.160 
display but actually I guess having it
free<00:05:40.060> from<00:05:40.270> being<00:05:40.450> connected<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.020> wall

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
free from being connected to the wall

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.360 
free from being connected to the wall
feels<00:05:41.470> different<00:05:41.830> or<00:05:41.890> something<00:05:42.040> I<00:05:42.310> don't

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
downside to that is that I'm a little

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.400 
downside to that is that I'm a little
behind<00:06:15.700> on<00:06:16.060> vlogs<00:06:16.420> like<00:06:16.690> I've<00:06:16.810> gotten<00:06:17.230> ahead

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
scheduled but I've gotten a little

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.820 
scheduled but I've gotten a little
behind<00:06:22.000> on<00:06:22.120> blogs<00:06:22.600> and<00:06:22.750> it's<00:06:22.900> it's<00:06:23.620> bad

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
behind on blogs and it's it's bad
