video we'll pick up where we left off
last<00:00:15.500> time<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:16.400> start<00:00:16.640> assembling<00:00:17.090> the

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
last time and start assembling the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.880 
last time and start assembling the
pieces<00:00:17.359> we<00:00:17.720> made<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.019> the<00:00:18.109> first<00:00:18.260> video<00:00:18.650> and

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
pieces we made in the first video and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.130 
pieces we made in the first video and
we'll<00:00:19.640> start<00:00:19.850> breeding<00:00:20.030> some<00:00:20.330> AI<00:00:20.480> life<00:00:20.810> into

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
we'll start breeding some AI life into

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.060 
we'll start breeding some AI life into
our<00:00:21.230> spider<00:00:21.500> game

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
our spider game

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.439 
our spider game
we'll<00:00:22.490> cover<00:00:22.640> techniques<00:00:22.940> for<00:00:23.330> getting

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
we'll cover techniques for getting

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.300 
we'll cover techniques for getting
objects<00:00:24.020> interacting<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:24.710> each<00:00:24.740> other<00:00:24.949> and

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
objects interacting with each other and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.609 
objects interacting with each other and
moving<00:00:25.850> in<00:00:26.060> interesting<00:00:26.630> ways<00:00:26.660> we'll<00:00:27.500> also

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
moving in interesting ways we'll also

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.470 
moving in interesting ways we'll also
learn<00:00:27.920> how<00:00:28.100> to<00:00:28.130> set<00:00:28.400> conditions<00:00:28.609> defining<00:00:29.359> how

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
learn how to set conditions defining how

learn how to set conditions defining how
games<00:00:29.779> are<00:00:29.960> won<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.980> let's<00:00:31.520> start<00:00:31.760> by<00:00:31.880> seeing

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
games are won so let's start by seeing

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.580 
games are won so let's start by seeing
what<00:00:32.329> our<00:00:32.419> spider<00:00:32.719> game<00:00:32.899> will<00:00:33.050> look<00:00:33.170> like<00:00:33.350> when

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
what our spider game will look like when

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.830 
what our spider game will look like when
we're<00:00:33.710> finished<00:00:36.489> as<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:37.670> can<00:00:37.820> see<00:00:38.059> our<00:00:38.420> spider

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
we're finished as you can see our spider

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.420 
we're finished as you can see our spider
and<00:00:39.050> enemy<00:00:39.320> will<00:00:39.470> move<00:00:39.649> independently<00:00:40.280> of

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
and enemy will move independently of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.560 
and enemy will move independently of
each<00:00:40.520> other<00:00:42.579> then<00:00:43.579> when<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.850> player<00:00:44.059> taps<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
each other then when the player taps the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.959 
each other then when the player taps the
spider<00:00:44.870> he<00:00:45.410> chases<00:00:45.800> after<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.130> enemy<00:00:46.520> and

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
spider he chases after the enemy and

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.389 
spider he chases after the enemy and
gives<00:00:47.210> them<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.450> firm<00:00:47.809> smackdown<00:00:48.710> let's<00:00:49.190> jump

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
gives them a firm smackdown let's jump

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.970 
gives them a firm smackdown let's jump
into<00:00:49.610> assembly<00:00:50.210> than<00:00:50.540> AI<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.230> first<00:00:51.649> create

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
into assembly than AI and first create

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.819 
into assembly than AI and first create
the<00:00:52.010> starting<00:00:52.520> AI<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:52.850> our<00:00:53.149> spider<00:00:53.829> we'll

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
the starting AI for our spider we'll

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.380 
the starting AI for our spider we'll
start<00:00:55.100> with<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.399> walking<00:00:55.610> art<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:56.180> then

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
start with the walking art and then

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.540 
start with the walking art and then
making<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.780> loop<00:00:57.050> what<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:57.920> gonna<00:00:58.010> do<00:00:58.309> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
making it loop what we're gonna do is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.450 
making it loop what we're gonna do is
set<00:00:58.820> at<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.270> location<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.770> that<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.100> appears

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
set at a location so that it appears

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.100 
set at a location so that it appears
randomly<00:01:02.050> within<00:01:03.050> an<00:01:03.170> area<00:01:04.780> we'll<00:01:05.780> define

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
randomly within an area we'll define

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.129 
randomly within an area we'll define
with<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.409> bounding<00:01:06.890> box<00:01:07.039> the<00:01:08.029> area<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.689> which<00:01:09.020> it

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
with a bounding box the area in which it

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.760 
with a bounding box the area in which it
appears<00:01:09.469> randomly<00:01:10.090> okay<00:01:11.200> now<00:01:12.200> for<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.409> trigger

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
appears randomly okay now for a trigger

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.069 
appears randomly okay now for a trigger
what<00:01:13.729> we'll<00:01:13.819> want<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.060> do<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.509> at<00:01:14.779> a<00:01:14.810> specific

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
what we'll want to do is at a specific

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.679 
what we'll want to do is at a specific
time<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.969> that<00:01:16.969> time<00:01:17.240> being<00:01:17.810> exactly<00:01:18.529> at<00:01:19.420> 1<00:01:20.420> 1

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
time and that time being exactly at 1 1

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.889 
time and that time being exactly at 1 1
which<00:01:20.959> is<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.200> beginning<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.679> the<00:01:21.799> game<00:01:22.899> we'll

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
which is the beginning of the game we'll

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.859 
which is the beginning of the game we'll
have<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.229> be<00:01:24.409> our<00:01:24.529> trigger<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:26.539> so<00:01:26.689> moving

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
have that be our trigger and so moving

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.690 
have that be our trigger and so moving
on<00:01:27.170> to<00:01:27.349> action<00:01:28.119> will<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.329> travel<00:01:29.810> and

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
on to action will have it travel and

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:39.159 
on to action will have it travel and
roam<00:01:33.579> using<00:01:34.579> reflect<00:01:37.539> what<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.630> spider<00:01:38.929> will

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:39.169 
roam using reflect what the spider will

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:43.059 
roam using reflect what the spider will
do<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.619> it<00:01:40.189> will<00:01:40.219> roam<00:01:40.869> within<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.380> area<00:01:42.709> that

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
do is it will roam within this area that

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.530 
do is it will roam within this area that
we're<00:01:43.249> defining

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.320 

I<00:01:49.710> also<00:01:50.710> need<00:01:50.980> to<00:01:51.010> create<00:01:51.220> AI<00:01:51.550> for<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.000> enemy

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
I also need to create AI for the enemy

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.810 
I also need to create AI for the enemy
object<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.900> give<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.140> similar<00:01:53.500> movement<00:01:53.920> it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
object to give it similar movement it's

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.550 
object to give it similar movement it's
nearly<00:01:55.150> identical<00:01:55.270> though<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.290> we<00:01:56.410> did

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
nearly identical though to what we did

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.620 
nearly identical though to what we did
for<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.800> spider<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.790> we'll<00:01:57.940> skip<00:01:58.180> ahead<00:01:58.240> so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
for the spider so we'll skip ahead so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.910 
for the spider so we'll skip ahead so
you<00:01:58.660> can<00:01:58.870> see<00:01:59.110> what<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.380> game<00:01:59.530> looks<00:01:59.800> like

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
you can see what the game looks like

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.620 
you can see what the game looks like
with<00:02:00.280> both<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.640> them<00:02:00.760> moving<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.970> now<00:02:04.300> with<00:02:04.510> our

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
with both of them moving so now with our

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.630 
with both of them moving so now with our
objects<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.170> motion<00:02:05.320> let's<00:02:06.040> introduce<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
objects in motion let's introduce the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669 
objects in motion let's introduce the
main<00:02:06.790> mechanic<00:02:07.270> bar<00:02:07.479> game<00:02:07.690> which<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.290> tapping

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
main mechanic bar game which is tapping

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.620 
main mechanic bar game which is tapping
the<00:02:08.770> spider<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.369> making<00:02:09.970> him<00:02:10.060> hunt<00:02:10.270> down<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the spider and making him hunt down the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.340 
the spider and making him hunt down the
enemy<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> we'll<00:02:13.060> create<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> new<00:02:13.630> AI<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
enemy so we'll create a new AI for the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
enemy so we'll create a new AI for the
big<00:02:14.530> spider<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> tap<00:02:17.200> trigger<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.940> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
big spider so with a tap trigger and of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.670 
big spider so with a tap trigger and of
course<00:02:19.180> tapping<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.780> object<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.780> make<00:02:22.990> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
course tapping this object will make the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.400 
course tapping this object will make the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
jump into the AI for the enemy so this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.009 
jump into the AI for the enemy so this
time<00:02:53.920> we're<00:02:54.070> going<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.220> use<00:02:54.370> contact<00:02:55.019> because

time we're going to use contact because
we<00:02:56.140> want<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.410> react<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.340> spider<00:02:57.610> hits

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
we want it to react when the spider hits

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.420 
we want it to react when the spider hits
the<00:02:58.090> enemy<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.440> touch<00:03:00.750> another<00:03:01.750> object<00:03:01.959> and

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
the enemy so touch another object and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
the enemy so touch another object and
our<00:03:03.430> spider<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.820> three<00:03:06.850> things<00:03:07.060> we

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
our spider so of the three things we

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.720 
our spider so of the three things we
wanted<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.709> first<00:03:08.920> thing<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.640> we're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
wanted to do the first thing that we're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.720 
wanted to do the first thing that we're
going<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> do<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:11.519> we're<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
going to have it do is we're going to

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.890 
going to have it do is we're going to
have<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.030> stop<00:03:13.330> its<00:03:13.570> travel<00:03:15.360> and<00:03:16.360> adding

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
have it stop its travel and adding

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.350 
have it stop its travel and adding
another<00:03:16.989> action<00:03:17.620> we're<00:03:18.610> also<00:03:18.760> going<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.150> have

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
another action we're also going to have

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.440 
another action we're also going to have
it<00:03:19.600> change<00:03:19.959> its<00:03:20.170> art<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.430> naturally<00:03:21.910> we<00:03:22.120> select

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
it change its art so naturally we select

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.140 
it change its art so naturally we select
change<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.400> Kayode<00:03:24.880> art<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:27.150> then

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
change to the Kayode art and then

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.240 
change to the Kayode art and then
finally<00:03:28.720> we<00:03:29.140> talked<00:03:29.410> about<00:03:29.530> adding<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.070> sound

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
finally we talked about adding a sound

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.880 
finally we talked about adding a sound
effect<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.720> let's<00:03:31.900> go<00:03:32.049> ahead<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.620> choose

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
effect so let's go ahead and choose

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.030 
effect so let's go ahead and choose
sound<00:03:33.160> effect<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:38.200> slice<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.799> should

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
sound effect and this slice one should

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.120 
sound effect and this slice one should
work<00:03:39.190> out<00:03:39.400> pretty<00:03:39.880> good<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:41.620> thing<00:03:41.830> I'm<00:03:41.950> also

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
work out pretty good one thing I'm also

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.729 
work out pretty good one thing I'm also
going<00:03:42.430> to<00:03:42.489> do<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.880> turn<00:03:43.090> on<00:03:43.239> its<00:03:43.390> switch<00:03:43.739> every

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
going to do is turn on its switch every

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.530 
going to do is turn on its switch every
object<00:03:45.130> has<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.310> switch<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.670> we<00:03:45.970> can<00:03:46.120> turn<00:03:46.330> on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
object has a switch that we can turn on

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.330 
object has a switch that we can turn on
and<00:03:46.690> off<00:03:46.780> as<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.110> means<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.530> communicating<00:03:48.070> its

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and off as a means of communicating its

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.449 
and off as a means of communicating its
status<00:03:49.290> think<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.500> switch<00:03:50.799> like<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.100> flag

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
status think of a switch like a flag

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.100 
status think of a switch like a flag
that<00:03:51.790> we<00:03:51.910> can<00:03:52.090> tell<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.450> rise<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.930> say

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
that we can tell the rise and say

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.090 
that we can tell the rise and say
yoo-hoo

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
yoo-hoo

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.819 
yoo-hoo
something<00:03:54.609> important<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.150> happened

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
something important just happened

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.050 
something important just happened
switches<00:03:56.829> can<00:03:57.040> communicate<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.790> other

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
switches can communicate this to other

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.140 
switches can communicate this to other
objects<00:03:58.690> and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
objects and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.970 
objects and
can<00:03:59.239> also<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.870> an<00:03:59.959> indicator<00:04:00.110> of<00:04:00.620> whether<00:04:00.799> or
