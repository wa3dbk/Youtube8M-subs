already added a little bit of grass as
my<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.329> layer<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.440> top<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.920> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
my first layer because on top of that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.110 
my first layer because on top of that
I'm<00:00:44.280> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> use<00:00:44.730> some<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> our

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I'm going to use some of our

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.420 
I'm going to use some of our
battery-operated<00:00:45.629> lights<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
battery-operated lights and just to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.190 
battery-operated lights and just to
cushion<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:48.000> battery<00:00:48.390> box<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.930> went<00:00:49.110> ahead

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
cushion that battery box I went ahead

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
cushion that battery box I went ahead
and<00:00:49.320> put<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> grass<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> can

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
and put the grass down in then you can

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.930 
and put the grass down in then you can
unwind<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:52.170> lights<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.430> move<00:00:53.699> them

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
unwind your lights and just move them

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.290 
unwind your lights and just move them
around<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.390> bowl<00:00:55.550> trying<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> space<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.180> out

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
around the bowl trying to space them out

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
around the bowl trying to space them out
pretty<00:00:57.570> nicely<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> doesn't<00:00:59.340> work<00:00:59.460> out

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pretty nicely but if it doesn't work out

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
pretty nicely but if it doesn't work out
that<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.969> it's<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.600> tragic<00:01:00.870> it'll<00:01:01.320> be<00:01:01.410> just

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that way it's not tragic it'll be just

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.090 
that way it's not tragic it'll be just
fine

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
fine

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.359 
fine
I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.579> lights<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> color

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
I think lights look pretty in color

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.740 
I think lights look pretty in color
regardless<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.909> whether<00:01:06.060> they're<00:01:06.270> perfectly

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
regardless of whether they're perfectly

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.030 
regardless of whether they're perfectly
spaced<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> fill<00:01:09.360> those<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> bowl<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
spaced so fill those into the bowl for

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.130 
spaced so fill those into the bowl for
your<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.460> layer<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.750> gonna<00:01:12.869> add<00:01:13.110> some

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
your first layer then I'm gonna add some

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.350 
your first layer then I'm gonna add some
more<00:01:13.650> grass<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:19.110> hide<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.710> battery<00:01:20.009> box

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
more grass to hide the battery box

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
more grass to hide the battery box
spreading<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.920> see<00:01:23.280> those

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
spreading it out so that you see those

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
spreading it out so that you see those
lights<00:01:23.759> glowing<00:01:24.150> through<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> grass<00:01:24.900> that's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
lights glowing through the grass that's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.510 
lights glowing through the grass that's
part<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:26.009> makes<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.310> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
part of what I think makes this so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.600 
part of what I think makes this so
pretty<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> add<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.799> second<00:01:29.340> battery

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
pretty and then add your second battery

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.100 
pretty and then add your second battery
box<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.150> second<00:01:30.540> strand<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.930> lights

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
box with your second strand of lights

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
box with your second strand of lights
now<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.430> strand<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
now if you just want to do one strand of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.179 
now if you just want to do one strand of
lights<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.479> great<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
lights that's great but I do think that

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
lights that's great but I do think that
the<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.090> colors<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.750> with<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.320> pink<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the two colors here with the pink and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
the two colors here with the pink and
the<00:01:37.710> purple<00:01:37.920> especially<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:38.759> look

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the purple especially it really look

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.630 
the purple especially it really look
nice<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.860> I'm<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:40.979> gonna<00:01:41.100> thread<00:01:41.490> those

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
nice so I'm just gonna thread those

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
nice so I'm just gonna thread those
around<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.840> around<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> fold

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
around so you see them around the fold

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.499 
around so you see them around the fold

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
box more than the others and the great

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.880 
box more than the others and the great
thing<00:02:10.119> about<00:02:10.180> that<00:02:10.450> grass<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.140> separates

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
thing about that grass is it separates

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.440 
thing about that grass is it separates
really<00:02:12.160> easily<00:02:12.460> so<00:02:12.700> it's<00:02:12.850> pretty<00:02:13.000> easy<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
really easily so it's pretty easy to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.620 
really easily so it's pretty easy to
mash<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.840> down<00:02:14.640> okay<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.880> looks<00:02:16.000> pretty<00:02:16.150> well

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
I think the lights here it'd look really

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740 
I think the lights here it'd look really
pretty<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.340> nicely<00:02:18.610> spread<00:02:19.060> out<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:19.630> I'm

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
pretty and nicely spread out and now I'm

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.780 
pretty and nicely spread out and now I'm
going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.050> add<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.650> our<00:02:20.740> Luminara<00:02:21.250> candles

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790
