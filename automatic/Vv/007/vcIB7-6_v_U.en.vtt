00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.500
 the removal of the pool must be done gently 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 so as not to spoil the flatness of the city 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.460
 all 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 after positioning the class their active 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.150
 leaving enough space for backfilling 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.710
 our checks using the surveyor level the flatness of the hull by 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 report to the report 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 setting up a sump 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910
 will at any time check if the land is in us 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.860
 ap 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 after 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.329
 we then proceed 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.040
 an earthquake 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.000
 using crushed gravel 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 I will be proud of the goals of the fed 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.400
 the good compaction of predators was essential 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 to ensure a perfect fit of the fif 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.360
 for a rectangular pool 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 the performance can start with men 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.939
 kelly 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.589
 next comes the gluing of hydraulic hoses on the hull for 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.589
 connection to the technical room 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.949
 after fonts cleaning wise 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:23.149
 my name from the empty when he left in necklace and we can probably 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 turn on itself 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.809
 the pause is new after cleaning the applications 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.809
 domestic sealing 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.259
 laprise banier it consists of a rigid pipe high pressure 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.719
 the waterproofness of the projector 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 is also organized with great care 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.480
 we can now run local technical streets the steam pipes 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.099
 of the bomb of 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.079
 of taking go of the repression of the filtered waters 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.079
 as well as the 3g range 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.140
 complex peripheral embankment using crushed gravel contact 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.139
 with care 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.009
 everything is ready 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:01.659
 Montreal they have then a belt since all cases identified remeshing 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
 to serve as a basis for the market 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.749
 ap 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.310
 the markets they have positioned themselves in terms of a few precise images 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.599
 they are then glued using cement glue on the a6b time 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.739
 between each match she makes a colorful choice in a similar way 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:11.069
 or that she added a plasticizer to maintain elasticity 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.069
 necessary for their good performance 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.210
 on the underside of the market 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.210
 on africa joined the structure 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.370
 after general cleaning all that remains is to complete the equipment 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.349
 and proceeded to the last operation before impoundment 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.349
 constituted by the establishment of a safety commission 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:24.509
 the installation of the technical room on a gravel bed 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.009
 pearl is installing the various devices and proceeding to 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.009
 their franchise 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.889
 this film illustrates with Centraide pause one of the many models of the range 

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:50.969
 it does not replace in any case the manual of Pau and use which details the 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.529
 Precautions specific to each model and each case
