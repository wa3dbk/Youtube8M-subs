00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
European tradition and that it's more of

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.210 
European tradition and that it's more of
the<00:02:12.420> times<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:13.019> were<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.070> has

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the times that were in and that it has

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.759 
the times that were in and that it has
to<00:02:14.370> reflect<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.230> community<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.500> were<00:02:16.739> in

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
to reflect the community that were in

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.000 
to reflect the community that were in
and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.459> think<00:02:17.519> it's<00:02:17.790> something<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.420> wave<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.620> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and I think it's something a wave of the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.729 
and I think it's something a wave of the
future<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:21.090> way<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.110> there's<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
future in a way to have that there's a

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.670 
future in a way to have that there's a
big<00:02:22.980> part<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.970> incorporates<00:02:24.600> not<00:02:25.140> only<00:02:25.200> just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
