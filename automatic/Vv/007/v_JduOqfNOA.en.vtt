00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.999
 3 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.269
 a month ago, we had before us the prototype of what is now 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.960
 the new one 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.830
 olympus 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.120
 efe maybe then it has not changed many the new 3g network such that is what 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.360
 we already imagined that it was going to be an intermediate model between the Olympus 520 i 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.210
 the olympus e3 from which it borrows most of its benefits and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.950
 design 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.350
 the new camera will not reach the market the shop windows until January as well 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 that for now we can not try these production or post war models 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.460
 the performance of this new sensor we have 2 megapixels what yes 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.760
 we can do is by looking at 2 - within the controls the two options for 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.470
 see yes olympus 70 really contributed to the catalog of deductions 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.280
 they know each other before the new one of trying for a hundred with their older sister 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.139
 obvious 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:05.579
 that the similarities are very large anyway like that of 30 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.570
 we suppose hopefully it's a little cheaper has lost something along the way 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.420
 this entity of resistance in construction 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.510
 holy mass for example what the body of the metallic desestimase more robust 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.620
 that he was the penta 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.650
 and also some details of this entity as it is deep dt he had 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.950
 the slot for cards with an opening mechanism 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 in this case the system is more direct 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.910
 i more simple 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.420
 it is heavy, less about 200 grams 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.479
 is a bit smaller than the e3 but the grip on the networks that remains 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.660
 very comfortable and between your hands your body 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.359
 it seems quite a robust one of the things that we liked the most 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.280
 exactly like what happened with the eternal screen 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.310
 totally mobile that in this case grows from two commas 5 ados comas that you can 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 return case will allow us to take full advantage of treviso benefits 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.090
 disappointment on screen 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.060
 the idea of ​​taking into account therefore that the epe unlike what it is 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.679
 also features system that emphasized by contrast and facial tissue 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.490
 camera stations we started so it has not changed respect sometimes 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.550
 such as the 11-point focusing system 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.160
 the burst of five photos per second 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
 the double slot shared with compactflash cards that is to highlight 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.809
 The integrated flash body that allows us to control calls for unity 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.060
 plastic scholarships 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.580
 that stayed on the road apart what we have already mentioned about the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.210
 construction especially the body 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.160
 the viewer that happens to be one hundred percent alternated sale and 8 percent 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 also as we have been able to verify comparing the camera with the one of teas 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.409
 it has also lost a point of luminosity 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.519
 what is it that contributes then is attentive because before the changes we begin 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.790
 for a new sensor, we made it, then pixels arrive, which is true 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 keeps faithful to the fan of censorship ie patés thousand 200 iso 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 i also has its own fair legal system and shadow compensation 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.480
 if we submit to the controls number of the camera we will discover some 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.619
 news such as for example 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.419
 the general switch that now changed position already seems much more 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:51.050
 integrated 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.440
 in the later day 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.330
 new tamiles called electronic leveled that as it happens in some 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.830
 compacta cerrito osma inform if the camera is straight with respect to the horizon 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.899
 with another cement, we are making a production model 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:03.289
 and it is not operational yet 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.929
 in two ways are beach more options than active one of the aspects in which 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.649
 olympus made more emphasis when presenting this camera we have for 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:11.210
 example 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.850
 of the multiple exposure system but above all 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.250
 of the so-called creative scenes or just is creative are half a dozen of 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.440
 Functions that deem deep pop art 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.070
 he knew that all the pale luminous bull speak so old ancient cubago 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.630
 lékué along here 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.760
 or toy camera that the others told us effect this one did not sin the 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.970
 awarding these options is that the effects apply directly to the jp is 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.059
 and that if we are working with him we can perisurizar 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.439
 what andasol effects of the image 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.529
 other novelties we walk of the andes that we have discovered that we trust that 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.559
 the final version does not seem as hidden as this model of 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.340
 production 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 that possibility of saying various other formats of those proportions 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.890
 of image ranging from 4 3 to 3 2 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.880
 most common even panoramic format of the ninth cis pound very interesting 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.720
 square format 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.089
 from 6 6 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.209
 improvement picture that we have already mentioned is the contrasting approach that incorporates 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.319
 has been detained for 20 years as it happens with cameras and targets 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.880
 of the tax 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.099
 not all lenses are compatible with this stop system 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.820
 only the most recent 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.850
 precisely for that reason and when the owner arrives at the market it will be accompanied 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.320
 the new version of this 14 54 very known but I have votes of the eight 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.120
 with five whose main best contribution will be precisely 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.410
 compatible with the smell that by contrast important not to forget that the stop 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.610
 as it happens with the fsm 520 incorporates a system of mechanical stabilization 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.800
 integrated body with which any objective compatible with the bayonet 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.810
 four thirds 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.810
 You can enjoy the benefits of integrated stabilization 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.819
 for now it is unknown what will be the price of this Olympus 70 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.879
 when it reaches the market although in the United States there is already talk of one thousand 300 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.930
 dollars for the body what we know is that it will reach the shop windows 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.729
 in January we for now have spent a few hours very few hours actually 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.580
 with with this new body 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.860
 but enough for him is to know unemployed account 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.530
 that is a really very complete load in performance at 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.219
 building 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:05.349
 for this segment to which it is aimed sentenced moderate spinally the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.339
 only problem or the only doubt we have left is where will it be now? 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.439
 the olympus athens
