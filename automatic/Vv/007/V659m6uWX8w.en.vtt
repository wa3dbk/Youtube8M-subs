00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.710 

in<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.370> I'll<00:00:02.580> show<00:00:02.879> the<00:00:03.030> operation<00:00:03.629> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
in this video I'll show the operation of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.690 
in this video I'll show the operation of
this<00:00:03.870> very<00:00:04.110> interesting<00:00:04.350> mold<00:00:04.859> and<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.490> is

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
this very interesting mold and this is

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.940 
this very interesting mold and this is
action<00:00:06.060> over<00:00:06.390> molding<00:00:06.779> mold<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.710> means

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
action over molding mold and that means

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.770 
action over molding mold and that means
you<00:00:08.130> put<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.429> metal<00:00:08.670> insert<00:00:08.970> or<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.480> plastic

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
you put a metal insert or a plastic

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.950 
you put a metal insert or a plastic
insert<00:00:10.290> inside<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> cavity<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.509> plastic

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
insert inside the cavity and the plastic

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.289 
insert inside the cavity and the plastic
is<00:00:13.049> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.380> form<00:00:13.679> an<00:00:13.950> encapsulation<00:00:14.910> around

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
is going to form an encapsulation around

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.870 
is going to form an encapsulation around
it<00:00:15.450> over<00:00:16.350> molding<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.830> also<00:00:17.160> good<00:00:17.490> for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
it over molding is also good for

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.760 
it over molding is also good for
electronics<00:00:18.630> enclosure<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.529> case

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
electronics enclosure but in this case

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
electronics enclosure but in this case
I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> over<00:00:21.029> mold<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.449> metal<00:00:22.050> handle

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I'm going to over mold a metal handle

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.230 
I'm going to over mold a metal handle
from<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.180> hydraulic<00:00:24.180> cylinder<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.849> there

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
from this hydraulic cylinder and there

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
from this hydraulic cylinder and there
it<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.750> I'll<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.230> pop<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.679> inside<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
it is and I'll just pop it inside this

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
it is and I'll just pop it inside this
opening<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.570> secures<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.110> place<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
opening and it secures it in place and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:02:12.750 
opening and it secures it in place and
ready<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> fill<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.910> plastic<00:00:39.450> all<00:00:39.719> around<00:00:40.200> it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.430 

and<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:13.880> going<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.210> let<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.450> cool<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:14.960> longer

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
and I'm going to let it cool it longer

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.040 
and I'm going to let it cool it longer
since<00:02:15.710> it's<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:16.070> very<00:02:16.280> large<00:02:16.810> injection<00:02:17.810> for

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
since it's a very large injection for

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.900 
since it's a very large injection for
the<00:02:18.080> plastic<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> solidify<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:19.730> would

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
the plastic to solidify so it would

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.720 
the plastic to solidify so it would
deform<00:02:20.420> or<00:02:20.630> rip<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.500> handle<00:02:21.890> will<00:02:22.490> not<00:02:22.610> be

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
deform or rip off the handle will not be

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:45.970 
deform or rip off the handle will not be
molded<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.870> there's<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.170> top<00:02:45.470> part<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.830> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
molded and there's a top part of the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.840 
molded and there's a top part of the
handle<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.640> can<00:02:46.700> see<00:02:47.290> right<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.850> you'll

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
handle you can see right here and you'll

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.370 
handle you can see right here and you'll
see<00:02:50.120> how<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.330> bottom<00:02:50.660> looks<00:02:50.960> like<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.320> a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
see how the bottom looks like in a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.950 
see how the bottom looks like in a
second<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.780> this<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.410> bottom<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.780> it's

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
second and this is the bottom so it's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.260 
second and this is the bottom so it's
actually<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.470> four-piece<00:03:04.070> mold<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.640> then<00:03:05.090> you

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
actually a four-piece mold and then you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:13.260 
actually a four-piece mold and then you
will<00:03:05.390> just<00:03:05.420> push<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.960> out<00:03:06.080> like<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:12.530> and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
will just push it out like this and

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.760 
will just push it out like this and
there<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:14.300> have<00:03:14.480> your<00:03:14.780> final<00:03:15.020> product<00:03:15.380> and

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
there you have your final product and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.080 
there you have your final product and
over<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> mold<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.370> handle<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.850> then<00:03:16.970> it

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
over a mold and handle and then it

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.690 
over a mold and handle and then it
regularly<00:03:17.450> goes<00:03:18.110> back<00:03:18.470> into<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.980> jack<00:03:19.310> like

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
regularly goes back into the jack like

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.160 
regularly goes back into the jack like
this<00:03:23.710> thanks<00:03:24.710> for<00:03:24.830> watching
