00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.870
 Y 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.990
 directional has an indicator of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.879
 almost neutral running speed 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.240
 first second third third fourth or 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.640
 sixth 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.710
 have 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.800
 from this place we can validate 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 odometer 31 that are the odometer 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.099
 partial we have trip 2 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.300
 in this place it indicates us for example and 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.750
 is telling us that it has the support 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.320
 side down I give him here he's going to 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 show an average 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.500
 of consumption in liters per km 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.379
 and in this place he shows us a 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.789
 mileage that is regressive where we 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.220
 is indicating when you leave the 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.900
 maintenance of the motorbike 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.430
 the first maintenance is to 2000 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.620
 so that's why he started in 1000 and he 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.240
 I was coming back after doing the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.490
 first review in the authorized workshop 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.980
 he did not schedule it to step on the thousands 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.230
 special 5000 and it's going back when 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.830
 the user is going to do another 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.300
 time is the maintenance 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.400
 and he managed to observe that they showed it 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.810
 battery indicator down and like 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.240
 that when he shows us and starts to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.460
 blinking here is a warning signal for 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.940
 tell us that there is something that the motorcycle 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.940
 to be going down 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 What else can I share here? 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.829
 the fuel gauge and the 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.350
 temperature indicator is bar 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.909
 temperature has 13 lines more or less 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.909
 when it reaches line number 10 or 11 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.069
 the extractor is turned on 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.760
 are some of the functions that it has 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.130
 the east board of this indicator 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.440
 I can program it so that at 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.490
 torque revolutions start at 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.120
 crash if I was going to continue on 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.470
 I continued without fixed until I scheduled it 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.790
 so that it reaches the revolutions of the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.250
 power then I can program 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.550
 torque revolutions in power for 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.150
 give the right condition to my engine 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.150
 all programmable
