00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.389
 recycled very beautiful and super original and 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:16.349
 well it's a 20 like this if you see here 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.519
 I tried to make a Franco 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.439
 supposedly to see if I stay to see 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.510
 what do you think to see if it appears or 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.119
 No, well, as I said, it's 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.980
 recycled because I am recycling a 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.349
 glass container and good as you 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.849
 I said is a sweet that for the part of 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.169
 inside we can throw our candy or 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.570
 a small gift that we want 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.090
 give this special person in this 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.950
 halloween and as I told them lamp since 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.390
 we just have to turn on this 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.100
 lamp and at the time of m to put it 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.570
 convert a nice little lamp so 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.240
 the person who gives it to you is not 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.070
 he's just going to have a candy bar 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.290
 that also a nice lamp and good 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.000
 it is only a matter of making 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.130
 night 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 as well as now and see how pretty 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.810
 turn this lamp as you see it shines 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.239
 very nice and the truth looks super super 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.310
 nice and good so if you want to learn 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.170
 to make this pretty little lamp, since 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.939
 this video that I will show you how 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.490
 and good first thing we have to do 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.860
 is to learn our lights because if not 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.140
 we learn them because you can not see anything and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.670
 We can do our craft and good 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
 Here I tell you so that you can continue to see it 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 and good things that we are going to need 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.220
 of course it's going to be a container of 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.869
 preferable glass this is long but 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.509
 you can also how to occupy others 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.430
 smaller ones like now I'm going to 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.909
 teach I know a pumpkin occupy one more 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.340
 short and more chubby and good too 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.909
 we are going to need a lamp of these 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.670
 they are from piles so they do not burn in 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.940
 They could also put a candle 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.510
 those that are of d 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.250
 wax but it would be better not to put 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.340
 the lid because then so you can leave 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 the hot and good town we are also going 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.650
 to need Chinese paper colors 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.720
 that you are going to use to do in 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.460
 this case for the Francoist I used 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.310
 green and for him is the pumpkin I'm going to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.649
 occupy orange we are also going to 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.510
 need form or paper to decorate by 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.030
 the outside part this is being 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.300
 using diamond foami too 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.250
 we're going to avoid white glue but that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.010
 Dry transparent any type that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.380
 you have a little broach and that's 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.030
 all good to start the first thing that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.260
 we have to do in getting our 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.930
 brush our our glue and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.640
 our Chinese paper ok what they go to 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.740
 do in this case as I told you it's very 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.630
 I'm going to make a zucchini so I'm going to 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.920
 use orange what they have to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.810
 to do is that they have to do it in 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.760
 little squares like I did here 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.650
 the squares do not have to be perfect 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.810
 you can not either do not need to 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.950
 are so small or so big and good 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.840
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.050
 remove the lid and we will win 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.660
 our little pieces of Chinese paper and 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.390
 let's do this let's put 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.430
 enough glue to our container 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.519
 let's put glue with our 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.500
 skewer on the inside ok 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.519
 the inside we put glue 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.580
 then we put our Chinese paper ok 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.860
 and then we go back to another layer 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.440
 of glue and on top of that layer of 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.620
 glue let's go back to put another 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.930
 china paper 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.239
 and we sealed it again with a little more 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.549
 of glue and so will be two layers that 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.069
 we are going to use this way they are going to do everything 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.200
 the container on the bottom also 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.170
 as well as this and also the part of 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.020
 down has 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.989
 after I'm all I know they expect 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.640
 I'll dry it if they're going to dry it 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.069
 inside your house it takes like a day 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.370
 but then if they take it outside in the air 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.200
 sun in a few hours or maybe on average 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.200
 Time is now ready after you are 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.810
 ready we will be as well as this as 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.670
 I told them I'm going to make a pumpkin 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.370
 completely dry already after it is 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.830
 dry let's start decorating it like 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.660
 I told them I'm going to make a pretty 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.360
 squash so I'll see that the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.830
 place is the one I like the most and where 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.959
 have the place that I like the most 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.280
 I'm just going to cut out how 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.810
 in this case it's going to be the zucchini 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:23.550
 clipping 23 saplings a mouth and a 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.280
 nose and is that I have lost 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.349
 here it is and now I'm just going to 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.449
 start to paste the the can paste with 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.490
 hot silicone with any glue 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.860
 on this occasion this form already comes with 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.090
 a glue so I'm just going 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.770
 to beat my calabacita ok 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.210
 since I'm well stuck 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.210
 let's put the little eyes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 even though 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.010
 the truth is super easy they can do it 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.340
 with children children can help in 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:59.010
 Pasting the paper can help decorate it 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.410
 how is this formica comes with glue 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.270
 because children are not in danger and if 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.400
 they're going to stick it with silicon, you guys 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.500
 you can do this part and good and 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.430
 decorated simply we cast our 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:16.920
 sweet milestones or what they will give away 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:19.980
 and we put the light bulb ok so and now 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.800
 the cap is this cap you can 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.450
 paint or they can cover it in this case 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.870
 like a zucchini just the 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.490
 paint green and that would be all of you 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.790
 You can put the cardboard in the part of 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.770
 in or in the little bottle 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.350
 they can also dedicate or 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.990
 whatever and good the Francoist and what 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.790
 which says that good thing for the boquita 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.850
 within the green Chinese paper and the 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.350
 little mouth I made it from a band of foami 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.830
 simply the report has been a 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.600
 mouth and curved and to do these 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.300
 little things just like bands of 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.250
 foami and nothing else sticks and nose 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.340
 and this is a half circle as you see here 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.830
 shape and green eyes is a way 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.920
 white one circle one smaller circle 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.410
 it was my black and this is a circle of 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.570
 green foami and then this one half and the 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.670
 another half the other half is here the 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.700
 cut and the cut is supposedly 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.460
 and it is equally a strip of was 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.139
 my red and I made him like that 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.389
 to make it look 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.129
 now these little things that have franchises 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:23.930
 that I do not know that I hope that 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.969
 explain what things are these that carry 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.620
 here on the sides just over it 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.419
 of squares of form one after another 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.539
 our others and well that was already done 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.400
 effect for the hair just what 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.009
 I made him cut a long strip 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.050
 of black foami and I just made him like that 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.550
 some zig zag or a few clipping 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.710
 Triangles as more is done more 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.169
 easy and simply stick it 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.749
 around my lid so that it is the 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.849
 little horse up here is this the paper 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:52.460
 black scrapbook but you too 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.400
 You can put it in foami simply 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.469
 takes the measure of our stage and already very 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.250
 easy and good as I told you I hit him 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:03.110
 inside the lamp and that's how it is 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.830
 inside you simply have to put your 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.599
 gift to the person who gave it to him 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.520
 good your gift your sweets or if it is 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.889
 for you decoration simply because 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.379
 he puts the bulb and ready as they 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.779
 I said this does not burn they are pile 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:20.569
 do they are not going to turn on now if 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:22.460
 I want to use the other lamps 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.889
 of the candles can also put 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.559
 but they just do not put the lid on it 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.599
 ok and good that's all that's how we 

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:32.389
 you just have to turn off the light 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.789
