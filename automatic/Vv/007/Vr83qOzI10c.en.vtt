are<00:01:09.990> made<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> big<00:01:11.180> hunters<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.299> made<00:01:12.450> out

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
are made out of big hunters are made out

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.030 
are made out of big hunters are made out
of<00:01:12.780> worms<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> reason<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.710> come<00:01:16.920> in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of worms and the reason they come in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
of worms and the reason they come in
pairs<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.270> worms<00:01:18.509> can't<00:01:18.960> fit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pairs is because all the worms can't fit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
pairs is because all the worms can't fit
into<00:01:19.909> one<00:01:21.560> thing<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.710> Hunter<00:01:23.009> armor<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.790> they

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
into one thing of Hunter armor so they

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.399 
into one thing of Hunter armor so they
put<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.350> supplicant<00:01:25.799> fit<00:01:26.070> into

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
put the other the supplicant fit into

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.749 
put the other the supplicant fit into
the<00:01:28.409> other<00:01:28.590> hunter<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.280> why<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.579> come

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the other hunter so that's why they come

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.390 
the other hunter so that's why they come
in<00:01:29.939> pairs<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.570> they're<00:01:31.530> pretty<00:01:32.009> much<00:01:32.070> like

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

very the joints are very stiff at first

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.840 
very the joints are very stiff at first
and<00:02:48.800> that's<00:02:48.920> great<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.370> when<00:02:49.760> you're

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
and that's great because when you're

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.080 
and that's great because when you're
trying<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> stand<00:02:50.390> them<00:02:50.510> up<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.820> don't<00:02:52.970> really

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
trying to stand them up you don't really

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.030 
trying to stand them up you don't really
have<00:02:53.240> to<00:02:53.330> worry<00:02:53.750> about<00:02:54.200> them<00:02:54.410> falling<00:02:54.620> over

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
have to worry about them falling over

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.340 
have to worry about them falling over
but<00:02:55.670> over<00:02:55.880> time<00:02:56.120> it<00:02:56.180> seems<00:02:56.690> like<00:02:56.810> their<00:02:56.959> joints

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
but over time it seems like their joints

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.190 
but over time it seems like their joints
get<00:02:57.730> Lilly<00:02:58.730> loose<00:02:59.000> like<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.450> guys<00:02:59.780> hard<00:03:00.020> to

get Lilly loose like this guys hard to

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.020 
get Lilly loose like this guys hard to
is<00:03:00.320> getting<00:03:00.530> hard<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.920> stand<00:03:01.190> because<00:03:01.730> his

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
is getting hard to stand because his

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.770 
is getting hard to stand because his
joints<00:03:02.420> are<00:03:02.480> getting<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:02.870> loose<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.780> it

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.030 
joints are getting so loose and it
really<00:03:05.959> sucks<00:03:06.350> because<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.650> takes<00:03:06.769> away<00:03:06.890> from

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really sucks because it takes away from

really sucks because it takes away from
the<00:03:07.190> pose<00:03:07.430> ability<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.120> figure<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:10.310> you

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
the pose ability of the figure but you

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.620 
the pose ability of the figure but you
can't<00:03:10.580> have<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.790> mess<00:03:10.970> with<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.510> be

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
can't have to mess with it and be

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.960 
can't have to mess with it and be
careful<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:13.280> worst<00:03:13.459> thing<00:03:13.640> about<00:03:13.760> this

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
careful the worst thing about this

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.270

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
to make the plastic software so you can

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.120 
to make the plastic software so you can
you<00:03:36.140> know<00:03:37.060> put<00:03:38.060> them<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.269> there<00:03:38.450> easier

this is Tartarus he is a brute in scale

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.000 
this is Tartarus he is a brute in scale
with<00:04:50.400> other<00:04:50.760> brutes<00:04:51.169> so<00:04:53.270> he<00:04:54.270> will<00:04:54.390> make<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.600> good

what<00:06:27.080> a<00:06:27.140> grunt<00:06:27.380> looks<00:06:27.590> like<00:06:30.520> and<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.640> all<00:06:31.790> of

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
what a grunt looks like and to all of

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.970 
what a grunt looks like and to all of
these<00:06:32.180> guys<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:34.750> the<00:06:35.750> grunt<00:06:36.020> is<00:06:36.200> very<00:06:36.560> much

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:36.980 
these guys and the grunt is very much

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:45.070 
these guys and the grunt is very much
dwarfed<00:06:37.610> by<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:39.620> hunters<00:06:40.010> and<00:06:41.710> it's<00:06:42.710> like<00:06:44.080> you

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
dwarfed by the hunters and it's like you

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.240 
dwarfed by the hunters and it's like you
probably<00:06:45.260> wouldn't<00:06:45.530> even<00:06:45.590> think<00:06:45.770> that<00:06:46.040> the

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
probably wouldn't even think that the

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.970 
probably wouldn't even think that the
hunter<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:46.610> the<00:06:47.140> grunt<00:06:48.140> come<00:06:48.380> from<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.770> same

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
hunter and the grunt come from the same

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.790 
hunter and the grunt come from the same
you<00:06:49.550> know<00:06:49.580> action<00:06:50.000> for<00:06:50.150> your<00:06:50.240> line<00:06:50.650> but<00:06:51.650> they

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
you know action for your line but they

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.280 
you know action for your line but they
do<00:06:51.860> and<00:06:52.220> they<00:06:53.150> are<00:06:53.270> very<00:06:53.300> small<00:06:53.900> compared<00:06:54.230> to

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.290 
do and they are very small compared to

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.770 
do and they are very small compared to
them<00:06:54.560> which<00:06:54.710> is<00:06:54.790> why<00:06:55.790> halo<00:06:56.240> is<00:06:56.360> such<00:06:56.540> a<00:06:56.570> great

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
them which is why halo is such a great

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:04.870 
them which is why halo is such a great
um<00:06:59.260> figure<00:07:00.490> thing<00:07:01.490> I<00:07:01.970> guess<00:07:02.930> to<00:07:03.700> army<00:07:04.700> build

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
um figure thing I guess to army build

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.610 
um figure thing I guess to army build
with<00:07:05.120> because<00:07:05.480> they<00:07:05.630> have<00:07:05.750> so<00:07:05.960> many<00:07:06.020> that<00:07:06.500> you

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
with because they have so many that you

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.550 
with because they have so many that you
have<00:07:06.740> bigger<00:07:07.070> figures<00:07:07.520> that<00:07:07.880> you<00:07:07.910> can<00:07:08.150> get<00:07:08.560> you

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
have bigger figures that you can get you

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.680 
have bigger figures that you can get you
know<00:07:09.590> and<00:07:10.130> then<00:07:10.820> there's<00:07:11.000> smaller<00:07:11.390> figures

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:11.690 
know and then there's smaller figures

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.490 
know and then there's smaller figures
and<00:07:12.050> medium-sized<00:07:12.530> figures<00:07:12.920> and<00:07:13.250> smaller<00:07:14.500> to

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
and medium-sized figures and smaller to

and medium-sized figures and smaller to
medium<00:07:15.530> sized<00:07:16.070> figures<00:07:16.490> and<00:07:17.230> yeah<00:07:18.230> this<00:07:18.470> is<00:07:18.590> a

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
medium sized figures and yeah this is a

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.710 
medium sized figures and yeah this is a
bunch<00:07:18.860> of<00:07:19.010> cool<00:07:19.190> stuff<00:07:19.430> you<00:07:19.490> can<00:07:19.670> do<00:07:20.300> a<00:07:20.540> bunch

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 
bunch of cool stuff you can do a bunch

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.180 
bunch of cool stuff you can do a bunch
of<00:07:20.840> cool<00:07:20.990> poses<00:07:21.230> you<00:07:21.530> can<00:07:21.680> get<00:07:21.860> out<00:07:22.010> of<00:07:22.040> these

of cool poses you can get out of these
figures<00:07:22.460> and<00:07:22.940> I<00:07:23.210> would<00:07:24.140> recommend<00:07:24.230> getting

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:24.910 
figures and I would recommend getting

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.659 
figures and I would recommend getting
the<00:07:25.910> hunters<00:07:26.270> and<00:07:26.630> pretty<00:07:27.590> much<00:07:27.650> most<00:07:28.370> of<00:07:28.550> the

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:28.669 
the hunters and pretty much most of the

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:30.490 
the hunters and pretty much most of the
halo<00:07:28.970> three<00:07:29.330> figures<00:07:29.510> except<00:07:29.960> for<00:07:30.110> one<00:07:30.260> side

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
halo three figures except for one side

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.980 
halo three figures except for one side
