protective<00:00:50.670> padding<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.350> idea<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.739> this

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
protective padding so the idea of this

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
protective padding so the idea of this
kite<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.550> actually<00:00:53.699> fits<00:00:54.120> onto<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> back

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
kite is it actually fits onto the back

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
protection at the back of the phone

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.029 
protection at the back of the phone
you've<00:01:00.420> got<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> usual<00:01:00.989> cut<00:01:01.350> outs<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.800> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you've got the usual cut outs here so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.520 
you've got the usual cut outs here so
we've<00:01:02.190> got<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> LED<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> loudspeaker<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
we've got the LED the loudspeaker and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.429 
we've got the LED the loudspeaker and
the<00:01:04.650> flash<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.540> idea<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the flash and the idea is that this

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
the flash and the idea is that this
flips<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> locks<00:01:08.939> onto<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> top<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.689> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
flips up and locks onto the top of the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.630 
flips up and locks onto the top of the
screen<00:01:09.900> giving<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.830> front<00:01:11.070> protection

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
screen giving you some front protection

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.640 
screen giving you some front protection
also<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.510> drop<00:01:12.780> out<00:01:12.960> your<00:01:13.140> pocket<00:01:13.530> or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
also if it does drop out your pocket or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.670 
also if it does drop out your pocket or
your<00:01:14.010> hand<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.630> stay<00:01:15.930> closed<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
your hand that will stay closed as it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.260 
your hand that will stay closed as it
hits<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.920> floor<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.490> hopefully<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.150> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
hits the floor so hopefully going to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.880 
hits the floor so hopefully going to
protect<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> screen<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.650> there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
protect the screen a little bit there

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.880 
protect the screen a little bit there

access to the the headphone jack and
also<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.710> part<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.250> where<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> actual

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
also this part here where the actual

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.899 
also this part here where the actual
case<00:02:03.570> itself<00:02:04.020> locks<00:02:04.439> onto<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> phone<00:02:05.159> again

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
case itself locks onto the phone again

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
case itself locks onto the phone again
follows<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> contour<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> metalwork<00:02:07.829> of

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
follows the contour of the metalwork of

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.820 
follows the contour of the metalwork of
the<00:02:08.099> phone<00:02:08.310> there<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:10.560> want

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the phone there so if you actually want

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
the phone there so if you actually want
to<00:02:10.920> charge<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.459> phone<00:02:11.670> there's<00:02:11.910> no<00:02:12.030> cut<00:02:12.270> out

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
to charge the phone there's no cut out

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.460 
to charge the phone there's no cut out
of<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.569> bottom

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of the bottom

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
of the bottom
so<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.740> charged<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.220> phone<00:02:14.400> adapter<00:02:14.940> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so it's charged the phone adapter have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.650 
so it's charged the phone adapter have
that<00:02:15.600> flipped<00:02:15.930> open<00:02:16.140> as<00:02:16.470> such<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:18.270> inside

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
that flipped open as such and the inside

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.480 
that flipped open as such and the inside
here<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:18.990> quite<00:02:19.320> soft<00:02:19.650> quite<00:02:20.010> feels<00:02:20.250> quite

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
here is quite soft quite feels quite

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.030 
here is quite soft quite feels quite
nice<00:02:20.670> almost<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.330> suede<00:02:21.660> again<00:02:22.350> indicating

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
nice almost like suede again indicating

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.730 
nice almost like suede again indicating
it<00:02:23.310> could<00:02:23.520> be<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.700> genuine<00:02:24.090> leather<00:02:24.300> case<00:02:24.740> as

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
it could be a genuine leather case as

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.370 
it could be a genuine leather case as
you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.250> there<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.670> cutouts<00:02:27.510> line<00:02:28.200> up

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
you can see there the cutouts line up

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.400 
you can see there the cutouts line up
nicely<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> if<00:02:30.240> we<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.540> flip<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.960> forward

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
nicely so if we just flip that forward

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.830 
nicely so if we just flip that forward
that<00:02:32.010> locks<00:02:32.640> onto<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> phone<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.540> such<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.780> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
that locks onto the phone as such so you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
that locks onto the phone as such so you
just<00:02:37.080> leaving<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.560> bit<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:37.890> exposed<00:02:38.580> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
just leaving this bit here exposed and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.760 
just leaving this bit here exposed and
that<00:02:39.390> bit<00:02:39.570> there<00:02:39.720> exposed<00:02:40.080> other<00:02:40.380> than<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
that bit there exposed other than that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.400 
that bit there exposed other than that
you<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.460> actually<00:02:41.910> got<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:42.720> fairly

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you have actually got some fairly

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.190 
you have actually got some fairly
adequate<00:02:43.830> protection<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.720> little

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
adequate protection that's the little

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.020 
adequate protection that's the little
partly<00:02:46.590> open<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.950> from<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.730> if<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:47.940> actually

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
partly open it from so if you actually

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.730 
partly open it from so if you actually
receive<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.510> phone<00:02:48.900> call<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.470> gonna<00:02:49.650> have

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
receive a phone call you are gonna have

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.980 
receive a phone call you are gonna have
to<00:02:49.830> open<00:02:50.160> up<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.880> flip<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.570> you<00:02:51.660> do<00:02:51.810> get

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
to open up the the flip so if you do get

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.510 
to open up the the flip so if you do get
a<00:02:52.050> phone<00:02:52.260> call<00:02:52.290> you're<00:02:52.680> pretty<00:02:53.100> much<00:02:53.160> gonna

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
a phone call you're pretty much gonna

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.400 
a phone call you're pretty much gonna
have<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.820> do<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.150> too<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.990> answer<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.380> phone

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
have to do that too to answer the phone

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.810 
have to do that too to answer the phone
call<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:57.140> split<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.260> background<00:02:58.820> another

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
call I split that background another

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.460 
call I split that background another
thing<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.150> pointed<00:03:00.510> out<00:03:00.600> about<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
thing that's pointed out about the the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.740 
thing that's pointed out about the the
other<00:03:01.560> Samsung<00:03:02.160> genuine<00:03:03.030> case<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.480> one<00:03:03.600> that

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
other Samsung genuine case the one that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290 
other Samsung genuine case the one that
flips<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> left<00:03:04.550> he's<00:03:05.550> using<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> camera

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
flips to the left he's using the camera

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.480 
flips to the left he's using the camera
so<00:03:06.750> with<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.140> one<00:03:07.440> you've<00:03:08.070> got<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> option

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
so with this one you've got the option

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.250 
so with this one you've got the option
if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.820> want<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.060> use<00:03:09.240> it<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.570> way<00:03:09.600> you<00:03:10.110> can

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
if you want to use it that way you can

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.199 
if you want to use it that way you can
just<00:03:10.290> leave<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.650> flap<00:03:11.430> dangling<00:03:11.850> down<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
just leave the flap dangling down the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.060 
just leave the flap dangling down the
bottom<00:03:12.690> or<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.410> want<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> use<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.980> in

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
bottom or if you want to use it in

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.000 
bottom or if you want to use it in
landscape<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.170> then<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.380> are<00:03:16.530> good<00:03:16.680> after

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
landscape and then you are good after

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.830 
landscape and then you are good after
the<00:03:17.190> flap<00:03:17.459> at<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.760> side<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.600> it's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the flap at the side so all in all it's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.100 
the flap at the side so all in all it's
is<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> fairly<00:03:25.860> reasonable<00:03:26.459> case<00:03:27.110> well-made

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
is a fairly reasonable case well-made

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.800 
is a fairly reasonable case well-made
again<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:28.920> from<00:03:29.790> Samsung<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.600> you've<00:03:30.780> got

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
again is for from Samsung so you've got

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.040 
again is for from Samsung so you've got
no<00:03:31.140> word<00:03:31.440> no<00:03:31.470> worries<00:03:31.890> there<00:03:32.480> it's<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.510> bit<00:03:33.720> bit

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
no word no worries there it's a bit bit

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.080 
no word no worries there it's a bit bit
of<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.200> different<00:03:34.620> bizarre<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.910> one

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
of a different bizarre to the to the one

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.610 
of a different bizarre to the to the one
that<00:03:36.239> flips<00:03:36.450> over<00:03:36.630> into<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.989> left<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.440> what

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
that flips over into the left in what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.430 
that flips over into the left in what
way<00:03:37.769> does<00:03:38.010> offer<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.370> bit<00:03:38.519> more<00:03:38.670> protection<00:03:39.440> but

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
way does offer a bit more protection but

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.190 
way does offer a bit more protection but
it<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.800> apply<00:03:41.130> black<00:03:41.430> case<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.200> it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it is just apply black case so it

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.199 
it is just apply black case so it
doesn't<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:44.130> doesn't<00:03:44.160> look<00:03:44.459> quite<00:03:44.670> as<00:03:44.760> good<00:03:45.030> as

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
doesn't it doesn't look quite as good as

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.870 
doesn't it doesn't look quite as good as
the<00:03:45.420> metallic<00:03:46.350> blue<00:03:46.530> one<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.830> reviewed<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.640> week

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
the metallic blue one we reviewed a week

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.080 
the metallic blue one we reviewed a week
ago<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:49.230> that's<00:03:50.130> that's<00:03:50.670> pretty<00:03:50.940> much<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
ago so that's that's pretty much the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.729 
ago so that's that's pretty much the
reserve<00:03:51.480> thing<00:03:51.690> to<00:03:51.780> say<00:03:51.930> about<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:52.230> case<00:03:52.470> so

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
reserve thing to say about this case so
