00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
delay effect on something or it could

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.740 
delay effect on something or it could
just<00:02:55.700> be<00:02:55.909> that<00:02:55.939> you<00:02:56.120> didn't<00:02:56.329> like<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.510> feel<00:02:56.719> of

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
the parts just let me know so the closer

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.349 
the parts just let me know so the closer
the<00:02:59.840> feedback<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.739> pinpointed<00:03:01.359> the

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
the feedback can be pinpointed the

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:03.879 
the feedback can be pinpointed the
better<00:03:02.540> chance<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.260> next<00:03:03.530> tape<00:03:03.680> will

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
better chance is that the next tape will

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.530 
better chance is that the next tape will
have<00:03:04.040> exactly<00:03:04.400> what<00:03:04.489> you're<00:03:04.579> looking<00:03:04.609> for

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.390 

so<00:03:08.810> once<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.319> recordings<00:03:09.709> been<00:03:09.860> completed<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
so once the recordings been completed I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.789 
so once the recordings been completed I
would<00:03:10.519> send<00:03:10.670> over<00:03:10.879> an<00:03:10.970> mp3<00:03:11.209> file<00:03:11.780> which<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.349> a

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
would send over an mp3 file which is a

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.199 
would send over an mp3 file which is a
mix<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.459> all<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.730> parts<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.030> have<00:03:14.150> been

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
mix of all the parts that have been

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.569 
mix of all the parts that have been
recorded<00:03:14.659> and<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:15.769> there's<00:03:15.980> an<00:03:16.129> existing

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
recorded and if there's an existing

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.550 
recorded and if there's an existing
track<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.060> I'm<00:03:17.150> recording<00:03:17.540> on<00:03:17.629> top<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.049> that

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
track that I'm recording on top of that

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.009 
track that I'm recording on top of that
would<00:03:18.709> be<00:03:18.829> included<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.489> mix<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:20.810> wouldn't

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
would be included in the mix it wouldn't

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.690 
would be included in the mix it wouldn't
be<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.110> final<00:03:21.470> mix<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:21.980> would<00:03:22.099> be<00:03:22.250> good

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
be a final mix but it would be good

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.830 
be a final mix but it would be good
enough<00:03:22.849> for<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.180> hear<00:03:23.360> everything's<00:03:23.689> been

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
recorded I would normally bump the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.619 
recorded I would normally bump the
guitars<00:03:25.340> up<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.610> little<00:03:25.760> bit<00:03:25.940> in<00:03:26.030> volume<00:03:26.360> from

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
where I would traditionally mix them so

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.600 
where I would traditionally mix them so
that<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.030> can<00:03:29.180> hear<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.450> new<00:03:29.569> parts

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
and into an Apogee preamp I always used

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.070 
and into an Apogee preamp I always used
two<00:05:01.640> microphones<00:05:02.030> with<00:05:02.180> acoustic<00:05:02.570> guitars<00:05:02.870> I

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
two microphones with acoustic guitars I

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.630 
two microphones with acoustic guitars I
find<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.410> picks<00:05:03.620> up<00:05:03.770> more<00:05:03.890> of<00:05:04.010> a<00:05:04.070> guitar<00:05:04.220> gives

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
find it picks up more of a guitar gives

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.970 
find it picks up more of a guitar gives
a<00:05:04.730> better<00:05:04.910> overall<00:05:05.210> sound<00:05:05.540> if<00:05:05.900> it's<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.530> Spartan

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
a better overall sound if it's a Spartan

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.560 
a better overall sound if it's a Spartan
X<00:05:07.130> where<00:05:07.400> maybe<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.730> just<00:05:07.850> acoustic<00:05:08.300> guitar

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
X where maybe it's just acoustic guitar

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.570 
X where maybe it's just acoustic guitar
vocals<00:05:09.050> and<00:05:09.230> recording<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.340> gives<00:05:10.520> you

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
vocals and recording and it gives you

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.980 
vocals and recording and it gives you
the<00:05:10.670> option<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:10.940> prepare<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.420> heart<00:05:11.600> left<00:05:11.810> and

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
the option to prepare the heart left and

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.300 
the option to prepare the heart left and
right<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.260> create<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.500> nice<00:05:12.620> stereo<00:05:13.010> image

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
right and create a nice stereo image

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.250 
right and create a nice stereo image
obviously<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.450> busier<00:05:14.750> mix<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.140> can

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
obviously it's a busier mix you can

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260 
obviously it's a busier mix you can
collapse<00:05:15.470> things<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.860> little<00:05:15.950> bit<00:05:16.130> more<00:05:16.270> just

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
collapse things a little bit more just

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.110 
collapse things a little bit more just
to<00:05:17.390> take<00:05:17.570> up<00:05:17.720> less<00:05:17.900> space<00:05:18.340> within<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.520> DW<00:05:20.090> I

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
to take up less space within the DW I

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.610 
to take up less space within the DW I
would<00:05:20.480> always<00:05:20.570> add<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:20.960> little<00:05:21.110> bit<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.470> reverb

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
would always add a little bit of reverb

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.560 
would always add a little bit of reverb
as<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.130> plug-in<00:05:22.430> which<00:05:22.670> can<00:05:22.820> be<00:05:22.910> turned<00:05:23.150> off<00:05:23.270> and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
as a plug-in which can be turned off and

likewise a high-pass filter and about
120<00:05:26.270> Hertz<00:05:26.690> which<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.110> cleans<00:05:27.380> up<00:05:27.530> some<00:05:27.770> of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
120 Hertz which just cleans up some of

120 Hertz which just cleans up some of
the<00:05:27.920> low<00:05:28.070> end

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
then I will print the delay on to that

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.909 
then I will print the delay on to that
part

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
part

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.070

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 
or if you say that you've got a delay

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.779

that you want to use I'll leave it dry

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.100 
that you want to use I'll leave it dry
and<00:06:19.849> you<00:06:20.210> can<00:06:20.240> put<00:06:20.509> the<00:06:20.599> delay<00:06:20.779> on<00:06:20.990> there

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
and you can put the delay on there

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.090 
and you can put the delay on there
afterwards

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100
