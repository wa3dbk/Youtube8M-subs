00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
little slot and kind of feeling it out

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.990 
little slot and kind of feeling it out
and<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.369> what<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> go<00:00:32.969> through

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and this is this is what you go through

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.110 
and this is this is what you go through
each<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> every<00:00:34.170> time<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> put<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.120> so

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
each and every time you put these on so

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.819 
each and every time you put these on so
it<00:00:36.239> does<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.020> maybe<00:00:37.230> double<00:00:37.620> or<00:00:37.770> even

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it does you know maybe double or even

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.160 
it does you know maybe double or even
triple<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.399> time<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.910> takes<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.450> put<00:00:39.690> socks<00:00:39.960> on

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
triple the time it takes to put socks on

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.150 
triple the time it takes to put socks on
but<00:00:41.629> definitely<00:00:42.629> worth<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.170> I'll<00:00:43.739> get<00:00:43.980> into

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
but definitely worth it as I'll get into

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.389 
but definitely worth it as I'll get into
a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.610> later<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.469> there<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.649> sock

floor there are a lot of stairs where I
work<00:01:41.380> it's<00:01:42.009> sort<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.340> corporate

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
work it's sort of a corporate

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.070 
work it's sort of a corporate
environment<00:01:42.819> you<00:01:43.360> know<00:01:43.390> you<00:01:43.539> dress<00:01:43.810> up<00:01:43.960> like

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
environment you know you dress up like

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.859 
environment you know you dress up like
this<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.679> if<00:01:45.280> I'm<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.970> I'm<00:01:46.119> standing<00:01:46.390> at<00:01:46.840> a

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
this and if I'm if I'm standing at a

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.309 
this and if I'm if I'm standing at a
counter<00:01:47.319> I<00:01:48.220> notice<00:01:48.970> that<00:01:49.149> these<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:50.200> know

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
counter I notice that these you know

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.200 
counter I notice that these you know
they<00:01:50.500> separate<00:01:51.190> my<00:01:51.340> feet<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> little<00:01:51.789> bit<00:01:51.940> more

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
they separate my feet a little bit more

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.990 
they separate my feet a little bit more
and<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.710> seems<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.039> give<00:01:54.220> better<00:01:54.460> support

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
and that seems to give better support

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.210 
and that seems to give better support
which<00:01:55.659> which<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.259> course<00:01:56.289> is<00:01:56.590> great<00:01:56.920> if<00:01:57.130> you're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
which which of course is great if you're

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.219 
which which of course is great if you're
walking<00:01:57.429> around<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:58.060> these<00:01:58.539> shoes<00:01:58.780> don't<00:01:59.050> is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
walking around and these shoes don't is

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.100 
walking around and these shoes don't is
have<00:01:59.470> an<00:01:59.590> especially<00:02:00.039> thick<00:02:00.280> midsole<00:02:00.819> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
have an especially thick midsole and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.719 
have an especially thick midsole and
there's<00:02:02.110> really<00:02:02.259> not<00:02:02.440> a<00:02:02.500> lot<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.729> cushioning

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
there's really not a lot of cushioning

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.730 
there's really not a lot of cushioning
there<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.240> that's<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.780> great<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.170> also<00:02:05.440> of

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
there so that's a great thing also of

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.160 
there so that's a great thing also of
course<00:02:05.920> they<00:02:06.159> spread<00:02:06.549> out<00:02:06.610> your<00:02:06.880> toes<00:02:07.179> and<00:02:07.479> and

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
course they spread out your toes and and

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.719 
course they spread out your toes and and
I<00:02:08.319> find<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.679> that's<00:02:08.799> that's<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.280> good<00:02:09.459> feeling

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
I find that that's that's a good feeling

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.340 
I find that that's that's a good feeling
you<00:02:10.090> know<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.360> sort<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.720> natural<00:02:10.899> feeling

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
you know it's sort of a natural feeling

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.440 
you know it's sort of a natural feeling
these<00:02:11.680> shoes<00:02:12.010> have<00:02:12.610> enough<00:02:12.880> width<00:02:13.090> in<00:02:13.299> them

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
these shoes have enough width in them

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
these shoes have enough width in them
that<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:14.049> not<00:02:14.200> pushing<00:02:14.500> my<00:02:14.799> smaller<00:02:15.430> toe

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that it's not pushing my smaller toe

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
that it's not pushing my smaller toe
into<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.090> edge<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.690> pads<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.560> cushions

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
into the edge and it pads and cushions

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.289 
into the edge and it pads and cushions
around<00:02:18.310> those<00:02:18.489> toes<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.030> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.180> go

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
around those toes so I'm going to go

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.130 
around those toes so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:19.329> and<00:02:19.570> take<00:02:20.410> these<00:02:21.220> off<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.239> lets<00:02:22.959> you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
ahead and take these off and lets you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.460 
ahead and take these off and lets you
see<00:02:23.350> there's<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:25.060> they<00:02:25.269> are<00:02:25.299> one<00:02:26.260> thing

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
see there's the there they are one thing

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.190 
see there's the there they are one thing
that<00:02:26.500> you'll<00:02:26.769> notice<00:02:27.540> pretty<00:02:28.540> quickly<00:02:28.840> after

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
that you'll notice pretty quickly after

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.199 
that you'll notice pretty quickly after
getting<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.010> pair<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.310> these<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.640> gingi<00:02:30.940> socks

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
getting a pair of these and gingi socks

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.319 
getting a pair of these and gingi socks
is<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:32.290> as<00:02:32.980> soon<00:02:33.250> as<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.489> take<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.760> your

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
is that as soon as you take your your

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.330 
is that as soon as you take your your
shoe<00:02:34.630> off<00:02:34.709> after<00:02:35.709> wearing<00:02:35.920> them<00:02:36.040> all<00:02:36.280> day

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
shoe off after wearing them all day

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940 
shoe off after wearing them all day
there's<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.760> solution<00:02:36.910> cold<00:02:37.600> air<00:02:37.900> between<00:02:38.650> your

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
there's a solution cold air between your

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.819 
there's a solution cold air between your
toes<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:40.390> course<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:40.750> because<00:02:41.170> they

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
toes and of course that's because they

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.729 
toes and of course that's because they
they<00:02:42.790> have<00:02:43.090> moisture<00:02:43.720> wicking<00:02:43.930> properties

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
they have moisture wicking properties

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.069 
they have moisture wicking properties
these<00:02:45.700> ones<00:02:45.880> being<00:02:46.150> synthetic<00:02:46.690> these<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:46.989> the

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
these ones being synthetic these are the

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.650 
these ones being synthetic these are the
performance<00:02:47.650> versions<00:02:48.070> or<00:02:48.549> three<00:02:48.910> ply<00:02:49.150> fabric

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
performance versions or three ply fabric

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.580 
performance versions or three ply fabric
and<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:51.940> between<00:02:52.060> each<00:02:52.450> toe<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.320> know<00:02:53.410> it's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
and so in between each toe you know it's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.710 
and so in between each toe you know it's
immediately<00:02:54.459> wicking<00:02:54.910> moisture<00:02:55.030> way<00:02:55.390> instead

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
immediately wicking moisture way instead

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.449 
immediately wicking moisture way instead
of<00:02:55.780> keeping<00:02:55.989> them<00:02:56.290> together<00:02:56.500> where<00:02:57.310> they're

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
of keeping them together where they're

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.430 
of keeping them together where they're
going<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.730> radiate<00:02:58.090> heat<00:02:58.359> from<00:02:58.660> from<00:02:59.079> one<00:02:59.230> toe

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
going to radiate heat from from one toe

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.110 
going to radiate heat from from one toe
to<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> other<00:02:59.769> so<00:03:00.310> these<00:03:00.430> are<00:03:00.489> these<00:03:00.880> are<00:03:00.940> an

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
to the other so these are these are an

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.569 
to the other so these are these are an
interesting<00:03:01.570> choice<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:02.019> socks<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.590> one<00:03:03.400> that

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
interesting choice in socks and one that

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.880 
interesting choice in socks and one that
I<00:03:03.609> I'm<00:03:03.970> quite<00:03:04.480> fond<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.200> fun<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.709> where

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519

made their back feel better
then<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.750> normal<00:03:17.140> sock<00:03:17.410> which<00:03:17.680> which<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:18.190> an

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
then a normal sock which which is an

to<00:03:19.930> tip<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.800> back<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> little<00:03:21.190> bit<00:03:21.400> because

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
to tip you back a little bit because

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.250 
to tip you back a little bit because
you've<00:03:21.670> got<00:03:21.820> more<00:03:22.000> cushioning<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.840> guess

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
you've got more cushioning and I guess

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.830 
you've got more cushioning and I guess
that<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.770> good<00:03:23.830> thing<00:03:24.010> for<00:03:24.540> some<00:03:25.540> people
