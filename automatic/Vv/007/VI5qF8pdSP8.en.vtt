like<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.880> ok<00:00:41.880> I<00:00:42.150> got<00:00:42.630> a<00:00:42.870> question<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
like that ok I got a question about that

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.130 
like that ok I got a question about that
I'm<00:00:44.370> someone<00:00:44.850> put<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.120> truck<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.630> said<00:00:45.810> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I'm someone put in truck and said you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.650 
I'm someone put in truck and said you
always<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.740> strike<00:00:47.010> with<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.310> toast<00:00:47.670> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
always have to strike with a toast so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.030 
always have to strike with a toast so
the<00:00:48.780> question<00:00:48.900> was<00:00:49.170> striking<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> toes

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
the question was striking on the toes

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.130 
the question was striking on the toes
however<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.700> constantly<00:00:51.360> getting<00:00:51.660> clamped

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
however they constantly getting clamped

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.960 
however they constantly getting clamped
over<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.740> the<00:00:53.190> reason<00:00:53.490> for<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.700> is

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
over here and the reason for that is

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.450 
over here and the reason for that is
because<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.330> were<00:00:54.450> doing<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.810> torn<00:00:55.250> how<00:00:56.250> can

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
because they were doing it torn how can

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.670 
because they were doing it torn how can
you<00:00:56.490> do<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.790> for<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.720> either<00:00:57.960> step<00:00:58.380> with<00:00:58.650> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you do it for you either step with the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.850 
you do it for you either step with the
heel<00:00:59.120> or<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.360> step<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:00.990> the<00:01:01.110> toes<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.800> up

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
heel or you step with the toes right up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.759 
heel or you step with the toes right up
into<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:03.450> let's<00:01:04.170> think<00:01:04.320> about<00:01:04.589> what

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
into one well let's think about what

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710 
into one well let's think about what
you've<00:01:05.100> been<00:01:05.129> trained<00:01:05.579> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.150> years<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you've been trained to do for years and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.109 
you've been trained to do for years and
years<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.170> years<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.829> see<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> try

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
years and years and see that if you try

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.030 
years and years and see that if you try
to<00:01:09.150> get<00:01:09.810> away<00:01:09.930> from<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.860> actually

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
to get away from that you're actually

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.710 
to get away from that you're actually
doing<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.700> wrong<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.329> on<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.600> get

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
doing it wrong if you go on and get

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.120 
doing it wrong if you go on and get
something<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> might<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.649> been<00:01:13.920> doing

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
something that you might have been doing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
moves this way it's used to strike with

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.849 
moves this way it's used to strike with
a<00:02:01.439> heel<00:02:01.799> you've<00:02:02.579> been<00:02:02.729> doing<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.450> time

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
a heel you've been doing it for one time

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.099 
a heel you've been doing it for one time
okay<00:02:04.859> the<00:02:05.310> muscles<00:02:05.729> here<00:02:05.969> contract<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
okay the muscles here contract the

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.230 
okay the muscles here contract the
muscles<00:02:07.469> give<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> left<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.490> that

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
muscles give the left it's all that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.559 
muscles give the left it's all that
means<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.200> he's<00:02:10.530> step<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.700> way<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
means that if he's step and this way the

kneecap the toes up Owen is trying for
the<00:02:15.390> heels<00:02:15.709> okay<00:02:16.709> straight<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.820> key

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
the heels okay straight for the key

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.530 
the heels okay straight for the key
ok<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.920> talked<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.310> walking<00:02:22.670> pole<00:02:23.030> now
