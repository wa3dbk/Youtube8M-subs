00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
senses HDMI splitter doesn't have like a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.649 
senses HDMI splitter doesn't have like a
specific<00:01:12.540> brand<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.799> say<00:01:13.890> 1<00:01:14.250> X<00:01:14.490> 2<00:01:14.729> which

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

means one of two HDMI whatever so uh
yeah<00:01:20.130> here's<00:01:20.310> my<00:01:20.369> HD<00:01:20.759> PVR<00:01:20.970> 2<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> what

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
yeah here's my HD PVR 2 which is what

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.990 
yeah here's my HD PVR 2 which is what
I'm<00:01:21.960> using<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> record<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.830> ps4<00:01:23.159> gameplay<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
I'm using to record my ps4 gameplay and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.340 
I'm using to record my ps4 gameplay and
basically<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:28.909> you're<00:01:29.909> splitting

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
basically what it is is you're splitting

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.030 
basically what it is is you're splitting
the<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.250> ps4<00:01:32.840> which<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> you're

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the out of the ps4 which is you're

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.660 
the out of the ps4 which is you're
splitting<00:01:35.340> its<00:01:35.759> HDMI<00:01:36.799> picture<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.490> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
splitting its HDMI picture because it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.390 
splitting its HDMI picture because it
goes<00:01:38.909> into<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.299> TV<00:01:39.479> normally<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:41.220> you're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
goes into the TV normally but you're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.149 
goes into the TV normally but you're
splitting<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.140> well<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.470> goes<00:01:43.680> into<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
splitting that well it goes into the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.649 
splitting that well it goes into the
splitter<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.350> HD<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.490> HD<00:01:47.970> CP

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
splitter and then the HD see the HD CP

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.590 
splitter and then the HD see the HD CP
protection<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.680> bypassed<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.970> inside<00:01:51.390> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
protection is bypassed so inside this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
protection is bypassed so inside this
box<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> HD<00:01:53.579> CP<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.509> being<00:01:55.229> jumped<00:01:55.770> by<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.009> whole

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
box the HD CP is being jumped by a whole

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
box the HD CP is being jumped by a whole
lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:57.049> HDMI<00:01:58.049> gods<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.460> on<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.960> output<00:02:01.170> side

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
lot of HDMI gods and on the output side

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.270 
lot of HDMI gods and on the output side
it<00:02:02.369> gives<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.659> HDCP<00:02:05.600> bypass<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.409> now<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it gives you the HDCP bypass so now I

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.059 
it gives you the HDCP bypass so now I
can<00:02:08.759> get<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.000> picture<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.500> capture

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
can get the picture and get the capture

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
can get the picture and get the capture
from<00:02:11.910> my<00:02:12.060> HDPE

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
from my HDPE

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.420 
from my HDPE
so<00:02:13.140> this<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:15.060> very<00:02:15.390> court<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.080> is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so this this very court right here is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.110 
so this this very court right here is
going<00:02:17.430> into<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:19.230> PVR<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.030> can

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
going into the PVR right here so you can

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.990 
going into the PVR right here so you can
see<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.750> hand<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.200> from<00:02:22.980> here<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.640> pull<00:02:23.879> it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

that's using the HD PVR 2 yeah it
actually<00:05:01.210> does<00:05:01.750> work<00:05:03.360> um<00:05:04.360> there<00:05:05.050> is<00:05:05.199> an

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
actually does work um there is an

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.379 
actually does work um there is an
alternative<00:05:06.099> way<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.340> do<00:05:06.639> this<00:05:06.849> if<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.210> don't

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
alternative way to do this if you don't

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.070 
alternative way to do this if you don't
have<00:05:07.599> the<00:05:07.840> HDMI<00:05:08.259> splitter<00:05:08.590> if<00:05:09.039> you<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:10.870> you

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
have the HDMI splitter if you if you

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.779 
have the HDMI splitter if you if you
just<00:05:11.110> don't<00:05:11.410> want<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> use<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.009> I'm<00:05:12.280> out<00:05:12.490> see

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
just don't want to use it I'm out see

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.409 
just don't want to use it I'm out see
why<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.449> wouldn't<00:05:13.690> but<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.500> had<00:05:15.180> another<00:05:16.180> thing

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
why you wouldn't but I had another thing

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.779 
why you wouldn't but I had another thing
I<00:05:16.479> purchased<00:05:17.080> purchase<00:05:17.830> from<00:05:17.979> Amazon<00:05:18.550> was

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
I purchased purchase from Amazon was

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.350 
I purchased purchase from Amazon was
this<00:05:19.090> which<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:20.069> HDMI<00:05:21.069> to<00:05:21.130> component<00:05:21.789> and

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
this which is the HDMI to component and

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.240 
this which is the HDMI to component and
basically<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.199> does<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.500> same<00:05:23.680> thing<00:05:23.740> only

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
basically it does the same thing only

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.149 
basically it does the same thing only
it's<00:05:25.110> when<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.229> go<00:05:26.409> to<00:05:26.470> our<00:05:26.830> software

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
it's when you go to our software

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.050 
it's when you go to our software
whatever<00:05:27.720> software<00:05:28.720> used<00:05:29.139> to<00:05:29.380> record<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:30.130> you

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
whatever software used to record it you

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.330 
whatever software used to record it you
have<00:05:31.210> to<00:05:31.300> use<00:05:31.449> components<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.860> component

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
have to use components so the component

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.480 
have to use components so the component
is<00:05:33.400> just<00:05:33.580> like<00:05:33.729> a<00:05:34.229> bootleg<00:05:35.229> version<00:05:35.650> of<00:05:35.949> HDMI

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
is just like a bootleg version of HDMI

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.290 
is just like a bootleg version of HDMI
so<00:05:36.969> uh<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.509> have<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.349> cord<00:05:38.620> right<00:05:38.770> here<00:05:38.830> the

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
so uh I have the cord right here the

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.850 
so uh I have the cord right here the
HDMI<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.360> component<00:05:40.960> cord<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:41.349> it<00:05:41.530> is

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
HDMI to component cord so it is

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.930 
HDMI to component cord so it is
basically<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:43.300> HDMI<00:05:44.020> cord<00:05:44.320> is<00:05:44.620> being<00:05:45.190> used

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
basically this HDMI cord is being used

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.230 
basically this HDMI cord is being used
with<00:05:46.539> components<00:05:47.229> so<00:05:47.680> it's<00:05:47.860> it's<00:05:48.729> converting

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
with components so it's it's converting

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.659 
with components so it's it's converting
it<00:05:49.360> from<00:05:49.389> HDMI<00:05:49.870> to<00:05:50.110> components<00:05:50.740> with<00:05:51.370> hints

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
it from HDMI to components with hints

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.240 
it from HDMI to components with hints
HDMI<00:05:52.509> converter<00:05:52.719> or<00:05:53.560> HDMI<00:05:54.039> component

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
HDMI converter or HDMI component

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.029 
HDMI converter or HDMI component
converter<00:05:54.789> so<00:05:55.389> uh<00:05:55.469> that's<00:05:56.469> basically<00:05:56.590> what<00:05:56.919> it

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 
converter so uh that's basically what it

00:05:57.039 --> 00:05:59.610 
converter so uh that's basically what it
does<00:05:57.190> but<00:05:57.460> I<00:05:57.520> don't<00:05:57.729> use<00:05:57.940> it<00:05:57.969> so<00:05:58.330> because<00:05:59.229> if

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
does but I don't use it so because if

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.570 
does but I don't use it so because if
it's<00:06:00.130> not<00:06:00.340> true<00:06:00.610> HD<00:06:00.789> so<00:06:01.630> uh<00:06:01.889> I'm<00:06:02.889> using<00:06:03.159> this<00:06:03.400> I

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
it's not true HD so uh I'm using this I

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.550 
it's not true HD so uh I'm using this I
