00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780 

okay<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.020> first<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.949> all<00:00:02.070> I<00:00:02.129> did<00:00:02.429> have<00:00:02.610> another

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay so first of all I did have another

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.880 
okay so first of all I did have another
video<00:00:03.090> lined<00:00:03.480> up<00:00:03.689> but<00:00:04.080> I'm<00:00:04.410> going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> wait

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
video lined up but I'm going to wait

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.860 
video lined up but I'm going to wait
until<00:00:05.009> 1.7<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.240> if<00:00:06.330> it's<00:00:06.450> still<00:00:06.509> plausible

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
until 1.7 to see if it's still plausible

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.650 
until 1.7 to see if it's still plausible
after<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.589> update<00:00:07.940> because<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.240> does<00:00:09.360> involve

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
after the update because it does involve

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.919 
after the update because it does involve
some<00:00:10.080> stuff<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.800> nerfed<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> I'm

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
some stuff that was nerfed and so I'm

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.660 
some stuff that was nerfed and so I'm
kind<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.349> hoping<00:00:13.590> it'll<00:00:13.799> still<00:00:14.070> be<00:00:14.190> possible

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
kind of hoping it'll still be possible

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.090 
kind of hoping it'll still be possible
even<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.660> less<00:00:15.960> useful<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.070> it

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
even if it's a bit less useful as it

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.120 
even if it's a bit less useful as it
would<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.550> been<00:00:18.350> so<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> figured<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:19.980> would

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
would have been so I figured this would

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.400 
would have been so I figured this would
be<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.340> good<00:00:20.850> video<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.900> sort<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.170> throw

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
be a good video to just sort of throw

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.220 
be a good video to just sort of throw
out<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.189> along<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> sort<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> PSA

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
out there and along with a sort of PSA

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
out there and along with a sort of PSA
while<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.830> wait<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:26.970> one<00:00:27.000> point<00:00:27.390> 7

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
while we wait for that one point 7

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.939 
while we wait for that one point 7
update<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.170> arrive<00:00:28.410> with<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> vanilla

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
update to arrive with the vanilla

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.089 
update to arrive with the vanilla
Pistons<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> basically<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> idea<00:00:31.679> behind

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
Pistons so basically the idea behind

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.100 
Pistons so basically the idea behind
this<00:00:32.430> version<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> archer<00:00:33.390> pillbox<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
this version of the archer pillbox that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.470 
this version of the archer pillbox that
I've<00:00:34.260> been<00:00:34.500> constantly<00:00:35.280> making<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.730> various

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
I've been constantly making a various

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.930 
I've been constantly making a various
videos<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> one<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
videos of is that this one is going to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.569 
videos of is that this one is going to
be<00:00:39.090> more<00:00:39.360> permanent<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:39.899> others<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.579> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
be more permanent than others and the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.900 
be more permanent than others and the
first<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> did<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.660> wanted<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.370> disabled

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
first one I did I wanted to be disabled

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.540 
first one I did I wanted to be disabled
I<00:00:44.969> had<00:00:45.180> some<00:00:45.390> redstone<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.340> here

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
I had some redstone on here here here

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
I had some redstone on here here here
here<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> had<00:00:48.090> four<00:00:48.300> bits<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> redstone<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
here so I had four bits of redstone and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
here so I had four bits of redstone and
the<00:00:50.129> idea<00:00:50.370> was<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:51.090> would<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.329> able<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> be

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the idea was that it would be able to be

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
the idea was that it would be able to be
disabled<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.949> varying<00:00:53.430> degree<00:00:53.760> maybe<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
disabled to varying degree maybe you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.880 
disabled to varying degree maybe you
would<00:00:54.300> disable<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.170> taking<00:00:55.440> off<00:00:55.649> one

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
would disable it by taking off one

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
would disable it by taking off one
redstone<00:00:56.160> ore<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.539> four<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.129> might

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
redstone ore up to all four so it might

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
redstone ore up to all four so it might
be<00:00:59.340> fully<00:00:59.699> disabled<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.539> need<00:01:01.079> all<00:01:01.109> kinds<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
be fully disabled and need all kinds of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.549 
be fully disabled and need all kinds of
redstone<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.520> fix<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> again<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
redstone to fix it again or just a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
redstone to fix it again or just a
little<00:01:04.799> bit<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.880> didn't<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
little bit but I didn't want to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
little bit but I didn't want to
completely<00:01:06.900> remove<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> redstone<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
completely remove all the redstone the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
completely remove all the redstone the
second<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> decided<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.409> use<00:01:11.010> only

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
second one I decided to just use only

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
second one I decided to just use only
the<00:01:11.580> redstone<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.810> nothing<00:01:13.170> under

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the redstone and have nothing under

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.179 
the redstone and have nothing under
ground<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.610> simplify<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.200> PvE

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
ground just to simplify it for PvE

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.609 
ground just to simplify it for PvE
purposes<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> time<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.840> have<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.409> more

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
purposes but this time we have a more

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.130 
purposes but this time we have a more
permanent<00:01:19.920> one<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.640> doesn't<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.450> disabled

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
permanent one that doesn't get disabled

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
permanent one that doesn't get disabled
really<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.729> would<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> things

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
really and so this would be the things

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.630 
really and so this would be the things
where<00:01:24.720> no<00:01:25.320> one's<00:01:25.500> carrying<00:01:25.740> around<00:01:25.920> carrying

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
where no one's carrying around carrying

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
where no one's carrying around carrying
around<00:01:26.790> red<00:01:27.150> stone<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.689> arena<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.619> this

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
around red stone in your arena and this

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
around red stone in your arena and this
is<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> permanent<00:01:29.759> arena<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
is a permanent arena and you want all of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.289 
is a permanent arena and you want all of
the<00:01:31.350> wiring<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.159> hidden<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.880> maybe<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
the wiring to be hidden and maybe you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.890 
the wiring to be hidden and maybe you
have<00:01:33.450> some<00:01:33.659> block<00:01:33.900> protection<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.680> etc<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have some block protection and etc so in

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
have some block protection and etc so in
that<00:01:37.020> sort<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.350> place<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.280> two<00:01:38.670> goals

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that sort of place there are two goals

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.719 
that sort of place there are two goals
that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> mainly<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> focus<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that you mainly want to focus on and I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
that you mainly want to focus on and I
tried<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> cover<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.500> video

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
tried to cover those in this video

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.389 
tried to cover those in this video
fairly<00:01:44.369> well<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.119> first<00:01:45.479> we<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.799> hidden

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
fairly well so first we have the hidden

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.969 
fairly well so first we have the hidden
redstone<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.380> made<00:01:49.710> sure<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
redstone and so I've made sure that

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
redstone and so I've made sure that
everything<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.640> hidden<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.500> although<00:01:52.500> we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
everything is hidden and although we

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.940 
everything is hidden and although we
have<00:01:52.680> glass<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.740> things

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
have glass here for just to see things

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.639 
have glass here for just to see things
easier<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.570> replaced<00:01:57.960> by<00:01:58.170> any<00:01:58.320> blocks

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
easier it can be replaced by any blocks

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.969 
easier it can be replaced by any blocks
you<00:01:58.829> want<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.909> entirety<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> this

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
you want so that the entirety of this

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
you want so that the entirety of this
setup<00:02:01.979> can<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.670> hidden<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.149> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.840> remove

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
setup can be hidden and if you remove

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.050 
setup can be hidden and if you remove
the<00:02:04.500> pressure<00:02:04.829> pad<00:02:05.189> temporarily<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the pressure pad temporarily you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.490 
the pressure pad temporarily you
wouldn't<00:02:06.299> even<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.899> entire<00:02:07.229> thing<00:02:07.439> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
wouldn't even know this entire thing is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109 
wouldn't even know this entire thing is
underground<00:02:07.920> unless<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.580> either<00:02:08.700> broke

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
underground unless you either broke

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.720 
underground unless you either broke
through<00:02:09.420> or<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.679> put<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> pressure<00:02:11.129> pad<00:02:11.430> down

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
through or you put a pressure pad down

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.330 
through or you put a pressure pad down
and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.229 
and
stepped<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:14.760> everything<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.879> just

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
stepped on it so everything is just

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.900 
stepped on it so everything is just
under<00:02:17.170> ground<00:02:17.319> and<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.220> second<00:02:18.610> thing<00:02:18.879> that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
under ground and the second thing that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.800 
under ground and the second thing that
you<00:02:19.420> would<00:02:19.510> want<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.920> have<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:21.099> quick<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.940> I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you would want is to have it quick and I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.809 
you would want is to have it quick and I
did<00:02:23.379> have<00:02:23.590> some<00:02:23.830> delays<00:02:24.129> in<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.489> previous

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
did have some delays in the previous

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.509 
did have some delays in the previous
ones<00:02:25.150> because<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.620> only<00:02:26.950> had<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> bit

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
ones because I you only had a bit

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.330 
ones because I you only had a bit
underground<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.599> I<00:02:28.980> wanted<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> make<00:02:30.129> it

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
underground and I wanted to make it

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.520 
underground and I wanted to make it
cheaper<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.760> build<00:02:30.879> and<00:02:31.209> such<00:02:31.420> but<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.290> one

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
cheaper to build and such but this one

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.729 
cheaper to build and such but this one
doesn't<00:02:32.799> have<00:02:32.980> any<00:02:33.250> delays<00:02:33.610> no<00:02:34.030> inverts<00:02:35.019> no

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
doesn't have any delays no inverts no

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.940 
doesn't have any delays no inverts no
repeaters<00:02:36.519> etc<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.049> just<00:02:38.319> pure<00:02:38.709> red

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
repeaters etc so it's just pure red

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.280 
repeaters etc so it's just pure red
stone<00:02:39.310> that's<00:02:39.730> close<00:02:40.569> enough<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:41.140> its

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
stone that's close enough to its

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.960 
stone that's close enough to its
destination<00:02:42.060> from<00:02:43.060> its<00:02:43.209> source<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:45.549> send

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
destination from its source to just send

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.110 
destination from its source to just send
the<00:02:46.030> power<00:02:46.239> down<00:02:46.390> without<00:02:46.599> any<00:02:46.930> sort<00:02:47.200> of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the power down without any sort of

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.120 
the power down without any sort of
extensions<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.890> actually

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
extensions to that and it's actually

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.539 
extensions to that and it's actually
fairly<00:02:51.549> simple<00:02:52.060> even<00:02:52.269> though<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.720> looks<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.549> bit

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
fairly simple even though it looks a bit

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.940 
fairly simple even though it looks a bit
sprawled<00:02:54.880> out<00:02:55.060> but<00:02:55.390> that's<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.810> because<00:02:56.019> you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
sprawled out but that's just because you

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
sprawled out but that's just because you
know<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.430> had<00:02:57.579> to<00:02:57.610> be<00:02:57.730> done<00:02:57.940> four<00:02:58.239> times<00:02:58.269> one

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
know it had to be done four times one

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.630 
know it had to be done four times one
for<00:02:59.170> each<00:02:59.290> side<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.650> basically<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> same

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
for each side is basically the same

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.900 
for each side is basically the same
setup<00:03:01.349> exactly<00:03:02.349> for<00:03:02.650> every<00:03:02.980> set<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> three

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
setup exactly for every set of three

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.979 
setup exactly for every set of three
Pistons<00:03:04.360> we<00:03:04.510> have<00:03:04.690> here<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:06.090> pretty<00:03:07.090> much<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
Pistons we have here and pretty much the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.069 
Pistons we have here and pretty much the
idea<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:09.090> we're<00:03:10.090> taking<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.510> power<00:03:10.629> from

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
idea is that we're taking the power from

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.410 
idea is that we're taking the power from
this<00:03:11.260> block<00:03:11.620> which<00:03:12.099> magically<00:03:12.579> gets<00:03:12.910> down<00:03:13.209> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
this block which magically gets down to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.830 
this block which magically gets down to
this<00:03:13.569> red<00:03:13.840> stone<00:03:14.140> from<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:15.420> pressure<00:03:16.420> pad<00:03:16.690> we

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
this red stone from the pressure pad we

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.259 
this red stone from the pressure pad we
have<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.139> there<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:18.579> take<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:18.790> down<00:03:18.910> some

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
have up there and we take it down some

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.180 
have up there and we take it down some
stairs<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.109> step<00:03:20.410> another<00:03:20.829> step<00:03:21.160> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
stairs just one step another step and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.190 
stairs just one step another step and
then<00:03:21.609> one<00:03:21.970> more<00:03:22.209> step<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:25.630> result<00:03:25.989> is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
then one more step so in the result is

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.729 
then one more step so in the result is
that<00:03:26.230> we<00:03:26.500> are<00:03:26.730> three<00:03:27.810> under<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.930> piston<00:03:29.440> on

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
that we are three under the piston on

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.800 
that we are three under the piston on
the<00:03:30.190> ground<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.790> that's<00:03:31.150> for<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.420> red<00:03:31.540> stones

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the ground and that's for the red stones

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.170 
the ground and that's for the red stones
traveling<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.920> we<00:03:33.220> just<00:03:33.430> take<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.730> red<00:03:33.910> stone

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
traveling and we just take the red stone

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.460 
traveling and we just take the red stone
and<00:03:34.480> down<00:03:34.660> those<00:03:34.870> steps<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:37.470> about

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
and down those steps and then about

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.750 
and down those steps and then about
three<00:03:38.950> spaces<00:03:39.370> from<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:41.130> piston<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.549> one

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
three spaces from the piston here so one

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.670 
three spaces from the piston here so one
under<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.419> piston<00:03:43.780> two<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.169> then<00:03:44.260> three<00:03:44.470> then

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
under the piston two and then three then

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.440 
under the piston two and then three then
we<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.400> up<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.639> block<00:03:45.880> up<00:03:46.870> another<00:03:47.230> block<00:03:47.560> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
we go up a block up another block and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.970 
we go up a block up another block and
then<00:03:49.450> we<00:03:49.569> go<00:03:49.690> around<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:50.019> back<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.470> these<00:03:50.739> are

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
then we go around the back and these are

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.099 
then we go around the back and these are
plugging<00:03:51.370> into<00:03:51.549> Pistons<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.150> are<00:03:52.359> behind<00:03:52.720> I

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
plugging into Pistons that are behind I

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.720 
plugging into Pistons that are behind I
mean<00:03:53.380> they're<00:03:53.680> plugging<00:03:53.889> into<00:03:54.130> blocks<00:03:54.489> that

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
mean they're plugging into blocks that

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.099 
mean they're plugging into blocks that
are<00:03:54.790> behind<00:03:55.180> our<00:03:55.569> side<00:03:56.349> Pistons<00:03:56.859> here<00:03:58.109> while

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
are behind our side Pistons here while

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.460 
are behind our side Pistons here while
this<00:03:59.919> front<00:04:00.700> bit<00:04:00.910> here<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.480> going<00:04:01.870> up<00:04:01.989> one<00:04:02.200> step

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
this front bit here is going up one step

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.729 
this front bit here is going up one step
and<00:04:02.709> plugging<00:04:03.220> into<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:04.470> block<00:04:05.470> that's

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
and plugging into the block that's

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.039 
and plugging into the block that's
underneath<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.730> middle<00:04:06.970> piston<00:04:07.359> that<00:04:07.389> way<00:04:07.750> we

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
underneath the middle piston that way we

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.780 
underneath the middle piston that way we
don't<00:04:08.230> have<00:04:08.440> any<00:04:08.590> interference<00:04:09.190> with<00:04:09.609> our

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
don't have any interference with our

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.879 
don't have any interference with our
redstone<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:11.109> pretty<00:04:11.319> easy<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.620> see

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
redstone and it's pretty easy to see

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.110 
redstone and it's pretty easy to see
what<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:12.160> doing<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.669> it<00:04:12.819> doesn't<00:04:13.060> require

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
what it's doing and it doesn't require

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.589 
what it's doing and it doesn't require
any<00:04:13.540> inversions<00:04:14.609> or<00:04:15.609> inverts<00:04:16.060> whatever

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
any inversions or inverts whatever

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.719 
any inversions or inverts whatever
anyway<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.440> point<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:17.859> they<00:04:18.430> all<00:04:18.549> get

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
anyway the point is that they all get

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.200 
anyway the point is that they all get
powered<00:04:19.090> at<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.109> same<00:04:20.289> time<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:21.210> basically

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
powered at the same time and basically

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.580 
powered at the same time and basically
it's<00:04:22.390> just<00:04:22.450> doing<00:04:22.659> that<00:04:22.840> for<00:04:23.080> all<00:04:23.169> of<00:04:23.320> them<00:04:23.440> you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
it's just doing that for all of them you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.100 
it's just doing that for all of them you
may<00:04:23.740> need

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
may need

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.209 
may need
to<00:04:24.229> make<00:04:25.099> some<00:04:25.370> changes<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.819> how<00:04:26.210> individual

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:27.219 
to make some changes to how individual

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:30.219 
to make some changes to how individual
sides<00:04:28.219> work<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.389> you<00:04:29.810> see<00:04:29.990> over<00:04:30.020> here

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
sides work because as you see over here

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.230 
sides work because as you see over here
we<00:04:30.530> have<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.800> going<00:04:31.039> down<00:04:31.189> the<00:04:31.430> side<00:04:31.610> over<00:04:32.090> here

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
we have it going down the side over here

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.390 
we have it going down the side over here
we<00:04:32.360> have<00:04:32.449> it<00:04:32.569> going<00:04:32.750> down<00:04:32.840> this<00:04:33.080> side<00:04:33.319> but<00:04:34.189> then

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
we have it going down this side but then

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.879 
we have it going down this side but then
I<00:04:34.430> have<00:04:34.849> it<00:04:35.000> going<00:04:35.240> down<00:04:35.419> from<00:04:35.870> this<00:04:36.050> step<00:04:36.349> that

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
I have it going down from this step that

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.339 
I have it going down from this step that
way<00:04:37.129> and<00:04:37.370> out<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:38.300> back<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.509> they<00:04:38.810> all<00:04:38.990> still

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
way and out the back and they all still

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.170 
way and out the back and they all still
I<00:04:39.620> mean<00:04:39.770> there's<00:04:39.979> plenty<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.340> space<00:04:40.490> really<00:04:41.000> if

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
I mean there's plenty of space really if

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.499 
I mean there's plenty of space really if
you<00:04:41.780> do<00:04:41.900> it<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.229> way<00:04:42.409> so<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:44.030> power<00:04:44.180> can

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
you do it that way so the power can

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.010 
you do it that way so the power can
reach<00:04:44.750> its<00:04:45.080> destination<00:04:45.199> quite<00:04:46.009> easily<00:04:46.159> and

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
reach its destination quite easily and

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.860 
reach its destination quite easily and
then<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.409> we<00:04:48.620> just<00:04:48.919> press<00:04:49.310> our<00:04:49.490> switch<00:04:49.870> they

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
then if we just press our switch they

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.499 
then if we just press our switch they
all<00:04:50.990> come<00:04:51.169> up<00:04:51.289> really<00:04:51.590> quickly<00:04:51.919> as<00:04:52.330> long<00:04:53.330> as

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509 
all come up really quickly as long as

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.360 
all come up really quickly as long as
you<00:04:53.750> know<00:04:53.870> it's<00:04:54.110> about<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.889> speed<00:04:55.159> of<00:04:55.340> the

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
you know it's about the speed of the

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.999 
you know it's about the speed of the
pressure<00:04:55.909> pad<00:04:56.150> itself<00:04:56.479> but<00:04:57.319> otherwise<00:04:57.680> it's

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
pressure pad itself but otherwise it's

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.369 
pressure pad itself but otherwise it's
very<00:04:58.189> quick<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.750> there<00:04:59.750> wouldn't<00:05:00.139> be<00:05:00.259> any

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
very quick and there wouldn't be any

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.730 
very quick and there wouldn't be any
bugs<00:05:00.620> since<00:05:00.919> he's<00:05:01.219> using<00:05:01.879> the<00:05:02.740> pushers

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
bugs since he's using the pushers

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.439 
bugs since he's using the pushers
instead<00:05:04.279> for<00:05:04.550> most<00:05:04.729> of<00:05:04.819> its<00:05:04.969> code<00:05:05.210> so<00:05:05.419> you

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
instead for most of its code so you

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.860 
instead for most of its code so you
won't<00:05:05.719> get<00:05:05.900> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.199> of<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.849> two<00:05:07.849> quick<00:05:08.210> press

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
won't get a lot of the two quick press

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.429 
won't get a lot of the two quick press
and<00:05:09.139> release<00:05:09.349> sort<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.770> bugs<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:12.139> it's

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:12.439 
and release sort of bugs and so it's

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.749 
and release sort of bugs and so it's
actually<00:05:12.590> really<00:05:12.919> simple<00:05:13.039> I<00:05:13.430> don't<00:05:13.610> think

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
actually really simple I don't think

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.309 
actually really simple I don't think
there's<00:05:13.909> much<00:05:14.120> other<00:05:14.389> explanation<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.169> he's

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
there's much other explanation that he's

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.929 
there's much other explanation that he's
done<00:05:15.529> you<00:05:15.710> can<00:05:15.830> see<00:05:15.979> that<00:05:16.129> over<00:05:16.370> here<00:05:16.610> it's

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:16.939 
done you can see that over here it's

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.939 
done you can see that over here it's
coming<00:05:17.300> up<00:05:17.419> from<00:05:17.599> this<00:05:18.050> side<00:05:18.289> and<00:05:18.319> going<00:05:18.800> up

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
coming up from this side and going up

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.339 
coming up from this side and going up
and<00:05:19.189> then<00:05:19.400> around<00:05:19.580> on<00:05:19.819> the<00:05:19.969> others<00:05:20.150> edges<00:05:20.599> and

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
and then around on the others edges and

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.649 
and then around on the others edges and
we<00:05:21.500> got<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.129> every<00:05:22.370> side<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.909> it's

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
we got that for every side and it's

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.719 
we got that for every side and it's
exactly<00:05:23.870> level<00:05:24.379> so<00:05:24.710> as<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.009> see<00:05:25.189> here<00:05:25.520> this<00:05:25.669> is

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
exactly level so as you see here this is

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.450 
exactly level so as you see here this is
level<00:05:26.240> ground<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.960> we<00:05:27.590> can<00:05:27.740> cover<00:05:27.949> this<00:05:28.159> place

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
level ground and we can cover this place

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.950 
level ground and we can cover this place
with<00:05:28.669> blocks<00:05:29.000> and<00:05:29.740> it<00:05:30.740> will<00:05:30.889> be<00:05:31.039> perfectly

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
with blocks and it will be perfectly

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.300 
with blocks and it will be perfectly
right<00:05:32.960> over<00:05:33.199> top<00:05:33.349> of<00:05:33.409> the<00:05:33.560> redstone<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:33.979> won't

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
right over top of the redstone and won't

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.540 
right over top of the redstone and won't
interfere<00:05:34.580> any<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.379> so<00:05:36.379> I'll<00:05:36.889> just<00:05:36.919> drop

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
interfere any and so I'll just drop

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.070 
interfere any and so I'll just drop
another<00:05:37.819> a<00:05:37.940> quick<00:05:38.270> couple<00:05:39.169> PSA<00:05:39.710> messages

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
another a quick couple PSA messages

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.219 
another a quick couple PSA messages
first<00:05:42.879> when<00:05:43.879> the<00:05:44.060> update<00:05:44.330> does<00:05:44.509> arrive<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.199> will

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
first when the update does arrive I will

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.279 
first when the update does arrive I will
be<00:05:45.650> making<00:05:45.979> an<00:05:46.400> alternate<00:05:46.940> video<00:05:47.240> for<00:05:47.839> an

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
be making an alternate video for an

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.869 
be making an alternate video for an
older<00:05:48.589> demonstration<00:05:49.370> which<00:05:49.520> was<00:05:49.699> rather

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
older demonstration which was rather

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.600 
older demonstration which was rather
recent<00:05:50.389> which<00:05:51.349> will<00:05:51.589> be<00:05:51.740> compatible<00:05:52.460> with<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
recent which will be compatible with the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.360 
recent which will be compatible with the
new<00:05:52.759> Pistons<00:05:53.330> I'm<00:05:53.509> hoping<00:05:53.930> I<00:05:54.169> mean<00:05:54.680> and<00:05:54.919> asthma

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370

new Pistons I'm hoping I mean and asthma
fact<00:05:55.669> i'll<00:05:55.819> include<00:05:56.860> another<00:05:57.860> version<00:05:58.129> of<00:05:58.400> it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
fact i'll include another version of it

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.550 
fact i'll include another version of it
that<00:05:58.550> won't<00:05:59.389> use<00:05:59.569> pistons<00:05:59.960> at<00:06:00.139> all<00:06:00.229> in<00:06:00.439> case

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
that won't use pistons at all in case

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.070 
that won't use pistons at all in case
you<00:06:00.710> don't<00:06:00.800> want<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.219> and<00:06:01.689> finally<00:06:02.689> i<00:06:02.960> would

you don't want to and finally i would
like<00:06:03.409> to<00:06:03.979> run<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.400> mini-series<00:06:05.000> on<00:06:05.210> the

stuff for multi player because that's

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.900 
stuff for multi player because that's
where<00:06:39.620> a<00:06:39.650> lot<00:06:39.740> of<00:06:39.920> the<00:06:40.040> fun<00:06:40.340> and<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.550> building

where a lot of the fun and the building

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.420 
where a lot of the fun and the building
is<00:06:41.060> and<00:06:41.380> there's<00:06:42.380> great<00:06:42.560> things<00:06:43.040> that<00:06:43.220> you<00:06:43.280> can

is and there's great things that you can
do<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.580> single<00:06:43.790> player<00:06:44.120> but<00:06:44.690> I<00:06:44.960> do<00:06:45.530> like<00:06:45.950> the

do a single player but I do like the
multiplier<00:06:46.700> aspect<00:06:47.120> for<00:06:47.300> pistons<00:06:47.750> and

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
multiplier aspect for pistons and

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.690 
multiplier aspect for pistons and
especially<00:06:48.170> our<00:06:48.380> locators<00:06:48.890> they<00:06:49.070> have<00:06:49.250> great

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
especially our locators they have great

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.090 
especially our locators they have great
multiplayer<00:06:50.150> potential<00:06:50.960> and<00:06:51.170> I'd<00:06:51.680> like<00:06:51.950> to

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
multiplayer potential and I'd like to

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.710 
multiplayer potential and I'd like to
know<00:06:52.250> that<00:06:52.460> we<00:06:52.610> can<00:06:52.760> actually<00:06:52.880> take<00:06:53.210> advantage

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
know that we can actually take advantage

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.690 
know that we can actually take advantage
of<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:54.020> potential<00:06:54.410> before<00:06:55.070> I<00:06:55.100> start<00:06:55.490> making

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:55.700 
of that potential before I start making

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.800 
of that potential before I start making
videos<00:06:55.940> that<00:06:56.780> won't<00:06:57.110> actually<00:06:57.620> work<00:06:58.310> so<00:06:59.270> that

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
videos that won't actually work so that

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.600 
videos that won't actually work so that
should<00:06:59.960> be<00:07:00.050> about<00:07:00.140> it<00:07:00.470> and<00:07:00.620> I<00:07:01.220> will<00:07:01.400> see<00:07:01.580> you

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
should be about it and I will see you

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.570 
should be about it and I will see you
next<00:07:02.270> time
