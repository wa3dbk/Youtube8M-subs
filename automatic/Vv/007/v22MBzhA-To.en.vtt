thing<00:02:37.579> ever<00:02:41.049> my<00:02:42.049> dad<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.970> always<00:02:44.329> been

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
thing ever my dad I just always been

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.670 
thing ever my dad I just always been
there<00:02:44.780> for<00:02:44.959> me<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:47.900> took<00:02:48.079> me<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.290> long<00:02:48.409> time<00:02:48.470> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
there for me it took me a long time to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.399 
there for me it took me a long time to

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
find ideas for a shoe like at first I

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.470 
find ideas for a shoe like at first I
thought<00:02:51.560> it'd<00:02:51.739> be<00:02:51.769> really<00:02:52.010> easy<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:53.180> once<00:02:53.359> you

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
thought it'd be really easy but once you

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.050 
thought it'd be really easy but once you
see<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.169> you<00:02:54.489> start<00:02:55.489> thinking<00:02:55.639> about<00:02:55.849> it

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
see it and you start thinking about it

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.670 
see it and you start thinking about it
it's<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.299> it's<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.079> lot<00:02:57.200> harder<00:02:57.349> than<00:02:57.470> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's like it's a lot harder than you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.129 
it's like it's a lot harder than you
think<00:02:57.829> would<00:02:57.980> be<00:02:58.189> my<00:02:58.909> designer<00:02:59.299> really<00:02:59.930> helped

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139

me out
I<00:03:02.180> think<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.319> think<00:03:03.950> we<00:03:04.280> don't<00:03:04.580> realize<00:03:04.790> how

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
I think I think we don't realize how

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.309 
I think I think we don't realize how
fragile<00:03:05.239> life<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:06.140> think<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:08.019> we<00:03:09.019> take<00:03:09.170> that

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
fragile life is I think the we take that

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.440 
fragile life is I think the we take that
for<00:03:09.470> granted<00:03:09.500> sometimes<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.550> I<00:03:11.030> know<00:03:11.090> as<00:03:11.269> you

for granted sometimes and I know as you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.449 
for granted sometimes and I know as you
