from<00:02:13.080> Makeda<00:02:13.440> nice<00:02:14.310> finesse<00:02:14.640> shot<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.060> was

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
from Makeda nice finesse shot as he was

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.220

signing<00:02:19.710> because<00:02:19.800> around<00:02:20.190> United<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.700> think<00:02:20.910> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
signing because around United I think I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.220 
signing because around United I think I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
might try and keep him at the end of the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.600 
might try and keep him at the end of the
season<00:02:22.380> he's<00:02:22.680> absolutely<00:02:22.950> incredible<00:02:23.490> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
season he's absolutely incredible this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.780 
season he's absolutely incredible this
is<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> things<00:02:25.190> he<00:02:26.190> can<00:02:26.400> do<00:02:26.610> me<00:02:26.730> this

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
is some of the things he can do me this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.100 
is some of the things he can do me this
is<00:02:26.940> another<00:02:27.240> finesse<00:02:27.600> shot<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.020> oh<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.130> close

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
is another finesse shot and oh so close

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.010 
is another finesse shot and oh so close
anyway<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.320> between<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.890> finished<00:02:32.310> shot<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
anyway in between that finished shot and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.240 
right back left-back Rickford left-back
I<00:02:39.300> think<00:02:39.600> sent<00:02:39.810> off<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:41.750> stupid<00:02:42.750> move<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
I think sent off and stupid move so I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.380 
I think sent off and stupid move so I
have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> move<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.700> team<00:02:44.850> around<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
have to move the team around but it

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
have to move the team around but it
doesn't<00:02:45.450> matter<00:02:45.720> i<00:02:45.870> still<00:02:46.170> win<00:02:46.380> one<00:02:46.620> nil<00:02:46.830> like

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
doesn't matter i still win one nil like

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.010 
doesn't matter i still win one nil like
I<00:02:47.310> said<00:02:47.460> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> bumper<00:02:48.840> pack

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
I said this is like a bumper pack

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.680 
I said this is like a bumper pack
episode<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.270> games<00:02:51.480> are<00:02:51.600> really

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
sorry I'm trying to find just bits and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.060 
sorry I'm trying to find just bits and
pieces<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.140> did<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.410> makeda<00:03:01.740> but

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.510 
pieces like I did with the makeda but
sometimes<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.150> maybe<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.570> hard<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:04.520> just

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520
