00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 whatsapp minutes guys on nlg team me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.230
 are simple that falls today I am here with 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 a video that I have been thinking about for a while 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.820
 to realize but only today I am convinced 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.640
 today we are talking about bitcoins and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.800
 how to make how to extract bitcoins 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.500
 for all those who did not know the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.400
 bitcoin is a virtual currency that by now 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.870
 has been in vogue since 2009, which has a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.030
 virtual value has no real 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 material has no intrinsic value 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.850
 but it is only a currency that can be 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 find bitcoins online in these 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 months is developing more and more 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.870
 there are so many internet sites that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.730
 now they accept bitcoins of course 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 we do not find large sites as they can 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 be house rather than other giants 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.210
 of technology and of the online shop 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.800
 however however bitcoin is easily 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.710
 between mutable therefore convertible into 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.930
 real currency then euro dollar 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 bitcoin is just a coin that like 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.610
 says the name is formed by bits 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.710
 therefore it is a completely secure currency 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 because it comes from cryptography 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.470
 it's really very high and you get in 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.479
 what way doing the meaning this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.600
 procedure called meaning in these 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 months is indeed depopulating indeed 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.259
 many ask for information on 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.950
 this on this procedure then on 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.560
 bitcoin on how to extract bitcoins and qual 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.229
 I can say is that you can gain 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.540
 have through this activity 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.479
 fine bitcoin however the meaning 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.970
 of bitcoin is a procedure that consists 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.659
 in using the computing power 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.329
 of our computer to develop and to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.210
 solve problems that come to us 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.030
 provided or rather the home precisely 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.520
 bitcoin manufacturer supplies 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.060
 problem packs obviously and a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.560
 IT level to be 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.409
 solved by our power of 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.020
 calculation and this computing power yes 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.590
 measure in 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.980
 or rather in g garage omega then comes out 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.560
 guys this is the unit of measurement 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.570
 with which our computer yes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.350
 interface with the problem that comes to us 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.270
 place 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 these packages that are sent to us 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.640
 they are really big and they are continuous 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.370
 obviously the number of users is increasing 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.280
 just preparing to do this activity 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.740
 therefore the meaning bitcoin is continuous 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080
 increase and that's how I can tell 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.150
 closely related to the difficulty 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.670
 of troubleshooting 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.710
 obviously those who produce 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.320
 bitcoins as users 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.330
 increases must and are forced to 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.640
 increase the difficulty of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.440
 Troubleshooting for compound 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.050
 find a resolution to this 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.990
 problem meaning has been created 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.970
 Pooled minibuses are groups of 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.280
 people who combine their power of 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.020
 calculation to precisely solve more 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.330
 quickly a problem 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.890
 the first the first person the first 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.740
 user or the first meaningful 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.209
 which is precisely able to solve the 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.400
 problem then to find the solution 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.800
 of this problem by processing all the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.260
 data that are contained within the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.300
 package that is provided to us receives a 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.000
 bitcoin prize that if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.190
 it's around 25 coins 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.490
 I just tell you that she cooks the equivalent 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 of a bit coin klein of children coin 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.190
 is about $ 680 at least today 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.290
 and if you had indeed 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.660
 reach the solution to the problem that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.510
 we are given the value in coins 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.180
 so in euros, yes, yes, yes 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.300
 would have about 17 thousand 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.459
 euro so guys is really crazy 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.890
 anyway I have to tell you these 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.890
 information with a little regard 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.660
 because meaning is not a process 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.480
 within everyone's reach 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.680
 obviously it is a very proceeding 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.620
 complicated and requiring a lot of power 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.590
 of calculation if not obviously it would be a 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.380
 gain too easy and there would be no 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.000
 such a high value of the boys coin 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.920
 the meaning I recommend it to everyone 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.400
 those who have cars from 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.150
 escort that they obviously want to manage 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.580
 however take this route 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.620
 of bitcoin and the meaning of bitcoin that 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.380
 however it is very demanding and not 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.570
 always leads to a look because I remember 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.720
 that machines therefore computers must 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.970
 stay on 24 hours a day seven 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.729
 days on seven a problem comes 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.039
 solved in about and based precisely on the 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.699
 your computing power at around 20 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:47.100
 days always having the pc turned on is one 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.740
 really very demanding thing 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.289
 it depends on the amount of jig you have 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.750
 so you can provide what you can 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.169
 offer to solve this 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.610
 problem and bg ganesh from what they derive 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.860
 from the computing power of yours 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.750
 processor of and of your card 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.479
 video card video which is much more 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.600
 used in another practice that more 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.430
 within our reach or mil 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.190
 meaning delight coin the light coin sono 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.130
 pretty much the same thing as bitcoin 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.020
 but they are virtual coins a little more 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.479
 within our reach they have a value 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.180
 decidedly lower than the 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.580
 bitcoins, however, allow us to 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.270
 do something even through the use 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.650
 of not very high hardware as for 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.169
 computing power 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.389
 obviously for all these practices 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:38.250
 amd video cards are recommended 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.190
 I honestly don't know why 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.260
 amd but vi are highly recommended 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.120
 I can only say I can send you back to 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.430
 a table that I will leave in description 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.289
 where they are specified 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.770
 computing powers and above all the 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.990
 relationship with the energy consumption of the 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.570
 video card itself because another thing 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.780
 that is to say that the practice of 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.860
 meaning requires a lot of energy 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.620
 electrical of course the computers must 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:07.470
 stay on 7 days a week 24 hours a day 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.430
 24 and energy in Italy really costs 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.380
 much 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.849
 therefore before embarking on the path of the 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.830
 meaning there is to do a 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.219
 how can I say a little calculation that 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:21.159
 allows you to calculate and draw 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:24.550
 conclusions about the real gain that you 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.009
 you might have from mining bitcoin 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.469
 rather than undermining light with the boys 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.270
 I really can't tell you much else about it 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:34.360
 this practice because I am not a 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.999
 expert I was asked to do 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.800
 this type of procedure however of 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:41.199
 take the road of meaning but 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.389
 honestly I have not decided to 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.199
 to undertake in a serious manner in 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.539
 constant manner because it is a very world 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:52.139
 complicated and really need a lot 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:54.399
 work and lots of computing power 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.779
 guys for any question I will 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.089
 I invite you to leave me below in the 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:00.039
 comments I will make more videos on this 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:02.169
 argument because I do n't think I have you 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:04.629
 all said indeed almost certainly not 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.879
 I told you all there are so many 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.649
 There are so many things to say about practices 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.469
 I do n't want to keep you too much in this 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:13.929
 video more told to general lines which it is 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:14.860
 what is bitcoin what it is 

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:17.469
 is 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.779
 the virtual currency and how spies 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.519
 I liked the video there among the boys 

00:07:19.779 --> 00:07:24.610
 invitation to leave a like maybe a 

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:26.889
 comment to let me know if and when 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.659
 you wanted a new episode 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:31.240
 maybe a new video in which I show you 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:34.059
 how how and how to best 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.779
 the meaning maybe I will also advise you 

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:40.509
 entry level pc configurations for 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:42.009
 take the mini route for 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:42.490
 today it's all guys I hope there is 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.349
 liked 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.349
 see you at the next hello video
