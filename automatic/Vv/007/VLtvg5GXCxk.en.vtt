on chalkboard paper this is my package
of<00:00:55.339> chalkboard<00:00:55.549> paper<00:00:55.940> I<00:00:56.089> typically<00:00:56.569> just

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
of chalkboard paper I typically just

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.889 
of chalkboard paper I typically just
open<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:57.350> up<00:00:57.499> at<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.799> top<00:00:57.979> and<00:00:58.370> leave<00:00:59.359> in<00:00:59.479> the

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:02.479 
wrapper because then I always know that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.950 
wrapper because then I always know that
this<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.499> the<00:01:04.070> front<00:01:04.400> side<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.269> chalkboard

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
this is the front side of the chalkboard

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500 
this is the front side of the chalkboard
paper<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.520> take<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.940> out<00:01:08.090> and<00:01:08.120> it's<00:01:08.360> all

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
paper if you take it out and it's all

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.270 
paper if you take it out and it's all
mixed<00:01:08.780> up<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.320> might<00:01:09.470> you<00:01:09.740> know<00:01:09.860> flip<00:01:10.160> around

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
mixed up and might you know flip around

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.690 
mixed up and might you know flip around

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
but this is definitely a little bit

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.980

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
and then I'm going to use my

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.400 
and then I'm going to use my

on<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.829> black<00:03:05.040> you'll<00:03:05.340> start<00:03:05.670> kind<00:03:06.329> of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
on the black you'll start kind of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.900 
on the black you'll start kind of
picking<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:07.019> little<00:03:07.260> bit<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> black<00:03:07.910> and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
picking up a little bit of the black and
in<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.269> case<00:03:09.629> you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:10.049> just<00:03:10.410> kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.040> wipe

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
in that case you can just kind of wipe

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.599 
in that case you can just kind of wipe
it<00:03:11.670> off<00:03:11.879> on<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> scrap<00:03:12.599> piece<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:12.989> paper<00:03:13.170> and
