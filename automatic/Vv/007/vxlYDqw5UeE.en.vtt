00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
so here we have a situation where we're

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.930 
so here we have a situation where we're
about<00:00:12.969> nine<00:00:13.269> now<00:00:13.480> -<00:00:14.440> 75<00:00:14.950> DBMS<00:00:15.580> of<00:00:15.700> power

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
about nine now - 75 DBMS of power

bunch of other traffic on the same Wi-Fi
network<00:00:25.450> we<00:00:26.289> currently<00:00:26.530> do<00:00:26.920> not<00:00:26.950> have<00:00:27.100> IP<00:00:27.400> q<00:00:27.730> on

network we currently do not have IP q on

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.620 
network we currently do not have IP q on
and<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:30.039> you<00:00:30.190> can<00:00:30.340> see<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.789> video<00:00:31.300> at<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.600> top

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
and as you can see the video at the top

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.670 
and as you can see the video at the top
is<00:00:32.079> quite<00:00:32.559> sucky<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:35.079> let's<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:35.379> a<00:00:35.440> nice

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
is quite sucky and so let's have a nice

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:44.729 
is quite sucky and so let's have a nice
conversation<00:00:36.120> by<00:00:37.120> a<00:00:37.149> carrier<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:44.470> as<00:00:44.590> you

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
conversation by a carrier so I so as you

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.610 
conversation by a carrier so I so as you
can<00:00:44.829> see<00:00:45.040> we've<00:00:45.280> without<00:00:45.940> IP<00:00:46.239> q<00:00:46.660> on<00:00:46.809> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.290> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
can see we've without IP q on Wi-Fi the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.440 
can see we've without IP q on Wi-Fi the
quality<00:00:48.130> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.340> video<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.670> inconsistent

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
quality of the video is inconsistent

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.630 
quality of the video is inconsistent
it's<00:00:49.750> breaking<00:00:50.230> up<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.649> audio<00:00:50.980> isn't<00:00:51.160> smooth

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
it's breaking up the audio isn't smooth

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's breaking up the audio isn't smooth
a<00:00:51.970> lot<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.809> framedrops<00:00:53.380> it's<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.399> a<00:00:54.460> poor

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
a lot of framedrops it's a it's a poor

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.490 
a lot of framedrops it's a it's a poor
experience<00:00:54.940> I<00:00:55.329> think<00:00:55.420> everyone's<00:00:55.840> everyone's

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
experience I think everyone's everyone's

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.979 
experience I think everyone's everyone's
seen<00:00:56.680> this<00:00:56.860> kind<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.190> quality<00:00:57.399> before<00:00:57.989> there's

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
seen this kind of quality before there's

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.569 
seen this kind of quality before there's
even<00:00:59.079> right<00:00:59.379> now<00:00:59.410> it's<00:00:59.649> frozen<00:00:59.920> his<00:01:00.190> hands

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
even right now it's frozen his hands

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.220 
even right now it's frozen his hands
come<00:01:00.790> off<00:01:00.820> his<00:01:01.090> body<00:01:01.329> and<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.840> can<00:01:01.930> see<00:01:02.020> it's

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
come off his body and you can see it's

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.639 
come off his body and you can see it's
very<00:01:02.379> poor<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.930> kind<00:01:05.140> of<00:01:05.199> experience

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
very poor not the kind of experience

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.249 
very poor not the kind of experience
you're<00:01:05.740> looking<00:01:06.009> for<00:01:06.219> and<00:01:06.899> in<00:01:07.899> a<00:01:07.990> video

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
you're looking for and in a video

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:15.840

conference<00:01:08.439> for<00:01:08.829> sure<00:01:14.520> yeah<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.580> got

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
conference for sure yeah you got

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
conference for sure yeah you got
terrible<00:01:16.299> audio<00:01:16.510> going<00:01:16.780> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.080 

I<00:01:23.039> will<00:01:23.579> now<00:01:23.729> protect<00:01:23.939> us<00:01:28.460> by<00:01:29.460> switching<00:01:30.000> on

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
I will now protect us by switching on

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.669 
I will now protect us by switching on
ipq<00:01:30.750> at<00:01:30.960> both<00:01:31.229> ends<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.960> ensure<00:01:34.350> we<00:01:34.530> get

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
ipq at both ends to ensure we get

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.840 
ipq at both ends to ensure we get
protection<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.369> both<00:01:35.549> directions<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.149> traffic

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.890 

all<00:01:41.420> right<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.290> once<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.800> queues<00:01:43.100> have

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
all right so once the queues have

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.969 
all right so once the queues have
cleared<00:01:44.900> we<00:01:45.110> should<00:01:45.320> get<00:01:45.470> much<00:01:45.710> better

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
cleared we should get much better

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.930 
cleared we should get much better
quality<00:01:46.460> audio<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.970> video<00:01:49.479> okay

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
quality audio and video okay

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.859 
quality audio and video okay
so<00:01:52.940> Brett<00:01:53.150> what<00:01:53.270> are<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:53.420> up<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.510> today

so Brett what are you up to today

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:01.510 
so Brett what are you up to today
Oh<00:01:56.800> video<00:01:58.210> movie<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.590> as<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.860> can<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.040> now<00:02:01.460> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
Oh video movie so as you can see now the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.870 
Oh video movie so as you can see now the
video<00:02:01.880> is<00:02:02.060> smooth<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> audio<00:02:03.050> is<00:02:03.200> smooth<00:02:03.880> it

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
video is smooth the audio is smooth it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.510 
video is smooth the audio is smooth it
is<00:02:05.000> still<00:02:05.270> sift<00:02:05.570> resolution<00:02:06.290> but<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:06.800> very

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
is still sift resolution but it's very

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.330 
is still sift resolution but it's very
usable<00:02:07.970> very<00:02:08.300> much<00:02:08.479> better<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.070> use

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
usable very much better so I think use

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.010 
usable very much better so I think use
now<00:02:10.520> sweet<00:02:10.759> honorable<00:02:11.209> friends<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.630> ensuring

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
now sweet honorable friends and ensuring

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.500 
now sweet honorable friends and ensuring
we<00:02:12.200> get<00:02:12.470> priority<00:02:13.370> access<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:13.940> network

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
we get priority access to the network

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.200 
we get priority access to the network
you<00:02:14.840> should<00:02:15.170> get<00:02:15.410> very<00:02:15.590> very<00:02:15.860> high<00:02:16.070> quality

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.620 

all<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.810> don't<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:26.330> hey<00:02:27.330> there

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
all right so I don't see you hey there

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.220 
all right so I don't see you hey there
you<00:02:27.780> are

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
you are

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.890 
you are
all<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> same<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
all right so this is the same as the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.880 
all right so this is the same as the
previous<00:02:31.350> test<00:02:31.970> except<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.500> hop

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
previous test except we have a Wi-Fi hop

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.770 
previous test except we have a Wi-Fi hop
which<00:02:35.520> were<00:02:35.670> particularly<00:02:36.060> currently<00:02:36.630> not

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
which were particularly currently not

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.070 
which were particularly currently not
protecting<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.650> we<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> wide<00:02:39.810> area

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
protecting and we also have a wide area

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.520 
protecting and we also have a wide area
network<00:02:40.410> which<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.950> 1%<00:02:41.520> packet<00:02:41.940> loss

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
network which is a 1% packet loss

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.410 
network which is a 1% packet loss
network<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.940> quality

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
network so you can see that the quality

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.720 
network so you can see that the quality
is<00:02:45.540> even<00:02:45.810> worse<00:02:45.960> than<00:02:46.140> before<00:02:46.490> we're<00:02:47.490> seeing

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
is even worse than before we're seeing

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.640 
is even worse than before we're seeing
artifacts<00:02:48.210> from<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.510> Wi-Fi<00:02:48.990> hub<00:02:49.200> but<00:02:49.500> we're

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
artifacts from a Wi-Fi hub but we're

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
completely user nope I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.800 
completely user nope I
I<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.310> hear<00:03:08.550> a<00:03:08.580> syllable<00:03:09.090> down<00:03:09.270> then<00:03:09.540> but

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
I can hear a syllable down then but

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.640 
I can hear a syllable down then but
definitely<00:03:10.200> not<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.380> conversation<00:03:11.100> oh<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.500> we

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
definitely not a conversation oh and we

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.059 
definitely not a conversation oh and we
lost<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.160> call

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.650 

you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.840 

so<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.200> think<00:03:28.470> here<00:03:28.860> is<00:03:28.980> currently<00:03:29.280> protecting

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
so I think here is currently protecting

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.090 
so I think here is currently protecting
both<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.300> Wi-Fi<00:03:30.780> hop<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.470> LAN<00:03:31.650> packet

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
both the Wi-Fi hop and the LAN packet

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.520 
both the Wi-Fi hop and the LAN packet
loss<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.550> as<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.730> can<00:03:32.850> see<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:34.200> video<00:03:34.500> is

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
loss and as you can see the video is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.890 
loss and as you can see the video is
good<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.070> audio<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.460> good<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> good

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
good the audio is good we have a good

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.880 
good the audio is good we have a good
quality<00:03:37.110> video<00:03:37.500> very<00:03:38.040> very<00:03:38.130> usable<00:03:39.800> what<00:03:40.800> do
