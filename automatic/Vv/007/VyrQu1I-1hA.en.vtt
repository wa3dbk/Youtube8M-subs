a<00:01:59.700> design<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> it's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
a design like that and so it's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.999 
a design like that and so it's
apparently<00:02:03.119> they're<00:02:03.540> claiming<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.320> 17

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
apparently they're claiming that it's 17

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
apparently they're claiming that it's 17
degrees<00:02:05.040> cooler<00:02:05.549> than<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.180> reference<00:02:06.360> but

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
degrees cooler than the reference but

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.369 
degrees cooler than the reference but
some<00:02:07.680> people<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.160> saying<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.580> they<00:02:08.729> got

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
some people are saying that they got

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.890 
some people are saying that they got
even<00:02:10.379> cooler<00:02:10.679> than<00:02:10.890> 17<00:02:11.550> degrees<00:02:11.819> right<00:02:12.090> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
even cooler than 17 degrees right so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.509 
even cooler than 17 degrees right so
turn<00:02:13.260> camera<00:02:13.650> off<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.769> have<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> look<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
turn camera off and have a look on the

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.330 
turn camera off and have a look on the
inside<00:02:14.750> okay<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.110> we've<00:02:16.470> got<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.739> box<00:02:16.950> open

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
inside okay so we've got the box open

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.949 
inside okay so we've got the box open
you<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.610> see<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> card<00:02:18.239> right<00:02:18.480> there<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
you can see the card right there and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.850 
you can see the card right there and
Allah's<00:02:19.260> goodly<00:02:19.920> godliness<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.709> it's<00:02:22.709> in

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
Allah's goodly godliness and it's in

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
some very dense very good packing foam

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.100 
some very dense very good packing foam
so<00:02:26.159> it<00:02:26.220> shouldn't<00:02:26.459> take<00:02:26.580> any<00:02:26.879> damage<00:02:27.090> here's<00:02:28.049> a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
so it shouldn't take any damage here's a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.440 
so it shouldn't take any damage here's a
chunk<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.879> okay<00:02:29.879> let's<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.239> look<00:02:30.360> at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
chunk of it okay let's have a look at

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
chunk of it okay let's have a look at
some<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> spots<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.319> get<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.829> where

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
some of the spots you get with it where

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
some of the spots you get with it where
you<00:02:32.099> get<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.959> dual<00:02:33.959> molex<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.530> 6-pin<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.849> get

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
you get a dual molex to 6-pin you get

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.580 
you get a dual molex to 6-pin you get
two<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.239> them<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.900> need<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.200> use<00:02:37.319> them<00:02:37.440> with

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
two of them if you need to use them with

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.930 
two of them if you need to use them with
your<00:02:37.650> power<00:02:37.890> supply<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.280> might<00:02:38.579> need<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.879> get

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
your power supply you might need to get

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.390 
your power supply you might need to get
a<00:02:39.000> new<00:02:39.120> power<00:02:39.360> supply<00:02:39.560> these<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.829> for<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.250> V

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
a new power supply these are for the V

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.720 
a new power supply these are for the V
checkpoints<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.120> plug<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:43.340> plug<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.489> into

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
checkpoints you plug your plug this into

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.580 
checkpoints you plug your plug this into
the<00:02:45.030> graphics<00:02:45.660> card<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.049> then<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.230> chuck

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the graphics card and then you chuck

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.130 
the graphics card and then you chuck
your<00:02:46.769> voltage<00:02:47.220> meter<00:02:47.459> into<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:48.140> multimeter

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
your voltage meter into that multimeter

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.750 
your voltage meter into that multimeter
or<00:02:49.319> whatever<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.709> called<00:02:49.769> up<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.609> one

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
or whatever it's called up that one

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.900 
or whatever it's called up that one
coming<00:02:51.329> out<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.489> there's<00:02:53.609> some<00:02:53.790> more

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
coming out and I think there's some more

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.869 
coming out and I think there's some more
underneath<00:02:54.239> baku-pod<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.579> should<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.849> a

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
underneath baku-pod so this should be a

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.899 
underneath baku-pod so this should be a
book<00:02:57.150> yep<00:02:57.900> I'll<00:02:58.560> put<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> card<00:02:59.099> over<00:02:59.459> there

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and in here we have a VGA to DVI to VGA

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.809 
and in here we have a VGA to DVI to VGA

on the card besides what I wanted to
check<00:06:49.780> before<00:06:49.930> my<00:06:50.470> 260<00:06:51.250> only<00:06:51.640> just<00:06:52.030> fit<00:06:52.360> in<00:06:52.600> the

compare it in size to this wow that is a
very<00:07:05.710> compact<00:07:06.220> powerful<00:07:06.940> card<00:07:07.350> so<00:07:08.350> I'm<00:07:08.770> quite

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
very compact powerful card so I'm quite

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.250 
very compact powerful card so I'm quite
happy<00:07:09.190> about<00:07:09.340> that<00:07:09.640> size<00:07:10.000> it<00:07:10.270> is<00:07:10.300> only<00:07:10.600> 9

inches<00:07:11.860> where<00:07:12.040> this<00:07:12.190> is<00:07:12.400> 11<00:07:14.730> so<00:07:15.730> it<00:07:15.820> should<00:07:16.000> be

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
inches where this is 11 so it should be

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.720
