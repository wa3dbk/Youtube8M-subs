00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.149 

great<00:01:24.850> jump<00:01:25.360> perhaps<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.350> lovely<00:01:26.710> dive<00:01:26.920> to

as<00:01:29.470> she<00:01:29.650> had<00:01:29.799> in<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.009> semies<00:01:30.369> I<00:01:30.580> know

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
as she had in the semies I know

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.760 
as she had in the semies I know
it's<00:01:31.180> impressive<00:01:31.540> because<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.229> jump<00:01:32.530> and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
it's impressive because of the jump and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.160 
it's impressive because of the jump and
she<00:01:33.130> finishes<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.000> high<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.509> she's<00:01:34.930> got<00:01:35.080> the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
she finishes so high and she's got the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.469 
she finishes so high and she's got the
Chinese<00:01:35.409> style<00:01:35.830> out<00:01:36.159> where<00:01:36.820> she<00:01:36.970> kicks<00:01:37.270> down

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
Chinese style out where she kicks down

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.300 
Chinese style out where she kicks down
at<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.720> water<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.290> then<00:01:38.470> floats<00:01:38.740> around<00:01:38.920> but

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
at the water and then floats around but

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.920 
at the water and then floats around but
she<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.729> forgot<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.090> reach<00:01:40.420> back<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.659> little

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
she just forgot to reach back a little

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.050 
she just forgot to reach back a little
bit<00:01:41.110> harder<00:01:41.590> with<00:01:41.950> her<00:01:42.070> hands<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:42.789> just

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
bit harder with her hands and so just

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.760 
bit harder with her hands and so just
drops<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.479> little<00:01:43.690> short<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.289> end<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
drops a little short on the end the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.230 
drops a little short on the end the
judges<00:01:45.130> are<00:01:45.280> like<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.549> jump<00:01:45.789> up<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.119> air

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
judges are like the jump up in the air

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.060 
judges are like the jump up in the air
but<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:46.960> could<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.380> she's<00:01:47.799> out<00:01:48.039> a

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
but you could just see she's out a

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.100 
but you could just see she's out a
fraction<00:01:48.850> too<00:01:49.060> early<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.689> she<00:01:49.840> didn't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
fraction too early and she didn't

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.929 
fraction too early and she didn't
overcompensate<00:01:50.920> by<00:01:51.100> pulling<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> arms<00:01:51.789> back

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939

harder the problem for Panda Lena ryeong

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.999 
harder the problem for Panda Lena ryeong
is<00:01:54.700> that<00:01:54.939> it<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.210> just<00:01:55.509> 2.9<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.590> tariff

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009
