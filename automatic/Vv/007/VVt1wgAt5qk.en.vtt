00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 the doctor pim van lommel and doctor 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.379
 cardiologist at the Dutch Hospital of 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.660
 rin stadt in the Netherlands he is the first 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.290
 to have done a great study 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 scale with 344 survivors 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 of death these works were published 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 in the very serious medical journal of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.660
 india 7 in December 2001 it is located 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 that new current concept in science 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 say that consciousness is produced 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.430
 by the brain of the functional brain and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.960
 this concept has never been proven to 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 screenshots the afp so we have to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 reconsider this concept of the consulate of 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.660
 this camp we have patients who 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.059
 report a clear conscience where they 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.910
 prove the memories or an activity 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.280
 Cognitive meaning of emotions evening 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140
 and sometimes even perceptions since 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.340
 the outside of the body they go over 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.949
 of a period when the brain is not 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 functional the worst we could so 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.699
 exclude the usual explanations 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.820
 I'm right the logical clio 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.190
 chronological or pharmacology and we 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.719
 have to look for another way as to 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 the way the brain works 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.260
 yes as a result of the results of these 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.180
 studies except that phoenix usa at the stage of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.189
 concept of the Canadian there is another 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.470
 concept that can be used according to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.750
 which the brain does not produce the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 consciousness too is perhaps only the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.860
 brain receives information from the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.860
 consciousness of the year and so we have a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 different concept to compeyre I compare 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.620
 that to a TV radio or a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.390
 mobile phone 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.700
 the program that we see at the 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.340
 television is received by the post and not 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.210
 not produced by an arrow so 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.270
 the information received by a mobile radio 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.970
 television or computer yves virus 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.960
 they receive this information and the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.930
 code in the form of waves 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.760
 electromagnetic 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.890
 they are everywhere around us and 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 as we speak here there is more 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.490
 of a hundred thousand phone calls that 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.230
 we cross through the walls and 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.350
 hundreds of programs 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:07.970
 television and radio we do not know 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.530
 not but the information is there and we have 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.510
 need an instrument to receive 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 this information 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.550
 so we compare the brain a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.050
 kind of receivers an interface between 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.730
 the informational fields of consciousness 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.410
 as I call them and our body 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.550
 So our colleague physical standby 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.490
 the way we are aware 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.110
 when we are awake are reading this 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.650
 is only part of our consciousness 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.430
 expanded there is even a connection with the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 songs of conscience of the past and 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.640
 also those of other individuals they 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.390
 are also connected to the field of 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.890
 awareness of missing loved ones 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.920
 so there is an interconnection with all 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.020
 the fields of consciousness of other countries 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.680
 an interconnection with a space where he 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.200
 there is no time 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.110
 smid spaces as we 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.770
 know here in the material world 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.770
