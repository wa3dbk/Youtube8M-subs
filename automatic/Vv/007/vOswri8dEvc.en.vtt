00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 with other friends with you alexey 32 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.660
 Today I insert a plugin called 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 admin utilities this plugin allows 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.630
 to give all possible mutant and frieze then 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.050
 there is a stop over the player in place 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.649
 the disappearance of all things from him from amber and 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.350
 in general, this plugin can be useful in 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.720
 batch well, that is, do not put there others 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 plugin that's just put this one and it 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.320
 well enough let's see we 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.329
 the team moved and relocated in the general 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.519
 here they are all there you will understand 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.940
 there is it primary to this here all 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.670
 easy 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 that is, I will not initially explain, but 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.980
 the teams themselves are a mod to give on 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 all players either at some 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140
 certain in my opinion I donâ€™t know 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.020
 would be here at all just so let's 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.000
 check probably 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 but you like 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.110
 so now time turn on 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.920
 nobody day 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.700
 so let's see here and on but here only 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 mutual 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.790
 only that is, you can not describe in the chat 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.790
 Now, in theory, but since the admin 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.800
 I can write that is written here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.430
 impossible and possible to chat 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.110
 there is as I said that the admin and I 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.160
 I can write then there are other players they 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.320
 will no longer be able to chat and so hill 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.990
 all that is, the treatment of all players on 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.260
 server ignore and some player player 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.840
 you can ignore the tempo for mute and 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.400
 it is my opinion and yes in the future will be 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.620
 give some player by the way 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.630
 mutants at all and this is for someone 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.030
 certain player 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.000
 frieze frieze is one player stop 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 let's check for example i have 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.869
 something like a book 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.540
 have we write a frieze and in theory should 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.760
 we all disappear so freeze 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 alexey here that is i can't right now 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.440
 move but i'm not dead yet 17 remain 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.780
 inside 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.510
 I had a bug when I was not filming 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.640
 I shot that is, but I can turn around 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.740
 I can not go I turn that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.400
 where did you want to go then that is all and 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 statements written type hey alex screw 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.130
 you can't move there you are like Christ 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.600
 and frozen in place and everything is not yet 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.760
 saw the same 5 commands already 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.580
 defrosting the player that is valid if 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.490
 someone there saw the player griffin yes and 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.850
 lest he bristle back home to 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.010
 to myself 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.930
 that is, we are stopping it on the spot 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.000
 freeze everything will stand still 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.710
 accidents 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.860
 so interesting so let's say the team 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.490
 Timefreeze can be frozen for a while. 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.380
 player 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 but for some particular then in seconds 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.710
 0 to time per second written 10 minutes 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.440
 here second that is for 60 seconds it 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.560
 whole minute that is for a minute, you can there 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.650
 or 120 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.580
 But in general, everything is moved here 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.790
 as already said 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.640
 chat color it is possible to write chad and by the way 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.520
 there are still emotions here 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.410
 click on the click on that is click and 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.019
 there will be you will highlight the emotions then 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.540
 have you can chat emotionally 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.360
 so let's say that is written for example 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.959
 such a muzzle but in principle you can kind 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.959
 and color yes you can 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.819
 and by 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.380
 Yes, you can see, for example, and 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.880
 supports all colors like 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.910
 bold and italic support 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.530
 for example let's last 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.370
 For example I will show an asterisk so 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.349
 we copy 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.030
 for example instead of you we insert emotions 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.080
 star take away from us and the star of 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.860
 It appeared in general, and that's all on it 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.730
