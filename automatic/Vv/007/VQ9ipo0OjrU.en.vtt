showed<00:00:11.969> my<00:00:12.420> work<00:00:12.570> in<00:00:12.719> progress<00:00:13.219> prototype<00:00:14.219> for

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
showed my work in progress prototype for

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.240 
showed my work in progress prototype for
my<00:00:15.360> new<00:00:15.540> railway<00:00:16.020> system<00:00:16.500> which<00:00:16.950> is<00:00:17.070> going<00:00:17.189> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
my new railway system which is going to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
my new railway system which is going to
be<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> top<00:00:17.520> crap<00:00:17.759> version<00:00:18.090> 3<00:00:18.360> and<00:00:18.689> i<00:00:19.439> finished

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
be a top crap version 3 and i finished

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.540 
be a top crap version 3 and i finished
my<00:00:20.250> prototype<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.720> hog<00:00:22.160> or<00:00:23.160> station<00:00:23.490> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
my prototype for the hog or station to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.599 
my prototype for the hog or station to
keep<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> anus<00:00:24.029> minecraft<00:00:25.369> progress<00:00:26.369> nine

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
keep the anus minecraft progress nine

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.439 
keep the anus minecraft progress nine
and<00:00:27.269> three-quarters<00:00:28.580> station<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and three-quarters station which is this

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.890 
and three-quarters station which is this
one<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.489> made<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:33.840> be

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
one here so I've made so this will be

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.509 
one here so I've made so this will be
repeated<00:00:34.140> at<00:00:34.410> every<00:00:34.650> station<00:00:34.860> from<00:00:35.280> every

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:35.519 
repeated at every station from every

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:38.930 
repeated at every station from every
station<00:00:35.699> and<00:00:36.479> program<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.350> work<00:00:37.650> but<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
station and program to work but for the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
station and program to work but for the
prototype<00:00:39.299> I've<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.690> built<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
prototype I've just built one and I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.350 
prototype I've just built one and I
finished<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.989> every<00:00:43.199> station<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> let's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
finished it to every station so let's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.770 
finished it to every station so let's
just<00:00:45.449> start<00:00:45.809> by<00:00:46.019> resetting<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.720> now<00:00:48.720> I'll

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
just start by resetting it and now I'll

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.100 
just start by resetting it and now I'll
show<00:00:48.900> you<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.199> from<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.830> get-go<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.989> begin

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
show you it from the get-go so to begin

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.700 
show you it from the get-go so to begin
with<00:00:55.199> choose<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.769> place<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.339> go<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.710> see

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
originally set to go that way that's now

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
originally set to go that way that's now
change<00:01:50.910> go<00:01:51.630> don't<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.900> go<00:01:52.050> pass<00:01:52.260> anything

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
change go don't you go pass anything

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
else I want you to go none of us are in

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.850 
else I want you to go none of us are in
the<00:01:55.710> main<00:01:55.830> attractions<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.720> we're<00:01:57.720> going<00:01:57.900> over

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the main attractions so we're going over

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.430 
the main attractions so we're going over
the<00:01:59.070> London<00:01:59.520> station<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:01.050> here<00:02:01.290> is

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
the London station and then out here is

selected to go right to the ministry if
let's<00:02:05.400> say<00:02:05.550> we<00:02:05.940> switch<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.740> here

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
let's say we switch it to this one here

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.170 
let's say we switch it to this one here
this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> taking<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:10.550> remote<00:02:11.550> place<00:02:11.850> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
this is taking it to a remote place it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.670 
this is taking it to a remote place it
goes<00:02:12.330> over<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> bridge<00:02:12.990> again<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:13.320> gets<00:02:13.350> left

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
goes over the bridge again but gets left

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.500 
goes over the bridge again but gets left
here<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.600> select<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.350> go<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.940> London

been what if you do I'll explain it to

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.570 
been what if you do I'll explain it to
walk<00:03:18.780> bit<00:03:18.989> each<00:03:19.590> does<00:03:19.890> check<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> last

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
walk bit each does check out the last

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250 
walk bit each does check out the last
video<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:21.390> kinda<00:03:21.690> goes<00:03:21.810> into<00:03:22.080> more<00:03:22.200> detail

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
video it kinda goes into more detail

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.390 
video it kinda goes into more detail
about<00:03:22.560> what<00:03:23.010> each<00:03:23.220> element<00:03:23.610> does<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.400> think

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
about what each element does so I think

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.060 
about what each element does so I think
on<00:03:26.820> my<00:03:26.880> next<00:03:27.420> video<00:03:28.579> it<00:03:29.579> will<00:03:29.880> be<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.980> of
