00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
flat but at a curve this one isn't so

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
flat but at a curve this one isn't so
bad<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> headset<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.040> not

around<00:01:28.380> there's<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.460> but

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
around there's a little bit there but

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.630 
around there's a little bit there but
