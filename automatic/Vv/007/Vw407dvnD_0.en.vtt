00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.720
 Today I'll show you how to get this The Walking Dead Keychain 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.620
 from Fimo can do it yourself 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.740
 First take a picture of your choice 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.720
 Then take her polymer clay decoration gel and cover your picture 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.980
 Removes all air bubbles 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.280
 Bake your picture for about 10 minutes 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.460
 Now it cuts out 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.540
 Roll out white polymer clay 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.120
 Put your picture on 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.100
 and cut away excess polymer clay 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 Now attach a Kettelstift 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.720
 and glue the picture with polymer clay deco gel 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.460
 Press it firmly and bake it again for about 15 minutes 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.340
 After baking paint the trailer 

00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:58.941
 The same technique I used for the term trailer 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.360
 Now take brown polymer clay 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.620
 Roll it to a ball and squeeze it flat 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.500
 Take brown polymer clay again and form the hat crown from it 

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:27.237
 Faces the hat crown with the brim 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.820
 Press the brim and crown into the desired shape 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.340
 Make a notch with the brush 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.980
 Take Fimo Gold and roll out 2 thin snakes 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.800
 Put one of them around the crown of the hat 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.000
 Cut off the rest and repeat with the other snake 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.020
 Now you need 2 short, thin snakes 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
 Press her 

00:04:09.258 --> 00:04:12.498
 Now form 3 small balls 

00:04:12.498 --> 00:04:14.438
 and place it 

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:36.374
 Take Fimo Gold again, roll it to a ball and push it flat 

00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:39.634
 and then cuts out a star 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.140
 Press the star 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.660
 Confirm Kettelstift and bake for 15-20 minutes 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.080
 Now black polymer clay rolls out 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.880
 and draw a weapon on it 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.720
 Cut them out 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.220
 Then her black polymer clay rolls to a snake 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.920
 and forms the trigger guard 

00:05:58.114 --> 00:06:03.854
 Now add all the details. Use a picture as a template 

00:06:48.204 --> 00:06:51.564
 Fix a pin and bake the gun for 15-20 minutes 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.140
 After baking, just paint and hang on a key ring 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.820
 So now we find our way to the terminus 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.120
 Have a cute sheriff hat 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.860
 a Daryl Dixon protecting us 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.900
 and of course a weapon 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.360
 I think that's how we survive 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:32.040
