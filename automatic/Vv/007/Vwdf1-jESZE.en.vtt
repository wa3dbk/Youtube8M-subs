00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
cost that went up as you rank the skill

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.939 
cost that went up as you rank the skill
which<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.420> constantly<00:00:43.960> left<00:00:44.199> skarner<00:00:44.649> out<00:00:44.800> of

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
mana and unable to do anything we've

mana and unable to do anything we've
flattened<00:00:47.469> and<00:00:47.710> lowered<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.129> mana<00:00:48.339> cost

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
flattened and lowered that mana cost

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.069 
flattened and lowered that mana cost
across<00:00:48.969> all<00:00:49.269> ranks<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.690> make<00:00:49.809> sure<00:00:49.960> that

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
across all ranks to make sure that

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.139 
across all ranks to make sure that
skarner<00:00:50.829> can<00:00:50.949> always<00:00:51.370> be<00:00:51.519> using<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.879> skill

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
skarner can always be using the skill

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.970 
skarner can always be using the skill
that's<00:00:52.329> designed<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.899> be<00:00:53.019> reusable<00:00:53.530> it's

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
that's designed to be reusable it's

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.489 
that's designed to be reusable it's
palpable<00:00:54.870> skarner's<00:00:55.870> attack<00:00:56.140> speed<00:00:56.379> per

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:56.499 
palpable skarner's attack speed per

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.739 
palpable skarner's attack speed per
level<00:00:56.800> was<00:00:56.949> considerably<00:00:57.760> lower<00:00:58.089> than<00:00:58.390> where

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
level was considerably lower than where

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.299 
level was considerably lower than where
it<00:00:58.899> probably<00:00:59.050> needed<00:00:59.469> to<00:00:59.589> be<00:00:59.649> for<00:00:59.949> a<00:00:59.980> fighter

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
it probably needed to be for a fighter

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.160 
it probably needed to be for a fighter
who<00:01:00.460> does<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.699> lot<00:01:00.789> of<00:01:00.940> auto<00:01:01.210> attacking<00:01:01.600> we

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
who does a lot of auto attacking we

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.079 
who does a lot of auto attacking we
brought<00:01:02.409> that<00:01:02.620> up<00:01:02.649> by<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:02.980> significant<00:01:03.550> amount

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
brought that up by a significant amount

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.640 
brought that up by a significant amount

to bring that cooldown down without the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
able to do that as effectively as he

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.940 
able to do that as effectively as he
needs<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.990> finally<00:01:13.990> we've<00:01:14.500> increased<00:01:14.829> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
needs to finally we've increased the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.179 
needs to finally we've increased the
duration<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.540> skarner's<00:01:16.540> ultimate<00:01:16.570> impale<00:01:17.560> to

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
duration of skarner's ultimate impale to

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.889 
duration of skarner's ultimate impale to
better<00:01:18.460> reflect<00:01:18.610> its<00:01:19.030> ultimate<00:01:19.600> kind<00:01:19.810> of

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:19.899 
better reflect its ultimate kind of

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.840 
better reflect its ultimate kind of
nature<00:01:20.200> it's<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.829> know<00:01:20.860> it<00:01:21.100> is<00:01:21.189> a<00:01:21.220> hard<00:01:21.460> CC

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
nature it's a you know it is a hard CC

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.700 
nature it's a you know it is a hard CC
it<00:01:22.060> does<00:01:22.299> drag<00:01:22.570> people<00:01:22.869> around<00:01:23.079> but<00:01:23.290> it<00:01:23.409> didn't

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
it does drag people around but it didn't

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.219 
it does drag people around but it didn't
quite<00:01:23.860> have<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.570> my<00:01:25.689> big<00:01:25.930> skill

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
quite have that this is my big skill

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.020 
quite have that this is my big skill
this<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.469> my<00:01:26.649> marquee<00:01:27.070> moment<00:01:27.460> feeling<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:28.000> I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
this is my marquee moment feeling and I

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.609 
this is my marquee moment feeling and I
think<00:01:28.210> that's<00:01:28.360> what<00:01:28.479> scar<00:01:28.719> players<00:01:29.020> expect<00:01:29.500> so

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
think that's what scar players expect so

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.870 
think that's what scar players expect so
we've<00:01:29.770> increased<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.219> by<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> little<00:01:30.759> bit

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
we've increased that by a little bit

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.520 
we've increased that by a little bit
we'll<00:01:31.240> see<00:01:31.420> where<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.630> stands<00:01:31.899> after<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.350> and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
we'll see where it stands after this and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.490 
we'll see where it stands after this and
we'll<00:01:32.619> be<00:01:32.649> we'll<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.130> evaluating<00:01:33.579> from<00:01:33.850> here

about<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.530> don't<00:03:21.590> think<00:03:21.739> core<00:03:22.069> key<00:03:22.190> players

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
about it I don't think core key players

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.190 
about it I don't think core key players
are<00:03:22.549> particularly<00:03:22.819> attached<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.540> that<00:03:23.660> so

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
are particularly attached to that so

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.569 
are particularly attached to that so
what<00:03:24.319> we<00:03:24.350> did<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.680> instead<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.010> making<00:03:25.100> the

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
what we did is instead of making the

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.069 
what we did is instead of making the
duration<00:03:25.970> scale<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.450> goes<00:03:26.660> up<00:03:26.690> we've<00:03:26.959> made

duration scale as it goes up we've made

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.840 
duration scale as it goes up we've made

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it a flat rate that's in the middle we

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.729 
it a flat rate that's in the middle we
actually<00:03:29.180> give<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.480> base<00:03:29.660> damage<00:03:30.170> as<00:03:30.350> well

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
actually give it a base damage as well

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.830 
actually give it a base damage as well
as<00:03:30.920> scaling<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.579> we've<00:03:32.120> actually<00:03:32.209> bumped

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
as scaling and we've actually bumped

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.330 
as scaling and we've actually bumped
kind<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.139> that<00:03:33.230> base<00:03:33.410> damage<00:03:33.769> up<00:03:33.920> from<00:03:34.160> his

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
damage into its own value what this does

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.960 
damage into its own value what this does
is<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:38.959> only<00:03:39.200> gives<00:03:39.380> it<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.590> buff<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.639> now

is not only gives it a buff in the now
but<00:03:41.299> also<00:03:41.930> allows<00:03:42.530> us<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.950> tune<00:03:43.190> additional

address<00:04:20.329> immediately<00:04:21.190> one<00:04:22.190> new<00:04:22.340> system<00:04:22.700> we

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
address immediately one new system we

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.490 
address immediately one new system we
introduced<00:04:23.630> to<00:04:23.720> Dominion<00:04:24.050> was<00:04:24.139> the<00:04:24.260> idea<00:04:24.470> of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
introduced to Dominion was the idea of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.589

we're seeing a lot on Dominion is a

we're seeing a lot on Dominion is a

characters are seeing a lot of play and

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.330 
characters are seeing a lot of play and
a<00:05:35.570> lot<00:05:35.720> of<00:05:35.810> dominance<00:05:36.229> on<00:05:36.349> Dominion<00:05:36.620> and<00:05:36.860> one

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
a lot of dominance on Dominion and one

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.770 
a lot of dominance on Dominion and one
of<00:05:37.430> those<00:05:37.490> things<00:05:37.820> that's<00:05:38.060> contributing<00:05:38.690> to

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
of those things that's contributing to

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.439 
of those things that's contributing to
that<00:05:38.810> is<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.169> inevitability<00:05:39.710> of<00:05:39.979> a<00:05:40.099> late-game

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
that is the inevitability of a late-game

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.839 
that is the inevitability of a late-game
this<00:05:41.620> XP<00:05:42.620> nerf<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:43.010> going<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.400> reduce<00:05:43.639> the

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
this XP nerf is going to reduce the

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:45.879 
this XP nerf is going to reduce the
inevitability<00:05:44.630> of<00:05:44.659> that<00:05:44.840> into<00:05:45.139> closer<00:05:45.560> or

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
inevitability of that into closer or

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.580 
inevitability of that into closer or
longer<00:05:46.430> games<00:05:46.699> so<00:05:47.000> when<00:05:47.210> you<00:05:47.330> take<00:05:47.539> a<00:05:47.750> hyper

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
longer games so when you take a hyper

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.800 
longer games so when you take a hyper
carry<00:05:48.860> champion<00:05:49.490> instead<00:05:50.090> of<00:05:50.240> being<00:05:50.419> like<00:05:50.630> I

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
carry champion instead of being like I

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.360 
carry champion instead of being like I
know<00:05:50.870> I'll<00:05:51.169> get<00:05:51.349> to<00:05:51.500> this<00:05:51.620> point<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.070> then<00:05:52.250> I

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
know I'll get to this point and then I

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.820 
know I'll get to this point and then I
will<00:05:52.520> dominate<00:05:52.940> you<00:05:53.419> go<00:05:53.599> if<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.349> game<00:05:54.530> gets<00:05:54.680> to

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
will dominate you go if the game gets to

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.560 
will dominate you go if the game gets to
this<00:05:54.919> point<00:05:55.190> I<00:05:55.400> know<00:05:55.550> I'll<00:05:55.880> be<00:05:55.909> stronger<00:05:56.539> so

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
this point I know I'll be stronger so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.870 
this point I know I'll be stronger so
I'm<00:05:56.810> kind<00:05:57.080> of<00:05:57.169> betting<00:05:57.770> on<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.010> long<00:05:58.250> game<00:05:58.490> this

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
I'm kind of betting on a long game this

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.279 
I'm kind of betting on a long game this

that different game length we'll be
