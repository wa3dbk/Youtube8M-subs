hello<00:00:08.550> everyone<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.540> normal<00:00:09.900> here<00:00:10.110> for

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hello everyone this is normal here for

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.200 
hello everyone this is normal here for
technique<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.340> video<00:00:11.639> we'll<00:00:11.790> test<00:00:12.000> out

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
technique in this video we'll test out

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.940 
technique in this video we'll test out
the<00:00:12.360> gaming<00:00:12.660> performance<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> lenovo

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the gaming performance of the lenovo

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.939 
the gaming performance of the lenovo
a6000<00:00:14.790> plus<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:16.199> already<00:00:16.289> done<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
a6000 plus so we have already done the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
a6000 plus so we have already done the
gaming<00:00:17.250> performance<00:00:17.430> test<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> a6000

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
gaming performance test on the a6000

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470 
gaming performance test on the a6000
which<00:00:19.350> came<00:00:19.619> with<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:20.010> gigabyte<00:00:20.160> ram<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
which came with one gigabyte ram and a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
which came with one gigabyte ram and a
petabyte<00:00:21.840> internal<00:00:22.410> storage<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.519> has

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
petabyte internal storage so this has

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
petabyte internal storage so this has
two<00:00:24.150> gigabyte<00:00:24.570> ram<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.080> 16<00:00:25.529> gigabyte

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
two gigabyte ram and a 16 gigabyte

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
two gigabyte ram and a 16 gigabyte
internal<00:00:26.160> storage<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.510> makes<00:00:27.930> much

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
internal storage so this makes much

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.009 
internal storage so this makes much
better<00:00:28.529> value<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:29.010> money<00:00:29.340> than<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.150> a6000

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
better value for money than the a6000

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.889 
better value for money than the a6000
so<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> ram<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:33.239> angry<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so here the ram is also angry so the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
so here the ram is also angry so the
gaming<00:00:34.170> performance<00:00:34.380> should<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:34.890> obviously

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
gaming performance should be obviously

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850 
gaming performance should be obviously
better<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:36.180> has<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> 5<00:00:36.719> inch<00:00:36.930> HD<00:00:37.079> display<00:00:37.320> rust

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
better this has a 5 inch HD display rust

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650 
better this has a 5 inch HD display rust
all<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> specs<00:00:38.700> remain<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> same<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
all the specs remain the same and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200 
all the specs remain the same and
compared<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.920> a6000<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.850> let's<00:00:42.059> get

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
compared to the a6000 so let's get

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.940 
compared to the a6000 so let's get
started<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> gaming<00:00:43.170> performance<00:00:43.350> or

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
started with the gaming performance or

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
started with the gaming performance or
test<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.789> we'll<00:00:44.910> play<00:00:45.090> three<00:00:45.270> games<00:00:45.600> asphalt<00:00:46.140> 8

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
test so we'll play three games asphalt 8

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
test so we'll play three games asphalt 8
airborne<00:00:46.500> Riptide<00:00:47.160> gp2<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.910> Real<00:00:48.480> Racing<00:00:48.719> 3

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
airborne Riptide gp2 and Real Racing 3

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
airborne Riptide gp2 and Real Racing 3
so<00:00:49.559> let's<00:00:49.739> start<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.129> Riptide<00:00:50.760> gp2

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.570 

we're<00:01:49.030> playing<00:01:49.360> and<00:01:49.660> rigidity<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:51.400> hear

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
we're playing and rigidity and I hear

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.150 
we're playing and rigidity and I hear
the<00:01:51.640> performance<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.420> pre<00:01:52.960> okay<00:01:53.290> are<00:01:53.830> not

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
the performance with pre okay are not

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.450 
the performance with pre okay are not
really<00:01:54.580> shoes<00:01:54.850> no<00:01:55.210> like<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.750> all<00:01:56.220> claims<00:01:57.220> of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
really shoes no like the all claims of

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.710 
really shoes no like the all claims of
happening<00:01:57.910> so<00:01:58.330> this<00:01:59.020> looks<00:01:59.260> pretty<00:01:59.500> good<00:02:00.720> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
happening so this looks pretty good the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.570 
happening so this looks pretty good the
beam<00:02:01.900> angles<00:02:02.320> are<00:02:02.440> also<00:02:02.590> good<00:02:02.950> are<00:02:03.190> on<00:02:03.430> the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
beam angles are also good are on the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.860 
beam angles are also good are on the
display<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.700> best<00:02:06.910> response<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.570> again

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
display the best response is again

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.059 
display the best response is again
pretty<00:02:08.170> good

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.390 

this<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.269> not<00:02:13.450> bragging<00:02:13.870> or<00:02:14.129> 400-foot<00:02:15.129> and

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
this is not bragging or 400-foot and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.789 
this is not bragging or 400-foot and
thoughtful<00:02:15.970> person<00:02:16.180> because<00:02:17.079> it<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.349> about<00:02:17.620> my

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
thoughtful person because it is about my

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.809 
thoughtful person because it is about my
drum<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:20.200> sound<00:02:20.439> output<00:02:20.680> from<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> speaker

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
drum the sound output from the speaker

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:35.290 
drum the sound output from the speaker
is<00:02:22.030> also<00:02:22.180> very<00:02:22.540> good

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.120 

so<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.569> are<00:02:36.780> playing<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.230> asphalt<00:02:37.950> 8

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
so now we are playing a asphalt 8

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.220 
so now we are playing a asphalt 8
airborne<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.240> highly<00:02:39.630> graphic<00:02:40.050> rich

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
airborne this is a highly graphic rich

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
airborne this is a highly graphic rich
game<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:40.860> are<00:02:40.950> said<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.160> graphic<00:02:41.910> quality

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
game and we are said the graphic quality

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.280 
game and we are said the graphic quality
are<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> highest<00:02:43.380> possible<00:02:45.020> so<00:02:46.020> we<00:02:46.200> are

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
are to the highest possible so we are

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
are to the highest possible so we are
running<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.740> full<00:02:47.010> graphic

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.970 

so<00:03:06.360> here<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> performance<00:03:07.379> looks<00:03:07.680> pretty

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
so here the performance looks pretty

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.190 
so here the performance looks pretty
decent<00:03:08.190> although<00:03:09.120> there<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.480> slight<00:03:09.840> frame

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
decent although there is slight frame

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.280 
decent although there is slight frame
drop<00:03:10.470> happening<00:03:10.890> here<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.580> there<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
drop happening here and there the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.229 
drop happening here and there the
overall<00:03:13.410> performance<00:03:13.800> looks<00:03:14.430> pleased<00:03:15.000> smooth

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
overall performance looks pleased smooth

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.150 
overall performance looks pleased smooth
no<00:03:16.080> lag<00:03:19.610> and<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:21.230> rendering<00:03:22.230> also<00:03:22.890> looks

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
no lag and the rendering also looks

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.410 
no lag and the rendering also looks
pretty<00:03:23.489> good<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:26.190> display<00:03:26.519> is<00:03:26.580> not<00:03:26.790> really<00:03:27.209> as

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
pretty good the display is not really as

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.930 
pretty good the display is not really as
vibrant<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.319> a7000<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.610> it's<00:03:29.730> still

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
vibrant as the a7000 but it's still

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:37.369 
vibrant as the a7000 but it's still
pretty<00:03:30.120> good<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:36.209> touch<00:03:36.360> response<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.080> also

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
pretty good the touch response is also

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.449 
pretty good the touch response is also
pretty<00:03:37.739> good<00:03:37.830> on<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.790> device<00:03:39.980> so<00:03:40.980> overall<00:03:41.250> ah

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
pretty good on this device so overall ah

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.610 
pretty good on this device so overall ah
we<00:03:41.730> don't<00:03:41.910> really<00:03:42.239> see<00:03:42.540> any<00:03:42.690> issues<00:03:43.110> with<00:03:43.410> the

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
we don't really see any issues with the

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.650 
we don't really see any issues with the
asphalt<00:03:44.340> 8<00:03:44.610> airborne<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.810> device<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:47.660> it

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
asphalt 8 airborne on this device and it

00:03:48.660 --> 00:04:30.280 
asphalt 8 airborne on this device and it
works<00:03:48.930> pretty<00:03:49.769> good<00:03:49.890> on<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:51.030> a6000<00:03:51.900> plus

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:46.110 

so<00:04:30.860> now<00:04:31.040> we're<00:04:31.220> playing<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.670> real<00:04:31.910> recently

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.240 

so<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:46.780> here<00:04:47.020> in<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.530> performance<00:04:48.040> will

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
so we here in the performance will

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:57.930 
so we here in the performance will
spread<00:04:48.550> smooth

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.050 

so<00:04:58.450> other<00:04:58.630> quality<00:04:59.320> looks<00:04:59.620> like<00:05:00.340> clean<00:05:00.700> new

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
so other quality looks like clean new

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:19.840 
so other quality looks like clean new
shoes<00:05:01.450> with<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.200> gameplay

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.720 

the<00:05:20.510> quality<00:05:20.900> of<00:05:20.930> graphics<00:05:21.470> also<00:05:22.190> looks

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
the quality of graphics also looks

00:05:22.730 --> 00:06:12.590 
the quality of graphics also looks
pretty<00:05:23.030> good

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.420 

so<00:06:13.600> that<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.170> gaming<00:06:14.470> performance<00:06:14.680> test

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
so that is the gaming performance test

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.600 
so that is the gaming performance test
on<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:16.060> lenovo<00:06:16.230> a6000<00:06:17.230> plus<00:06:17.440> level<00:06:17.740> it's<00:06:18.520> a

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
on the lenovo a6000 plus level it's a

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.220 
on the lenovo a6000 plus level it's a
pretty<00:06:18.730> good<00:06:18.970> device<00:06:19.240> for<00:06:19.270> gaming<00:06:19.840> there<00:06:20.080> is

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
pretty good device for gaming there is

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.100 
pretty good device for gaming there is
good<00:06:20.440> enough<00:06:20.680> lamb<00:06:21.520> available<00:06:22.180> when<00:06:22.780> playing

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
good enough lamb available when playing

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.260 
good enough lamb available when playing
games<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:23.770> there's<00:06:24.340> no<00:06:24.460> lag<00:06:24.700> or<00:06:24.940> issues

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
games and there's no lag or issues

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.190 
games and there's no lag or issues
happening

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
happening

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.750 
happening
but<00:06:26.560> having<00:06:26.830> said<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.610> over

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
but having said that the over

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.440 
but having said that the over
performance<00:06:28.560> isn't<00:06:29.560> as<00:06:30.190> good<00:06:30.880> as<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.270> ACE

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
performance isn't as good as the ACE

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.020 
performance isn't as good as the ACE
7000<00:06:32.260> probably<00:06:32.890> because<00:06:33.130> of<00:06:33.160> two<00:06:33.460> reasons<00:06:33.490> the

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
7000 probably because of two reasons the

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.780 
7000 probably because of two reasons the

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
mediatek octa-core chipset does perform

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.720 
mediatek octa-core chipset does perform
pretty<00:06:36.970> well<00:06:37.060> and<00:06:37.470> I<00:06:38.470> would<00:06:39.220> say<00:06:39.520> this

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:39.730 
pretty well and I would say this

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.850 
pretty well and I would say this
outperforms<00:06:40.510> the<00:06:40.570> same<00:06:40.870> dragon<00:06:41.230> foot<00:06:41.470> and<00:06:41.680> I

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
outperforms the same dragon foot and I

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.290 
outperforms the same dragon foot and I
in<00:06:42.220> terms<00:06:42.400> of<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.670> overall<00:06:42.760> gaming

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
in terms of the overall gaming

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.650 
in terms of the overall gaming
experience<00:06:43.810> and<00:06:43.990> also<00:06:44.140> 5.5<00:06:45.040> inch<00:06:45.280> of<00:06:45.660> display

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.210 
experience and also 5.5 inch of display
on<00:06:47.260> this<00:06:47.970> 7000<00:06:48.970> makes<00:06:49.510> much<00:06:49.840> better<00:06:50.220> device

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.220 
on this 7000 makes much better device

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.830 
on this 7000 makes much better device
for<00:06:51.550> gaming<00:06:51.880> because<00:06:52.000> it's<00:06:52.300> a<00:06:52.390> bigger<00:06:52.600> display

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
for gaming because it's a bigger display

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.930 
for gaming because it's a bigger display
and<00:06:53.230> the<00:06:53.680> display<00:06:54.040> is<00:06:54.100> also<00:06:54.280> pretty<00:06:54.670> vibrant

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
and the display is also pretty vibrant

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.830 
and the display is also pretty vibrant
and<00:06:55.480> the<00:06:55.840> brightness<00:06:56.080> levels<00:06:56.620> are<00:06:56.800> higher<00:06:57.010> on

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
and the brightness levels are higher on

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.840 
and the brightness levels are higher on
the<00:06:58.840> a<00:06:58.870> 7000<00:06:59.650> but<00:06:59.770> having<00:07:00.040> said<00:07:00.250> that<00:07:00.280> this

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
the a 7000 but having said that this

the a 7000 but having said that this
device<00:07:01.120> is<00:07:01.360> also<00:07:01.510> pretty<00:07:01.750> good<00:07:01.990> for<00:07:02.200> gaming

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
device is also pretty good for gaming

now a lot of users might be interested
in<00:07:13.990> knowing<00:07:14.200> the<00:07:14.350> the<00:07:14.950> heating<00:07:15.580> on<00:07:15.730> this

device it does get a bomb here on the
top<00:07:18.970> portion<00:07:19.180> it<00:07:19.450> does<00:07:19.600> get<00:07:19.840> from<00:07:20.050> be<00:07:20.230> played

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
top portion it does get from be played

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.320 
top portion it does get from be played
for<00:07:20.650> around<00:07:20.890> that<00:07:21.100> we<00:07:21.280> need<00:07:21.460> 2<00:07:21.640> to<00:07:21.760> 30<00:07:21.940> minutes

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
for around that we need 2 to 30 minutes

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.480 
for around that we need 2 to 30 minutes
and<00:07:22.540> it<00:07:22.750> does<00:07:22.900> get<00:07:23.110> one<00:07:23.320> but<00:07:23.770> if<00:07:23.920> the<00:07:24.190> heating

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:24.490 
and it does get one but if the heating

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.240 
and it does get one but if the heating
isn't<00:07:24.910> really<00:07:25.690> into<00:07:26.020> very<00:07:26.440> high<00:07:26.710> levels<00:07:27.130> but

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
isn't really into very high levels but

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.850 
isn't really into very high levels but
it's<00:07:27.520> like<00:07:28.300> heating<00:07:28.720> so<00:07:28.900> that<00:07:29.110> doesn't<00:07:29.290> really

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:29.860 
it's like heating so that doesn't really

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.240 
it's like heating so that doesn't really
make<00:07:30.520> a<00:07:30.550> big<00:07:30.820> issue<00:07:31.290> again<00:07:32.290> the<00:07:32.620> display<00:07:32.980> is

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
make a big issue again the display is

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.780 
make a big issue again the display is
also<00:07:33.460> slightly<00:07:33.940> warm<00:07:34.480> but<00:07:35.110> not<00:07:35.350> really<00:07:35.830> of<00:07:36.280> a

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790 
also slightly warm but not really of a

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.260 
also slightly warm but not really of a
very<00:07:37.270> high<00:07:37.480> temperature<00:07:37.720> so<00:07:38.590> that's<00:07:39.270> pretty

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.270 
very high temperature so that's pretty

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.200 
very high temperature so that's pretty
good<00:07:41.020> from<00:07:41.440> lenovo<00:07:41.890> as<00:07:42.070> well<00:07:42.310> so<00:07:42.730> that<00:07:42.970> is<00:07:43.090> the
