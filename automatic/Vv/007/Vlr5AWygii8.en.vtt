hey guys we're taking a look at my
galaxy<00:00:02.040> /<00:00:02.190> photon<00:00:02.790> deck<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.410> they<00:00:04.410> just

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
galaxy / photon deck today they just

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.320 
galaxy / photon deck today they just
kind<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.770> go<00:00:04.920> together<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.580> kind<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.879> could

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
kind of go together so you kind of could

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.730 
kind of go together so you kind of could
refer<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.660> them<00:00:06.779> as<00:00:06.810> one<00:00:07.020> archetype<00:00:07.410> if<00:00:07.620> you

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
refer to them as one archetype if you

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.680 
refer to them as one archetype if you
want<00:00:07.950> but<00:00:08.519> they<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:08.790> separate<00:00:09.179> cards<00:00:09.510> that

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
want but they have separate cards that

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.770 
want but they have separate cards that
work<00:00:09.840> together<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:12.150> deck<00:00:12.330> type<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
work together the deck type can be a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.970 
work together the deck type can be a
little<00:00:12.900> hard<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> explain<00:00:13.410> because<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.860> does

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
little hard to explain because it does

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
little hard to explain because it does
different<00:00:14.280> things<00:00:14.370> it's<00:00:15.150> worms<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.929> summons

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
different things it's worms it summons

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340 
different things it's worms it summons
from<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> graveyard<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:17.400> has<00:00:17.850> anti<00:00:18.240> XYZ<00:00:18.900> it

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
from the graveyard it has anti XYZ it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.679 
from the graveyard it has anti XYZ it
can<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> lot<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.279> XYZ<00:00:20.670> on<00:00:20.970> its<00:00:21.119> own<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.600> can

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
can do a lot of XYZ on its own so it can

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.269 
can do a lot of XYZ on its own so it can
do<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> lot<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.020> different<00:00:22.050> things<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:23.100> mainly

it's overpowering your opponent and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.849 
it's overpowering your opponent and
really<00:00:25.920> annoying<00:00:26.189> their<00:00:26.430> XYZ's<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> first<00:00:28.680> off

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
really annoying their XYZ's so first off

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.130 
really annoying their XYZ's so first off
we<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.400> galaxy<00:00:29.880> wizard<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.869> card's

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
we have a galaxy wizard so this card's

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.510 
we have a galaxy wizard so this card's
really<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.560> obviously<00:00:31.800> at<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> decent

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
really good obviously at a decent

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.360 
really good obviously at a decent
defense<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:34.140> allows<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.980> match<00:00:35.160> up

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
defense but it allows you to match up

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
eight stars and get eight star XYZ's out

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.330 
eight stars and get eight star XYZ's out
really<00:00:39.210> easily<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:40.110> galaxy<00:00:40.590> cards<00:00:40.890> which

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
really easily and get galaxy cards which

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
really easily and get galaxy cards which
is<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.670> nice<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> searcher<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.899> has<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
is really nice a searcher that has the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
is really nice a searcher that has the
ability<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.559> become<00:00:44.550> eight<00:00:44.910> stars<00:00:45.239> really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
ability to become eight stars really

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.760 
ability to become eight stars really
crazy<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.550> galaxy-eyes<00:00:48.030> photon<00:00:48.149> dragon

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
crazy and then galaxy-eyes photon dragon

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.889 
crazy and then galaxy-eyes photon dragon
everybody<00:00:49.770> pretty<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.039> knows<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.489> guy

special summon ability can be pretty
nice<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:03.210> you're<00:01:03.390> using<00:01:03.809> things<00:01:04.140> from

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
nice because you're using things from

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670 
nice because you're using things from
the<00:01:04.439> graveyard<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:06.500> then<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.590> have

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the graveyard as well and then we have

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
the graveyard as well and then we have
photon<00:01:08.010> Thrasher<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> like

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
photon Thrasher so it's kind of like

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120 
photon Thrasher so it's kind of like
cyber<00:01:09.630> dragon<00:01:10.140> special<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.010> when

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
cyber dragon special some of them when

you don't have any monsters but the
problem<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.439> guy<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.070> he<00:01:14.280> can't

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
problem with this guy is that he can't

be using them as a strong attacker but
also<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.540> four<00:01:18.780> star<00:01:19.159> XYZ's<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.759> easily

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
also for four star XYZ's really easily

vein a strong attacker with a obvious
bad<00:01:26.580> effect<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.119> he<00:01:27.210> has<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.420> switch<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bad effect that he has to switch to

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
bad effect that he has to switch to
defense<00:01:27.930> mode<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.430> use<00:01:29.460> them

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
defense mode again you can use them

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.770 
defense mode again you can use them
easily<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.450> four<00:01:30.780> star<00:01:30.990> XYZ's<00:01:32.390> then<00:01:33.390> galaxy

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
easily for four star XYZ's then galaxy

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.149 
easily for four star XYZ's then galaxy
night<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> other<00:01:34.229> eight<00:01:34.590> star<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> you'll

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
useful to special summon for stars so uh

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.890 
useful to special summon for stars so uh
you<00:06:20.550> know<00:06:20.640> again<00:06:20.940> something<00:06:21.450> that<00:06:21.570> I'm<00:06:21.720> not

currently running I'm focusing more on

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.040 
currently running I'm focusing more on
the<00:06:23.550> eight<00:06:23.700> stars<00:06:24.000> but<00:06:24.300> can<00:06:24.630> be<00:06:24.780> very<00:06:24.990> useful
