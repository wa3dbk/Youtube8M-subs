00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 and the boys do not answer from mainquÃ© 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.609
 we were in a tutorial as always 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.750
 Sir 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.120
 this time we will be buying from that side 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.120
 to make permanent objects yes sir 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 it's a very cool thing 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.939
 that was basically from this 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.610
 let's start 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.309
 have a plan with the gentlemen horses 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.329
 here looking at me as a culture it's worth not 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.309
 then nothing that are objects 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.770
 permanent gentlemen because these objects 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 that you see here as you see in people 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.860
 another but you can catch but they do not 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.129
 you can see - I get up people 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 it goes up on our servers not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
 they will be able to take the same favor 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.809
 I want to catch it because I was able to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.329
 dammit 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.990
 together to do this is something quite 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.130
 simple 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 this is the like of the lie to pick up a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.220
 object 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.250
 then nothing like we have done this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.869
 well here we have our Lord command 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.689
 logically, you do not have to eat 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.720
 blogs but in this case I have five more 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.329
 then fixed here we have a sumo of 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.810
 an object is worth in this case its currency a 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.640
 ax a silver iron ax as 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.780
 what brings them to the top nothing more than 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.100
 nea or a silver act with 1 and the peak 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.450
 of lay that we have here I'm going to 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.310
 leave the same right playing the team of 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.270
 video is set to 100 what do you want 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.429
 say this 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.709
 this is set to 100 and sly and they're 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.720
 100,000 positions will therefore take 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:51.759
 in 100 thousand to catch but from what 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.390
 time starts telling this if this 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.830
 is at 100 when I give here to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.539
 put it here this as you see new 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.970
 take for this position the and in certain 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.890
 but when they pass the 100 tickets worth 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.049
 once they pass the 200 six that is not 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.909
 mind how many seconds are already 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.709
 you can take the object as you can see 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.690
 nothing behind bet in 100,000 so 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.620
 so much will take a lot then what 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.430
 I'm going to put in a million 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.489
 Logically, it will be impossible for 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.440
 someone can come and take it then 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.879
 nothing this is all you have the command of 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.650
 description of the video you have to 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.049
 leave so I'll leave it with time 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.050
 logically you make him more like 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.540
 right now we can put 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.520
 a rabbit of numbers we give him has done 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.950
 we put the block petals for a 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.180
 button or what you want logically is the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.370
 milk you see 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.800
 these face this is how you start it 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.260
 you believe in your mind again 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.260
 please here nothing 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.710
 here you have command function from 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.510
 the nap soft stool of the 1.8 now 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.900
 I'll even see you in another video more 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.900
 wave
