00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
back from the previous game just based

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.880 
back from the previous game just based
off<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.509> footage<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.409> also<00:01:16.560> show

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
off this footage and they also show

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
off this footage and they also show
briefly<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.460> piece<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> his<00:01:18.030> character<00:01:18.420> art<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
briefly a piece of his character art and

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.870 
briefly a piece of his character art and
design<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> looks<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.310> different<00:01:20.369> than

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
design but it looks a lot different than

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.719 
design but it looks a lot different than
how<00:01:21.030> Glacia<00:01:21.509> appears<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.979> trailer<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
how Glacia appears in the trailer that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.370

was first released for killer instinct

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.690 
was first released for killer instinct

potential<00:01:33.119> tag<00:01:33.450> team<00:01:33.780> being<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> game

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
potential tag team being in the game

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
potential tag team being in the game
this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.640> not<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.689> on

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
this is actually not what is going on

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.030 
this is actually not what is going on
within<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.259> couple<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.619> these<00:01:37.799> different

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
within a couple of these different

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.039 
within a couple of these different
segments<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.060> different<00:01:39.540> like

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
segments you see these different like

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.920 
segments you see these different like
life<00:01:40.380> bars<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:41.070> some<00:01:41.490> some<00:01:41.820> extra<00:01:42.210> text<00:01:42.600> above

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
life bars or some some extra text above

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.960 
life bars or some some extra text above
the<00:01:43.140> characters<00:01:43.530> help<00:01:43.799> energy<00:01:44.189> bars<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the characters help energy bars this is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.960 
the characters help energy bars this is
actually<00:01:45.360> placeholders<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:47.280> gamertag

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
actually placeholders for like gamertag

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually placeholders for like gamertag
icons<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.720> things<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.200> most<00:01:49.680> likely

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
icons and things like that most likely

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.280 
icons and things like that most likely
that's<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.030> guessing<00:01:51.270> we<00:01:51.869> finally<00:01:52.110> got

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that's what I'm guessing we finally got

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050 
that's what I'm guessing we finally got
to<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> new<00:01:52.860> stage<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.189> holy<00:01:53.670> crap

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to see a new stage in holy crap

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
to see a new stage in holy crap
sabrewulf<00:01:54.810> stage<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.470> least<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.950> I'm

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
sabrewulf stage at least that's what I'm

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.310 
sabrewulf stage at least that's what I'm
guessing<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.670> looks<00:01:57.060> freaking<00:01:57.750> awesome

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
guessing it is looks freaking awesome

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.940 
guessing it is looks freaking awesome
it's<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> motif<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.369> like<00:02:00.020> 1922<00:02:01.020> 1930s

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
as well you might have noticed in the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.310 
as well you might have noticed in the
previous<00:02:30.910> videos<00:02:31.300> saber<00:02:31.660> wolves<00:02:31.960> cloth

mode<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:37.870> blue<00:02:38.320> so<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.830> seems<00:02:39.040> that

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
mode but now it's blue so it seems that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.100 
mode but now it's blue so it seems that
they<00:02:39.520> are<00:02:39.760> changing<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.420> little<00:02:40.600> bit<00:02:40.750> of<00:02:40.930> things

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
they are changing a little bit of things

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.140 
they are changing a little bit of things
this<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.709> probably<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> most<00:02:42.190> remedial<00:02:42.910> of

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
this is probably the most remedial of

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.630 
this is probably the most remedial of
all<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.959> changes<00:02:44.410> in<00:02:44.440> so<00:02:44.800> minor<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.400> it's

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
all the changes in so minor but it's

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.040 
all the changes in so minor but it's
interesting<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.360> they're<00:02:46.570> actually<00:02:46.870> going

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
interesting that they're actually going

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.110 
interesting that they're actually going
about<00:02:47.320> looking<00:02:47.800> at<00:02:47.920> small<00:02:48.190> adjustments<00:02:48.970> like

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
about looking at small adjustments like

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.750 
about looking at small adjustments like
this<00:02:49.390> throughout<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.840> cast<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.500> finally<00:02:51.130> one

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
this throughout the cast and finally one

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.920 
this throughout the cast and finally one
thing<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.209> I<00:02:52.239> actually<00:02:52.570> knew<00:02:52.900> about

thing that I actually knew about

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.660 
thing that I actually knew about
personally<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:53.890> didn't<00:02:54.160> get<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> hear
