00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello again sure you have seen in 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.930
 many blogs velvet manicures 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.830
 Today we are going to show you how 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.830
 you will see how easy 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.059
 the plush velvet manicure is 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.650
 very simple to do perhaps the most 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.020
 complicated is finding the materials 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.029
 you can find it online in stores 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.529
 specialized for nail art 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.450
 we will need the velvet powder 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:32.020
 some tweezers and a pincelito to eliminate 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:35.260
 to remove the remains and then a color 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.620
 similar to the one you have chosen from 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.500
 stuffed or velvet and we're going to do 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.210
 a little detail with a brush also the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.469
 now you will see it 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.469
 we paint the nail 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 and then we throw the velvet 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.179
 over 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179
 the powder 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.990
 do not worry if I know by the sides 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.940
 we have put a sheet to collect 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.940
 after and not waste anything 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.620
 now we leave it like that for a little while until 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.650
 go dry the enamel 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.159
 we remove the excess 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.380
 and the shape of the enamel will remain 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.939
 and it stays perfect and now I'm going to 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.420
 draw a little detail on the ring finger 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.200
 of sake of valentine and you can 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.750
 imagine what is going to be 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.190
 we make a heart 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.190
 with abundant 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.340
 nail polish 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.420
 and do not let it dry 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.420
 and we throw a little velvet 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.680
 we 'll leave it for a while and then we'll 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.980
 we give with the brush to remove the 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 surplus 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 I'm going to give you some advice that should 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.710
 follow if you do not want them to spoil the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.850
 manicure not women if you need 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.850
