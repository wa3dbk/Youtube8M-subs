g-string and slide it out say anything
with<00:04:24.140> a<00:04:24.200> harmony<00:04:24.650> it'll<00:04:24.830> be<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:28.610> for<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.090> lead

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
with a harmony it'll be so for the lead

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.490 
with a harmony it'll be so for the lead
part<00:04:29.480> in<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.600> course<00:04:29.840> it's<00:04:30.020> pretty<00:04:30.260> much<00:04:30.350> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
part in the course it's pretty much the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.810 
part in the course it's pretty much the
same<00:04:30.680> except<00:04:31.040> for<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.250> ending<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:31.610> let<00:04:31.730> me

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
same except for the ending so let me

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:45.650 
same except for the ending so let me
just<00:04:31.970> show<00:04:32.090> you<00:04:32.150> how<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.330> last<00:04:33.020> part<00:04:33.350> goes

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.330 

so<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.350> pretty<00:04:46.470> much<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.740> same<00:04:46.920> thing<00:04:47.190> as

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
so it's pretty much the same thing as

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.890 
so it's pretty much the same thing as
