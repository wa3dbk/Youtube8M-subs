00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 good kids joan try we are here 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.279
 in a new video and well then this time 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.629
 it's about final fantasy 15 has come out 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.660
 the demo you already know how good 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.790
 you bought the remastering that has 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.049
 come out of the final fantasy type-0 they gave you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.389
 a beta of what will be the end 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.100
 fantasy 15 and good then in final fantasy 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 15 I think it's something at the end of this year 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.960
 or if I'm not mistaken, it has already passed to 2016 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 so there's still a lot left but the beta 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.449
 we have been able to try it and I want 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 comment a little over the game 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 a kind of analysis is worth his opinion 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.240
 so that you can see a little bit of what is going to 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.160
 game and it's already so good 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.420
 basically those who know what is going 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 at the end of fantasy is not that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 you need a lot of explanation those who do not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 you know it is a role play though 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.750
 what are you going to see the images it is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.760
 a little different from what was final 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 previously good fantasy what usually 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.899
 being is a game that good not always 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 ok because for example the 12 also 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 it was a little like this time but good 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 it's a role-playing game that took turns 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.789
 some games because he has gotten some 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 modification that no longer takes turns 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.989
 but you are the one who can 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.730
 dodge attack and all that then 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 well in this game what they have 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.480
 fact is the modification is that I 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.300
 I think it's going to be good for the game 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.760
 much more since then the system of 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.170
 combat is more attractive in sight no 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 I say it's better because me too 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 I really like turn-based combat 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.860
 but people avoid people who have moped 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 the game people who have never played 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.920
 final fantasy that has always been 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.450
 seen the final fantasy have not 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.550
 attracted because it is a turn-based combat 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.040
 such and such and well then if you are not much 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.570
 of playing role play do not attract you to the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.940
 However, this final 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.160
 fantasy is a final fantasy that is going to 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.780
 like a lot of people at least 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.400
 view is then worth playing as it can 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 that get hooked maybe that's not what 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
 we know but I have many friends who 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.370
 they have seen it and have said that this final 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.250
 fantasy is handsome maybe I bought it 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.750
 I'm going to try it like that and never have 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.460
 imagined that they had to leave 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.260
 to buy a final fantasy, this is not 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 good at that point to sell sure that 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.400
 will sell quite a lot and that will bring 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.830
 much more public than the others 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.420
 final fantasy now not everything is good 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.550
 It also has some little things that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.410
 let's see that I do not know if they will be good or 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.270
 bad and such that good for now 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.520
 like in the beta I can not judge either 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.679
 but I can give you a little bit my opinion 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 In the background you will have several clips of 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.570
 video of what's good so I played 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.950
 a little better what I first 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.050
 seen that it has not convinced me at all 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.640
 is that there are very few animals of 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.770
 variety I mean or there are animals there 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.990
 many but the dogs are after 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.570
 are those big there with a lot of 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.190
 hair and little more or I hope it is 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.530
 because in the beta that are the ones 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.230
 three types of monsters but let's go 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.420
 basically I define faults printing 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.520
 that I'm used to in 30 40 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.650
 meters and there are already different animals there 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.600
 It's like there is a lot a lot of life in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.960
 what is the world the grass is very 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.760
 Nice it looks all beautiful but there's only 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.650
 23 types of animals that I have seen 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.000
 so then that is something that would molarÃ­a 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.160
 to improve or give me more 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.630
 variety I guess as I said it will be 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 because in the beta and they have not wanted either 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.670
 put a lot of stuff and then another little thing 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.920
 that I have seen is that give a drop of 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.270
 very large frames that you mean 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.040
 that basically you're playing 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.710
 the goal and hit like that starts to 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.600
 slow down or things like that of that kind do not 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.460
 then that's for sure it's because in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.780
 the beta the final version nothing happens 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.980
 at least it would be very rare that 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.040
 pass 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.140
 then the demo would highlight its 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.620
 barrel sometimes but not jerks there a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.090
 weird relationship with frames but good yo 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.680
 I guess that has nothing to do 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.060
 with what will be the final game after 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.379
 of the little things so different that I've 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.269
 seen is that well, the uncle when 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.830
 run is a bit when you drop a few 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.720
 meters gets tired not that that's something that 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.330
 the truth is that we are not going to 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.370
 too much because it gives you impotence of not 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.140
 can go faster and good after 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.540
 seen that as level rises only 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.890
 when you sleep that is something I'm not going to 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.079
 say neither what is good nor is it bad because 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.629
 the truth is that right now I do not know no 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.370
 I would know what to think about that but good you 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.650
 struggles such and when you go back to a place 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.150
 rest to sleep you get the levels 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.620
 the skills you have acquired and everything 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.819
 that's good let's leave it in different 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.410
 I'm not going to say it 's good or 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.450
 bad after apart from those little ones 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.829
 little things the game the truth is that I 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.959
 love the combat system is 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.390
 pretty funny entertaining has 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.769
 it 's with the square I'm going to talk to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.019
 the control of the play is worth simply if 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.879
 I'm from xbox because it would be the same with 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.440
 with the xbox buttons with the square 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.419
 you do normal attacks you keep it 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.430
 pulsed was hitting there is also a button 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.650
 to dodge a button to block and 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.030
 so and well then we would have the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.860
 triangle that you place 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.690
 serves to make as super attack is 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.420
 magic power as you want to call it at 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.430
 which then removes an attack with a sword or 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.700
 a spear what an attack is made 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.770
 let's say better than the normal attack is worth 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.090
 a special attack we would say later then 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.260
 the rest will also love me as 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.480
 I always like the final fantasy 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.130
 they have a lot of options if you do not know 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.770
 how it works because basically it consists 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.150
 in killing bugs raises a basic level 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.830
 history that history what more 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.870
 usually like the final fantasy 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.300
 true the games usually last and in 200 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.730
 at least more hours that is a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.710
 authentic madness and it's a game that does 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.450
 Engage I tell you what are you going 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.100
 make the most of what you have 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.810
 cost the game because they are games that 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.180
 there 's fuck it cost me 70 euros but 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.310
 at least I have been able to throw 200 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.350
 hours you know good because that always 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.580
 has enchanted the final fantasy plus the 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.260
 graphic quality has always been 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.970
 incredible the final fantasy more to the 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.410
 feeling that always more like a 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.330
 generation ahead of the rest of 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.070
 the games and also being so long there 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.870
 I know how they can put so much quality 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.070
 graphic not apart from all this because 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.780
 we can only wait out the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.360
 definitive game and see what and give 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.220
 an opinion there is already power to judge from 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.230
 true not because as I said this in 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.470
 the beta has 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.290
 very beautiful the game looks beautiful 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.610
 is fine or the combat system the 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.880
 story I suppose it will be phenomenal 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.590
 as always but it has some failures 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.260
 as I said there are few animals 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.870
 has a drop of frames that flip 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.210
 once in a while and it looks like it's created 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.790
 and I do not know, there's not much more to say 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.680
 about beta is a game that to me 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.240
 will already like the elephants if they will like it 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.280
 you may like it more or less 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.020
 But that was already seen because neither 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.210
 is that many stories have come out here 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.100
 but we have been able to prove a little the 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.080
 combat system in the beta and you're 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.400
 not so nothing kids because I hope that 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.990
 I liked the opinion a little 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.610
 that the most important thing is that what 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.200
 you can see in the background a little bit you and 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.150
 hey say because I like to hear it 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.430
 me not those who have played it tell me 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.560
 by reviews opinions reviews 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.420
 of the game that you have seen if it has 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.220
 molado that has molado more than you 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.510
 molado less and kids just simply 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.010
 I hope you enjoyed a little 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.840
 with the video that burst with live 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.080
 favorites and until next time 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.080
 goodbye
