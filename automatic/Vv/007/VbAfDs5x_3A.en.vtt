Hi it’s Steve from PartSelect. Today we
are going to show you how to change the timer

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.650
on your washer and it’s a really easy job,
all of we going to need is a ¼ inch nut driver

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.780
and a pair needle nose pliers.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.680
Let me show you how we do it, now before we
begin this repair, the first thing we need

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.650
to do is disconnect the power from the washer,
and then we will pull the washer away from

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.609
the wall about a foot so that we can access
some screws at the back. With our ¼ inch

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.199
nut driver we are going to remove these three
screws that secure the console to the back

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:46.019
panel. Next we will tilt that console forward
and we will just slide it slightly to the

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.320
right and we can lay it down flat.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.120
Next we are going to pull the timer knob out
and then with our needle nose pliers just

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:12.070
going reach in and grab the retaining clip,
pull that off the shaft that hold the knob

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:27.040
in place, remove the knob and the knob skirt,
then we will remove the wire harness from

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:34.409
the timer just lift up the locking tab and
pull straight back on the harness connector,

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:50.460
and then we will remove the single ¼ inch
screw that holds that timer to the console.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.140
Now to remove the timer from the console we
are going to just lift up on it slightly to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.770
the front end and turn it clockwise and then
it will lift right out, there are two little

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.149
retaining tabs that will connect to the backside
of the console, there is also little ridge

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.730
right where that screw fastened on, that we
need to lift up on it so that we can rotate

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.200
it.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.690
We can now discard the old timer, and to install
the new one, we will set that in place, just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.540
have that hole for the screws slightly to
the right where it mounts, and rotate timer

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:45.849
counterclockwise till it snaps into position,
we will reinstall the ¼ inch screw and we

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:58.659
will reinstall the wire harness connector.
Make sure the locking tab engages and we can

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.190
tilt the console up into position and then
we will insert these two tabs into these slotted

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:16.019
openings on the bottom, slide it to the left
and make sure it lines up. Put the holes in

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:24.500
the back guard, we will install those three
screws, make sure that end caps line up flush,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:37.220
and we will tighten those screws and we will
install the knob skirt. It has a little locating

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:47.209
tab on it that will lineup with the slot in
the timer shaft and we will take that retaining

00:03:47.209 --> 00:04:01.030
clip and just slide it partway onto that timer
knob, and then we simply push the knob on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:09.150
to the timer shaft, check the operation of
it we are now ready to reconnect the power

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.720
and our repair is complete. I told you, it
was an easy job, thanks for watching and good

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.689
luck with your repair.
