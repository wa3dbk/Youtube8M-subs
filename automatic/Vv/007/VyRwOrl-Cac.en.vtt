model<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:07.959> freelancer<00:03:08.739> misc<00:03:09.099> or<00:03:09.489> not<00:03:09.879> misc

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
model is the freelancer misc or not misc

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.440 
model is the freelancer misc or not misc
miss<00:03:10.930> m<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.800> missile<00:03:12.400> variant<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.239> I

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
miss m is the missile variant and I

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.170 
miss m is the missile variant and I
don't<00:03:13.660> own<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.319> particular<00:03:15.310> model<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:16.150> i

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
don't own that particular model so i

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.220 
don't own that particular model so i
think<00:03:17.879> well<00:03:18.879> maybe<00:03:18.910> maybe<00:03:19.660> if<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.930> own<00:03:20.049> that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
think well maybe maybe if you own that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.869 
think well maybe maybe if you own that
model<00:03:20.590> you'll<00:03:20.769> get<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.040> display<00:03:21.430> case<00:03:21.700> i

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
model you'll get the display case i

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.070 
model you'll get the display case i
think<00:03:21.910> i<00:03:22.180> think<00:03:22.239> that's<00:03:22.510> because<00:03:22.660> this<00:03:22.930> is

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
think i think that's because this is

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.890 
think i think that's because this is
probably<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.440> bug<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.950> really<00:03:24.640> don't<00:03:24.790> think<00:03:25.150> this

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
probably a bug I really don't think this

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.110 
probably a bug I really don't think this
is<00:03:26.140> our<00:03:26.319> July<00:03:26.680> flare<00:03:27.340> now<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.760> think<00:03:27.849> of<00:03:28.030> it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
is our July flare now that I think of it

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.930 
is our July flare now that I think of it
I<00:03:28.209> think<00:03:28.480> this<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.810> because<00:03:29.319> i<00:03:29.349> own<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.680> star<00:03:30.610> g

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
I think this is because i own a star g

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.479 
I think this is because i own a star g
that<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.870> has<00:03:32.019> shown<00:03:32.290> up<00:03:32.500> but<00:03:32.799> i<00:03:32.980> think<00:03:33.370> it's

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
that this has shown up but i think it's

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.670 
that this has shown up but i think it's
a<00:03:34.090> bug<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:34.780> not<00:03:35.069> supposed<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:36.160> appear<00:03:36.489> yet

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
models I don't know if the damage state

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.260 
models I don't know if the damage state
is<00:04:27.789> part<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:29.460> WY<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.520> integration

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
is part of it that the WY is integration

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.159 
is part of it that the WY is integration
I'm<00:04:32.260> assuming<00:04:33.360> they're<00:04:34.360> going<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:34.599> separate

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
I'm assuming they're going to separate

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.089 
I'm assuming they're going to separate
as<00:04:35.380> much<00:04:35.710> as<00:04:35.889> possible<00:04:36.300> from<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.570> patch<00:04:38.099> to

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
as much as possible from that patch to

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.140 
as much as possible from that patch to
give<00:04:39.340> us<00:04:39.550> in<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.930> one<00:04:41.200> point<00:04:41.470> 1.5<00:04:42.310> patch<00:04:42.639> since

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
give us in the one point 1.5 patch since

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.240 
give us in the one point 1.5 patch since
the<00:04:43.330> FPS<00:04:43.780> module<00:04:44.169> is<00:04:44.229> still<00:04:44.500> not<00:04:44.680> quite<00:04:44.889> ready

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the FPS module is still not quite ready

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.800 
the FPS module is still not quite ready
do<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:45.820> in<00:04:45.880> that<00:04:46.000> code<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:48.510> hopefully<00:04:49.510> we<00:04:49.570> hear

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
do it in that code so hopefully we hear

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.050 
do it in that code so hopefully we hear
something<00:04:50.050> here<00:04:50.530> again<00:04:51.280> as<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.550> said<00:04:51.580> in<00:04:51.849> a<00:04:51.910> week

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
something here again as I said in a week

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.480 
something here again as I said in a week
or<00:04:52.210> two<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:55.410> it's<00:04:56.410> going<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.680> be<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> huge<00:04:57.190> patch

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
or two and it's going to be a huge patch

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.680 
or two and it's going to be a huge patch
they<00:04:57.910> said<00:04:58.090> it's<00:04:58.180> going<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.360> be<00:04:58.450> something

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
they said it's going to be something

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.810 
they said it's going to be something
like<00:04:58.900> twenty<00:04:59.349> five<00:04:59.620> gigabytes<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:00.550> if<00:05:00.669> you're

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
like twenty five gigabytes so if you're

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.570 
like twenty five gigabytes so if you're
on<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.000> connection<00:05:01.930> that's<00:05:02.080> slow<00:05:02.440> or<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:03.130> limited

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
on a connection that's slow or a limited

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.279 
on a connection that's slow or a limited
data<00:05:04.979> cap<00:05:05.979> then<00:05:06.789> probably<00:05:07.660> won't<00:05:07.870> don't<00:05:08.110> want

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
data cap then probably won't don't want

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.620 
data cap then probably won't don't want
to<00:05:08.410> download<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.460> PTU<00:05:09.789> version<00:05:10.210> because<00:05:10.389> it

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
to download the PTU version because it

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.899 
to download the PTU version because it
they<00:05:11.169> said<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.560> will<00:05:11.860> likely<00:05:12.099> change<00:05:12.280> three<00:05:12.820> or

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
they said it will likely change three or

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.070 
they said it will likely change three or
four<00:05:13.030> times<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.419> probably<00:05:13.659> have<00:05:13.780> to<00:05:13.840> download

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
four times you probably have to download

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.999 
four times you probably have to download
that<00:05:14.380> patch<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:14.830> few<00:05:15.159> times

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
that patch a few times

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:18.999 
that patch a few times
before<00:05:16.369> it<00:05:16.490> goes<00:05:16.639> live<00:05:16.939> to<00:05:17.719> the<00:05:17.960> live<00:05:18.379> servers

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
before it goes live to the live servers

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.149 
before it goes live to the live servers
and<00:05:19.629> so<00:05:20.629> you<00:05:21.289> may<00:05:21.439> watch<00:05:21.619> just<00:05:21.740> give<00:05:21.860> it<00:05:21.949> a<00:05:22.009> pass

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
and so you may watch just give it a pass

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.890 
and so you may watch just give it a pass
until<00:05:22.580> then<00:05:22.819> of<00:05:23.029> course<00:05:23.240> i'll<00:05:23.509> be<00:05:23.689> downloading

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
until then of course i'll be downloading

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.829 
until then of course i'll be downloading
