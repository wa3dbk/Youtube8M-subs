 hi everyone, they are zoroark 99 and precisely 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.830
 as read from the title in this tutorial 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.590
 I will show you how to get your pokémon 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.550
 team favorites 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.090

 the two in fact I don't have the games there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 I can swear it's not my little team 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 thus a 1 zoroark of level one hundred 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.940
 the game is Italian is not a Japanese 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.070
 and afterwards you will understand the reason why at 67 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.840
 but this is normal here because I am 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.260
 buried after you found all the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.409
 his essays that the last essay is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.080
 found in the castle buried and you will notice 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.700

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.170

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.860

 room there will be a crown 10 and note 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.810

 connection 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.620
 to do this however you will have to 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:48.549
 need some people because it is not a 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:53.769
 makeup but as you will see you can do ad 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:56.170
 example look for pokémon and click on 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:05.709

 around the world this type of co 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.870
 United States 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.720
 this also prevented this course from 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.260
 to add this brings nigeria e 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.670
 to have these pokémon you will have to see 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.700
 for example zekrom what is level 92 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:42.400
 go to a part below will ask 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.329

 box click on it and make the exchange 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.769
 she looks stupid but I think it's a 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.349
 very useful method because I ad 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:22.539
 example I was lucky because I had 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:24.400

 any level I had that on 10 arc 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:38.169
