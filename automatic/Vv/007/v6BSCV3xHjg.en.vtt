00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
again as as part of the confusion ending

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.560 
again as as part of the confusion ending
so<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.850> see<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:30.330> eventually

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
so we're going to see if they eventually

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.690 
so we're going to see if they eventually
nursultan<00:03:31.530> anywhere<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.070> they<00:03:32.160> decided<00:03:32.489> to

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
nursultan anywhere and they decided to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.759 
nursultan anywhere and they decided to
go<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.060> meaty<00:03:33.269> up<00:03:33.510> perhaps<00:03:34.110> he<00:03:34.320> had<00:03:34.410> simply

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
go to the meaty up perhaps he had simply

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.060 
go to the meaty up perhaps he had simply
missing<00:03:34.980> probably<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:37.680> we're<00:03:37.800> going<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:37.980> look

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
missing probably so we're going to look

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.070 
missing probably so we're going to look
around<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.670> areas<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.660> see<00:03:39.810> if<00:03:39.930> we<00:03:40.019> were

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
