well across much of the mountains and
deserts<00:01:57.689> through<00:01:57.899> Tuesday<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.009> those

deserts through Tuesday but those

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.740 
deserts through Tuesday but those
thunderstorms<00:01:59.670> should<00:02:00.090> bring<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.479> showers

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
thunderstorms should bring some showers

thunderstorms should bring some showers
with<00:02:01.140> them<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:01.799> few<00:02:01.979> dry<00:02:02.369> strikes<00:02:02.759> are

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
with them so very few dry strikes are
