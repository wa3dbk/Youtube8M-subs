00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 what's up youtube and welcome 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.609
 for another comments in one 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.990
 channel renewed with the concerts has a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.179
 gameplays I have just currently playing 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.219
 I have to say that support because 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 Otherwise, the bad copy copies 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 son of a bitch and that's why you're just here 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.730
 a type 95 gebashe goes on the parade 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.960
 already that was waiting because I know 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 that he will come and for that 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.529
 I also directly the Englishman and so 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.180
 The brand continues to collect and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.310
 nice that c4 thrown 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.420
 yes i was a bit mix marx today 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.439
 commentary so a little bit about that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.880
 I have no gameplay and no power 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980
 never told my whole life so 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.329
 are you at the premiere here 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 and a little bit more with that 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.670
 right now just got so straight in one case 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.780
 I just like it somehow like that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.190
 a bit to chatter 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
 just with you and I start too 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 never said hey two premieres and that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 I get away nicely from the hip yes 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.989
 People around you ask yourself permanently in the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.039
 last videos always marcel what the for 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.590
 Camouflage on his type 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.210
 this is the so called party rock 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.469
 So I guess that school zebra will too 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 partly already called and that is 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.840
 now my new brand because i 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 Now again this day run around 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.239
 will 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 for some of you because of that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 maybe from e-commerce because 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.030
 bought this camouflage namely but 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 I got that far, there is one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 a little money for it first time 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.330
 individually a bit up and here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.799
 come three opponents do not fuck you 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.710
 I simply have my visa franzose 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.150
 just take off and take this one here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.479
 and then you already see the gameplay 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the end an almost full gameplay but 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.229
 you'll see what happens in the end 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.009
 So I'll say it's a 40 academy 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.390
 you can think of many 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.159
 Kills that will be at the time I 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.330
 would have 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.220
 and yes the two still cut away nicely 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.390
 and yes, I think so it completely 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 nice I could be right again 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.200
 one now claims to marcel callo 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 say if you are so bad and edge 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.420
 and play with support and I have you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 eh only one playstation plays that yes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.900
 but here is an xbox gameplay I have to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.460
 disappoint with the new clear so 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.630
 impact nothing is the new clear if I am 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.130
 the subscribers purely let know yet 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.899
 So maybe not 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.310
 slave tournament but the new let 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.680
 you surprise what his future 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 you pay for how long the money 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.810
 ok at all, you see, that was it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280
 orbital lothar and sponge rifle beautiful 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 I think the three killstreaks exactly 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.360
 asks very well that would have to everyone 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.799
 carry case and then so much fun 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.969
 have because opponents so not really 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.290
 chance of course have the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.090
 bulletproof trees come like yours 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 play because you know so cheap two 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.910
 Chambers with a failed ski 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.319
 come through walls but shoot one 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.310
 Can not with a loud parson cheese 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.770
 shoot through a few first 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.030
 yes it is loud a game as I said 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.470
 a few walls topics that me now 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.940
 come in and the first movie just like that 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.560
 a kicker kicker is now in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.180
 hamburg soon to meet a subscriber 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.950
 and since I have somehow fully bock out 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.330
 to drive so if someone from 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.080
 it is probably on you 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.060
 20 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.380
 to take place on the 20th of 04 I do not know yet 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.360
 exactly if it will happen then but 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.010
 if so, I will definitely be there 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.090
 be in hamburg and then you will me 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.780
 also meet in the box 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.040
 maybe I can teach you something like that 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.420
 so will sign up for me 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.430
 feel so funny people because 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.300
 i sign what i mean i am 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.290
 but actually only a small one 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.730
 youtube but i have been with many 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.989
 Subscribers of the cap of this interest 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 it would have to meet me times or 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.140
 times 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.730
 and here I have survived and now 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.760
 thinks he can now but the type 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.780
 Barabara, I have taken him away and the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.819
 even to the notary 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 yes but a few moments were synonymous 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.519
 already totally amazed what I tuesday 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.660
 Called if we did not overdo it 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.190
 the people are glad I can not do that 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.269
 understand because I'm wondering then 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.680
 always so why can you so about it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.080
 I look back order and human but 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.099
 well i guess for some of you 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.450
 I might have something on youtube 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.980
 like a little star that's why 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.269
 I am also very unusual but think 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.099
 if she comes to the subscriber 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.549
 you could definitely mine 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.739
 nice round chat 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.790
 for example, the odds random blabber 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.170
 if you're in the mood for me over 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.670
 some topic talk about what moves you 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.260
 then write to us in the comments 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.670
 if I wanted to talk about something 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.900
 what is in your head right now then 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.040
 writes it said purely perhaps the 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.239
 the first part to do something if I'm bock 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 but my old eat them when I 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.510
 let's talk to it 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.980
 I know I should be a bit 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.410
 slower but people talk I do 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.269
 that's just before I hear so yes 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.799
 kill the enemy here with the lot there 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.840
 shoot those out there I still see 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.310
 which close one more time on it my 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.049
 clear meter runs around 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.970
 I will satellite in Oberthal 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.989
 Immediately on her now and people 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.220
 i can not do that at all i can 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.900
 did not want to persuade so long the 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 we write people so matejka a 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.959
 my comments are a little slow 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.819
 but it just is not my style and 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.870
 yes I guess you can hear your ears 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.220
 maybe you can be a bit of a colleague 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.480
 I'm listening to my videos because then 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.370
 you know just so so, how fast can you 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.600
 I even talk that is still 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.889
 I understand what I mean 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.090
 the life of the moon eclipse of koller 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.260
 I think you 're fine on the page 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.910
 adjusted to it 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.799
 sometimes I think about it here too 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.060
 only six minutes then either one 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.049
 theme will be stored or so the 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.010
 that's why you have to be very difficult 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.479
 just a little bit 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.709
 get higher speed and you 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.670
 See the swarms here again 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.320
 on the other hand the black right off 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.030
 if there is no kill confirmed gameplay 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.960
 but a dominance has been fighting 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.860
 I think I have 100 plus 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.720
 because I am so good 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.250
 actually departed and you know 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.050
 marcel minister worst player 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.220
 that's why skibbe is 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.810
 Of course, I also have to ask 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.390
 say and who finds that irony in the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.930
 keep the rest and do what he does with it 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.490
 I would like the type I have to be able to do 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.840
 also say the guy is such a 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.410
 won really cool water ever since 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.420
 Petzschner 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.830
 I thought so the practice groups going 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.930
 taught that you do not pack 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.940
 purely in your classes setup tutorial there 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.440
 because this is not so good people this 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.990
 become overly horny one stands the 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.370
 I have them here with economics and 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.660
 I'll take her with you 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.430
 creates and expanded magazine game 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.390
 If I can because the weapon 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.680
 just has such a fast art 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.690
 disadvantage of the animation I like 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.310
 huge and how much the deadline around one 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.650
 he thinks with his s mini he can 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.090
 get me but a copy can be 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.200
 Do not stop so easily as I am 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.280
 now already briefly from the next orbita 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.290
 satellite I do not even know if I'm still 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.690
 getting a hobby is only right 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.100
 flashed away nice and here has the b23 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.120
 makes the best time at the game 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.320
 Of course your work is very good here 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.820
 I can still talk over here a bit 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.860
 as I said just freestyle easy 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.120
 microphone made so that we can 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.500
 every case a positive rating or 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.640
 if you do not like it that way with that 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.630
 make freestyle sound and that 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.610
 Gameplay, it seems to her already 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.710
 to be at the end and look forward to everyone 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.380
 think about it as I'm about to die 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.960
 just wonderful, I'm just going to be like that 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.250
 killed in a way yes I know how 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.120
 you can look forward to much more 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.320
 actually dearer dead
