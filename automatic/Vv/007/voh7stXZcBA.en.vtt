00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.549
 This is the path of the path of crosses 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.320
 Efe and the plantation trail both found out were in the national park 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.280
 sovereignty 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.549
 one of the many parks that are in the city of panama 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.880
 well we crossed the others and not to 20 3 points 5 kilometers 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.019
 iñaki trail crossing path to intercept the plantation trail 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.279
 and finish the mingo with everything soon a road of sirte 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.540
 kilometer 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.880
 to leave and the area of ​​vicar opita originating from san borja 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.080
 guillén but way of crosses because they have their future in that historical 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.830
 be 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.400
 the second road that the Spaniards used for what was the transfer 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.320
 of what was gold and silver 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.240
 the part of the Atlantic towards the Pacific 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.280
 On the other hand, the Atlantic that was in a boat 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.620
 At any rate, the river Chagres entering through what is currently the hotel of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.580
 gamboa 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.460
 there is an entrance of this path ended in crosses leaving the rondón del 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.870
 case not all other and five entries on the road to colon with perception 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.140
 with a punch and libya 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 this path he is in 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.630
 Much of Belgrade 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.840
 we understand that this path is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.070
 It was built at that time with the whole band soon three meters 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.500
 wide and the whole floor was perforated embocar in stone 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.520
 if they used 'mules' 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.670
 together with the slaves for the moment the load from one side to another 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.020
 Here we can see the first three points 5 kilometers of it 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.610
 It is mostly cobbled there and you can also see the footprint of 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.780
 the mules 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.700
 percent and the bada and what the rock 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 is he the blind eye to the most interesting experience we can 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.570
 to appreciate 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.159
 here passed by different rivers affirmed the fact happened in this 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.850
 it was bought 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.020
 same the dry season 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.080
 per cent that all these small rivers rivulets or tributary of one or the other 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.859
 way of what is the river chagres 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.859
 this is approximately 2 207 kilometers from the entrance by chile 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.909
 we did this tour but well here you can appreciate a skeleton of a 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.969
 armadillo in the bush 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.799
 in full 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.519
 in the hallway 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.709
 annual percent has to have been for 3 to 2 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.709
 in a predator the center I wanted from the bone 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.059
 as a hammer wounded and resulted therefore from the 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.169
 in the meeting 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.859
 same for there continues to be views of what the first part of the 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.749
 trail cross road 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.629
 here we are at this moment in the intersection with what would be 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.989
 the plantation path the plantation path 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.079
 where because there is a tender percent of both trails join where 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.669
 I can continue the path of crosses 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.689
 soon another seven kilometers to the river chagres 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.389
 or as much in this case this time it was walking other 7 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.289
 kilometer 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.029
 who want to the side of the road 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.239
 would be canopy out 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.969
 this view you can appreciate what is experienced at this moment the output of what 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.209
 the path 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.139
 this path actually to a 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.449
 or it has remained like a highway 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.429
 percentage the unam 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:31.469
 the used as 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.809
 like the highway the western maintenance on the trails 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.769
 is actually the only one the only way to assimilate has been from ccoo to 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.029
 intercept the paths alcon by means of almud 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.529
 transport 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:49.880
 this trail has seven meters per cent equipment 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.859
 total 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:51.739
 percent 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.439
 as you read it was a slightly wider area of ​​much cleaner 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.249
 It takes logically much less effort 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:04.569
 It is a road where there is some doubt that another joke but deep call 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.059
 tepoztlan 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.639
 Equally true of which path if you have a man what would be trails 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.980
 plantation why 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.139
 previously he was directing 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.499
 dadaab 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:20.109
 based on the people who lived here around what they had empowered 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.969
 it was a cocoa plantation 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.770
 and from the loft 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.810
 in his time the time of the American military used equally 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.460
 for practices of 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.039
 July airs the ship are what the American cargo was different 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.259
 polished to the front also maría cropped walked where you see what 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.939
 would be the weed or the wave for the canal 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:48.020
 that the agreement with the day of the unam that accompanies all 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.159
 It was a varied used to 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.279
 ad shooting tests 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.279
 and where they also landed by helicopters 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.680
 nowadays it can passively all this would leave a protected area within the 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.439
 Park 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.869
 this is a huge rubber tree gestates almost at the exit kilometer and a half 

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.650
 departure day 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.650
 percent and good you can appreciate all kinds of 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.559
 ii well also from a place that are used 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:20.349
 the observers of america do not paint meadow in the morning 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.909
 to be his sightings 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.379
 this path 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.810
 per hundred goes parallel to a whole bed of the river that when it is in winter then 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.110
 it has a channel 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.479
 and interesting where there are a couple of things that can also be used 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.229
 as a flag 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:37.250
 I'm interested in the fact that the Indian has 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.669
 a menu of the departure kilometer we have observed 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.930
 by blind we are observing 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.939
 this act only that it climbed a tree in reality 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:52.519
 we think that he himself was active moving the moment we did not 

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:54.240
 we had closer but 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.270
 modesty 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.180
 Our surprise for the data only allowed us to pass 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.129
 let's go through 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.129
 for the price but really pay more attention 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:09.389
 a hundred a little bit later we could see all these animals 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.800
 I usually drank to the manara 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.480
 and later I could observe inside it within the same path 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.979
 they were going table 1 2 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.979
 presented his new partner arrested 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.060
 Judge 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.110
 we can appreciate that at the moment that we are passing below the data 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.650
 only efe 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.860
 in which he only limited himself to observe very curious lot being this his 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.610
 natural habitat 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.340
 And by the way another overconfidence of the leader 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:45.309
 it was moved roughly and abuses and half in the morning the power was 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.619
 moving tall animals doing 

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:50.619
 doing their work or in this entity 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.629
 this tour in total in the services of approximately 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:04.110
 about 10 points 5 kilometers from luis xiv or the world around 1 4 to 2 4 hours 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.069
 with 15 minutes or so 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.999
 with one or another stop you can observe both flora and 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:11.580
 wildlife 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.180
 here we will do when another victory equal eta 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.759
 the animal then stayed 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.849
 quiet once you state 

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:19.270
 for the moment the plan 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.869
 from the past 

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:24.180
 type of procedure has because of the output 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.249
 percent 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.990
 and backwards 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.180
 after the jons fe-jons and simple 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.120
 in each of the entry points to the paths of the unam has well 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.439
 identified 

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:39.050
 was the air one that they are going to go with some documentation that serves to him 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.939
 to the person who wants to experience these these years 

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.199
 here we can appreciate 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.949
 in the creation of the unpublished park where indicated at the moment 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:53.999
 he made the entrance so the chilibre road we walk brings my medium 

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.370
 kilometer 15 they jumped from this moment the path of plantation 

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.430
 leaving the canopy area on the road towards gamboa
