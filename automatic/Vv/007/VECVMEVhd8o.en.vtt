00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 the 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.440
 now we are going to make a soup of 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.670
 mushrooms I know it's a pretty dish 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.590
 traditional and common but there's always 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.330
 interesting variations in the soup of 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.910
 mushrooms that one can apply a new 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.850
 remove and put you will not see my soup 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.670
 mushrooms I tell them my ingredients since 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.980
 for this recipe we are going to occupy two 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.740
 tablespoons of oil half bar 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.010
 butter 2 garlic cloves, chopped 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.769
 half chopped onion 500 grams of 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.250
 mushrooms in thick slices a tomato 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.500
 seedless and chopped seven cups of 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.129
 chicken broth two chipotle peppers 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.469
 dry and fried a tablespoon of 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.550
 chopped or cilantro if you have been like this 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:51.430
 you prefer salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.620
 a very easy recipe to make and how 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.199
 they know their bonuses now so mushrooms 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.100
 they are very good they have all the 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:03.160
 vitamins all minerals proteins 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.860
 and I repeat, they have a protein that 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.869
 It is responsible for accelerating the lipid process 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.670
 of the body so it helps a lot 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.130
 fight cellulite and also eliminate 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 body fat for those people 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.640
 who want to lose weight quickie 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.170
 mushrooms let's put some 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.180
 Butter 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.659
 and we're also going to put a little bit of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
 oil and this is just so that it does not 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.009
 burn the butter because the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.259
 temperature of the butter does not 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.020
 rises as much as the temperature of the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.440
 oil then let's put more 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.180
 little bit and we're going to let our 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.520
 Butter 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.780
 as I hope it is done as 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.300
 effervescent and take a golden color 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.760
 light gold there we will add the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.620
 garlic and onion we are going to put 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.510
 same time so there is not a taste 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.560
 that predominates more than another we want that 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:04.110
 the both flavors now yes marry 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.060
 and mix their aromas at the same time 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.940
 apart good onion and garlic already 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.760
 they know they help a lot to avoid 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 problems of flu and now with these 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.520
 cold between more onions we can consume 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.830
 best 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.610
 there is not very good onion true and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.170
 gives a very special flavor to all 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.630
 the community I love the onion 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 well now let's put the mushroom 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.530
 when you put the mushroom in the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.240
 poster is very important that everything is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.040
 very hot because if you do not release many 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.980
 juices if we want to release the juice 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.350
 but since we put the broth then 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 we are going to put here the trancones that in 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.430
 this case, they can make a game 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.320
 of mushrooms or mushrooms can no longer 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.760
 Put on a nail can put shitake 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.120
 portovelo what you like the most 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.159
 let's season with salt 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.460
 in this case he will not put pepper 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:04.230
 because I'm going to use chiles 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:07.129
 and we're going to let them brown a little 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.530
 how rich is the mushroom other than that it is a 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.170
 pretty cheap ingredient then 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.019
 making a mushroom soup results 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.900
 quite productive and one can throw 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.450
 well l lotito the pumpkin do still 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.330
 more broth if there are guests well where 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.349
 They eat 3 as the 4 or 5 we throw more 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.349
 water or whatever 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.540
 we are also going to add tomato 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.700
 this is to give her a little touch of 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.100
 taste we do not want to throw a lot because the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.920
 soup is not mushroom tomatoes is 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.080
 really more to give it a touch of 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.320
 special flavor 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.820
 it appears that all variations can 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.610
 make a difference and with a tomato 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.740
 milestone well since cesarean another thing we're going to 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.890
 relate a little salt 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:03.230
 and let's add good first I'm going to 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.230
 put the chili dry 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.909
 I'll put 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.439
 You can help me, you can 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:16.130
 choose between coriander parsley 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.160
 you if they want 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.320
 maybe a little bit of fine herbs will 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:28.640
 they like and we are going to put the consomme of 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.720
 chicken so that here all the 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.150
 flavors let's let it take a boil 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.650
 and since the boil is already ready 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.960
 our easy and rich healthy clothes 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.170
 the subtracted to the car partly we return 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.400
 do not go step by step of mushroom soup 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.540
 I brake the oil and the butter 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.640
 to garlic and mushrooms 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.770
 Leave them until golden brown and add the 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.780
 tomato adds the broth the epazote and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.210
 chile tapa and serve from 10 to 15 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.990
 minutes rectifies the seasoning and serves 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.590
