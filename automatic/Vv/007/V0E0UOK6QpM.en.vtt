00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.640
 a fast train is traveling at a speed of 150 kilometers per hour 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.859
 Hour to a train station too 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.599
 At this station, passengers want to get in and out 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.499
 the train did not brake and continues at a constant speed 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.249
 At the station, the new passengers are now getting into a feeder to Klein 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.009
 before the express train reaches the station Fourth feeder on one 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.140
 Parallel track Klose and accelerates to the speed of approaching 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.140
 fast train 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.410
 as soon as the two moves next to each other with exactly the same speed 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.720
 drive 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.730
 the feeder connects to the express train 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.750
 there is a transfer service from the passengers get on the express train and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.810
 or from the express train to the feeder 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.460
 the transfer point has been withdrawn 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.470
 the feeder train brakes and the express train continues its journey 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 constant speed 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.659
 during the transfer process, the feeder train has 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.670
 about five kilometers from the train station 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 and now brings the passengers exiting the express train to the platform 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.280
 back 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 the station needs except the parallel track and the feeder 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.090
 Railcar no special infrastructure 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.110
 the express train is a normal train as it is used today only with 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.160
 an additional transfer wagon in the train with de 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.880
 After about four minutes, the feeder train reaches the platform and the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 Passengers get off at their destination 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.730
 the benefits of nonstop tears concept 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.869
 the existing train and rail systems can be used 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.710
 because the railway lines and express trains used today at a speed 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 of 150 kilometers per hour they can be low with Blood 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.709
 Modifications are used 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.389
 higher average prices speed 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:15.249
 Rainer nonstop tears no time by getting in and out of the passengers 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.219
 any number of stations can be integrated 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.179
 the average cruising speed is higher than at 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:25.959
 High-speed trains such as the ICE 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.840
 the on the distance Munich hamburg despite top speeds of about 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.090
 250 kilometers per hour only an average between Diakite of about 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.120
 Reached 135 kilometers per hour 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.849
 in comparison to IV c 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.590
 whose trains and especially developed the routes devour billions 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.879
 the cost of the new top ten concert is the rain 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.810
 Energy saving without stopping the entire train 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:59.209
 because when nonstop tears do not slow down every time the entire train and 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.689
 has to be accelerated 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.919
 but only the much lighter feeder wagon 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:07.939
 This results in an ECE energy saving potential 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.329
 gradual conversion to new is whether tears 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.430
 Of course the train can also stop at stations at any time 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:21.009
 As a result, train stations could gradually make do with Parallels 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.269
 dissatisfied railcar be equipped 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.059
 non-stop small 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:27.790
 whoever rests rustes
