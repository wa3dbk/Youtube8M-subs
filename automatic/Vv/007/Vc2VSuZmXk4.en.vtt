00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
know keep it down on the bottom so if

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.390 
know keep it down on the bottom so if
it's<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.810> little<00:02:12.019> bit<00:02:12.110> deeper<00:02:12.260> 6<00:02:12.769> 7<00:02:13.040> 8<00:02:13.160> foot

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
it's a little bit deeper 6 7 8 foot

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
you're going to have to slow you know

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.539 
you're going to have to slow you know
you<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.590> slow<00:02:15.799> your<00:02:15.950> retrieve<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.519> a

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
you have to slow your retrieve down a

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.030 
you have to slow your retrieve down a
little<00:02:16.760> bit<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.690> of<00:02:17.780> my<00:02:17.870> other<00:02:18.049> favorite

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
little bit one of my other favorite

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.160 
little bit one of my other favorite
techniques<00:02:19.489> for<00:02:19.700> this<00:02:19.850> is<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.690> pump<00:02:20.930> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
techniques for this is just a pump and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620 
techniques for this is just a pump and
you<00:02:22.040> know<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.430> pull<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.850> stop<00:02:23.120> type

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
you know just a pull and stop type

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.840 
you know just a pull and stop type
retrieve<00:02:24.500> instead<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.250> working<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.670> like<00:02:25.820> a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
retrieve instead of working it like a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.280 
retrieve instead of working it like a
jig<00:02:26.180> with<00:02:26.360> your<00:02:26.480> rod<00:02:26.630> tip<00:02:26.840> up<00:02:26.989> where<00:02:27.170> you're

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
jig with your rod tip up where you're

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.840 
jig with your rod tip up where you're
really<00:02:27.530> lifting<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:27.920> off<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.220> bottom<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.640> just

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
really lifting it off the bottom I just

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.000 
really lifting it off the bottom I just
keep<00:02:29.209> my<00:02:29.360> rod<00:02:29.540> tip<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.019> side<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.560> just

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
keep my rod tip to the side and just

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.150 
keep my rod tip to the side and just
sweep<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.610> then<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.450> follow<00:02:32.930> your<00:02:33.320> your

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
sweep it and then just follow your your

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.500 
sweep it and then just follow your your
bait<00:02:34.340> back<00:02:34.519> down<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:34.790> want<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.360> keep

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
bait back down I want to just keep

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
bait back down I want to just keep
tension<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.230> line<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:37.070> let<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.430> bait

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
tension on the line but let the bait

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.940 
tension on the line but let the bait
fall<00:02:37.910> and<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.510> lets<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.870> read<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.079> shed<00:02:39.440> do

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
fall and that lets that read I shed do

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.500 
fall and that lets that read I shed do
its<00:02:40.130> thing<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.519> mean<00:02:40.640> that's<00:02:40.820> when<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.120> swims<00:02:41.390> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
its thing I mean that's when it swims to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.210 
its thing I mean that's when it swims to
the<00:02:41.540> bottom<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.380> I'll<00:02:42.470> catch<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.769> lot<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.010> fish

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
the bottom and I'll catch a lot of fish

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.490 
the bottom and I'll catch a lot of fish
doing<00:02:43.489> this<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:44.299> works<00:02:44.540> really<00:02:44.900> good<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.380> I'm

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
doing this this works really good if I'm

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.930 
doing this this works really good if I'm
trying<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.799> work<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.040> little<00:02:46.160> bit<00:02:46.310> deeper<00:02:46.519> flat

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
trying to work a little bit deeper flat

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.930 
trying to work a little bit deeper flat
I'll<00:02:47.180> do<00:02:48.049> it<00:02:48.170> over<00:02:48.290> grass<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.160> I'll<00:02:49.459> do<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.820> over

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
I'll do it over grass it I'll do it over

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.880 
I'll do it over grass it I'll do it over
rocks<00:02:50.329> whatever<00:02:50.810> covers<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.500> know<00:02:51.709> down

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
rocks whatever covers that you know down

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.410 
rocks whatever covers that you know down
there<00:02:52.160> doesn't<00:02:52.549> really<00:02:52.700> matter<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.209> that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
there doesn't really matter but that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.500 
there doesn't really matter but that
that<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.739> pump<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.370> stop<00:02:55.730> retrieve<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
that just pump and stop retrieve is a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.449 
that just pump and stop retrieve is a
deadly<00:02:57.079> way<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.260> fish<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.829> probably<00:02:58.190> catch

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
deadly way to fish it I probably catch

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.220 
deadly way to fish it I probably catch
more<00:02:58.700> fish<00:02:58.910> in<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.300> way<00:02:59.480> than<00:02:59.840> any<00:03:00.019> other

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
more fish in it this way than any other

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.400 
more fish in it this way than any other
way<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.180> get<00:03:02.360> out<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.690> where<00:03:02.840> I'm<00:03:02.959> fishing<00:03:03.170> in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
way if I get out to where I'm fishing in

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.000 
way if I get out to where I'm fishing in
even

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
even

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.339 
even
deeper<00:03:04.280> water<00:03:04.549> I<00:03:04.849> will<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:05.599> of<00:03:05.720> yo-yo<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.230> on

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
deeper water I will kind of yo-yo it on

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.039 
deeper water I will kind of yo-yo it on
those<00:03:06.530> ledges<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:08.060> same<00:03:08.450> kind<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:08.840> places

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
those ledges you same kind of places

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.229 
those ledges you same kind of places
you'd<00:03:09.349> throw<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> big<00:03:09.829> crankbait<00:03:10.340> stuff<00:03:11.030> like

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
you'd throw a big crankbait stuff like

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:11.619 
you'd throw a big crankbait stuff like
that

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
that

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.210 
that
