00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
weren't that many rules the container

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620 
weren't that many rules the container
gardening<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.860> just<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.450> one

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
gardening really just to the first one

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.060 
gardening really just to the first one
being<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> fact<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.650> want<00:00:22.829> to<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:22.950> a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
really well drained soil and secondly

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
really well drained soil and secondly
that<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> bottom<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> container<00:00:27.330> have<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that the bottom of the container have a

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
that the bottom of the container have a
hole<00:00:27.929> in<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> add<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> third<00:00:29.730> one

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
hole in it I'm going to add a third one

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.759 
hole in it I'm going to add a third one
now<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.720> fact<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> need<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.410> really

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
now the fact that we need to really

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.460 
now the fact that we need to really
consider<00:00:31.949> Sun<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.940> shade<00:00:33.080> just<00:00:34.080> like<00:00:34.260> these

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
consider Sun and shade just like these

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.829 
consider Sun and shade just like these
bleeding<00:00:35.160> heart<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.790> these<00:00:36.000> hostas<00:00:36.600> really

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:36.839 
bleeding heart and these hostas really

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:38.900 
bleeding heart and these hostas really
like<00:00:37.019> to<00:00:37.140> grow<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.280> ground<00:00:38.550> bed

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
like to grow here in this ground bed

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
like to grow here in this ground bed
that's<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.269> the<00:00:39.360> shade<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:40.199> also<00:00:40.379> need<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
that's in the shade we also need to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.950 
that's in the shade we also need to
think<00:00:40.920> about<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> fact<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.720> most<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.839> our

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
think about the fact that most of our

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
think about the fact that most of our
plants<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.739> grow<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.039> containers<00:00:44.250> are

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
plants that we grow in containers are

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
plants that we grow in containers are
going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.120> sunny<00:00:45.899> plants<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:46.559> some<00:00:46.739> are

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
going to be sunny plants but some are

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to be sunny plants but some are
going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.129> shady<00:00:47.370> plants<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> really

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
going to be shady plants and you really

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
going to be shady plants and you really
need<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> analyze<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> area<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:49.949> you're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
need to analyze the area where you're

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.619 
need to analyze the area where you're
going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.340> growing<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.940> container<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
going to be growing that container and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
going to be growing that container and
keep<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.379> mind<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> pick<00:00:53.219> out

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
keep that in mind when you pick out

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.270 
keep that in mind when you pick out
plants<00:00:53.820> alright<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.870> our<00:00:54.899> third<00:00:55.260> rule<00:00:55.530> keep

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
plants alright so our third rule keep

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
plants alright so our third rule keep
that<00:00:56.460> Sun<00:00:56.760> Shade<00:00:57.059> require<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.690> mind<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that Sun Shade require in mind when you

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.980 
that Sun Shade require in mind when you
go<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> garden<00:00:59.160> store

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:00.990 
go to the garden store

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.140 
go to the garden store
you<00:01:01.680> remember<00:01:01.980> how<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.130> talked<00:01:02.610> about<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.970> fact

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
you remember how I talked about the fact

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.880 
you remember how I talked about the fact
that<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.420> really<00:01:03.780> need<00:01:03.960> well-drained<00:01:04.590> soil

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that we really need well-drained soil

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
that we really need well-drained soil
for<00:01:05.190> containers<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.420> gives<00:01:06.630> us<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.870> good

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
for containers it gives us a good

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.990 
for containers it gives us a good
opportunity<00:01:07.050> to<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.800> those<00:01:08.070> routes<00:01:08.460> expand

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
opportunity to have those routes expand

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
opportunity to have those routes expand
and<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.930> sit<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> water<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.100> rot<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and they don't sit in water and rot so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.500 
and they don't sit in water and rot so
it's<00:01:11.700> really<00:01:11.910> important<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> have

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it's really important to have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.110 
it's really important to have
well-drained<00:01:13.020> soils<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:14.730> know<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> can't

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
well-drained soils you know you can't

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.210 
well-drained soils you know you can't
have<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.450> cake<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.690> eat<00:01:15.870> it<00:01:15.930> too

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
have your cake and eat it too

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.460 
have your cake and eat it too
unfortunately<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> well-drained<00:01:17.970> soils

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
unfortunately the well-drained soils

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
unfortunately the well-drained soils
necessitate<00:01:19.470> us<00:01:19.710> having<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> add<00:01:20.760> water<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.270> lot

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
necessitate us having to add water a lot

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
necessitate us having to add water a lot
and<00:01:21.780> sometimes<00:01:22.530> even<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> daily<00:01:23.610> basis<00:01:24.210> if

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and sometimes even on a daily basis if

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
and sometimes even on a daily basis if
it's<00:01:24.510> really<00:01:24.780> hot<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.890> key<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> though<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's really hot the key is though to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
it's really hot the key is though to
know<00:01:26.910> when<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> walk<00:01:27.510> add<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.930> water<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.320> when

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
know when to walk add the water and when

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.700 
know when to walk add the water and when
to<00:01:29.070> leave<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.370> alone<00:01:29.460> here's<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.120> good<00:01:30.270> example

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
to leave it alone here's a good example

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
to leave it alone here's a good example
this<00:01:31.710> pot<00:01:31.980> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.510> pretty<00:01:33.510> moist<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.140> stick<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
can even tell just by looking at the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.630 
finger down in there it's just as dry
down<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.330> as<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.080> on<00:01:49.110> top<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> one

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
down in it as it is on top so this one

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
down in it as it is on top so this one
will<00:01:50.700> need<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> water<00:01:51.180> right<00:01:51.479> away<00:01:51.510> now<00:01:52.260> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
will need the water right away now a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
will need the water right away now a
good<00:01:52.680> sign<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.040> I've<00:01:53.490> done<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:53.850> job<00:01:53.910> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
good sign that I've done a good job of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.030 
good sign that I've done a good job of
watering<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.080> I'm<00:01:55.229> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> flood<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
watering is that I'm going to flood it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.430 
watering is that I'm going to flood it
and<00:01:56.220> then<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> see<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.479> water<00:01:57.690> coming<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.260> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
and then I see the water coming all the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.440 
and then I see the water coming all the
way<00:01:58.470> through<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.890> pot<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.150> bottom

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
way through the pot and out the bottom

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.390 
way through the pot and out the bottom
in<00:02:00.540> fact<00:02:00.780> ten<00:02:01.380> percent<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> water<00:02:02.190> that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
in fact ten percent of the water that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.370 
in fact ten percent of the water that
you<00:02:02.550> apply<00:02:02.850> should<00:02:03.540> drain<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:03.930> bottom

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you apply should drain out the bottom

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
you apply should drain out the bottom
and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.009> good<00:02:05.160> sign<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.550> watering<00:02:05.880> now

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
and that's a good sign of watering now

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.240 
and that's a good sign of watering now
is<00:02:06.630> compared<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.050> ground<00:02:07.470> bed<00:02:07.770> soils

ability to retain and hold nutrients but

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.870 
ability to retain and hold nutrients but
the<00:02:12.930> plants<00:02:13.290> certainly<00:02:13.650> need<00:02:13.860> them<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.730> we're

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the plants certainly need them so we're

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.980 
the plants certainly need them so we're
going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> need<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.330> add<00:02:15.510> them<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to need to add them on a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620 
going to need to add them on a
prescribed<00:02:16.500> basis<00:02:16.920> two<00:02:17.670> approaches<00:02:18.030> here<00:02:18.390> for

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
prescribed basis two approaches here for

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.180 
prescribed basis two approaches here for
us<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.960> first<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:19.980> an

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
us the first one is to use an

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.520 
us the first one is to use an
all-purpose<00:02:20.850> plant<00:02:21.270> food<00:02:21.540> mix<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.440> up

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
all-purpose plant food mix it up

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.230 
all-purpose plant food mix it up
according<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.950> label<00:02:23.160> directions<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.060> then

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
according to label directions and then

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.780 
according to label directions and then
water<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.140> plant<00:02:25.410> with<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:26.010> monthly

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
water the plant with that a monthly

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
water the plant with that a monthly
schedule<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.570> should<00:02:27.720> work<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
schedule for that should work out and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
schedule for that should work out and
suffice<00:02:28.830> for<00:02:28.890> most<00:02:29.250> plants<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:30.600> other

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
suffice for most plants the other

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.350 
suffice for most plants the other
approach<00:02:30.960> is<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.710> use<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:32.190> slow<00:02:33.180> release

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
approach is to use a slow release

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.510 
approach is to use a slow release
product<00:02:33.810> much<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.650> actually<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.250> would<00:02:35.400> use

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
product much is actually you would use

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.220 
product much is actually you would use
on<00:02:35.760> your<00:02:35.910> lawn<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.540> same<00:02:36.750> type<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> fertilizer

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
on your lawn the same type of fertilizer

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860 
on your lawn the same type of fertilizer
approach<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.880> way<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.120> works<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.569> again

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
approach and the way this works is again

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.830 
approach and the way this works is again
sprinkling<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.970> predetermined<00:02:41.970> amount<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.480> top

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
sprinkling a predetermined amount on top

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.070 
sprinkling a predetermined amount on top
of<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.110> soil<00:02:43.290> letting<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.250> soak<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
of the soil letting that soak in and the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.660 
of the soil letting that soak in and the
fertilizer<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.740> released<00:02:47.069> with<00:02:47.250> every

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
fertilizer is released with every

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.120 
fertilizer is released with every
watering<00:02:48.240> with<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:48.630> approach<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.710> either

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
watering with this approach now either

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.680 
watering with this approach now either
one<00:02:50.370> will<00:02:50.520> work<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:50.819> just<00:02:50.850> fine<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.450> kinda

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
one will work out just fine you kinda

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
one will work out just fine you kinda
have<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.840> pick<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:52.350> works<00:02:52.620> best<00:02:52.890> for

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
have to pick out which works best for

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.120 
have to pick out which works best for
you<00:02:53.569> alright<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.960> keys<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.650> maintaining

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
you alright so the keys for maintaining

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.730 
you alright so the keys for maintaining

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
a good container garden our first of all

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.800 
a good container garden our first of all
the<00:02:58.890> sun<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.400> shade<00:02:59.430> requirements<00:03:00.330> the

second of all a good watering schedule
and<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.990> third<00:03:04.200> part<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.920> fertilizer

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and the third part is the fertilizer

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.350 
and the third part is the fertilizer
out<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.860> plants<00:03:07.250> themselves<00:03:07.330> need<00:03:08.330> a

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
out of the plants themselves need a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.330 
out of the plants themselves need a
little<00:03:08.570> help<00:03:08.660> picking<00:03:09.050> those<00:03:09.320> out<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.800> that's

little help picking those out and that's

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.130 
little help picking those out and that's
what<00:03:10.460> we'll<00:03:10.580> talk<00:03:10.730> about<00:03:10.790> on<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.480> next<00:03:11.840> garden
