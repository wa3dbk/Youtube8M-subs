change them to a high my own number
divisible<00:02:44.060> by<00:02:44.270> eight<00:02:44.600> remember<00:02:44.989> that<00:02:45.489> go<00:02:46.489> back

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
divisible by eight remember that go back

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.430 
divisible by eight remember that go back
into<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.880> game<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.420> look<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.110> should<00:02:48.290> see

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
into the game and look you should see

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.080 
into the game and look you should see
here<00:02:48.680> that<00:02:48.709> it<00:02:48.920> changed<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.550> buttload<00:02:50.030> of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
here that it changed to a buttload of

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.170 
here that it changed to a buttload of
money<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.540> since<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.900> frozen<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:52.040> can<00:02:52.220> buy

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
money and since it's frozen you can buy

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.220 
money and since it's frozen you can buy
stuff<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.320> it<00:02:54.380> won't<00:02:54.530> go<00:02:54.680> down<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:56.020> so<00:02:57.020> you<00:02:57.110> can

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
stuff and it won't go down so so you can
