00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
your powdered sugar and you're going to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.130 
your powdered sugar and you're going to

doesn't<00:02:58.440> mix<00:02:58.650> well<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.310> where<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.549> can

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
doesn't mix well this is where you can

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.870 
doesn't mix well this is where you can

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
add your soy milk and it's estimated

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.120 
add your soy milk and it's estimated
that<00:03:03.180> should<00:03:03.420> be<00:03:03.510> about<00:03:03.600> 3<00:03:04.019> tablespoons<00:03:04.260> but

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
that should be about 3 tablespoons but

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.740 
that should be about 3 tablespoons but
it's<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.579> up<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> consistency<00:03:06.720> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
it's really up to the consistency that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
it's really up to the consistency that
you<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.920> do<00:03:08.070> more<00:03:08.310> or<00:03:08.459> less

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you want it so you can do more or less

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.440 
you want it so you can do more or less

and<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.239> trick<00:03:58.450> here<00:03:58.780> is<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.590> double<00:03:59.770> pan<00:04:00.220> so

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
and the trick here is the double pan so

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.270 
and the trick here is the double pan so
in<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.660> bottom<00:04:02.050> pan<00:04:02.290> you're<00:04:02.890> going<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.099> bring

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
in the bottom pan you're going to bring

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.900 
in the bottom pan you're going to bring
water<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.480> boil<00:04:04.840> my<00:04:05.800> water<00:04:06.069> has<00:04:06.430> reached<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
water to a boil my water has reached a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.940 
water to a boil my water has reached a
boil<00:04:07.150> so<00:04:07.750> I'm<00:04:07.810> going<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.989> turn<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.500> heat<00:04:08.709> down

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
boil so I'm going to turn the heat down

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.920 
boil so I'm going to turn the heat down
to<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:10.360> low<00:04:10.720> setting<00:04:11.530> and<00:04:12.000> then<00:04:13.000> place<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
to a low setting and then place the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.819 
to a low setting and then place the
empty<00:04:14.319> pan<00:04:14.560> on<00:04:15.040> top<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.410> what<00:04:17.560> I'm<00:04:17.680> going

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
empty pan on top this is what I'm going

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.590 
empty pan on top this is what I'm going
to<00:04:17.859> put<00:04:18.130> in<00:04:18.310> my<00:04:19.299> chocolate<00:04:19.720> chips<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.590> milk

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.420 

and<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.110> melt<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.560> down<00:04:26.590> until<00:04:27.130> it's

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
and you just melt it down until it's

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.610 
and you just melt it down until it's
liquid<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:29.919> after<00:04:30.220> you've<00:04:30.370> got<00:04:30.610> your<00:04:30.850> drizzle

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
liquid so after you've got your drizzle

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.960 
liquid so after you've got your drizzle
all<00:04:32.620> liquefied<00:04:33.510> you're<00:04:34.510> gonna<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:35.970> drizzle

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
all liquefied you're gonna just drizzle

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.969 
all liquefied you're gonna just drizzle
