00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 a hello my dear friends and 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.380
 Welcome to the first hacker report 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.480
 in battlefield 4 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.890
 yes it's time for the first rag or 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.630
 I know even the first rag is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.280
 but at least for me it is the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 first rag I've seen the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 Battlefield 4 The beta means to hack 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 I have already recorded 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 they will be uploaded later or 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 if after a uploaded the bet 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 still please see my please 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.670
 now you see her player profile the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 from him that is a hacker where I am with 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.820
 the later was still level 2 now 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 even the windy mine makes me too 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.320
 sky from points you can see he has one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.129
 He has two hours and five minutes 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.730
 but already has 449 kills and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.309
 that is one kg out of eleven out of eleven people 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.200
 I do not know what to say now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 Let's just have a look at it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 with type 88 killed me constantly 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.640
 has 138 kills in 18 minutes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 made the power in the minute 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.980
 average 8 kills so what can you do 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.550
 still has 100 other skills 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.750
 920 shots partner carrey of 12% that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.070
 is actually still under overview 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.600
 yes I do not know it is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.280
 a hacker that will be videos too 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.110
 Do not worry about it anyway 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.460
 go now you are on his profile 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.000
 I show you I copied the times 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.170
 names here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 I still have in the description 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.900
 pack then he just goes up here 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.970
 Just battlelog on it then one 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.810
 is displayed directly then clicks on 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 his profile 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 then you find here then you have 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.799
 here in battlefield 3 can 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.079
 We also look what you think about it 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.020
 By the way, kg had known 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.790
 3 since he was clearly a hacker 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.320
 because you have no 3000 kills and three 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.329
 method a card of 10 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 I have even the big pro gamer 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.909
 no kg of 10 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.290
 So in my opinion would have to there 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.720
 concocted by discussed here 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.729
 also reports we can times 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 look also with the type 88 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.240
 decisive one of his 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.220
 favorite weapons good in any case then 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.509
 Can you come here now ? 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.110
 back exactly that is not just about 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.630
 given back to the battlefield 4 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.560
 types above again 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 you do not even have to like it here 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 press enter which is displayed directly 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.149
 then you have the soldiers click here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.709
 then on the profile and then game 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.940
 Activity level were that again 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.130
 Something has happened 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.050
 because of that I could do that 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.360
 because of report or something 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.900
 The unlock slot autobots battle was created 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.150
 pack it went on for now just been 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.370
 times against the art is different 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.060
 made exactly what the trainers we 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.240
 do it differently 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.710
 I was on my profile and I had 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.690
 yes, the last four and played with him 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.390
 with his opponent team then I'm up 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.680
 gone the last round 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.270
 36 3 of our choice would not have been here 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.470
 So because the group thinks are okay 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.640
 normal city ​​is me but i can 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.340
 like to show the others below 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.010
 namely he had nice rounds too 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840
 like, for example, here I am 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.240
 only after separate he for so the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.160
 datev 65 3 before the round 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.950
 who had not counted the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.110
 75 8 or so so in my opinion it is 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.390
 not possible in any case then clicks 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.940
 That's exactly what it will be okay 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.170
 for me that is displayed then so 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.850
 if I'm in the round with that 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.420
 I could be here on full report 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.760
 click 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.900
 Alone from the report means oh 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.250
 God wants a report from a reporter 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.170
 but not that is meant by 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.660
 because of 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.400
 here because of the whole city is here 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.780
 exactly people here it's off easy 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.459
 his profile then you come here on it 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.830
 then you see here such a sign looks 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.680
 therefore a mouse button on it like port 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.890

 many more and players 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:05:06.840
 what many times and one shot to 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:10.479
 kill me is likely to be 88 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.520
 that's right I'm copying 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:19.740
 it just let's see my short time 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.210
 on the types because of a can then can 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.240
 the painter also we copy us again 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.110
 short text cancel exactly what were 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.659
 which finds weapons of the now 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.360
 indeed, it deserves the type 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:43.110
 88 mm the usa is not right I have that 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:46.379
 but now write 288 parents discos 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.500
 as 650 5 6 2 what else did he have 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:54.870
 stutters again 62 5 or so 60 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.069
 60 378 5 36 2 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.690
 that's here again what you 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:02.460
 the 44 2 if the ideas never if you 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.039
 motto kill me and the players as 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:13.669
 many times and around and need 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:23.659
 one shot to kill me details lmg so how 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:26.659
 heavy rain dragging the new old time 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.659
 very 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:49.829
 the players said that had to please continue 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:51.809
 no sex no that does not mean many 

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.859
 big regards so definitely 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.659
 possible for porting 

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:56.489
 That's what I wrote you can do 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.629
 you have to copy the text so synonymous if 

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.459
 her if you want 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:01.199
 I have no problem with that though you 

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.279
 he must somehow write to her 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.239
 That does not even have to be that way for the 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.429
 I think you write writes 

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:07.739
 just link to battle report option 

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:09.360
 yes, people clearly the link to the beg 

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:11.129
 ford of which i hope that works 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.239
 if you enter here now and 

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:21.809
 it would work clearly in the report 

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:23.459
 so left report I think that is 

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:24.929
 the link meant so well on channel 

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:28.019
 Your case would be glad if you too 

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:29.159
 I do not have to do it on a purely possible tail 

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.299
 I have no idea what's in store for me 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:32.129
 I do not know what it is 

00:07:30.299 --> 00:07:35.549
 But eberhard also had a lot of tail 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:37.829
 killed well we ship reporters 

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:39.749
 percent great people in any case that 

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:41.699
 was my first report to a hacker 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:43.829
 I hope he is warned I ask you 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.719
 fervently them all her reports 

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:46.589
 his profile I will again in the 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:48.179
 pack description 

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:49.439
 I hope you can then on the left 

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:50.039
 Otherwise , just give his name 

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:51.779

 even in battlelog enter and wants 

00:07:55.799 --> 00:07:58.379
 Now maybe find a profile 

00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:59.699
 Already warned in the near future 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:00.599
 i will definitely hope so 

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.329

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:04.619
 I burned you hope you tied the and 

00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:06.059

00:08:06.059 --> 00:08:08.819
 find the description 

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:10.439
 have taken quietly to the videos and 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.639
 probably while I was at my opponent 

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:12.629
 I have quite simply refused the 

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:14.999
 still to support 

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:18.239
