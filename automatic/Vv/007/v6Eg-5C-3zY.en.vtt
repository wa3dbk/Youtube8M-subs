00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
so this is just so much easier and guess
it<00:01:14.970> might<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.330> slightly<00:01:15.630> difficult<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.540> see<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.990> most<00:01:37.710> buildings<00:01:38.040> there

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
you can see here most buildings there

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
you can see here most buildings there
are<00:01:38.430> some<00:01:38.579> sort<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> window<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.659> there's<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
are some sort of a window or there's a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
are some sort of a window or there's a
hole<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> wall<00:01:40.590> there's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> balcony<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
hole in the wall there's a balcony and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460 
hole in the wall there's a balcony and
then<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.119> basically<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:43.079> fly<00:01:43.320> away

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
then you can basically just fly away

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
then you can basically just fly away
across<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.250> simple<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.479> can

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
across it's that simple and you can

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.600 
across it's that simple and you can
basically<00:01:46.020> fly<00:01:46.680> until<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.159> head<00:01:47.310> hits<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
basically fly until your head hits the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
basically fly until your head hits the
ceiling<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> very<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.899> clever<00:01:49.229> way

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
ceiling and it's a very very clever way

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
ceiling and it's a very very clever way
that<00:01:49.590> track<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.250> innovated<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> put

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that track of actually innovated and put

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
that track of actually innovated and put
this<00:01:51.540> into<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> game<00:01:52.170> because<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.890> can

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
this into the game because not you can

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.039 
this into the game because not you can
fly<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> way<00:01:53.970> into<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> sky<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.840> can

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
fly all the way into the sky but you can

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.139 
fly all the way into the sky but you can
you<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.470> fly<00:01:55.710> obviously<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.549> map<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.790> there

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you can fly obviously this map is there

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.300 
you can fly obviously this map is there
buried<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> says<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.590> tunnels<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.189> it's

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
buried and it says in tunnels and it's

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.859 
buried and it says in tunnels and it's
Underground<00:01:59.700> there's<00:01:59.909> ceilings<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.780> they're

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
Underground there's ceilings so they're

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
Underground there's ceilings so they're
kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.110> giving<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> freedom<00:02:02.340> which

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
kind of giving you this freedom which

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.130 
kind of giving you this freedom which
you've<00:02:02.880> obviously<00:02:03.000> never<00:02:03.240> had<00:02:03.630> before<00:02:03.750> ever

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you've obviously never had before ever

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
you've obviously never had before ever
in<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.680> cool<00:02:04.890> juicy<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.369> able<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.610> fly<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
in a cool juicy be able to fly like this

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.059 
in a cool juicy be able to fly like this
but<00:02:06.899> they're<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.530> giving<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.799> freedom

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
but they're kind of giving you freedom

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.919 
but they're kind of giving you freedom
and<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> limited<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> sense<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.569> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and it's limited in the sense in a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.360 
and it's limited in the sense in a
clever<00:02:10.140> way<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:10.950> not<00:02:10.979> invisible

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
clever way that is not invisible

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.729 
clever way that is not invisible
barriers<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> wall<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.530> yeah

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
barriers and it's just a wall and a yeah

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.360 
barriers and it's just a wall and a yeah
it's<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.069> me

it's just me
able<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> fly<00:02:15.030> around<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.330> place<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.569> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
able to fly around the place and you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
able to fly around the place and you
will<00:02:16.349> need<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.560> gun<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.400> there's<00:02:17.670> nothing

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
will need this gun and there's nothing

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.940 
will need this gun and there's nothing
you<00:02:18.000> need<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.379> unpack

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
you need to do to you this is unpack

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.160 
you need to do to you this is unpack
punch<00:02:20.250> version<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.750> see<00:02:21.780> here

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
punch version and as you can see here

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.479 
punch version and as you can see here
you're<00:02:22.590> basically<00:02:22.739> flying<00:02:23.010> around<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.310> say

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
you're basically flying around and say

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.610 
you're basically flying around and say
the<00:02:23.580> most<00:02:23.760> useful<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.470> you're<00:02:25.530> not

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the most useful thing is that you're not

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.780 
the most useful thing is that you're not
wasting<00:02:25.799> hammer<00:02:26.129> when<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.610> you're

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
wasting hammer when you do this you're

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.539 
wasting hammer when you do this you're
just<00:02:26.819> stays<00:02:27.209> infinite<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.099> as<00:02:29.099> well<00:02:29.310> as<00:02:29.400> being

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
just stays infinite so as well as being

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.280 
just stays infinite so as well as being
able<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.849> kill<00:02:30.030> zombies<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:30.780> very
