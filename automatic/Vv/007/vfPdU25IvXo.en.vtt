00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.099
 droid and I bring you a small preview 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.960
 review more or less reviews 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.960
 a gameplay of number 2 that such comes out 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.980
 In fact right now and good for missions 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.630
 a little bit that they have done that they have 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.759
 changed if they saw is also from the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 series that I'm doing good I do not know if 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.230
 his place first episode 2 in the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.309
 episode 2 we are here lost in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.410
 this strange place that is a stronghold 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:40.320
 and good a ship has a lot the version 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 previous was that railings and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.650
 crops looked like that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.860
 they blinked yes very well in this version 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.070
 of windows no longer already look good no longer 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 they blink and make the bars these 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 the crops 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.690
 also here that was that sound 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 many strange sounds and one in which 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.059
 I recorded basically 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.370
 in this place and heard some sounds 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.070
 strange villagers here or 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.310
 there are two poor in the creative but that 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.229
 can laugh but well I went around a lot 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.869
 and I did not find states to expose to 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.979
 little pig if you can not find it and then 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.380
 the idea right now is pretty much 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.990
 explain to them what change they have fixed 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.880
 they arrange the east east block ship 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.710
 that is not name already says post sun that 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.380
 has names and I the mock follow 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 being mute in the book of heaven what 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.280
 they arranged where you walk in the water and the 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.240
 sky turns dark it has already been repaired 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.290
 because he listened 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.710
 ok that is the inder mans water for has 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 a block in the hand are doing 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 what the fuck are they doing? 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.560
 water is a spammer because there is one in the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 flying cuff 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.030
 and I found a secret place full of 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.090
 ender man wai 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.740
 I miss what I want to find 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.930
 little pigs but this is also great 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.840
 it looks curious interesting and good them 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.550
 It was great to see yesterday I do not know how many 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.380
 minutes in the episode where turns in 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.510
 this place although there is a library 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.880
 I'm here by bus the door to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.650
 doors for being able to see the ports by 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 they can as they are closed there is another 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.800
 bus 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.930
 and in itself I think it 's the news 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.940
 they repaired more what is the burden of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.200
 worlds what is mention yesterday I feel I 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.819
 that separated him good to me no longer 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.010
 they move the worlds corrupted then 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.640
 I think they fixed that 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.540
 wow this place is 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.540
 amazing 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.590
 we want to wait a little bit here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.370
 that there is too much that adds a nice 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.049
 we celebrate here 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 how do you know a library under the 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:05.030
 law mention that it is below the law 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.260
 in which I started the first episode and I 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.510
 I realized because I can not because of 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.790
 I decided to follow the cave and then I finished 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.189
 here 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.870
 and then one does not know how well exposes 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.760
 senerman is very rare 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 and in itself they are the novelties that have 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 brought if the loop the buttons the look 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.159
 of the buttons in case they have a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.690
 vote g or any crop with kitkat it 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.990
 active when the volume goes up or down 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.190
 they are going to see and the buttons are not hidden 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.540
 as they should 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.980
 as you can see I do not know how to buttons 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 vision is normal they stay there for 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.070
 always the buttons and then the ones themselves 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.850
 new blocks some still soundless 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.540
 the new mods continue without sound this 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.520
 that more than more if there is something in my case 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.650
 the book of the clippers was fixed 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.970
 that were exploding late are going to explode the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.970
 world now it already explodes normal 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.480
 some names that were wrong too 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.620
 you are ruled especially this that neither 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.209
 it does not even have a name but others do not 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.560
 they are more written and they fixed 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.860
 and well I think it will be all for this 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.450
 for this mini review as are the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.630
 spoilers 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.680
 It really is so creative because 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.280
 battle enough to find it on 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.930
 product game little character and is that 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.669
 never in my life vision to a business 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.840
 partner, you can see three great not 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:27.260
 know what happens for that and then 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.030
 it's not that they go crazy and well I do not know 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.400
 if here that happens a while ago there will be 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.260
 the sixth episode first the episode 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.510
 in fact the serious episode also the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.300
 turn 1 and blink everything then then 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.639
 it does everything right and you have not 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.050
 seen by this videos because he liked me 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.550
 they say they look for new ones they noticed I do not 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.610
 I know how good the doors to pay 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.620
 things that they did not do before and the buttons 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.389
 they continue to get stuck they should not 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.680
 the burdens of the world in my case of 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.680
 resolution there were no moments that 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:01.449
 then I do not know if you are your solution 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.449
 that 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.360
 but this is incredible we want 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.430
 have it more than anything I think it was touched 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.770
 We liked this video now, yes 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.890
 I go and they tell me what's new 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.630
 they will find the same, I will make an air 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.790
 tests in annexes and there by facebook or 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.740
 for you I will tell you that I found the same or 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.420
 are reporting in the group and then nothing 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.300
 give us the next video 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:27.229
 Hello 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.250
 can leave the many but nothing that 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.250
 the next video 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.680
 although a small pause I withdraw what I said 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.620
 they were added expose the just 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.160
 check here maybe here they are here they are 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.160
 15 this 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.129
 and I do not know if we're going to see if I can put 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.129
 this panchos 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.810
 and they added this before it was not so 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.530
 it's good that they add it for those who 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.620
 we want to try too crazy continue 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.300
 keep pig flying and then almost everything 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.430
 lend life two in the next video 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.750
 the books that the missions are all that 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.400
 I do not like you, I think that also 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.580
 fungi no longer shine the same any 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.580
 thing
