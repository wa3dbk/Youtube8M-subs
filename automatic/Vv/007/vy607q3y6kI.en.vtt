their<00:02:15.790> own<00:02:15.940> garage<00:02:16.540> door<00:02:17.020> opener<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:20.040> race

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
their own garage door opener I race

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.680 
their own garage door opener I race
motorcycles<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> hobby<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.300> when<00:02:22.600> you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
motorcycles as a hobby and when you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.000 
motorcycles as a hobby and when you
first<00:02:22.870> start<00:02:22.990> now<00:02:23.290> you're<00:02:23.530> riding<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.830> same

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
first start now you're riding the same

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.890 
first start now you're riding the same
bike<00:02:24.220> home<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.640> what<00:02:25.240> you<00:02:25.330> took<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> track

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
bike home as what you took to the track

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.470 
bike home as what you took to the track
so<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.470> thought<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.580> know<00:02:27.670> what<00:02:27.820> why<00:02:28.150> not<00:02:28.330> just

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so I thought you know what why not just

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.940 
so I thought you know what why not just
have<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.720> drive<00:02:28.930> strokin<00:02:29.380> when<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.590> pull<00:02:29.770> in

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
have to drive strokin when you pull in

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.620 
have to drive strokin when you pull in
so<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.670> connected<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.240> dots

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
so I connected the dots

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.300 
so I connected the dots
I<00:02:31.690> took<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.930> smartphone<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.470> took<00:02:32.830> some<00:02:33.040> micro

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
I took a smartphone I took some micro

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
I took a smartphone I took some micro
processors<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.570> put<00:02:34.959> them<00:02:35.050> together<00:02:35.170> into

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
processors and I put them together into

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.180 
processors and I put them together into
this<00:02:35.680> product

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
this product

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.040 
this product
the<00:02:36.430> GPS<00:02:36.820> portion<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:37.540> product<00:02:37.959> is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the GPS portion of this product is

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.230 
the GPS portion of this product is
really<00:02:38.290> what<00:02:38.440> sets<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.800> apart<00:02:38.920> once<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.030> set

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
really what sets it apart once you set

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.300 
really what sets it apart once you set
your<00:02:40.270> threshold<00:02:40.510> when<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.320> cross<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.950> will

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
your threshold when you cross it it will

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.220 
your threshold when you cross it it will
automatically<00:02:42.880> open<00:02:42.910> your<00:02:43.209> garage<00:02:43.330> door<00:02:43.690> when

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
automatically open your garage door when

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.020 
automatically open your garage door when
you<00:02:44.380> leave<00:02:44.590> it'll<00:02:45.160> automatically<00:02:45.730> close

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you leave it'll automatically close

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.570 
you leave it'll automatically close
you're<00:02:46.750> really<00:02:47.020> hands-free<00:02:47.410> some<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.519> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
you're really hands-free some of the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.250 
you're really hands-free some of the
products<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.000> on<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.209> market<00:02:49.300> are<00:02:49.750> also<00:02:50.080> able

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
products out on the market are also able

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.810 
products out on the market are also able
to<00:02:50.410> determine<00:02:50.920> whether<00:02:51.040> your<00:02:51.250> garage<00:02:51.400> door<00:02:51.700> is

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
to determine whether your garage door is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.520 
to determine whether your garage door is
open<00:02:52.060> or<00:02:52.120> closed<00:02:52.360> but<00:02:53.080> they<00:02:53.170> do<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
open or closed but they do it in a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.180 
open or closed but they do it in a
different<00:02:53.650> way

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
different way

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.160 
different way
some<00:02:54.790> use<00:02:54.970> raw<00:02:55.209> programming<00:02:55.810> logic<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
some use raw programming logic and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.320 
some use raw programming logic and
others<00:02:56.530> use<00:02:56.739> pressure<00:02:57.010> switches<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.910> problem

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
others use pressure switches the problem

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.880 
others use pressure switches the problem
with<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:58.570> is<00:02:58.810> they<00:02:58.959> cannot<00:02:59.260> detect<00:02:59.650> when

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
with this is they cannot detect when

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.770 
with this is they cannot detect when
your<00:03:00.010> garage<00:03:00.160> door<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.700> only<00:03:00.970> slightly<00:03:01.269> open

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
your garage door is only slightly open

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.110 
your garage door is only slightly open
open<00:03:02.470> me<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.680> different<00:03:02.890> by<00:03:03.550> using<00:03:03.880> sonar

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
open me is different by using sonar

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
open me is different by using sonar
technology<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:05.320> able<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.800> detect<00:03:06.100> whether

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
technology it's able to detect whether

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.370 
technology it's able to detect whether
or<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.760> your<00:03:06.970> garage<00:03:07.180> door<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.630> open<00:03:07.930> even<00:03:08.200> a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
or not your garage door is open even a
