what you'd expect out of a human being
you<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:55.670> shut<00:03:55.879> them<00:03:56.060> off<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:57.170> just<00:03:57.379> say

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
you just shut them off and you just say

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.809 
you just shut them off and you just say
oh<00:03:57.500> they're<00:03:57.739> just<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:57.980> video<00:03:58.099> game<00:03:58.250> character<00:03:58.579> I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
don't need to worry about feeling

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.319 
don't need to worry about feeling
anything<00:04:01.190> about<00:04:01.400> them<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.090> tried<00:04:02.299> a

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
anything about them and so we tried a

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.170 
anything about them and so we tried a
lot<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.599> things<00:04:02.720> we<00:04:03.379> tried<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.739> make<00:04:03.859> Liz<00:04:04.180> have

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
lot of things we tried to make Liz have

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.869 
lot of things we tried to make Liz have
emotions<00:04:06.109> so<00:04:06.769> that<00:04:06.920> she<00:04:07.069> can<00:04:07.280> react<00:04:07.549> to<00:04:07.760> things

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
emotions so that she can react to things

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.550 
emotions so that she can react to things
in<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.120> world<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:08.510> things<00:04:08.659> that<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.930> do<00:04:09.140> for

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
in the world and things that you do for

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.009 
in the world and things that you do for
example<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:10.790> might<00:04:10.970> say<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.450> Liz<00:04:11.629> will<00:04:11.780> feel

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
example we might say that Liz will feel
