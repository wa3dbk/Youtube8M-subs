there<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.039> provides<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.610> heat<00:02:12.360> source<00:02:12.629> for

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
there so it provides a heat source for

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.630 
there so it provides a heat source for
them

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
them

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.350 
them
for<00:02:14.240> when<00:02:14.420> they're<00:02:14.740> want<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.830> chill<00:02:16.070> down

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
for when they're want to chill down

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.850 
for when they're want to chill down
under<00:02:17.360> there<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.810> then<00:02:18.320> after<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.620> got<00:02:18.830> up

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
under there and then after you got up

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.210 
under there and then after you got up
top<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.510> main<00:02:20.720> idea<00:02:21.050> was<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.470> hated<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
top the main idea was that I hated the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
top the main idea was that I hated the
fact<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:23.420> lot<00:02:23.960> of<00:02:23.990> them<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.410> those

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
fact that a lot of them have those

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.620 
fact that a lot of them have those
massive<00:02:25.190> globes<00:02:25.520> that's<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.330> annoying

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
massive globes that's just so annoying

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.070 
massive globes that's just so annoying
that<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.680> looked<00:02:27.920> good<00:02:28.300> that<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.540> poked<00:02:29.840> out

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
that it looked good that just poked out

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.490 
that it looked good that just poked out
from<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:31.280> backs<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:31.970> top<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
from the backs and the top of the

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.410 
from the backs and the top of the
cabinets<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.760> just<00:02:34.910> doesn't<00:02:35.060> look<00:02:35.180> cool

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
cabinets and it just doesn't look cool

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.810 
cabinets and it just doesn't look cool
so<00:02:36.230> what<00:02:37.040> I've<00:02:37.160> done<00:02:37.280> is<00:02:37.340> I've<00:02:37.580> got<00:02:37.670> these

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
so what I've done is I've got these

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.700 
so what I've done is I've got these
ceramic<00:02:38.240> tiles<00:02:38.480> I've<00:02:38.840> fastened<00:02:39.290> them<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.560> the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
ceramic tiles I've fastened them to the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.110 
ceramic tiles I've fastened them to the
sides<00:02:39.980> there<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.030> these<00:02:41.750> shelves<00:02:42.140> used<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> be

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
sides there and these shelves used to be

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.160 
sides there and these shelves used to be
attached<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.390> wings<00:02:44.630> there<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:44.900> can<00:02:45.020> see

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
attached to the wings there you can see

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.000 
attached to the wings there you can see
where<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.320> cut<00:02:45.530> them<00:02:45.710> off

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
where I cut them off

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.130 
where I cut them off
and<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.760> put<00:02:47.000> them<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.270> there<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.570> painted<00:02:47.960> them

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
and I put them in there and painted them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.100 
and I put them in there and painted them
on<00:02:48.260> top<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.130> these<00:02:49.250> shelves<00:02:49.550> if<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.570> open<00:02:50.960> this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
on top of these shelves if I open this

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.730 
on top of these shelves if I open this
up

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.840 

hopefully<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.920> will<00:02:55.010> stay<00:02:55.250> up<00:02:55.400> for<00:02:55.580> me

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
hopefully that will stay up for me

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.449 
hopefully that will stay up for me
you<00:02:56.270> can<00:02:56.390> see<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.780> I've<00:02:56.900> wrapped<00:02:57.370> heat<00:02:58.370> cord

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
you can see that I've wrapped heat cord

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.570 
you can see that I've wrapped heat cord
around<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.790> top<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:04.250> form<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:05.230> heat<00:03:06.230> pad

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
around the top to form a heat pad

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.199 
around the top to form a heat pad
basically<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.300> now<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.570> can<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:10.209> mates

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
basically so now you can see mates

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.210 
basically so now you can see mates
absolutely<00:03:11.930> loving<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.530> they<00:03:12.830> do<00:03:12.890> they

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
absolutely loving it and they do they

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.300 
absolutely loving it and they do they
love<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.580> they<00:03:13.970> love<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.240> there<00:03:15.100> so<00:03:16.100> it's<00:03:16.250> a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
love it they love it there so it's a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.940 
love it they love it there so it's a
heat<00:03:16.520> source<00:03:16.700> it's<00:03:16.970> actually<00:03:17.240> wrapped<00:03:17.480> behind

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
heat source it's actually wrapped behind

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.390 
heat source it's actually wrapped behind
that<00:03:18.950> tile<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.489> well<00:03:20.560> it's<00:03:21.560> using<00:03:21.980> those<00:03:22.100> hooks

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
that tile as well it's using those hooks

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.360 
that tile as well it's using those hooks
it's<00:03:22.730> wrapped<00:03:23.060> behind<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.750> on<00:03:23.840> top<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.040> he<00:03:25.220> has

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
it's wrapped behind and on top so he has

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.840 
it's wrapped behind and on top so he has
even<00:03:25.790> heat<00:03:26.060> from<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.510> side<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.110> from<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.560> top

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
even heat from the side and from the top

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.350 
even heat from the side and from the top
so<00:03:28.850> it's<00:03:28.970> basically<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.739> little<00:03:31.070> a<00:03:31.519> little

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
so it's basically like a little a little

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.500 
so it's basically like a little a little
sauna<00:03:32.780> in<00:03:32.989> there<00:03:33.200> for<00:03:33.620> him<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:37.209> I'll<00:03:38.209> just

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510

used<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:45.010> incandescent<00:03:46.010> globes<00:03:46.670> they're

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
used the incandescent globes they're

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.050 
used the incandescent globes they're
just<00:03:47.750> useless<00:03:48.170> they<00:03:48.440> don't<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:49.519> just<00:03:49.550> create

just useless they don't they just create
too<00:03:50.180> much<00:03:50.330> heat<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.930> there<00:03:51.110> that<00:03:51.950> have<00:03:52.340> that

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459
