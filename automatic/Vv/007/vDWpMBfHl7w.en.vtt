00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
will go over awesome quality a lot of

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.610 
will go over awesome quality a lot of
your<00:02:43.060> inferior<00:02:43.510> grills<00:02:43.780> they<00:02:43.990> have<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> couple

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
screws that screw into some cheap wood

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.930 
screws that screw into some cheap wood
that<00:02:47.320> rot<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.739> your<00:02:47.860> handle<00:02:48.130> becomes<00:02:48.459> useless

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
that rot and your handle becomes useless

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.250 
that rot and your handle becomes useless
after<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.300> few<00:02:49.570> months<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> you've<00:02:52.840> got<00:02:53.020> your

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
after a few months and you've got your

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.699 
after a few months and you've got your
bottom<00:02:54.010> piece<00:02:54.250> right<00:02:54.489> here<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.350> look<00:02:56.500> at<00:02:56.590> that

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
bottom piece right here and look at that

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.810 
bottom piece right here and look at that
it's<00:02:56.920> got<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.070> thing<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.459> regulate<00:02:57.850> oxygen<00:02:58.420> flow

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
it's got a thing to regulate oxygen flow

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.000 
it's got a thing to regulate oxygen flow
which<00:03:00.820> is<00:03:00.970> really<00:03:01.209> nice

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.640 

and<00:03:06.010> then<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.700> other<00:03:06.730> nice<00:03:07.060> touch

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
and then this is the other nice touch

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.000 
and then this is the other nice touch
the<00:03:08.650> piece<00:03:08.890> of<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> grill<00:03:09.460> that<00:03:09.730> goes<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:10.300> your

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the piece of the grill that goes in your

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.790 
the piece of the grill that goes in your
bottom<00:03:12.010> part<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.810> coals<00:03:14.170> sit<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.620> it

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
bottom part so that the coals sit on it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.430 
bottom part so that the coals sit on it
because<00:03:15.100> in<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.280> lot<00:03:15.460> of<00:03:15.490> these<00:03:15.670> cheap<00:03:15.940> grills

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
because in a lot of these cheap grills

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.230 
because in a lot of these cheap grills
your<00:03:17.440> coals<00:03:17.770> are<00:03:18.040> resting<00:03:18.460> directly<00:03:18.730> on<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
your coals are resting directly on the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.780 
your coals are resting directly on the
grill<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.630> that's<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.900> problem<00:03:20.140> because<00:03:20.790> what

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
grill and that's a problem because what

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.360 
grill and that's a problem because what
can<00:03:21.910> happen<00:03:21.970> they're<00:03:22.450> not<00:03:22.690> only<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.380> flavors

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
can happen they're not only the flavors

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.990 
can happen they're not only the flavors
of<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.320> paint<00:03:26.650> on<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.130> inferior

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
grill you know that can melt and tarnish

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.120 
grill you know that can melt and tarnish
the<00:03:31.300> taste<00:03:31.840> of<00:03:32.020> your<00:03:32.170> meat<00:03:32.350> or<00:03:32.590> vegetables<00:03:33.040> or
