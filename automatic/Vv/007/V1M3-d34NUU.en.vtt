00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
end up with this ribbon 3 strand ribbon

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.910 
end up with this ribbon 3 strand ribbon
back<00:00:49.920> strand<00:00:50.250> or<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.910> easier<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.510> B<00:00:51.960> C<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.590> D

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
back strand or a bit easier a B C and D

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.369 
back strand or a bit easier a B C and D
this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> setup<00:00:54.030> for<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> flat<00:00:54.719> four<00:00:55.020> strand

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this is the setup for a flat four strand

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
this is the setup for a flat four strand
braid<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> idea<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.030> strand<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
braid so the idea is to take strand a

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.069 
braid so the idea is to take strand a
and<00:00:57.870> weave<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:58.949> strand<00:00:59.399> B<00:00:59.699> under<00:01:00.059> C<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and weave it over strand B under C and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:10.010 
and weave it over strand B under C and
then<00:01:01.350> over<00:01:01.800> D<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:02.940> over<00:01:03.780> B

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.800 

now<00:01:10.590> under<00:01:10.979> C<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:16.369> lastly<00:01:17.369> over<00:01:17.520> D<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
now under C and lastly over D so the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
now under C and lastly over D so the
strands<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.590> moved<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.250> spot<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
strands have all moved over one spot and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.859 
strands have all moved over one spot and
the<00:01:21.210> first<00:01:21.509> trend<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.140> B<00:01:22.530> C<00:01:23.430> D<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the first trend is now B C D and then a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200 
the first trend is now B C D and then a
but<00:01:25.409> who<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.770> gives<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.220> sh<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.430> knit<00:01:26.670> it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
but who really gives a sh is knit it's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
but who really gives a sh is knit it's
all<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> make<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.560> easier<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
all in the same so to make it easier the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
all in the same so to make it easier the
Strand<00:01:29.640> closest<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> face<00:01:30.539> will<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
Strand closest to the face will and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.490 
Strand closest to the face will and
forever<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.860> strand<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.929> again<00:01:33.929> you'll<00:01:34.170> repeat

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
forever be strand a again you'll repeat

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.570 
forever be strand a again you'll repeat
the<00:01:34.710> same<00:01:34.979> thing

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
the same thing

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.169 
the same thing
so<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:36.030> strand<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.899> weave<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.619> over<00:01:37.920> B

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
so take strand a and weave it over B

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:49.669 
so take strand a and weave it over B
under<00:01:39.179> C<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.350> over<00:01:40.740> D<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:48.020> again<00:01:49.020> strand

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
under C and then over D and again strand

00:01:49.679 --> 00:02:00.740 
under C and then over D and again strand
a<00:01:49.830> goes<00:01:50.130> over<00:01:50.520> B<00:01:54.140> under<00:01:55.140> C<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:58.670> over<00:01:59.670> D<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.090> all

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a goes over B under C and over D so all

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480 
a goes over B under C and over D so all
the<00:02:01.110> strands<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.619> moved<00:02:01.860> over<00:02:02.130> once<00:02:02.340> more

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the strands have moved over once more
