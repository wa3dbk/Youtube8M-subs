00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
such as when i was in Skyrim a lot of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
times conversations would break because

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.450 
times conversations would break because

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
mid-battle and then the quest would get

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
mid-battle and then the quest would get
all<00:01:10.350> glitched<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:11.040> i<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.850> if

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
all glitched out i would like it if

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
all glitched out i would like it if
perhaps<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.930> added<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.380> type<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> AI<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
perhaps they added some type of AI to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
perhaps they added some type of AI to
allow<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> wait<00:01:15.570> until<00:01:15.720> battles<00:01:16.200> are

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
allow them to wait until battles are

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
allow them to wait until battles are
complete<00:01:16.680> before<00:01:17.009> speaking<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> me<00:01:17.670> stuff

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
like that I'd also like it if they

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.429

maybe some cuts in the arm you know
something<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.680> know<00:04:10.710> is<00:04:10.830> that<00:04:11.100> my<00:04:11.520> strength

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
something you know is that my strength

is<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.360> I<00:04:12.570> think<00:04:12.900> it'd<00:04:12.990> be<00:04:13.020> cool<00:04:13.290> because<00:04:13.530> it

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
is up I think it'd be cool because it

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.960 
is up I think it'd be cool because it
would<00:04:13.800> kind<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.010> distinguish<00:04:14.490> your<00:04:14.610> character

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
would kind of distinguish your character

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.370 
would kind of distinguish your character
from<00:04:15.120> other<00:04:15.360> characters<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.020> I<00:04:16.049> think<00:04:16.230> that's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
from other characters and I think that's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.930 
from other characters and I think that's
one<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.620> more<00:04:16.739> unique<00:04:16.920> things<00:04:17.310> about<00:04:17.400> rpgs

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
one of the more unique things about rpgs

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.420 
one of the more unique things about rpgs
aside<00:04:18.450> from<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.750> way<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:18.930> just<00:04:19.320> look<00:04:19.590> perhaps

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
aside from the way I just look perhaps

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.550 
aside from the way I just look perhaps
my<00:04:20.580> skills<00:04:20.940> will<00:04:21.120> also<00:04:21.390> influence<00:04:21.630> how<00:04:22.169> I<00:04:22.200> look

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
my skills will also influence how I look

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.890 
my skills will also influence how I look
so<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.550> sit

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.990 
so just to sit
wish<00:04:24.110> but<00:04:24.380> one<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.800> I<00:04:24.979> think<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.639> can<00:04:25.790> really

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
wish but one that I think we can really

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.430 
wish but one that I think we can really
develop<00:04:26.150> on<00:04:26.509> especially<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:27.139> what<00:04:27.320> he<00:04:27.410> did

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
develop on especially like what he did

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.379 
develop on especially like what he did
were<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.740> know<00:04:28.040> if<00:04:28.310> my<00:04:28.520> repair<00:04:28.940> scale<00:04:29.270> or

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
were you know if my repair scale or

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.580 
were you know if my repair scale or
whatever<00:04:29.660> is<00:04:29.780> high<00:04:29.900> enough<00:04:30.050> I<00:04:30.259> could<00:04:30.320> take

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
whatever is high enough I could take

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.590 
whatever is high enough I could take
pre-existing<00:04:31.220> headwear<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.580> add<00:04:31.850> stuff<00:04:32.389> on

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
pre-existing headwear and add stuff on

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.840 
pre-existing headwear and add stuff on
to<00:04:32.840> it<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.710> stuff<00:04:34.100> we<00:04:34.220> kind<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.550> briefly

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
to it so that stuff we kind of briefly

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.340 
to it so that stuff we kind of briefly
discussed<00:04:35.240> before<00:04:35.539> but<00:04:35.690> he<00:04:35.810> has<00:04:35.900> a<00:04:35.930> good<00:04:36.169> idea

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
discussed before but he has a good idea

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.650 
discussed before but he has a good idea
of<00:04:36.560> where<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.889> go<00:04:37.130> with<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.910> you<00:04:38.330> guys<00:04:38.509> have

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
of where to go with it so you guys have

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.330

any other skill based ideas and that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.279 
any other skill based ideas and that

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
imagine that you know you stumble upon a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.020 
imagine that you know you stumble upon a
vault<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.830> like<00:05:07.250> they're<00:05:07.430> like<00:05:07.669> where<00:05:07.910> did

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
vault and like they're like where did

vault and like they're like where did
you<00:05:08.150> even<00:05:08.240> come<00:05:08.539> from<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:09.020> know<00:05:09.139> like<00:05:09.320> I

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
absolutely startle them they have no

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.330 
absolutely startle them they have no
idea<00:05:11.990> what's<00:05:12.260> happened<00:05:12.710> since<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.130> bombs

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
idea what's happened since the bombs

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580 
idea what's happened since the bombs
fell<00:05:13.699> or<00:05:13.970> since<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.360> alarm<00:05:14.449> on<00:05:14.900> they've<00:05:15.410> been

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
fell or since that alarm on they've been

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.890 
fell or since that alarm on they've been
every<00:05:15.919> like<00:05:16.190> a<00:05:16.310> ok<00:05:16.849> since<00:05:17.240> then<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:17.660> I<00:05:17.720> just

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
every like a ok since then and I just

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.360 
every like a ok since then and I just
come<00:05:18.080> in<00:05:18.229> and<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.500> essentially<00:05:19.099> ruin

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
come in and I essentially ruin

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.339 
come in and I essentially ruin
everything<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:20.000> think<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.840> would<00:05:20.900> be<00:05:20.960> so<00:05:21.320> cool

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
everything I think that would be so cool

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.070 
everything I think that would be so cool
because<00:05:22.099> every<00:05:22.610> vault<00:05:22.880> in<00:05:23.090> fall<00:05:23.389> is<00:05:23.599> different

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
because every vault in fall is different

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.870 
because every vault in fall is different
it<00:05:24.169> has<00:05:24.199> their<00:05:24.440> own<00:05:24.470> story<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.280> has<00:05:25.610> gotten

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
it has their own story and has gotten

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.610 
it has their own story and has gotten
the<00:05:25.940> shit<00:05:26.120> in<00:05:26.240> some<00:05:26.479> way<00:05:26.690> and<00:05:26.900> some<00:05:27.410> vaults

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
the shit in some way and some vaults

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.260 
the shit in some way and some vaults
actually<00:05:28.010> do<00:05:28.160> come<00:05:28.340> out<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.520> a<00:05:28.699> degree<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:29.030> bit

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
actually do come out to a degree a bit

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.450 
actually do come out to a degree a bit
successful<00:05:29.930> but<00:05:30.410> I<00:05:30.650> feel<00:05:31.070> like<00:05:31.190> it<00:05:31.280> would<00:05:31.370> be

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
successful but I feel like it would be

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.700 
successful but I feel like it would be
really<00:05:31.639> cool<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.000> one<00:05:32.900> vault<00:05:33.139> was<00:05:33.320> just<00:05:33.500> so

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
really cool if one vault was just so

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.260 
really cool if one vault was just so
untouched<00:05:34.099> that<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.430> only<00:05:34.639> way<00:05:34.970> it<00:05:35.150> could

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
untouched that the only way it could

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.730 
untouched that the only way it could
truly<00:05:35.449> be<00:05:35.599> influenced<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.229> if<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.530> actually

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
truly be influenced is if I actually

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.670 
truly be influenced is if I actually
explore<00:05:37.400> inside<00:05:37.580> here<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.090> in<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.599> way<00:05:38.780> it<00:05:39.050> kind

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
explore inside here and in a way it kind

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.860 
explore inside here and in a way it kind
of<00:05:39.710> was<00:05:39.860> like<00:05:39.889> in<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.310> very<00:05:40.970> weird<00:05:41.060> way<00:05:41.570> kind<00:05:41.810> of

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
of was like in a very weird way kind of

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.240 
of was like in a very weird way kind of
telling<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.169> that<00:05:42.320> exploring<00:05:42.800> was<00:05:42.949> bad

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
telling you that exploring was bad

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.370 
telling you that exploring was bad
because<00:05:43.550> I<00:05:43.940> went<00:05:44.360> too<00:05:44.570> far<00:05:44.840> and<00:05:45.020> I<00:05:45.080> went<00:05:45.289> inside

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
because I went too far and I went inside

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.290 
because I went too far and I went inside
this<00:05:45.650> vault<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:46.130> I've<00:05:46.220> changed<00:05:46.610> everyone's

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
this vault and I've changed everyone's

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.750 
this vault and I've changed everyone's
lives<00:05:47.510> and<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:48.590> think<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.099> would<00:05:49.220> be<00:05:49.280> really<00:05:49.490> cool

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
lives and I think I would be really cool

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.010
