00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.410
 since marco polo brought noodles from 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.480
 China 700 years ago 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.639
 the pasta fought the places it became just 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 the world is so popular pasta 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.559
 acquired when in the 15th century they occupied 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.179
 first place in italian cuisine from 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.100
 spaggeti yes a linguine 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.439
 eyes not to feathers and and the list is possible 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.140
 continue to the pasta 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.180
 usually made from cereals a cup of water 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.689
 the vault holds over 30 tons of mana 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.240
 cereals and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.779
 derived from durum wheat cereal 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.779
 amber color 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.960
 kruploka passes through 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.300
 high speed pre-mixer 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.290
 which she vigorously mixes with 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.000
 water for 5 to 10 seconds 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.550
 This unit can handle from 1 to 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 2 tons of semolina per hour dough 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.540
 extracted from the pre-mixer 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.000
 and falls in 1 paddle mixer with 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.739
 free access of air then dough 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.470
 fits in this vacuum paddle 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.989
 all the mixture can now be passed through 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.460
 brass shaped here it does spaghetti a 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.050
 this is morpho ice 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.670
 very narrow i'm crap these forms are used 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.160
 for making long sinks 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.820
 the stars for the soup are also cross and digalo 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.979
 dough put suppression forms it 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.190
 rotating blade cut out 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.789
 about 12,000 spirals a minute that is 720 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.789
 thousand per hour 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.560
 spirals are soft then the dough is still fresh 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.200
 they dry up on this people 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.060
 and now go to the lasagna dough 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.860
 passes through this brass shape then 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.170
 107 fresh dough 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.480
 centimeters are placed on these rods where 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.750
 pasta dry at 65 degrees 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.520
 Celsius they dry vertical therefore 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.520
 retain wonderful flat shape 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.119
 after 15 hours of drying hair and 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.119
 cut into 4 cups 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.560
 to minimize losses make 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.209
 process easier scissors cut pieces 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.780
 test to the same length right us 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.480
 technician 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.480
 the long process of drying the lasagna begins 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.530
 after drying lasagna finally cut 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.390
 Now it is ready for packaging when 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 making other pasta mix you need 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.739
 handle differently to give it 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.269
 the required form of dough passes under this 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.900
 roller which roll it up 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:52.069
 the required thickness is now preparing butterflies 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.129
 this shape cuts out seven and a half 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.599
 thousand butterflies a minute ie 450,000 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.069
 portion width dough sheet 61 centimeters 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:07.190
 they are made continuous 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:09.409
 send everything straight into butterfly shape 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.170
 fall on the conveyor to dry and then 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.640
 pass the next stage of production 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.849
 some short pasta such as 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.410
 these butterflies and spirals need drying 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.500
 therefore puts in this drying 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.500
 apparatus 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.530
 at the outlet of the drying apparatus pasta 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.870
 already hardened and ready to pack a 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.300
 here we see how it is produced itself 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.980
 popular and spaghetti like lasagna 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.980
 spaghetti and dried vertically 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.040
 now this machine puts spaghetti on 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 cutting table and gives them the right 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.780
 the length of the spaggeti is ready to pack exact 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.209
 the amount is determined by the computer 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.930
 then spaggeti gently lowers 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.930
 so the complaint 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.720
 a portion of spaghetti is transported and poured out 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.250
 using this moving container 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.280
 spaghetti go down so the complaint is to 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.560
 facilitate packing in this minute 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.699
 the machine can pack 10 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.160
 kilogram tank but if necessary 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.160
 he is able to accelerate to 60 packs a minute 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.070
 This factory produces over 100 different 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.440
 varieties of pasta and every day 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.730
 processes up to 360 tons of cereals 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.100
 after all macaroni 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.100
 this is the favorite dish of the whole world
