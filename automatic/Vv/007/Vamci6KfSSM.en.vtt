 droid your android channel i want 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.110
 show you how I have configured the 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.300
 personalized my android device 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.980
 I currently have the Samsung Galaxy No 4 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.259
 in the android version removes the last 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.939
 official update we are waiting 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.140
 what is the deployment giving to the Olympus 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.180
 that arrives that Spain unfortunately 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.560
 I have purchased this device for 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.910
 through operators so I'll have to 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.610
 wait a little longer for the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.259
 update let's start with the 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.610
 lock screen and I currently have 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.680
 an application that is called local site 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.790
 that you can find it totally free 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.160
 in google play as you can observe 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.679
 It has a very striking visual appearance 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 really minimalist as you can 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.980
 observe that I have notifications and 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.809
 we move it to the right as the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.699
 will open the application directly 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.010
 we have the notifications and we do it 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.480
 to the left as it will eliminate and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.219
 will remove also in what is the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.410
 blurred of the image I had of 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.030
 background as you can see the application is 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.070
 very good I recommend it fatalist you read 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.570
 on your android now to unlock 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.399
 Well, you have what the effect is like 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.749
 here as you can see here 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 we can also put the effect of 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.930
 android lollipop that will depend on 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.820
 everyone likes the time 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.650
 install 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.210
 now I will give you a tour of what is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.830
 my device as you can see 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.450
 I have a desktop background what more 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.970
 I use are of nature but they are 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.590
 a little clarity not that they are very well 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450
 very clear since it is a bit annoying 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 view I only have a single screen of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.570
 desktop I do not have applications 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.490
 additional installed, let alone 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.090
 about the device widget I do not 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.009
 like 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.390
 install what are customizations already 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.090
 that at the time we have a launcher 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.400
 additional because that consumes a little more 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.229
 of battery and then only personally 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.820
 I recommend you can also observe 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.380
 that I have divided the applications by 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.869
 social media messaging sections 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.340
 multimedia and utilities if we go into what 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.390
 what are social networks can we see 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.000
 I have what is facebook 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.390

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
