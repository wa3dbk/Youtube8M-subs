shopping mall built I think in the early
1900s<00:03:35.710> but<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.130> don't<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:36.580> what<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.760> right

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
1900s but I don't know what the right

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.970 
1900s but I don't know what the right
architectural<00:03:37.570> term<00:03:38.020> is<00:03:38.260> Art<00:03:38.440> Deco<00:03:38.650> or

architectural term is Art Deco or

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.140 
architectural term is Art Deco or
something<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.610> quite<00:03:39.790> what<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.000> is

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
something I don't know quite what it is

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.430 
something I don't know quite what it is
but<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.480> early<00:03:41.050> 1900s<00:03:41.860> now<00:03:42.760> it<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.630> not<00:03:44.080> not

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
but it's early 1900s now it is not not

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.110 
but it's early 1900s now it is not not
functioning<00:03:44.950> anymore<00:03:45.160> as<00:03:45.520> a<00:03:45.580> shopping<00:03:45.790> mall

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.340 
but the production took it over and the
interior<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.690> shopping<00:03:49.959> mall<00:03:50.080> has

differently layers going up and off

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.580 
differently layers going up and off
those<00:03:57.430> balconies<00:03:57.640> they<00:03:58.090> put<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.959> doors<00:03:59.350> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
those balconies they put the doors of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.520 
those balconies they put the doors of
various<00:03:59.950> rooms<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:01.170> staircase<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.410> was

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
various rooms and staircase so it was

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.010
