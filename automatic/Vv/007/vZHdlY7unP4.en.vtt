00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 good day with you channel master secret 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.470
 at the request of the subscriber jon jones 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.990
 LED power circuit is published from 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.660
 one battery without winding 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 core transformer for operation 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.760
 we need copper wire 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 diameter 0 3 0 4 mm let's start 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.490
 Here we have a manâ€™s water 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.420
 smaller and reel on it 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:38.550
 We will organize 30 turns of wire on 30 tags 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:42.170
 just such a loop and keep winding 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.170
 another 30 turns 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.059
 3 result we get 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.469
 and you need to fix the tape 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.469
 anal sex immediately spill 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:25.299
 completely wind up the hall coil pins 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.299
 you need to be stripping the wires and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.170
 cover with solder 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.590
 so do all three wires 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.460
 now the most interesting moment we 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.460
 let's collect this scheme 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:02:00.880
 solder the resistor soldered wire 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:05.680
 power positive take the transistor 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.479
 In this case , the transistor is applied in 1815 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.970
 so olive his next when viewed 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.080
 marking the top it will be on the left and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:31.360
 sweeps in the center of the collector on the right base 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:34.360
 base solder millimeter pripyat 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.360
 negatively 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.390
 electro kill and tight us format 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.630
 take the LED must be 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.100
 observe polarity 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:20.150
 connect it one pin LEDs 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:20.630
 connect the collector second output to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.430
 emitter 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.730
 and to the power supply minus but it happened 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.730
 thing 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:43.240
 check we take the battery planted 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:43.240
 jacen 1 volt gives you everything plus minus 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:53.510
 scheme earned immediately started collected 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.880
 right as you can see 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.910
 voltage converter on one 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.700
 ferrite - free transistor 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.360
 core rings and so on is enough 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.360
 have copper wire 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.320
 if you like this theme then the secret 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.400
 wizard will continue publishing 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.100
 use of such a circuit 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.590
 solutions for building others 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.300
 interesting electronic homemade 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.060
 do not forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.870
