good<00:00:00.450> morning<00:00:00.840> soldiers<00:00:01.230> today<00:00:01.530> we're<00:00:01.680> gonna

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
good morning soldiers today we're gonna

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.020 
good morning soldiers today we're gonna
examine<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.310> third<00:00:02.460> tier<00:00:02.730> perk<00:00:03.000> called

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
examine the third tier perk called

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
examine the third tier perk called
awareness<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.899> black<00:00:04.110> ops<00:00:04.350> 2<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.770> see<00:00:05.250> if

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
awareness and black ops 2 and see if

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.010 
awareness and black ops 2 and see if
it's<00:00:05.490> effective<00:00:06.000> enough<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.299> earn<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> spot<00:00:06.839> in

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
it's effective enough to earn a spot in

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:22.849 
it's effective enough to earn a spot in
your<00:00:07.379> loadout<00:00:20.930> so<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.050> notice<00:00:22.380> right<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
your loadout so we notice right from the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.470 
your loadout so we notice right from the
start<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.250> awareness<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.939> last<00:00:24.180> third

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
start that awareness is the last third

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
start that awareness is the last third
tier<00:00:24.660> perk<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.109> unlocked<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> think

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
tier perk to be unlocked and I think

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.529 
tier perk to be unlocked and I think
that<00:00:26.039> entices<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.609> lot<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.939> us<00:00:27.029> including

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that entices a lot of us including

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.570 
that entices a lot of us including
myself<00:00:27.859> especially<00:00:28.859> since<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.189> noticed<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
myself especially since we noticed that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
myself especially since we noticed that
sound<00:00:29.939> whoring<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.359> black<00:00:30.570> ops<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.170> pretty

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
sound whoring and black ops do is pretty

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.920 
sound whoring and black ops do is pretty
difficult<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.369> unreliable<00:00:32.780> even<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
difficult and unreliable even with a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
difficult and unreliable even with a
pair<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> astro<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> 50s<00:00:35.010> which<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.489> use

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
pair of astro a 50s which is what I use

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.549 
pair of astro a 50s which is what I use
you<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.210> can't<00:00:36.420> always<00:00:36.600> rely<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> sound

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you just can't always rely on the sound

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.319 
you just can't always rely on the sound
of<00:00:37.680> footsteps<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.190> indicate<00:00:38.520> exactly<00:00:39.149> where<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of footsteps to indicate exactly where a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.819 
of footsteps to indicate exactly where a
player<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.840> much<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> couldn't<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:40.770> to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
player is much like you couldn't want to

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.450 
player is much like you couldn't want to
work<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.100> too

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
work there too

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.340 
work there too
so<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.300> level<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.840> look<00:00:42.989> forward<00:00:43.290> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so as we level off we look forward to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.110 
so as we level off we look forward to
using<00:00:43.469> awareness<00:00:44.040> boasting<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.030> can

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
using awareness boasting that it can

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.029 
using awareness boasting that it can
make<00:00:45.270> enemy<00:00:45.629> movements<00:00:45.989> easier<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> hear<00:00:46.710> but

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
make enemy movements easier to hear but

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.549 
make enemy movements easier to hear but
the<00:00:47.129> question<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.640> how<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.329> easier<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.350> let's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the question is how much easier so let's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
the question is how much easier so let's
take<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> look<00:00:49.980> first<00:00:50.940> let's<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> listen<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
take a look first let's take a listen to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.240 
take a look first let's take a listen to
what<00:00:51.809> enemy<00:00:52.289> player<00:00:52.500> movements<00:00:52.890> sound<00:00:53.100> like

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
what enemy player movements sound like

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:07.500 
what enemy player movements sound like
without<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.149> awareness<00:00:54.239> perk

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.000 

that's<00:01:08.510> pretty<00:01:08.720> quiet<00:01:08.990> as<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.470> not<00:01:09.860> only

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
that's pretty quiet as it is not only

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.260 
that's pretty quiet as it is not only
can't<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.430> hear<00:01:10.700> them<00:01:10.820> until<00:01:11.090> they<00:01:11.150> get

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
can't you hear them until they get

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270 
can't you hear them until they get
within<00:01:11.450> ten<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.840> twenty<00:01:12.170> feet<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.590> but<00:01:13.190> you

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
within ten to twenty feet of you but you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.310 
within ten to twenty feet of you but you
also<00:01:13.520> have<00:01:13.880> no<00:01:14.150> ability<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.780> tell<00:01:14.990> what

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
also have no ability to tell what

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.109 
also have no ability to tell what
surface<00:01:15.740> they're<00:01:15.920> on<00:01:16.040> there's<00:01:16.340> no<00:01:16.520> discerning

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
surface they're on there's no discerning

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.999 
surface they're on there's no discerning
sounds<00:01:17.750> between<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.200> surfaces<00:01:18.680> I<00:01:18.830> should

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
sounds between the surfaces I should

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.070 
sounds between the surfaces I should
hear<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.580> clinking<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.060> wood<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.509> that's<00:01:20.930> not

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
hear the clinking of wood and that's not

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.690 
hear the clinking of wood and that's not
the<00:01:21.259> case<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:21.710> let's<00:01:22.220> take<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.369> listen<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:22.640> what

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
the case so let's take a listen to what

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:42.230 
the case so let's take a listen to what
this<00:01:22.820> sounds<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:23.240> with<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.960> awareness<00:01:24.140> Berg

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 

so<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.380> only<00:01:43.560> does<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.799> make<00:01:43.979> enemy<00:01:44.310> movements

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so not only does it make enemy movements

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.640 
so not only does it make enemy movements
louder<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.420> also<00:01:45.810> tells<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.470> type<00:01:46.619> of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
louder it also tells you what type of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.469 
louder it also tells you what type of
surface<00:01:47.100> are<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.430> by<00:01:47.580> changing<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> actual

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
surface are on by changing the actual

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.930 
surface are on by changing the actual
sound<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.380> their<00:01:49.920> footsteps<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.490> match<00:01:50.700> what

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
sound of their footsteps to match what

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.310 
sound of their footsteps to match what
surface<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.510> whereas<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.170> not

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
surface they're on whereas you do not

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
surface they're on whereas you do not
have<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.830> ability<00:01:53.070> without<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:54.180> perk<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
have that ability without this perk so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.420 
have that ability without this perk so
let's<00:01:55.320> take<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> listen<00:01:55.650> on<00:01:55.830> some<00:01:56.009> multiple

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
let's take a listen on some multiple

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.680 
let's take a listen on some multiple
different<00:01:56.610> surfaces<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.509> how<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
different surfaces and see how the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:10.190 
different surfaces and see how the
noises<00:01:57.900> change<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.450> seems<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.780> me<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
noises change so it seems to me like the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.420 
noises change so it seems to me like the
awareness<00:02:10.530> perk<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:11.009> much<00:02:11.160> brings

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
awareness perk pretty much brings

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.460 
awareness perk pretty much brings
footstep<00:02:11.880> sounds<00:02:12.270> back<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.930> modern<00:02:13.140> warfare<00:02:13.290> 2

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
footstep sounds back to modern warfare 2

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.350 
footstep sounds back to modern warfare 2
and<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:14.250> found<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.610> really<00:02:14.640> interesting<00:02:14.970> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and I found it really interesting that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.840 
and I found it really interesting that
they<00:02:15.480> only<00:02:15.660> incorporate<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:17.010> incorporate<00:02:17.820> I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
they only incorporate and incorporate I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
they only incorporate and incorporate I
should<00:02:18.120> say<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.690> appropriate<00:02:19.260> surface

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
should say the appropriate surface

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.430 
should say the appropriate surface
sounds<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.820> when<00:02:20.970> using<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.540> perk<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
sounds for when using this perk only and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.080 
sounds for when using this perk only and
that<00:02:23.070> it<00:02:23.190> serves<00:02:23.310> more<00:02:23.640> than<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.000> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that it serves more than just to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
that it serves more than just to
increase<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> level<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.230> those<00:02:25.380> sounds<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.519> is

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
increase the level of those sounds so is

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.860 
increase the level of those sounds so is
it<00:02:26.790> worth<00:02:26.940> your<00:02:27.090> third<00:02:27.239> tier<00:02:27.450> perk<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it worth your third tier perk on a

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.440 
it worth your third tier perk on a
regular<00:02:28.140> basis<00:02:28.530> probably<00:02:29.100> not<00:02:29.280> but<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.150> found

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
regular basis probably not but I found

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.880 
regular basis probably not but I found
it<00:02:30.600> very<00:02:30.630> interesting<00:02:31.019> especially<00:02:31.410> when<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
it very interesting especially when I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.520 
it very interesting especially when I
combined<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.400> with<00:02:32.430> dead<00:02:32.670> silence<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:34.080> think

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
combined it with dead silence I think

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.720 
combined it with dead silence I think
it's<00:02:34.620> gonna<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.890> great<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.340> Search<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
it's gonna be great for Search and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.100 
it's gonna be great for Search and
Destroy<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.300> some<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.570> your<00:02:36.750> very

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
Destroy and some of your very

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.259 
Destroy and some of your very
competitive<00:02:37.860> matchups<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.209> know

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
competitive matchups but I want to know

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.120 
competitive matchups but I want to know
what<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:40.140> awareness<00:02:40.709> worth<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
what you think is awareness worth the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650 
what you think is awareness worth the
price<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> admission<00:02:41.519> into<00:02:42.120> your<00:02:42.269> third<00:02:42.480> tier

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
price of admission into your third tier

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.750 
price of admission into your third tier
slot<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.230> do<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.830> think<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.069> Treyarch<00:02:44.550> made

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
slot and do you think that Treyarch made

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.490 
slot and do you think that Treyarch made
the<00:02:44.880> right<00:02:45.030> call<00:02:45.209> by<00:02:45.450> withholding<00:02:45.660> surface

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the right call by withholding surface

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.979 
the right call by withholding surface
specific<00:02:47.040> footstep<00:02:47.489> noises<00:02:47.910> only<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:48.870> this

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
specific footstep noises only for this

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.509 
specific footstep noises only for this
perk<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.769> that's<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.310> this

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
perk but that's all I have for this

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.620
