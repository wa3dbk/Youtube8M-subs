have could have mattered you know my son
was<00:05:38.050> gonna<00:05:38.170> hook<00:05:38.380> on<00:05:38.560> but<00:05:38.950> it<00:05:39.400> could<00:05:39.580> have

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
was gonna hook on but it could have

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.220 
was gonna hook on but it could have
mattered<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.060> know<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.270> still<00:05:40.720> had<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.960> rest

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
mattered you know I still had the rest

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.390 
mattered you know I still had the rest
but<00:05:41.500> it<00:05:41.650> definitely<00:05:41.890> would<00:05:42.160> have<00:05:42.190> learned

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
but it definitely would have learned

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.010 
but it definitely would have learned
that<00:05:42.640> limited<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.180> amount<00:05:43.360> that<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.810> could

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
that limited the amount that I could

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.190 
that limited the amount that I could
have<00:05:44.140> set<00:05:44.410> up<00:05:44.700> but<00:05:45.700> uh<00:05:45.730> he<00:05:46.540> citizens<00:05:46.930> in<00:05:47.050> this
