00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.410 
actually the one I used had to score the
bottom<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.469> order<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.250> vacuum<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
bottom in order for the vacuum to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.070 
bottom in order for the vacuum to
release<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.649> slip<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.629> what<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> did<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
release and to slip out what I did is I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.930 
release and to slip out what I did is I
set<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
set the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.180 
set the
set<00:02:11.330> these<00:02:11.480> weights<00:02:14.320> 10<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.470> 15<00:02:15.770> pound<00:02:16.010> weights

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
set these weights 10 to 15 pound weights

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.150 
set these weights 10 to 15 pound weights
in<00:02:16.370> here<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:18.080> then<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.710> pour<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> concrete

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
in here and then just pour the concrete

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.930 
in here and then just pour the concrete
around<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.840> put<00:02:21.290> my<00:02:21.320> dowel<00:02:21.620> rod<00:02:21.940> right

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
around it and put my dowel rod right

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.960 
around it and put my dowel rod right
here<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.270> middle<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.610> let<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.670> concrete

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
here in the middle and let the concrete

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.780 
here in the middle and let the concrete
set<00:02:26.240> up<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:27.020> then<00:02:27.530> once<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:27.860> set<00:02:28.130> I'd<00:02:28.490> give

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
set up and then once it's set I'd give

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.330 
set up and then once it's set I'd give
it<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.940> good<00:02:29.140> probably<00:02:30.140> good<00:02:30.260> 36<00:02:30.710> 48<00:02:31.010> hours

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
it a good probably good 36 48 hours

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.190 
it a good probably good 36 48 hours
before<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.580> moved<00:02:31.820> it<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.510> flip<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.780> over<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
before I moved it just flip it over and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.740 
before I moved it just flip it over and
do<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.190> same<00:02:34.310> thing<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.700> other<00:02:34.760> side<00:02:37.750> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
do the same thing on the other side and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.470 
do the same thing on the other side and
what<00:02:38.960> you're<00:02:39.050> gonna<00:02:39.140> end<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:40.270> just<00:02:41.270> right

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
what you're gonna end up with just right

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.560

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
you can see right here this is the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.810 
you can see right here this is the
concrete<00:02:58.760> nice<00:02:59.360> crawled<00:02:59.960> in<00:03:00.110> 2011<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.700> is

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
concrete nice crawled in 2011 this is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.370 
concrete nice crawled in 2011 this is
actually<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.270> cast<00:03:02.600> iron<00:03:02.840> weight<00:03:03.110> there's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
actually that cast iron weight there's

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.780 
actually that cast iron weight there's
three<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.620> them<00:03:03.740> in<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.400> is<00:03:04.520> one<00:03:04.640> it's

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
three of them in here this is one it's

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.430 
three of them in here this is one it's
kind<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.000> poking<00:03:05.300> out<00:03:05.390> a<00:03:05.420> little<00:03:05.540> bit<00:03:05.720> kind<00:03:06.410> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
kind of poking out a little bit kind of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.190 
kind of poking out a little bit kind of
like<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:06.740> then<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.820> got<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.150> rubber<00:03:08.870> taped

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
like that then you got this rubber taped

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200 
like that then you got this rubber taped
around<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.620> just<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:10.010> give<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.970> little<00:03:11.090> bit

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
around it just to give it a little bit

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.520 
around it just to give it a little bit
of<00:03:11.270> cushion<00:03:11.420> when<00:03:11.690> it<00:03:11.780> hits<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.990> concrete<00:03:12.200> it

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
of cushion when it hits the concrete it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.260 
of cushion when it hits the concrete it
doesn't<00:03:12.770> chip<00:03:12.890> off<00:03:13.070> yeah<00:03:13.640> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.910> sand<00:03:14.150> this

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
doesn't chip off yeah you can sand this

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.610 
doesn't chip off yeah you can sand this
down<00:03:14.330> if<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.750> want<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.110> probably<00:03:15.410> put<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
down if you want and probably put a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.870 
down if you want and probably put a
little<00:03:15.650> finish<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.280> just<00:03:16.490> for<00:03:16.640> weather

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
little finish on it just for weather

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.580 
little finish on it just for weather
resistance<00:03:17.860> that's<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:21.110> all<00:03:21.350> in<00:03:21.500> all

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
resistance that's it so all in all

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.580 
resistance that's it so all in all
probably<00:03:21.890> cost<00:03:22.100> about<00:03:22.250> ten<00:03:22.700> fifteen<00:03:23.209> bucks

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
probably cost about ten fifteen bucks

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:31.360 
probably cost about ten fifteen bucks
and<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:26.209> know<00:03:27.430> here's<00:03:28.430> my<00:03:28.550> gym<00:03:28.790> is<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
and you know here's my gym is the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.150
