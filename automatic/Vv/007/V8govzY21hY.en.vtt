down<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.640> West<00:00:35.730> Hamlin<00:00:36.030> supposed<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> message

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

from<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> manager<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> players

more<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> same<00:00:38.910> especially<00:00:39.210> second-half

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
more of the same especially second-half

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.600 
more of the same especially second-half
performance<00:00:40.050> yeah<00:00:40.680> definitely<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
performance yeah definitely I think I

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.979 
performance yeah definitely I think I
think<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.879> both<00:00:42.030> felt<00:00:42.329> West<00:00:42.600> downward

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think we both felt West downward

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
think we both felt West downward
probably<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.680> better<00:00:43.860> team<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.370> first

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
probably the better team in that first

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
probably the better team in that first
off<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> thought<00:00:45.719> Everton<00:00:46.079> defend<00:00:46.350> thee

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
off but I thought Everton defend thee

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.510 
off but I thought Everton defend thee
well<00:00:46.620> off<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.340> well

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
well off the back of that as well

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.279 
well off the back of that as well
second-half<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.510> an<00:00:48.989> outstanding

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
second-half it was an outstanding

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
second-half it was an outstanding
performance<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> course<00:00:50.370> letting<00:00:50.969> Ben<00:00:51.120> two

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
performance of course letting Ben two

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
performance of course letting Ben two
girls<00:00:51.600> were<00:00:52.050> an<00:00:52.320> excellent<00:00:52.699> rounding<00:00:53.699> off

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
girls were an excellent rounding off

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.040 
girls were an excellent rounding off
performance<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.270> i<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> cork<00:00:54.930> who

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
performance but i think the cork who

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
performance but i think the cork who
come<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.320> made<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> difference<00:00:55.910> berry-berry

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
come on made a difference berry-berry

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
come on made a difference berry-berry
play<00:00:57.329> well<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:57.719> throughout<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> team<00:00:58.559> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
play well I think throughout the team I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.420 
play well I think throughout the team I
thought<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:58.980> played<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.309> well

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
thought they played really well

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
thought they played really well
especially<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.000> second<00:01:00.300> half<00:01:00.420> Romelu<00:01:01.199> Lukaku

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
especially the second half Romelu Lukaku

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
especially the second half Romelu Lukaku
should<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.070> his<00:01:02.160> first<00:01:02.370> start<00:01:02.760> tonight<00:01:03.239> at
