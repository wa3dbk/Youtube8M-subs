00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
this is not exactly surprising that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.550 
this is not exactly surprising that
their<00:02:39.299> servers<00:02:39.750> are<00:02:39.870> kind<00:02:40.049> of<00:02:40.140> straining

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
their servers are kind of straining

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.009 
their servers are kind of straining
under<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> load<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> little<00:02:41.430> bit<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:42.030> course<00:02:42.540> it

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
under the load a little bit of course it

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.170 
under the load a little bit of course it
was<00:02:43.260> pretty<00:02:43.470> much<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.830> worldwide<00:02:44.370> launch<00:02:44.670> other

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
was pretty much a worldwide launch other

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.130 
was pretty much a worldwide launch other
than<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.360> countries<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.690> already<00:02:45.989> had

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
than the countries that already had

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.410 
than the countries that already had
access<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> ps4<00:02:46.950> yesterday<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:48.239> it's<00:02:48.360> not

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
access to the ps4 yesterday so it's not

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.020 
access to the ps4 yesterday so it's not
exactly<00:02:48.720> surprising<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:50.459> they're<00:02:50.880> having

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
exactly surprising that they're having

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.650 
exactly surprising that they're having
problems<00:02:51.470> now<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.829> said<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:54.120> did<00:02:54.269> find<00:02:54.510> them

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
problems now as I said we did find them

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.080 
problems now as I said we did find them
much<00:02:55.049> smoother<00:02:55.680> than<00:02:56.130> late<00:02:56.400> last<00:02:56.610> night<00:02:56.849> when

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
much smoother than late last night when

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
much smoother than late last night when
we<00:02:57.180> had<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.329> look<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.959> could<00:02:58.140> just<00:02:58.170> been

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
we had a look but that could just been

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.550 
we had a look but that could just been
to<00:02:58.769> less<00:02:59.220> users<00:02:59.670> online<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> real<00:03:01.260> test

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to less users online so the real test

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.460 
to less users online so the real test
would<00:03:01.860> be<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:03.000> example<00:03:03.200> anyone<00:03:04.200> would<00:03:04.319> try

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
would be if for example anyone would try

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.979 
would be if for example anyone would try
to<00:03:04.500> log<00:03:04.769> in<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.720> unfortunately<00:03:06.720> i<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.870> have

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
to log in now unfortunately i don't have

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.000 
to log in now unfortunately i don't have
the<00:03:07.170> ps4<00:03:07.410> here<00:03:07.769> with<00:03:07.920> me<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.540> still<00:03:10.010> hopefully

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the ps4 here with me but still hopefully

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
the ps4 here with me but still hopefully
they'll<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.310> fixed<00:03:11.640> soon<00:03:11.790> now<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.870> i<00:03:12.900> think

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
they'll be fixed soon now but i think

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.690 
they'll be fixed soon now but i think
this<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.500> really<00:03:13.950> unexpected<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.610> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
this is to be really unexpected it's a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.280 
this is to be really unexpected it's a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
shame don't get me wrong it was really

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020
