00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.440 
and so you don't want to have that
happen<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> rail<00:01:22.799> master<00:01:23.159> pretty<00:01:23.790> much<00:01:23.939> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
happen and rail master pretty much just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.969 
happen and rail master pretty much just
cast<00:01:24.659> missile<00:01:24.990> barrage<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> can't<00:01:25.710> stop

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
cast missile barrage and you can't stop

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
cast missile barrage and you can't stop
them<00:01:26.159> from<00:01:26.189> casting<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.960> just

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
them from casting it and so it's just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
them from casting it and so it's just
honestly<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.430> real<00:01:29.939> masters<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> little<00:01:30.570> bit

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
honestly like real masters a little bit

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.179 
honestly like real masters a little bit
easier<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> deal<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.500> Boracay<00:01:31.740> depending

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
easier to deal with in Boracay depending

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.310 
easier to deal with in Boracay depending

even whenever he's out of his uh his
turret<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.850> makes<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.330> lot

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
turret and so that makes this a lot

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.449 
turret and so that makes this a lot
easier<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.950> guys<00:03:17.100> can<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.430> I

easier and so that as you guys can see I

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.850 
easier and so that as you guys can see I
did<00:03:17.670> like<00:03:17.820> fucking<00:03:18.209> 15%<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.900> itself<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.410> so

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
did like fucking 15% of itself and so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.140 
did like fucking 15% of itself and so
again<00:03:20.070> guys<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.459> all<00:03:20.580> about<00:03:20.760> controlling

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
again guys it's all about controlling

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.910 
again guys it's all about controlling
the<00:03:21.330> ads<00:03:21.480> making<00:03:21.930> sure<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.260> suppressor<00:03:22.739> fire

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
the ads making sure the suppressor fire

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
the ads making sure the suppressor fire
by<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> way<00:03:23.250> focuses<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.269> person<00:03:24.660> there's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
by the way focuses one person there's

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.330 
by the way focuses one person there's
just<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.260> targeting<00:03:25.739> thing<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:26.250> if

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
just like a targeting thing and so if

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.440 
just like a targeting thing and so if
you<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.519> suppressed<00:03:26.730> fire<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.180> run<00:03:27.330> away

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
you have suppressed fire just run away

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.860 
you have suppressed fire just run away
and<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.620> probably<00:03:28.799> won't<00:03:28.980> hit<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.280> too<00:03:29.459> much

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
and it probably won't hit you too much

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.180 
and it probably won't hit you too much
make<00:03:30.870> sure<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.080> don't<00:03:31.170> stand<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> fire<00:03:31.830> of

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
