it's all gonna be in the box below I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
it's all gonna be in the box below I
decided<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> get<00:00:28.289> green<00:00:28.529> contact<00:00:28.920> lenses

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
decided to get green contact lenses

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.560 
decided to get green contact lenses
because<00:00:29.519> I've<00:00:29.640> really<00:00:29.970> been<00:00:30.119> into<00:00:30.269> kind<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
because I've really been into kind of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
because I've really been into kind of
green<00:00:30.840> lenses<00:00:31.260> ever<00:00:31.500> since<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:31.980> my

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
green lenses ever since I was little my

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
green lenses ever since I was little my
mom<00:00:32.550> has<00:00:32.790> green<00:00:33.000> eyes<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.780> that's<00:00:34.170> probably

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
mom has green eyes so that's probably

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.569 
mom has green eyes so that's probably
where<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> came<00:00:35.160> from

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
where it came from

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
where it came from
so<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> ones<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.420> are<00:00:36.899> these<00:00:37.230> ones

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
so the ones that I got are these ones

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.090 
so the ones that I got are these ones
which<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.420> G&amp;G<00:00:39.450> bTW<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.469> they're<00:00:40.980> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
rim around the edge and then as you go

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.920 
rim around the edge and then as you go
in<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> goes<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.090> greener<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.570> little

in it goes a little bit greener a little

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.679 
in it goes a little bit greener a little
bit<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> more<00:01:41.310> graded<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> just

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
bit kind of more graded and then it just

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.289 
bit kind of more graded and then it just
fades<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.350> pretty<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.710> nothing<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> then

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
fades into pretty much nothing and then

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.359 
fades into pretty much nothing and then
you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.570> kind<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> little<00:01:46.950> bit<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> my

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you can kind of see a little bit of my

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.340 
you can kind of see a little bit of my
brown<00:01:47.640> showing<00:01:48.060> up<00:01:48.210> because<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.079> such<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
brown showing up because I have such a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
brown showing up because I have such a
heavy<00:01:49.619> light<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> moment<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.759> pupils

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
heavy light on at the moment my pupils

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
heavy light on at the moment my pupils
are<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.810> smaller<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.649> kind

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
are a little bit smaller so you can kind

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
are a little bit smaller so you can kind
of<00:01:52.950> see<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.310> brown<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.659> they

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of see the brown but I just think they

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.580 
of see the brown but I just think they
look<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.610> natural<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:58.170> far<00:01:58.350> away<00:01:58.469> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
look so natural like from far away you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.660 
look so natural like from far away you
can't<00:01:58.920> even<00:01:59.100> tell<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.280> I'm<00:01:59.520> wearing

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
can't even tell that I'm wearing

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
can't even tell that I'm wearing
contacts<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.600> even<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.560> up

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
contacts at all like even when I'm up

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.910 
contacts at all like even when I'm up
this<00:02:02.189> close<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.570> can't<00:02:04.020> quite<00:02:04.380> tell<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.829> I'm

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
this close you can't quite tell that I'm

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.139 
this close you can't quite tell that I'm
wearing<00:02:05.100> contacts<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
wearing contacts I don't know if I'm

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
wearing contacts I don't know if I'm
just<00:02:06.180> getting<00:02:06.540> used<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.930> them<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.799> just

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
just getting used to them but I just

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.930 
just getting used to them but I just
think<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:08.729> really

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
think that they look really really

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.660 
think that they look really really
natural<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.660> compare<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> my<00:02:10.379> mom

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
natural and compare this to my mom

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.220 
natural and compare this to my mom
sighs<00:02:10.849> who<00:02:11.090> are<00:02:11.209> green<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.720> they're<00:02:11.900> very

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
sighs who are green and they're very

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.830 
sighs who are green and they're very
very<00:02:12.709> similar<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.640> hers<00:02:14.120> are<00:02:14.270> naturally<00:02:14.630> green

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
very similar so hers are naturally green

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.449 
very similar so hers are naturally green
eyes<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.380> these<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.770> contacts<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.370> they

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
eyes and these are the contacts and they

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.550 
eyes and these are the contacts and they
look<00:02:16.670> quite<00:02:17.150> similar<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:18.260> will<00:02:18.410> show<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.800 
look quite similar and I will show you
guys<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.770> few<00:02:18.890> different<00:02:19.880> options<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.480> how<00:02:20.660> they

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
guys a few different options of how they

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.510 
guys a few different options of how they
look<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.500> different<00:02:21.530> Lighting's<00:02:22.310> so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
look like in different Lighting's so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.130 
look like in different Lighting's so
right<00:02:23.030> now<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.180> have<00:02:23.450> them<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.720> quite<00:02:23.930> an

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
right now I have them in quite an

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.930 
right now I have them in quite an
intense<00:02:24.500> fake<00:02:24.890> light<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.489> there's<00:02:25.700> no<00:02:25.819> other

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
intense fake light so there's no other

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.880 
intense fake light so there's no other
lighting<00:02:26.239> other<00:02:26.599> than<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.989> fake<00:02:27.290> lump<00:02:27.620> that's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
lighting other than a fake lump that's

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.590 
lighting other than a fake lump that's
on<00:02:28.100> at<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.250> moment<00:02:28.400> then<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:29.420> them

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
on at the moment then you can see them

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.479 
on at the moment then you can see them
in<00:02:29.750> natural<00:02:29.959> daylight<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.010> they<00:02:31.130> look<00:02:31.340> a

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
in natural daylight so they look a

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.970 
in natural daylight so they look a
little<00:02:31.850> bit<00:02:32.000> kind<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.530> softer<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.890> bit

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
little bit kind of softer a little bit

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.670 
little bit kind of softer a little bit
brighter<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.760> kind<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.390> green<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.260> then<00:02:36.590> you

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
brighter and kind of green and then you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.220 
brighter and kind of green and then you
can<00:02:36.830> see<00:02:37.010> them<00:02:37.220> in<00:02:37.400> low-light<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.360> well<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:39.110> it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
can see them in low-light as well so it

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.990 
can see them in low-light as well so it
depends<00:02:39.560> on<00:02:39.620> kind<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> pupil<00:02:40.400> shape<00:02:40.670> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
depends on kind of the pupil shape and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.460 
depends on kind of the pupil shape and
all<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.209> kind<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.420> stuff<00:02:41.540> kind<00:02:41.989> of<00:02:42.050> affects

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
all that kind of stuff kind of affects

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.259 
all that kind of stuff kind of affects
the<00:02:42.769> way<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.190> they<00:02:43.310> look<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:43.700> how<00:02:43.760> natural

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
the way that they look and how natural

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.610 
the way that they look and how natural
and<00:02:44.330> they'll<00:02:44.540> haven't<00:02:44.840> had<00:02:45.019> any<00:02:45.230> problems

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and they'll haven't had any problems

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.750 
and they'll haven't had any problems
with<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.920> but<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.190> do<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.580> make<00:02:46.700> sure

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.009 
with them but you do want to make sure
