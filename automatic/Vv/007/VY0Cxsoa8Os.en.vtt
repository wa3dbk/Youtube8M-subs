the<00:00:20.939> best<00:00:21.240> full<00:00:22.050> games<00:00:22.350> but<00:00:22.619> it's<00:00:22.740> still<00:00:22.920> both

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the best full games but it's still both

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
the best full games but it's still both
teams<00:00:24.150> are<00:00:24.269> pretty<00:00:24.359> explosive<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.439> kind

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
teams are pretty explosive but it's kind

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.310 
teams are pretty explosive but it's kind
of<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.039> up<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> down<00:00:26.400> year<00:00:26.699> ah<00:00:27.140> the<00:00:28.140> big

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
east and acc were probably the two

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.870 
east and acc were probably the two
weakest<00:00:30.900> conferences<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.949> year<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:34.880> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
weakest conferences this year so you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this game clean clothes in West Virginia

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
this game clean clothes in West Virginia
Tech<00:01:00.050> cleansing<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.829> plumb<00:01:02.039> out

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
Tech cleansing like I was just plumb out

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.649 
Tech cleansing like I was just plumb out
they<00:01:02.760> were<00:01:03.229> undefeated<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.640> lost<00:01:05.880> two<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
they were undefeated and they lost two I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
they were undefeated and they lost two I
think<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.590> were<00:01:07.650> 17<00:01:08.130> 0<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.090> then<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.299> lost

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
think they were 17 0 and then they lost

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.859 
think they were 17 0 and then they lost
a<00:01:09.630> Georgia<00:01:09.990> Tech<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:11.520> after<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> was<00:01:12.240> two<00:01:12.659> more

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a Georgia Tech then after I was two more

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.460 
a Georgia Tech then after I was two more
games<00:01:13.760> but<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.880> still<00:01:15.150> won<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.630> third

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
games but they still won the third

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.010 
games but they still won the third
division<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.950> ACC<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.360> they<00:01:18.479> blew<00:01:18.810> out

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
division of ACC and then they blew out

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.050 
division of ACC and then they blew out
Virginia<00:01:19.740> Tech<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> ACC<00:01:20.610> championship<00:01:20.909> game

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
Virginia Tech and ACC championship game

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.460 
Virginia Tech and ACC championship game
so<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.210> Clemson<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:24.990> definitely<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so I think Clemson is definitely the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.030 
so I think Clemson is definitely the
favorite<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.460> steam<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:28.040> positive

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
favorite going to steam it positive

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.039 
favorite going to steam it positive

their<00:03:06.550> defense<00:03:07.030> isn't<00:03:09.180> really<00:03:10.180> too<00:03:10.480> its

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
their defense isn't really too its

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.990 
their defense isn't really too its
decent<00:03:11.709> but<00:03:13.590> they've<00:03:14.590> cave<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.310> Austin<00:03:15.790> he's<00:03:15.970> a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.210 

they're<00:03:22.540> interesting<00:03:23.110> third<00:03:23.709> an<00:03:23.799> interesting

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
they're interesting third an interesting

they're interesting third an interesting
team<00:03:24.430> but<00:03:25.090> it'll<00:03:25.329> be<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.480> good<00:03:25.690> game<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.019> should

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
team but it'll be a good game it should

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.960 
team but it'll be a good game it should
be<00:03:26.230> good<00:03:26.350> game<00:03:26.650> did<00:03:26.890> definitely<00:03:27.790> worth

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
be good game did definitely worth

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.430 
be good game did definitely worth
watching<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.930> think<00:03:29.140> it'll<00:03:29.290> be<00:03:29.350> a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
watching and I think it'll be a

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.940 
watching and I think it'll be a
high-scoring<00:03:29.680> game<00:03:30.190> just<00:03:30.459> because<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:31.950> star

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
high-scoring game just because the star

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.330 
high-scoring game just because the star
to<00:03:33.130> all<00:03:33.280> kinds<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.610> teams<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.440> expect<00:03:36.160> um

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
to all kinds of teams so I expect um

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.039 
to all kinds of teams so I expect um
didn't<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:36.610> win<00:03:39.180> it<00:03:40.180> but<00:03:40.420> if<00:03:40.510> puns<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.870> plays<00:03:41.019> a

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
didn't to win it but if puns it plays a

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.390 
didn't to win it but if puns it plays a
way<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.410> they<00:03:41.530> did<00:03:41.590> when<00:03:41.799> their<00:03:41.920> laws<00:03:42.070> on<00:03:42.280> you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
way that they did when their laws on you

West<00:03:42.549> Virginia<00:03:42.970> could<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.269> boy<00:03:43.450> beat<00:03:43.630> them

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
West Virginia could that boy beat them

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.240 
West Virginia could that boy beat them
West<00:03:43.959> Virginia<00:03:44.350> like<00:03:44.859> I<00:03:44.950> said<00:03:45.010> they're<00:03:45.220> not

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
West Virginia like I said they're not

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.370 
West Virginia like I said they're not
really<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.760> dominant<00:03:46.570> team<00:03:46.720> but<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.109> mean<00:03:47.260> they

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
really a dominant team but I mean they

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.069 
really a dominant team but I mean they
can<00:03:47.560> beat<00:03:48.209> clauses<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.390> plugs<00:03:49.570> not<00:03:49.959> on

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
can beat clauses and it plugs not on

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.050 
can beat clauses and it plugs not on
their<00:03:50.200> game<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:50.620> I<00:03:50.680> would<00:03:51.220> probably<00:03:51.609> expect

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
their game but I would probably expect

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.920 
their game but I would probably expect
