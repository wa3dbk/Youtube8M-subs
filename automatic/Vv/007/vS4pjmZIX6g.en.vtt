as<00:00:17.580> each<00:00:17.760> block<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.240> made<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.690> learned<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.470> in

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
as each block is made I learned this in

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.410 
as each block is made I learned this in
a<00:00:19.770> classroom<00:00:20.010> Sally<00:00:20.490> Collins<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.180> thought

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
a classroom Sally Collins I thought

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
a classroom Sally Collins I thought
close<00:00:21.660> enough<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.140> good<00:00:22.350> enough<00:00:22.560> mm-hmm<00:00:23.460> so

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
close enough was good enough mm-hmm so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
close enough was good enough mm-hmm so
let<00:00:24.119> me<00:00:24.300> show<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.869> she<00:00:25.050> taught<00:00:25.320> us<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> do

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
let me show you what she taught us to do

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.580 
let me show you what she taught us to do
in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> class<00:00:26.369> she<00:00:27.240> instructed<00:00:27.750> us<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.320> cut

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
in the class she instructed us to cut

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.550 
in the class she instructed us to cut
two<00:00:29.160> strips<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.880> exactly<00:00:30.449> one<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.439> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
two strips that are exactly one and a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.549 
two strips that are exactly one and a
quarter<00:00:32.009> inch<00:00:32.219> each<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.750> stitched

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
quarter inch each and then stitched

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
quarter inch each and then stitched
through<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> machine<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.570> you're

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
through the machine and then when you're

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.790 
through the machine and then when you're
done<00:00:36.930> press<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.000> measures<00:00:39.390> -

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800
