group of people as well so how to know
i'm<00:03:04.170> not<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.680> justify<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.960> so<00:03:06.960> like<00:03:07.080> I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
i'm not going to justify it so like I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.110 
i'm not going to justify it so like I
was<00:03:07.230> saying<00:03:07.350> about<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.710> commando<00:03:08.130> commando

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
was saying about the commando commando

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.150 
was saying about the commando commando
is<00:03:09.180> okay<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:10.200> one<00:03:10.320> of<00:03:10.350> my<00:03:10.530> favorite<00:03:10.860> but<00:03:10.980> it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
is okay not one of my favorite but it's

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.920 
is okay not one of my favorite but it's
I<00:03:11.520> think<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.120> has<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.240> slow<00:03:12.570> rate<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.810> fire

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I think it has a slow rate of fire

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.280 
I think it has a slow rate of fire
actually<00:03:14.210> but<00:03:15.210> I<00:03:15.360> find<00:03:15.600> would<00:03:15.720> read<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.110> it's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
actually but I find would read that it's

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.840 
actually but I find would read that it's
working<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.650> me<00:03:16.710> because<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.040> gets<00:03:17.460> monotonous
