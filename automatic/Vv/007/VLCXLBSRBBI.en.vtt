 high yes she allows high in 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.630
 principle, the full height of a person to be 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.990
 inside the tent as vestibule and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.270
 the sleeping compartment is bright there I see 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.990
 walk from two sides two entrances to this 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.970

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.600

 moisture there is an additional foul there is a floor 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.860
 in there were floors made of 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.860
 polyethylene 120 grams per square meter 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.660

 morning light did not interfere quite possible 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.520
 close well and the bed that is 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.880

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.160
 tent done 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.900
 part by segments of mosquito net that 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.000
 even allow to mount well 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.590
 tent the way from the back side there 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.180
 additional window which can also 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.440
 used as an extra 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.180
 ventilation and that is there were 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.920
 equipped with ventilation will only be you 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.020
 then we will set a hot time 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.760
 year up due to the fact that the bedroom 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.190
 the department is very large, respectively 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.510
 there is a lot of air in such a tent 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.790
 be in hot weather 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.220
 and who forged that water will withstand this 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.880
 tent on bills used here 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.660
 fabric and polyester taffeta 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.250
 it withstands 35 thousand water column 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.799
 In principle, this is enough to 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.049
 to withstand the strongest rain and which 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.360
 maybe everything is clear I understand that you can 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.130
