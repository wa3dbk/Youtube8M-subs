00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.910 

tip<00:00:28.410> number<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.220> rock<00:00:30.000> salt<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> baby<00:00:31.560> oil

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
tip number one is rock salt and baby oil

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
tip number one is rock salt and baby oil
now<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.450> best<00:00:33.870> exfoliator<00:00:34.290> I've

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
now this is the best exfoliator I've

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
now this is the best exfoliator I've
ever<00:00:35.100> used<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> best<00:00:35.969> part<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.329> because

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ever used and the best part is because

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.080 
ever used and the best part is because
it's<00:00:36.899> got<00:00:37.050> baby<00:00:37.350> oil<00:00:37.590> involved<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.399> really

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it's got baby oil involved it really

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
it's got baby oil involved it really
really<00:00:39.510> moisturizes<00:00:40.440> your<00:00:40.469> skin<00:00:40.620> super<00:00:41.280> well

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
really moisturizes your skin super well

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
really moisturizes your skin super well
and<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.870> measurement<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and I think the measurement that you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.580 
and I think the measurement that you
should<00:00:43.890> take<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.309> maybe<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.989> tablespoon

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
should take is maybe like a tablespoon

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.920 
should take is maybe like a tablespoon
of<00:00:46.980> rock<00:00:47.190> salt<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.700> then<00:00:47.969> two<00:00:48.360> or<00:00:48.570> three

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
of rock salt and then two or three

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
of rock salt and then two or three
tablespoons<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.829> baby<00:00:50.100> oil<00:00:50.399> because<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> need

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tablespoons of baby oil because you need

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.270 
tablespoons of baby oil because you need
more<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> oil<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.739> literally<00:00:53.160> just

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.749 
a little goldish because I kind of like
a<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> shimmer<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.610> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
a little bit of shimmer but you can have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.420 
a little bit of shimmer but you can have
it<00:01:50.880> completely<00:01:51.479> matte<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.280> put

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
it completely matte and if you just put

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.249 
it completely matte and if you just put
it<00:01:53.520> under<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.820> eyes<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.930> also

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
it under your eyes like that it also

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.289 
it under your eyes like that it also
breaks<00:01:55.680> away<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> redness<00:01:56.490> from<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.119> eyes

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
breaks away the redness from your eyes

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.050 
breaks away the redness from your eyes
okay<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.320> fourth<00:01:58.649> tip<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.790> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

in<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.209> use<00:03:37.239> clear<00:03:37.810> mascara<00:03:38.079> to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
in that is if you use clear mascara to

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.589 
in that is if you use clear mascara to
just<00:03:38.889> give<00:03:39.069> your<00:03:39.310> eyelash<00:03:39.669> a<00:03:39.700> bit<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.060> texture

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599
