00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
talks about goalkeepers that they can

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.990 
talks about goalkeepers that they can
fly<00:01:47.470> for<00:01:47.530> longer<00:01:47.950> than<00:01:47.979> outfield<00:01:48.429> players<00:01:48.729> and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
fly for longer than outfield players and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.490 
fly for longer than outfield players and
almost<00:01:49.240> their<00:01:49.539> prime<00:01:49.810> comes<00:01:50.079> a<00:01:50.170> bit<00:01:50.289> later

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
almost their prime comes a bit later

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.710 
almost their prime comes a bit later
when<00:01:51.189> you're<00:01:51.310> by<00:01:51.460> no<00:01:51.610> means<00:01:51.880> approaching<00:01:52.479> any

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
when you're by no means approaching any

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.809 
when you're by no means approaching any
of<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.079> status<00:01:53.350> but<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:53.679> guess<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.009> you're

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
of that status but I guess it is you're

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:55.800 
of that status but I guess it is you're
always<00:01:54.939> getting<00:01:55.149> better<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.599> goalkeeper

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.039 
and you could be hopefully heading into
some<00:01:57.549> of<00:01:57.610> your<00:01:57.729> best<00:01:57.819> years<00:01:58.149> still<00:01:58.330> now<00:01:58.569> that's

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
it's another year we're going back and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.949 
it's another year we're going back and
looking<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.060> be<00:02:19.150> better<00:02:19.299> than<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.630> last<00:02:19.660> one

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
and I think there's a much-changed squad

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.850 
and I think there's a much-changed squad
which<00:02:22.569> had<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> lot<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.900> success<00:02:23.319> but<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.590> fact

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
which had a lot of success but the fact

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.830 
which had a lot of success but the fact
that<00:02:23.890> yourself<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.880> stays<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.329> David<00:02:25.630> rules

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that yourself and stays and David rules

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.420

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
mean last season was probably one of the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.310 
mean last season was probably one of the
most<00:04:04.890> memorable<00:04:05.760> might<00:04:06.660> even<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.900> link<00:04:07.080> one

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
most memorable might even in link one

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.750 
most memorable might even in link one
but<00:04:07.500> everyone<00:04:07.770> enjoyed<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.370> much<00:04:08.400> after

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
but everyone enjoyed it so much after

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.100 
but everyone enjoyed it so much after
what<00:04:08.970> had<00:04:09.060> happened<00:04:09.270> gone<00:04:09.420> on<00:04:09.510> before<00:04:09.690> it's

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
what had happened gone on before it's

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.660 
what had happened gone on before it's
there's<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.740> bit<00:04:10.860> momentum<00:04:11.310> there<00:04:11.460> hopefully

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
there's a bit momentum there hopefully

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.400

with<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> playoffs<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.300> can<00:05:23.480> be<00:05:23.600> sort<00:05:23.780> of

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
with the playoffs you can be sort of

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.180 
with the playoffs you can be sort of
mid-table<00:05:24.200> if<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.590> like<00:05:24.770> but<00:05:24.920> there's<00:05:25.070> always

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
mid-table if you like but there's always

that<00:05:25.460> chance<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.910> make<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.090> make<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.840> relative

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
that chance to make it make a relative

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.570 
that chance to make it make a relative
there's<00:05:27.530> no<00:05:27.620> reason<00:05:27.980> as<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.160> say<00:05:28.310> i<00:05:28.340> think<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
there's no reason as you say i think the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.340 
there's no reason as you say i think the
gaffer's<00:05:28.880> himself<00:05:29.180> has<00:05:29.330> said<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.870> real<00:05:30.110> lap

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
gaffer's himself has said that real lap

the<00:05:32.450> first<00:05:32.660> thing<00:05:32.810> you<00:05:32.870> know<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.470> got

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
the first thing you know you got

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.090 
the first thing you know you got
probably<00:05:34.550> about<00:05:34.670> 12<00:05:35.470> 40<00:05:36.470> teams<00:05:36.740> we've<00:05:36.950> been

probably about 12 40 teams we've been
looking<00:05:37.340> into<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.670> plows<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.120> we<00:05:38.450> should<00:05:38.900> we

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.840 
looking into the plows and we should we
want<00:05:39.170> to<00:05:39.260> as<00:05:39.440> well<00:05:39.500> because<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.400> size<00:05:40.640> of<00:05:40.790> the

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
just sort of a good seeds of solid

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.700 
just sort of a good seeds of solid
season<00:05:52.340> and<00:05:52.550> see<00:05:53.270> what<00:05:53.419> Texas<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.230> believe

we<00:05:54.889> can<00:05:54.919> butcher<00:05:55.850> the<00:05:56.090> top<00:05:56.300> six<00:05:56.570> and<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:56.870> course

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
we can butcher the top six and of course

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.320 
we can butcher the top six and of course
I<00:05:57.200> don't<00:05:57.380> trust<00:05:57.860> our<00:05:58.040> players<00:05:58.280> were<00:05:58.550> so<00:05:59.300> I

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
I don't trust our players were so I

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.790 
I don't trust our players were so I
think<00:05:59.450> about<00:05:59.780> getting<00:06:00.050> into<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.320> season<00:06:00.710> and

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
think about getting into the season and

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.920 
think about getting into the season and
sort<00:06:01.010> of<00:06:01.040> see<00:06:01.190> where<00:06:01.370> we<00:06:01.490> are<00:06:01.580> I<00:06:01.790> think<00:06:02.570> club

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
sort of see where we are I think club

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.570 
sort of see where we are I think club
record<00:06:03.230> clean<00:06:03.470> sheets<00:06:03.740> last<00:06:04.190> year<00:06:04.430> which

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
record clean sheets last year which

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.010 
record clean sheets last year which
equaled<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.030> League<00:06:05.180> One<00:06:05.210> record<00:06:05.690> as<00:06:05.810> well<00:06:05.990> I

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
equaled the League One record as well I

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.780 
equaled the League One record as well I
mean<00:06:06.290> goalkeepers<00:06:07.100> and<00:06:07.250> defenders<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:07.700> the

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.790 
mean goalkeepers and defenders and the

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.940 
mean goalkeepers and defenders and the
whole<00:06:07.910> team<00:06:08.120> contributed<00:06:08.450> to<00:06:08.840> that<00:06:08.870> I<00:06:09.200> guess

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
whole team contributed to that I guess

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.850 
whole team contributed to that I guess
I'm<00:06:10.490> important<00:06:11.080> difficult<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:12.139> do<00:06:12.260> that<00:06:12.470> again

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
I'm important difficult to do that again

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.350 
I'm important difficult to do that again
in<00:06:13.040> terms<00:06:13.220> of<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.430> numbers<00:06:13.760> but<00:06:13.910> important<00:06:14.270> to

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
in terms of the numbers but important to

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.790 
in terms of the numbers but important to
try<00:06:14.510> and<00:06:14.600> get<00:06:14.690> that<00:06:14.810> solid<00:06:15.169> base<00:06:15.350> again<00:06:15.650> for

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
try and get that solid base again for

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.110 
try and get that solid base again for
next<00:06:15.889> season<00:06:16.280> yeah<00:06:16.430> definitely<00:06:16.639> of<00:06:16.910> it<00:06:17.000> we

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
next season yeah definitely of it we

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.360 
next season yeah definitely of it we
built<00:06:17.330> after<00:06:17.450> that<00:06:17.630> last<00:06:17.780> season<00:06:18.260> and<00:06:19.220> then

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
built after that last season and then

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.430 
built after that last season and then
sort<00:06:19.850> of<00:06:19.940> towards<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:20.450> end<00:06:20.840> of<00:06:20.960> the<00:06:21.020> season<00:06:21.410> we

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
sort of towards the end of the season we

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.740 
sort of towards the end of the season we
saw<00:06:21.500> blue<00:06:22.490> team's<00:06:22.760> away<00:06:23.030> a<00:06:23.060> bit<00:06:23.270> more<00:06:23.479> but<00:06:23.720> I

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
saw blue team's away a bit more but I

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.480 
saw blue team's away a bit more but I
think<00:06:24.080> he's<00:06:24.200> massively<00:06:24.830> important<00:06:25.310> to<00:06:25.430> a

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
think he's massively important to a

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.909 
think he's massively important to a
solid<00:06:26.120> base<00:06:26.300> and<00:06:26.660> so<00:06:27.320> they've<00:06:27.470> want<00:06:27.680> to<00:06:27.800> know

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
solid base and so they've want to know

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.800 
solid base and so they've want to know
them<00:06:28.070> know<00:06:28.550> their<00:06:28.729> jobs<00:06:28.940> and<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:29.479> hopefully

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
them know their jobs and so hopefully

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.540 
them know their jobs and so hopefully
you<00:06:29.870> can<00:06:29.990> take<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.290> into<00:06:30.440> next<00:06:30.620> season<00:06:30.770> just

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
you can take that into next season just

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.610 
you can take that into next season just
finally<00:06:31.850> it's<00:06:31.970> back<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.600> preseason<00:06:33.020> and<00:06:33.320> Tony
