field we took the best things from that
bar<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.030> incorporated<00:00:52.780> into<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:52.989> new<00:00:53.199> bar

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
bar and incorporated into a new bar

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.600 
bar and incorporated into a new bar
called<00:00:53.650> the<00:00:53.739> pinnacle<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:54.220> that's<00:00:54.370> what<00:00:54.489> you

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
called the pinnacle and that's what you

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.210 
called the pinnacle and that's what you
see<00:00:54.790> here<00:00:55.059> this<00:00:55.930> is<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.170> 48<00:00:56.440> inch<00:00:56.680> version

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220

specification the the SAE je8 4 5 and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.459 
specification the the SAE je8 4 5 and
what<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:30.820> a<00:01:31.080> 360-degree<00:01:32.080> spec<00:01:32.439> that

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
what that is is a 360-degree spec that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.340 
what that is is a 360-degree spec that
needs<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.219> meet<00:01:33.479> certain<00:01:34.479> light<00:01:34.659> outputs<00:01:35.109> on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
needs to meet certain light outputs on

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.520 
needs to meet certain light outputs on
every<00:01:35.979> given<00:01:36.219> angle<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:38.109> Sun<00:01:38.350> up

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
every given angle and the Sun up

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.859 
every given angle and the Sun up
pinnacle<00:01:38.950> actually<00:01:39.369> meets<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.939> j4<00:01:40.630> 5

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
pinnacle actually meets that j4 5

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.469 
pinnacle actually meets that j4 5
specification<00:01:41.399> with<00:01:42.399> just<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.000> end<00:01:43.180> caps

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
specification with just the end caps

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.630 
specification with just the end caps
alone<00:01:43.899> so<00:01:44.229> four<00:01:44.469> corners<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.159> bar<00:01:45.399> already

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
alone so four corners this bar already

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.969 
alone so four corners this bar already
meets<00:01:45.939> that<00:01:46.149> specification<00:01:47.109> at<00:01:47.200> 360<00:01:47.950> degrees

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
meets that specification at 360 degrees

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.240 
meets that specification at 360 degrees
so<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.149> in<00:01:49.329> boards<00:01:49.780> are<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.350> added<00:01:50.979> at<00:01:51.100> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
so the in boards are just added at that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.160 
so the in boards are just added at that
point<00:01:51.549> now<00:01:51.729> obviously<00:01:52.240> you're<00:01:52.810> gonna<00:01:52.899> get<00:01:53.109> a

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
point now obviously you're gonna get a

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.469 
point now obviously you're gonna get a
lot<00:01:53.320> of<00:01:53.380> light<00:01:53.619> out<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.100> boards<00:01:54.479> now

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
lot of light out of the in boards now

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.209 
lot of light out of the in boards now
speaking<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.960> in<00:01:56.079> boards<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.560> want<00:01:57.009> to<00:01:57.070> point

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
speaking the in boards I want to point

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.010 
speaking the in boards I want to point
out<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.640> each<00:01:57.880> one<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.179> these<00:01:58.270> in<00:01:58.539> boards<00:01:58.899> is

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
out that each one of these in boards is

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.649 
out that each one of these in boards is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
easy to install and I'll tell you why

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.420 
easy to install and I'll tell you why
it's<00:03:34.689> got<00:03:34.930> two<00:03:35.379> wires<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:35.859> come<00:03:36.040> out<00:03:36.159> of<00:03:36.189> it

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
it's got two wires that come out of it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.300 
it's got two wires that come out of it
one<00:03:37.000> wires<00:03:37.239> for<00:03:37.599> power<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.959> ground<00:03:38.139> and<00:03:38.409> it's

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
one wires for power and ground and it's

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.789 
one wires for power and ground and it's
fairly<00:03:40.150> small<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.959> intrusion<00:03:41.530> into<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
fairly small so the intrusion into the

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.550 
fairly small so the intrusion into the
roof<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.639> not<00:03:42.939> excessive<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:43.930> then<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
roof is is not excessive and then the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.949 
roof is is not excessive and then the
other<00:03:44.739> wire<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.129> a<00:03:45.159> data<00:03:45.459> cable<00:03:45.720> both<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.900> those

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
other wire is a data cable both of those

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.289 
other wire is a data cable both of those
wires<00:03:47.199> are<00:03:47.470> 15<00:03:47.799> feet<00:03:47.829> long<00:03:48.099> you<00:03:48.879> run<00:03:49.060> them<00:03:49.180> into

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
wires are 15 feet long you run them into
