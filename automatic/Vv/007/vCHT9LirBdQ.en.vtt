00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.879 
and I'd say that course I've golf the
most<00:00:11.429> has<00:00:11.610> been<00:00:11.759> true<00:00:12.030> north<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.710> there's<00:00:13.710> two

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
most has been true north and there's two

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.129 
most has been true north and there's two
courses<00:00:14.429> there<00:00:14.639> i<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.969> i<00:00:15.330> think<00:00:15.540> pinnacles

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
courses there i think i think pinnacles

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710 
courses there i think i think pinnacles
of<00:00:16.260> want<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> ease<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.770> golf<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.359> is<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.420> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
of want to ease you golf and is that is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
of want to ease you golf and is that is
that<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> name<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.289> yep<00:00:19.470> yeah<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.330> it's<00:00:21.330> uh

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
i spray the ball a lot so it's it's

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.750 
i spray the ball a lot so it's it's
probably<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.600> good<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:24.810> me<00:00:25.109> but<00:00:25.490> you<00:00:26.490> need<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
probably not good for me but you need to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.370 
probably not good for me but you need to
be<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.029> accurate<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.810> it's<00:00:28.230> not

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
be very accurate and it's not

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.589 
be very accurate and it's not
necessarily<00:00:28.500> distance<00:00:29.369> more<00:00:29.670> more<00:00:30.390> just

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
necessarily distance more more just

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.440 
necessarily distance more more just
picking<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:30.990> spots<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.030> I'm<00:00:33.030> not<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> great

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
picking your spots and I I'm not a great

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.150 
picking your spots and I I'm not a great
golfer<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.950> difficult

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
golfer so it's it's it's a difficult

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
golfer so it's it's it's a difficult
course<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.969> had<00:00:36.090> somebody's<00:00:36.540> coming<00:00:36.870> town

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
course like I had somebody's coming town

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
course like I had somebody's coming town
and<00:00:37.469> played<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.399> had<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> tough

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and played it and they had a bit a tough

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.229 
and played it and they had a bit a tough
time<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.809> too<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.950> you're<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.730> you're

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
time with it too but if you're if you're

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.790 
time with it too but if you're if you're
kind<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.510> like<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.719> call<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> grandpa<00:00:43.379> golfing

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
kind of like I call it grandpa golfing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.290 
kind of like I call it grandpa golfing
where<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.190> keep<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> straight<00:00:44.850> 200

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
where you know you keep it straight 200

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.400 
where you know you keep it straight 200
yards<00:00:45.510> every<00:00:45.629> time<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.230> should

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
yards every time I think you should

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.810 
yards every time I think you should
probably<00:00:46.500> manage<00:00:46.920> yourself<00:00:47.190> well<00:00:47.610> they're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
probably manage yourself well they're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
probably manage yourself well they're
all<00:00:48.000> right<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:49.050> are<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.680> ratings<00:00:50.160> real

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
all right these are the the ratings real

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.100 
all right these are the the ratings real
quick<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> scale<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> five<00:00:51.899> would

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
quick on a scale from one to five would

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889 
quick on a scale from one to five would
be<00:00:52.140> given<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.620> value<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.629> think<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.750> pretty

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
be given for value I think it's pretty

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.760 
be given for value I think it's pretty
expensive<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.620> golf<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:57.020> one<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
expensive to golf there as one it's in

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.740 
expensive to golf there as one it's in
the<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> winter<00:00:59.520> rates<00:00:59.730> when<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.570> like

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the in the winter rates when it's like

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.020 
the in the winter rates when it's like
peak<00:01:01.079> season<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.789> close

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
peak season here I think it's like close

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the toner bucks for realm but it is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
the toner bucks for realm but it is
rated<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.339> uh<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.240> rated

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
one of the best public courses and I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.030 
one of the best public courses and I
think<00:01:09.420> North<00:01:09.630> America<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.350> point<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
think North America at one point and I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.620 
think North America at one point and I
don't<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.670> still<00:01:11.760> there<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
don't know if it's still there but I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230 
don't know if it's still there but I
mean<00:01:13.200> sometimes<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.850> people<00:01:15.119> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
mean sometimes you know some people just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
mean sometimes you know some people just
like<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> name<00:01:16.259> drop<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.740> fact<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> was

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
like to name drop the fact that it was

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.300 
like to name drop the fact that it was
rated<00:01:17.729> high<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.450> mean<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.049> think<00:01:19.650> paying<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
rated high but I mean I think paying to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.190 
rated high but I mean I think paying to
inter<00:01:20.460> boxer<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> golf<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.390> ridiculous<00:01:21.930> but

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
inter boxer on a golf is ridiculous but

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.249 
inter boxer on a golf is ridiculous but
it's<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.220> nice<00:01:23.340> course<00:01:23.750> all<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.049> pick

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.560 
it's a nice course all right so you pick
a<00:01:25.290> number<00:01:25.470> will<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.729> value<00:01:27.060> for

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
a number will you think for value for

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.390 
a number will you think for value for
value<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.930> C<00:01:28.080> was<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> three<00:01:29.040> okay

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
value of C was just it was a three okay

about for the design of the course what
do<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> rate<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> um<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:58.770> guy<00:01:59.100> i<00:01:59.130> would<00:01:59.460> say

do you rate that um it's guy i would say
a<00:01:59.610> 4<00:01:59.700> like<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.479> said<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.259> very

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
a 4 like i said it's just it's very

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.959 
a 4 like i said it's just it's very
challenging<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.460> have<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> get<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
challenging because you have to get to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.760 
challenging because you have to get to
think<00:02:03.180> about<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.479> can't<00:02:03.630> just<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
think about you can't just get up and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.260 
think about you can't just get up and
hit<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:05.850> about<00:02:06.119> where

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
hit it and you got to think about where

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
hit it and you got to think about where
you're<00:02:06.390> gonna<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> ball<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.020> any<00:02:07.710> most

said this one was

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.850 
said this one was
was<00:02:12.540> especially<00:02:12.900> challenging<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.770> because

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
was especially challenging just because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
was especially challenging just because
I<00:02:14.070> spray<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> ball<00:02:14.460> a<00:02:14.640> lot<00:02:14.820> okay<00:02:15.270> two<00:02:15.330> more

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
that won't be about spraying the ball

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
that won't be about spraying the ball
