00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.000
 so often so here we start we go 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.100
 look for a match with the compo so 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.440
 marcelo left winger ramos point 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.360
 aquintra in the midfield even though 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.399
 quan trout m me in midfield 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.220
 so benzema left rear in the axÃ© 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.440

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.530
 highlight the hidden waters of course 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.580
 casias so I fall on a small 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.500
 chelsea team 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.960
 it was a pretty closed match with little 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.159
 second chance it is rather him who 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.630
 dominates and you will see for the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.530
 gameplay 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.810
 I also wanted to thank you for 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.420

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.750
 previous challenges and do not hesitate to me 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.179
 propose new challenges I try to 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.039
 choose the most relevant ones that are 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.229
 still achievable in the measure of 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.610
 possible but do not hesitate to contact me 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.179

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.099
 and continued laity and all that while 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.440
 what i do on on youtube 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.140
 it's really nice and so here I am 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.080
 was starting pretty well the fake match 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.429
 ramos strike and that ends on the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.890
 pole this is one of the only gestures that 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.200
 we can do with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.000
 with ramos there the little duel against 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.260
 two central defenders the passing of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.120
 legs he liked both in the 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.769
 wind i'm pulling on ronaldo ronaldo this fact 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.720
 tackle and he takes a red card 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.950
 penalty 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.430
 I did not really understand but I 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.450
 hump I do not like it so we pull the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.010
 penalty of course with sar hard admit this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.560
 in the same place as the previous video 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.700
 top right a little bit on 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.790
 the guardian's side 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.870
 in general it is to listen or where the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.870
 people have a harder time stopping 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.250
 she has benzema that me out impact 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.660
 of anthology congratulated by cr7 of course 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:55.090
 and to see the little pearl I got 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:00.670
 still pretty dominated I would have enough 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:03.280
 hot to say the aja a good opportunity 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.640
 with ramos I try a teacher lob but 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 I'm doing your key so here we go 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.090
 continue to dribble and crabos a little 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.230
 little I could just do feints 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.680
 typing and some passings of 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.000
 legs or and at the same time there's no big 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.600
 number of technical actions to perform 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.600
 chronos 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.670
 so as you can see the match 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.470
 was pretty rough 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.480
 but I'm still beautiful 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.540
 small sections and the pp for marcelo 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.370
 marcelo who turns courteous and that makes 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.370
 2-0 55th minute 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.660
 a real call and the attacker in laxe 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:45.100
 perfect small goal of marcelo 55th minute 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.120
 the guy but poses h leaves 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.510
