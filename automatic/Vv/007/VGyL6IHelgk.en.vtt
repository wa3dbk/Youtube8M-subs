00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the same design as the s3 but a little

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.460 
the same design as the s3 but a little
bit<00:03:06.130> shrink<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.090> would<00:03:07.480> say<00:03:09.959> what<00:03:10.959> else<00:03:11.140> we<00:03:11.319> can

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
bit shrink I would say what else we can

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.500 
bit shrink I would say what else we can
say<00:03:11.709> about<00:03:11.739> this<00:03:12.280> device<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:12.940> we<00:03:13.060> have<00:03:13.209> the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
say about this device so we have the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.360 
say about this device so we have the
robotic<00:03:13.959> wireless<00:03:14.530> LAN<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:15.010> Bluetooth

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
robotic wireless LAN we have Bluetooth

LTE someday we have one gigabyte RAM so

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.900 
LTE someday we have one gigabyte RAM so
like<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.299> S<00:03:31.420> we<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.769> normal<00:03:33.040> three<00:03:33.430> we

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
like the S we like the normal three we

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.210 
like the S we like the normal three we
have<00:03:34.000> four<00:03:34.269> gigabyte<00:03:34.750> internal<00:03:35.680> internal

gigabyte<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:52.109> storage<00:03:53.109> it's<00:03:53.920> normal<00:03:54.340> same<00:03:54.549> so

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
gigabyte and storage it's normal same so

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.360 
gigabyte and storage it's normal same so
micro<00:03:55.359> sim<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> normal<00:03:56.920> sim<00:03:57.070> card<00:03:58.890> no<00:03:59.890> micro

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
micro sim so a normal sim card no micro

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.340 
micro sim so a normal sim card no micro
SIM<00:04:01.000> card<00:04:02.010> nothing<00:04:03.010> else<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.489> say<00:04:03.730> here<00:04:04.480> okay

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
SIM card nothing else to say here okay

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.949 
SIM card nothing else to say here okay
let's<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.430> battery

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.410 

so<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.530> thickness<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.489> device<00:04:14.760> is<00:04:15.030> nine

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
so the thickness of the device is nine

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.749 
so the thickness of the device is nine
point<00:04:15.689> nine<00:04:15.900> millimeters<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.889> with

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
point nine millimeters and with

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.979 
point nine millimeters and with
batteries<00:04:18.829> with<00:04:19.829> weight<00:04:20.160> is<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.519> about

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
batteries with weight is around about

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.219 
batteries with weight is around about
120<00:04:21.989> gram<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.979> price<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.639> in<00:04:23.910> Europe<00:04:24.240> 300<00:04:24.930> euro

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
120 gram the price is in Europe 300 euro

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.820 
120 gram the price is in Europe 300 euro
maybe<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.699> not<00:04:27.240> maybe<00:04:27.479> in<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.020> US<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.650> also

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
maybe and not maybe in the US it's also

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.909 
maybe and not maybe in the US it's also
300<00:04:29.550> bath<00:04:29.729> dollar<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> little<00:04:31.530> bit<00:04:31.650> cheaper

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
300 bath dollar so a little bit cheaper

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.740 
300 bath dollar so a little bit cheaper
than<00:04:32.070> here<00:04:32.539> for<00:04:33.539> us<00:04:35.210> okay<00:04:36.240> let's<00:04:36.600> start<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.259> up

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
than here for us okay let's start it up

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.670 
than here for us okay let's start it up
directly<00:04:39.750> saying<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.440> three<00:04:40.710> mini<00:04:45.500> booting<00:04:46.500> up

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
directly saying a three mini booting up

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:58.149 
directly saying a three mini booting up
now<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.710> it's<00:04:49.830> quite<00:04:50.070> fast

00:04:58.149 --> 00:04:58.159 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:01.839 

we<00:04:58.849> also<00:04:59.029> make<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.330> compare<00:05:00.169> between<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.159> s3

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
we also make a compare between the s3

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.139 
we also make a compare between the s3
mini<00:05:02.029> and<00:05:02.449> the<00:05:02.809> normal<00:05:03.469> f3<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.189> show<00:05:04.759> you<00:05:04.819> the

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:05.149 
mini and the normal f3 to show you the

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:10.869 
mini and the normal f3 to show you the
big<00:05:05.899> differences<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.629> devices<00:05:09.879> some

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
big differences of the devices some

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:17.049 
big differences of the devices some
difference<00:05:11.269> between<00:05:11.629> them<00:05:13.449> let's<00:05:14.449> see<00:05:16.059> the

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:17.059 
difference between them let's see the

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:34.950 
difference between them let's see the
start<00:05:17.419> the<00:05:17.569> homescreen

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.249 

still<00:05:35.440> waiting<00:05:35.800> for<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.040> homescreen<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:38.050> come

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
still waiting for the homescreen to come

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.499 
still waiting for the homescreen to come
up<00:05:38.440> so<00:05:38.710> now<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.580> home<00:05:39.699> screen<00:05:40.000> we

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
up so now this is the home screen we

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.469 
up so now this is the home screen we
have<00:05:40.540> jellybean<00:05:41.169> 4.0<00:05:41.620> I<00:05:41.889> also<00:05:42.070> told<00:05:42.940> you<00:05:43.060> that

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.370 

the<00:05:46.479> multi-touch<00:05:46.900> display<00:05:49.110> display<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:50.350> a

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
the multi-touch display display is a

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.310 
the multi-touch display display is a
quite<00:05:50.620> good<00:05:50.650> quality<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.720> resolution<00:05:53.199> is

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
quite good quality but the resolution is

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.830 
quite good quality but the resolution is
a<00:05:53.350> little<00:05:53.620> bit<00:05:53.710> lower<00:05:53.889> than<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.430> s3<00:05:55.180> but<00:05:55.810> I

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
a little bit lower than the s3 but I

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.900 
a little bit lower than the s3 but I
will<00:05:56.110> make<00:05:56.289> another<00:05:56.470> compare<00:05:57.310> with<00:05:57.520> you<00:05:57.699> with

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
will make another compare with you with

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.420 
will make another compare with you with
the<00:05:58.060> normal<00:05:58.360> s3<00:05:58.720> so<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:58.990> can<00:05:59.259> compare<00:06:00.220> them

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
the normal s3 so you can compare them

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.529 
the normal s3 so you can compare them
directly<00:06:05.759> and<00:06:06.759> will<00:06:06.940> compare<00:06:07.240> them<00:06:07.389> directly

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
directly and will compare them directly

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.120 
directly and will compare them directly
in<00:06:08.020> this<00:06:08.199> video<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.070> thank<00:06:09.400> you<00:06:09.490> for<00:06:09.639> watching
