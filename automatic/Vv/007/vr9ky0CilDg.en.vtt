00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
marks and beliefs should be on which you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
want you do not want bleed marks makes a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.030 
want you do not want bleed marks makes a
little<00:01:06.150> too<00:01:06.330> difficult<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
little too difficult to see and I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.760 
little too difficult to see and I
suggest<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:09.180> using<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.900> bleed<00:01:10.530> settings

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
suggest just using the bleed settings

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
suggest just using the bleed settings
that<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.159> set<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.820> were<00:01:12.150> using<00:01:12.360> your

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that you set up when you were using your

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
that you set up when you were using your
document<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.040> beginning<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.549> not

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
document in the very beginning if not

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.210 
document in the very beginning if not
just<00:01:15.119> go<00:01:15.299> ahead<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.689> change<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> whatever

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
just go ahead and change it to whatever

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
just go ahead and change it to whatever
you<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> uncheck<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.159> all

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you want it to do and uncheck this all

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
right let's see output convert to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
right let's see output convert to
destination<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.729> means<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.240> by<00:01:24.600> chance

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
destination that means if I do by chance

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.780 
destination that means if I do by chance

point eight and it gets me back to four

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
point eight and it gets me back to four
pieces<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.550> paper<00:02:35.730> or<00:02:35.850> point<00:02:36.180> nine<00:02:36.330> does<00:02:36.630> the

looking for I'm trying I can actually
count<00:02:46.980> how<00:02:47.310> many<00:02:47.370> pieces<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:47.940> 11<00:02:48.510> x<00:02:48.600> 17<00:02:48.630> paper

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
count how many pieces of 11 x 17 paper

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
count how many pieces of 11 x 17 paper
it's<00:02:49.440> going<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.160> telling<00:02:51.090> me<00:02:51.210> there's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
my crop marks you can see so once i put

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
my crop marks you can see so once i put
these<00:02:55.110> four<00:02:55.470> sheets<00:02:55.710> together<00:02:55.980> they<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.550> be

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
these four sheets together they will be

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.430 
these four sheets together they will be
overlapped<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.630> what<00:02:57.810> these<00:02:57.930> kind<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
overlapped and that's what these kind of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.700 
overlapped and that's what these kind of
checkerboard<00:02:59.150> lines<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.480> telling<00:03:00.960> me<00:03:01.110> it's

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
checkerboard lines are telling me it's

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.370 
checkerboard lines are telling me it's
going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.130> use<00:03:02.460> four<00:03:02.940> pieces<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.630> 11<00:03:04.230> x<00:03:04.350> 17

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
going to use four pieces of 11 x 17

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.520 
going to use four pieces of 11 x 17
paper<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:06.240> i<00:03:06.330> know<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.350> is

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
paper and i know that because this is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.240 
paper and i know that because this is
the<00:03:07.710> i<00:03:07.860> did<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.220> page<00:03:08.490> setup<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:09.720> 11<00:03:10.110> x<00:03:10.260> 17<00:03:10.290> for

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
the i did the page setup for 11 x 17 for

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.970 
the i did the page setup for 11 x 17 for
the<00:03:11.600> whatever<00:03:12.600> printer<00:03:12.990> you<00:03:13.140> want<00:03:13.380> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.830> do

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the whatever printer you want you can do

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.580 
the whatever printer you want you can do
and<00:03:14.810> Paige<00:03:15.810> scaling<00:03:16.440> is<00:03:16.590> tile<00:03:17.100> all<00:03:17.370> pages<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and Paige scaling is tile all pages and

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.300 
and Paige scaling is tile all pages and
i<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.770> want<00:03:20.370> cut<00:03:20.670> marks<00:03:21.000> which<00:03:22.130> we've<00:03:23.130> already

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
i do want cut marks which we've already

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.280 
i do want cut marks which we've already
put<00:03:23.640> cut<00:03:23.850> marks<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.239> there<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.900> actually

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
put cut marks in there so we actually

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.410 
put cut marks in there so we actually
can<00:03:25.440> take<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.770> off<00:03:25.920> because<00:03:26.580> my<00:03:26.910> cut<00:03:27.180> marks

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
can take that off because my cut marks

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.630 
can take that off because my cut marks
are<00:03:27.540> already<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.590> there<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.430> we're<00:03:29.550> going

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
are already in in there but we're going

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.130 
are already in in there but we're going
to<00:03:29.700> leave<00:03:29.910> it<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.300> in<00:03:30.420> case<00:03:30.450> maybe<00:03:30.870> it'll

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
to leave it just in case maybe it'll

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.500 
to leave it just in case maybe it'll
give<00:03:31.260> us<00:03:31.290> some<00:03:31.590> overlap<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.390> would

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
give us some overlap and then you would

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.340 
give us some overlap and then you would
hit<00:03:33.630> print<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.950> would<00:03:35.070> print
