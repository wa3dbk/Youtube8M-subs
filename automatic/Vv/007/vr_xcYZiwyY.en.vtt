for a winter up here we have the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.950 
for a winter up here we have the
shut-off<00:00:24.689> valve<00:00:25.910> I'd<00:00:26.910> shuts<00:00:27.300> off<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.719> water

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
shut-off valve I'd shuts off the water

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.860 
shut-off valve I'd shuts off the water
to<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:29.489> sprinkler<00:00:29.939> system<00:00:31.550> you<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.730> that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.460 

turn<00:00:39.870> clockwise<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.829> shut<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:45.230> that's<00:00:46.230> all

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
turn clockwise to shut it off that's all

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.530 
turn clockwise to shut it off that's all
there<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> part<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.120> over<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
there is to that part and go over to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.690 
there is to that part and go over to
hook<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.810> there<00:00:49.050> compress<00:00:49.560> them<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.450 

blowing<00:00:53.700> out<00:00:53.880> the<00:00:54.180> water<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> doesn't

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
blowing out the water so it doesn't

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.660 
blowing out the water so it doesn't
freeze<00:00:56.930> okay<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.200> then<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.560> next<00:00:58.680> part<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
freeze okay and then the next part is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.830 
freeze okay and then the next part is
turn<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.960> power<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.460> right<00:01:03.360> there<00:01:03.600> is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
turn off the power to it right there is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.550 
turn off the power to it right there is
the<00:01:04.110> control<00:01:04.500> box<00:01:04.850> turn<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.970> off<00:01:06.259> that<00:01:07.259> takes

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the control box turn it off that takes

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
the control box turn it off that takes
care<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.829> the<00:01:07.920> electrical<00:01:08.399> part<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.759> it<00:01:08.960> and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
care of the electrical part of it and

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.190 
care of the electrical part of it and
then<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.479> drain<00:01:12.479> valve<00:01:12.840> right<00:01:13.140> here

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
then we have a drain valve right here

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.950 
then we have a drain valve right here
we're<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.040> connect<00:01:14.369> our<00:01:15.650> air<00:01:16.650> hose<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
we're going to connect our air hose to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
we're going to connect our air hose to
maybe<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.150> there<00:01:21.810> goes<00:01:23.060> we're<00:01:24.060> going

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
maybe one there there goes we're going

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
maybe one there there goes we're going
to<00:01:24.299> connect<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:27.170> nice<00:01:28.170> tight<00:01:31.159> go<00:01:32.159> borrow

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
to connect that up nice tight go borrow

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:54.849 
to connect that up nice tight go borrow
mine<00:01:35.180> return<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> air<00:01:36.420> compressor<00:01:36.930> on

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.630 

forgot<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:57.630> pressure<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.979> reduce<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
forgot to pressure right reduce the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
forgot to pressure right reduce the
pressure<00:01:59.880> down<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:00.570> 40<00:02:00.990> pounds<00:02:01.140> which

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
pressure down to about 40 pounds which

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.840 
pressure down to about 40 pounds which
is<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.859> you<00:02:01.979> need<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.340> pull<00:02:02.490> off<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
is all you need to pull off the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.609 
is all you need to pull off the
sprinklers<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.569> want<00:02:03.750> 100<00:02:04.289> pounds

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
sprinklers you don't want 100 pounds

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.200 
sprinklers you don't want 100 pounds
going<00:02:04.890> through<00:02:05.069> there<00:02:05.280> you'll<00:02:05.460> blow

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
going through there you'll blow

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.029 
going through there you'll blow
something<00:02:06.569> up<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.979> bow<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
something up so little bow down with the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.150 
something up so little bow down with the
air<00:02:11.190> pressure<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> basically<00:02:13.440> hook

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
air pressure in so you basically hook

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.150 
air pressure in so you basically hook
that<00:02:14.340> up<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.580> compressor<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.269> turn<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.599> on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
that up to the compressor and turn it on

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.720 
that up to the compressor and turn it on
now<00:02:17.160> you're<00:02:17.310> letting<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:18.049> oops<00:02:19.730> valves

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
now you're letting that oops valves

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:34.940 
now you're letting that oops valves
going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.060> bark<00:02:31.670> okay<00:02:33.319> then<00:02:34.319> go<00:02:34.500> see<00:02:34.680> how<00:02:34.799> much

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
going to bark okay then go see how much

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.229 
going to bark okay then go see how much
pressure<00:02:35.190> we<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:39.799> this<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.280> sprinkler

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
pressure we go this is the sprinkler

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.110 
pressure we go this is the sprinkler
control<00:02:42.629> box<00:02:44.299> we<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:46.010> three<00:02:47.010> zones<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:49.170> can

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
control box we have three zones you can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.470 
control box we have three zones you can
open<00:02:51.120> them<00:02:51.360> up<00:02:51.480> manually<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.670> third<00:02:54.120> blowing

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
open them up manually the third blowing

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.420 
open them up manually the third blowing
air<00:02:54.599> out

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.280 

purpose<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.390> whiskey<00:03:01.719> choice<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.170> still

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
purpose of whiskey choice is still

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.369 
purpose of whiskey choice is still
doesn't<00:03:02.890> freeze<00:03:03.780> told<00:03:06.930> pressors<00:03:07.930> not<00:03:08.140> very

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
doesn't freeze told pressors not very

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.130 
doesn't freeze told pressors not very
big<00:03:08.620> so<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:09.849> can't<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.569> it<00:03:10.689> for<00:03:10.930> three

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
big so you can't have to do it for three

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.240 
big so you can't have to do it for three
times<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.189> do<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.430> turn<00:03:16.180> this<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.599> emanuel

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
times all you do is turn this is emanuel

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.009 
times all you do is turn this is emanuel
and<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.700> important<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.180> note<00:03:19.359> to<00:03:19.510> turn<00:03:19.750> off

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
and it's important to note to turn off

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.520 
and it's important to note to turn off
of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.639> electrical<00:03:21.639> first<00:03:22.469> doesn't<00:03:23.469> really

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
of the electrical first doesn't really

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.809 
of the electrical first doesn't really
matter<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.129> you<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.430> turn<00:03:24.700> off<00:03:24.969> yeah<00:03:26.819> they

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
matter but you can turn off yeah they

there on the other side and we want to
blow<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.469> water<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:47.919> that<00:03:48.159> line<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.730> it

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
blow the water out of that line so it

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.979 
blow the water out of that line so it
doesn't<00:03:49.239> rupture<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:50.159> fries<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:51.430> rupture

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
doesn't rupture and fries and rupture

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.659 
doesn't rupture and fries and rupture
basically<00:03:52.989> because<00:03:53.379> it's<00:03:53.680> Underground<00:03:54.310> and

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
basically because it's Underground and

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:00.390 
basically because it's Underground and
we<00:03:54.819> don't<00:03:54.939> want<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.359> have<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.500> dig<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.829> up<00:03:59.400> all

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
we don't want to have to dig it up all

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:09.119 
we don't want to have to dig it up all
the<00:04:00.489> water

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.380 

generally<00:04:10.129> you<00:04:10.220> have<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.610> do<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.909> two<00:04:11.269> or<00:04:11.299> three

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
generally you have to do it two or three

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.960 
generally you have to do it two or three
times<00:04:11.750> cuz<00:04:12.200> it'll<00:04:12.500> it'll<00:04:13.280> blow<00:04:13.519> out<00:04:13.670> some

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
times cuz it'll it'll blow out some

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.300 
times cuz it'll it'll blow out some
water<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.569> then<00:04:14.720> you'll<00:04:14.870> get<00:04:15.019> some<00:04:15.170> air<00:04:15.409> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
water and then you'll get some air the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.860 
water and then you'll get some air the
water<00:04:16.519> will<00:04:16.760> settle<00:04:16.970> down<00:04:17.180> again<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.750> then

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
water will settle down again and then

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.319 
water will settle down again and then
you<00:04:17.989> do<00:04:18.139> it<00:04:18.169> two<00:04:18.440> three<00:04:18.590> times<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.269> what<00:04:20.269> do

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
going to disconnect the pump right there

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.640 
going to disconnect the pump right there
hook<00:04:26.090> up<00:04:26.240> another<00:04:26.360> line<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.229> pump<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.620> water
