00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
okay so I'm going to start with this ivy

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.650 
okay so I'm going to start with this ivy
well<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.739> think<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.370> might<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.940> ivy<00:04:12.239> is<00:04:12.359> known

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
well I think I might the ivy is known

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.390 
well I think I might the ivy is known
who<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.230> more<00:04:13.410> delicate<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:14.010> think<00:04:14.190> this<00:04:14.280> is

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
who is more delicate and I think this is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.789 
who is more delicate and I think this is
more<00:04:14.549> chunky<00:04:15.060> I<00:04:15.269> feel<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.169> need<00:04:16.380> for<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.680> little

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
more chunky I feel the need for a little

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.490 
more chunky I feel the need for a little
bit<00:04:17.070> more<00:04:17.250> white<00:04:17.639> in<00:04:18.150> mind<00:04:18.599> to<00:04:18.900> balance<00:04:19.320> out

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
bit more white in mind to balance out

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.640 
bit more white in mind to balance out
the<00:04:19.709> red<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.729> when<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.690> use<00:04:22.019> flowers<00:04:22.380> like

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
the red and when you use flowers like

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.040 
the red and when you use flowers like
this<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.940> perhaps<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.419> part<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.810> you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
this it's it's perhaps a part that you

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.839 
this it's it's perhaps a part that you
can<00:04:25.080> keep<00:04:25.620> refreshing<00:04:27.199> okay<00:04:28.199> moment<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.650> truth

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849
