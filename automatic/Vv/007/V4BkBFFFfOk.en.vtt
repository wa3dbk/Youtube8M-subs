first thing you want to do is fall to

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.020 
first thing you want to do is fall to
paper<00:00:10.769> corner<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.280> corner<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.790> create<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
paper corner to corner and create a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:33.180 
paper corner to corner and create a
crease<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.900> do<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> scene<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.619> other<00:00:22.769> way

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.790 

now<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:34.280> want<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.580> create<00:00:34.790> a<00:00:34.910> waterbomb<00:00:35.600> base

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
now you want to create a waterbomb base

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.130 
now you want to create a waterbomb base
by<00:00:36.800> performing<00:00:37.309> following<00:00:37.730> action<00:00:41.140> which

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
by performing following action which

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.750 
by performing following action which
first<00:00:42.470> time<00:00:42.710> doing<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.190> it<00:00:43.460> may<00:00:43.640> require

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
first time doing this it may require

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.870 
first time doing this it may require
about<00:00:44.420> practice

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.280 

fold<00:00:49.450> this<00:00:49.630> flap<00:00:49.690> up<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.380> the<00:00:50.470> top

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:08.950 

I'm<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> same<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.400> other<00:00:56.430> side

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.310 

you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.320 

they<00:01:11.920> fold<00:01:12.190> each<00:01:12.370> of<00:01:12.520> these<00:01:12.670> sides<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
they fold each of these sides to the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:25.440 
they fold each of these sides to the
center<00:01:13.510> line<00:01:13.900> like<00:01:14.170> so

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.529 

these<00:01:26.049> two<00:01:26.289> flaps<00:01:26.560> here<00:01:30.180> unfolding<00:01:31.180> into

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
these two flaps here unfolding into

00:01:31.539 --> 00:02:02.170 
these two flaps here unfolding into
these<00:01:32.049> slots

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.930 

after<00:02:02.870> you've<00:02:02.990> done<00:02:03.110> that<00:02:03.290> take<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.620> over<00:02:03.940> now

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
after you've done that take it over now

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.700 
after you've done that take it over now
for<00:02:05.000> each<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.390> these<00:02:05.660> sides<00:02:05.960> down<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.620> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
for each of these sides down to the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:22.430 
for each of these sides down to the
centerline

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.699 

now<00:02:22.950> fold<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.310> side<00:02:23.810> outwards

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:37.270 

to<00:02:29.709> create<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.250> angle<00:02:30.730> here

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.000 

I<00:02:38.440> fold<00:02:39.440> them<00:02:39.560> both<00:02:39.740> together<00:02:40.010> like<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:45.010> now

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
I fold them both together like so now

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.140 
I fold them both together like so now
the<00:02:46.069> fish<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.400> still<00:02:46.670> flat<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.730> with<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.970> back

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
the fish is still flat so with the back

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.500 
the fish is still flat so with the back
this<00:02:50.660> should<00:02:50.870> be<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.020> little<00:02:51.140> hole<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:53.330> blow

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
this should be a little hole to blow

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.300 
this should be a little hole to blow
some<00:02:53.690> air<00:02:53.840> into<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.260> hole<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.739> stored<00:02:55.160> my

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
some air into this hole I stored my

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:27.070 
some air into this hole I stored my
paper<00:02:55.580> water

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.140
