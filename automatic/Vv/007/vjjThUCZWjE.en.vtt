when it decelerates obviously yeah it's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.320 
when it decelerates obviously yeah it's
a<00:01:55.450> lot<00:01:55.630> quieter<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.280> yeah<00:01:57.970> we're<00:01:58.150> going<00:01:58.270> to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
a lot quieter but yeah we're going to

bring her in on on Friday to get her
fixed<00:02:01.320> but<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.680> don't<00:02:02.800> want<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.100> wif

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
fixed but I just don't want the wif

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.710 
fixed but I just don't want the wif
driving<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.730> around<00:02:04.030> like<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.420> because

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
driving this around like this because

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.240 
driving this around like this because
she<00:02:04.900> might<00:02:05.050> piss<00:02:05.290> off<00:02:05.440> too<00:02:05.680> many<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.070> wrong

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.800 
she might piss off too many and wrong
people<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:06.910> I<00:02:06.970> figured<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.390> could<00:02:07.420> do<00:02:07.660> that

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
people so I figured I could do that

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.430 
people so I figured I could do that
instead

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
instead

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.380 
instead
so<00:02:09.190> anyway<00:02:09.460> that's<00:02:09.670> what<00:02:09.850> we're<00:02:10.000> doing<00:02:10.300> or

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
so anyway that's what we're doing or

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.570 
so anyway that's what we're doing or

what<00:03:17.300> couldn't<00:03:17.569> come<00:03:17.720> soon<00:03:17.989> enough<00:03:18.110> but

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
what couldn't come soon enough but

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.729 
what couldn't come soon enough but
another<00:03:18.830> day<00:03:19.099> done<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:20.480> think<00:03:21.349> we'll<00:03:21.470> open<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
another day done I think we'll open the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.229 
another day done I think we'll open the
window<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.160> time<00:03:22.220> because<00:03:22.670> I<00:03:22.790> did<00:03:22.940> review

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
window this time because I did review

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.360 
window this time because I did review
the<00:03:23.300> video<00:03:23.630> before<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.140> it's<00:03:25.010> kind<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.220> hard

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
the video before and it's kind of hard

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.520 
the video before and it's kind of hard
to<00:03:25.489> tell<00:03:25.790> what<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.810> sound<00:03:27.050> was<00:03:27.200> because<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
to tell what the sound was because the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.020 
to tell what the sound was because the
camera<00:03:27.860> muffles<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.459> because<00:03:28.819> of<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
camera muffles it because of the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.350 
camera muffles it because of the
automatic<00:03:29.660> level<00:03:29.930> correction<00:03:30.910> or<00:03:31.910> control

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
automatic level correction or control

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.979 
automatic level correction or control
whatever<00:03:32.600> you<00:03:32.810> call<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.510> we'll<00:03:35.660> open<00:03:35.780> the

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
whatever you call it so we'll open the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:50.690 
whatever you call it so we'll open the
window

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.580 

so<00:03:51.240> hopefully<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.930> gives<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.319> a<00:03:52.349> better

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
so hopefully that gives you a better

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.610 
so hopefully that gives you a better
idea<00:03:53.569> anyway<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.630> think<00:03:54.870> I'll<00:03:55.170> hit<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.410> grocery

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
