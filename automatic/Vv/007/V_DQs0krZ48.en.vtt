00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and the top and left the back plane so I

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.880 
and the top and left the back plane so I
could<00:00:54.360> make<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.690> cuts<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.199> openings<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
could make my cuts and openings for a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.970 
could make my cuts and openings for a
refrigerator<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> microwave<00:00:57.859> for<00:00:58.859> the

canopy<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.670> cut<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.030> piece<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.570> foam<00:01:00.870> core<00:01:01.199> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
canopy I cut one piece of foam core then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680 
canopy I cut one piece of foam core then
scored<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> bent<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.609> almost<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.120> half<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
scored it and bent it almost in half I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
scored it and bent it almost in half I
glued<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.439> dowel<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.949> support<00:01:05.339> across<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
glued a dowel for support across the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
glued a dowel for support across the
middle<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.270> didn't<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.170> four<00:01:07.439> holes

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
middle I didn't want to put four holes

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.429 
middle I didn't want to put four holes
in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> pretty<00:01:08.549> foam<00:01:08.820> core<00:01:09.180> snack<00:01:09.479> counter<00:01:09.720> so

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
in the pretty foam core snack counter so

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.050 
in the pretty foam core snack counter so
when<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> tried<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> work<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.850> two

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
when I tried to make it work with two

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
when I tried to make it work with two
legs<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.570> instead<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.320> four<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.920> fell<00:01:14.369> off

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
legs and instead of four and it fell off

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.539 
legs and instead of four and it fell off
I<00:01:15.030> decided<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.200> needed<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.619> use<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.159> last

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
I decided that I needed to use my last

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
I decided that I needed to use my last
bit<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> foam<00:01:18.270> core<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> make<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.990> legs<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
bit of foam core to make the legs to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.679 
bit of foam core to make the legs to
support<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.979> canopy<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> had<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
support the canopy you can see I had to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
support the canopy you can see I had to
angle<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.080> foam<00:01:22.439> core<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> mimic<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.220> curve

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
angle the foam core to mimic the curve

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
angle the foam core to mimic the curve
of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> canopy<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> top<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.930> had<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
of the canopy at the top I had to use a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
of the canopy at the top I had to use a
large<00:01:26.400> amount<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> hot<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.390> we're<00:01:27.479> putting<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
large amount of hot and we're putting it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
large amount of hot and we're putting it
all<00:01:28.110> together<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> removable<00:01:30.150> however

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
all together it is removable however

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.649 
all together it is removable however
because<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.229> whole<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.159> holes<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:33.090> hold<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
because the whole the holes do hold the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.859 
because the whole the holes do hold the
dowels<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.100> side<00:01:35.549> supports<00:01:36.150> are<00:01:36.420> just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
dowels and the side supports are just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.469 
dowels and the side supports are just
slightly<00:01:37.710> shorter<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.909> rest<00:01:39.360> on

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
slightly shorter so they just rest on

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.160 
slightly shorter so they just rest on
top<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> cart<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:41.570> made<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.600> signs<00:01:42.990> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
top of the cart I made some signs in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
top of the cart I made some signs in
