00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
red background I'm gonna use black
acrylic<00:00:36.840> paint<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.460> using<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.000> bit

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
acrylic paint and I'm using a little bit

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.810 
acrylic paint and I'm using a little bit
of<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:40.079> wet<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.160> black<00:00:41.520> acrylic

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
of water to wet out my black acrylic

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.510 
of water to wet out my black acrylic
paint<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.350> make<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> little<00:00:44.309> bit

paint I want to make it a little bit
transparent<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.200> really

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
transparent see right now it's really

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
transparent see right now it's really
quite<00:00:48.030> dark<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.620> reason<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
quite dark and the reason for this is

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.680 
quite dark and the reason for this is
when<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.640> multiple<00:00:51.210> stripes

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
when I do multiple stripes

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.560 
when I do multiple stripes
I<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> stripes<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.829> overlap<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.730> be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I want the stripes to overlap and be

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.830 
I want the stripes to overlap and be
darker<00:00:54.989> where<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.440> meet<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:57.360> first

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
darker where they meet so this first

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
darker where they meet so this first
coat<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.550> gonna<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.850> very<00:01:00.210> wet

coat I'm gonna do it's gonna be very wet
and<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.760> should<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.420> slightly<00:01:04.019> transparent

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090
