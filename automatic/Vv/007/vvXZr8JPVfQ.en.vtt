00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.939 

but<00:06:03.310> anyway<00:06:03.669> it's<00:06:04.509> just<00:06:04.629> another<00:06:05.590> one<00:06:05.770> of<00:06:05.800> the

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.540 
but anyway it's just another one of the
gate<00:06:06.069> machines<00:06:06.400> I<00:06:06.520> got<00:06:08.159> next<00:06:09.159> I<00:06:09.250> think<00:06:09.430> I'll

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
gate machines I got next I think I'll

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.909 
gate machines I got next I think I'll
put<00:06:09.669> up<00:06:09.729> a<00:06:10.050> video<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.259> the<00:06:13.440> Virtual<00:06:14.440> Boy<00:06:14.710> or

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
it but for right now I just thought I'd

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.029 
it but for right now I just thought I'd
give<00:06:20.110> you<00:06:20.139> a<00:06:20.229> taste<00:06:20.440> of<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.620> old<00:06:20.740> PC<00:06:21.280> FX<00:06:21.729> so<00:06:23.039> see

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039
