I really have to say you're going to be

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.660 
I really have to say you're going to be
loud<00:03:48.630> alright<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.350> continuing<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.220> gameplay

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
loud alright so continuing the gameplay

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.730 
loud alright so continuing the gameplay
you<00:03:51.660> need<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> go<00:03:51.960> through<00:03:52.140> this<00:03:52.260> building<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
you need to go through this building you

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.170 
you need to go through this building you
might<00:03:52.950> need<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.160> take<00:03:53.340> cover<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.940> window

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
might need to take cover that window

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.630 
might need to take cover that window
there<00:03:54.600> it's<00:03:54.870> unlikely<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.070> somebody<00:03:56.550> will

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
there it's unlikely that somebody will

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.460 
there it's unlikely that somebody will
be<00:03:56.760> there<00:03:56.910> but<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.330> said<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.750> check<00:03:58.080> to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
be there but like I said if you check to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.380 
be there but like I said if you check to
the<00:03:58.500> right<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:59.370> should<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.700> able<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.000> know<00:04:00.180> if

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the right you should be able to know if

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.420 
the right you should be able to know if
somebody's<00:04:00.720> going<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.900> be<00:04:01.050> there<00:04:01.200> anyways<00:04:01.590> so

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
somebody's going to be there anyways so

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.280 
somebody's going to be there anyways so
just<00:04:02.730> go<00:04:02.910> right<00:04:03.090> through<00:04:03.420> there<00:04:04.080> might<00:04:04.260> be

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
just go right through there might be

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.870 
just go right through there might be
people<00:04:04.470> there<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.459> took<00:04:05.580> them<00:04:05.730> out

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
and the clips following you'll notice

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.320

up<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.070> building<00:04:14.580> there<00:04:15.209> could<00:04:15.330> be

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
up in this building there could be

because you didn't know he was there so

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.900 
because you didn't know he was there so
you<00:04:51.479> need<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.720> check<00:04:52.010> on<00:04:53.010> almost<00:04:53.340> all<00:04:53.550> rush

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
you need to check on almost all rush

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.700 
you need to check on almost all rush
routes<00:04:54.180> there<00:04:54.690> are<00:04:54.870> always<00:04:55.080> times<00:04:55.440> when<00:04:55.560> you

left or right to make sure your path is
safe<00:04:59.100> now<00:04:59.610> in<00:04:59.729> this<00:04:59.880> path<00:05:00.120> i'm<00:05:00.360> not<00:05:00.510> using

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
safe now in this path i'm not using

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.580 
safe now in this path i'm not using
lightweight<00:05:01.020> because<00:05:01.860> i<00:05:02.370> love<00:05:02.850> flak<00:05:03.120> jacket

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
lightweight because i love flak jacket

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.170 
lightweight because i love flak jacket
so<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.620> now<00:05:04.800> use<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.160> specter<00:05:05.580> at<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.700> npl

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
so you now use the specter at the npl

works<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.540> lightweight<00:05:22.110> jammer<00:05:22.410> combo

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
works but the lightweight jammer combo

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.590 
works but the lightweight jammer combo
also<00:05:23.250> works<00:05:23.550> just<00:05:23.820> whatever<00:05:24.150> your<00:05:24.330> preference

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
also works just whatever your preference

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.830 
also works just whatever your preference
is<00:05:25.700> obviously<00:05:26.700> if<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:26.970> have<00:05:27.090> flak<00:05:27.330> jacket<00:05:27.720> and

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
is obviously if you have flak jacket and

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.450 
is obviously if you have flak jacket and
what<00:05:27.930> you're<00:05:28.140> still<00:05:28.380> subject<00:05:28.590> to<00:05:28.919> motion

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
what you're still subject to motion

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.120 
what you're still subject to motion
sensors<00:05:29.970> with<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.720> jammer<00:05:31.020> you're<00:05:31.290> not<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:31.919> if

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
sensors with the jammer you're not so if

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.770 
sensors with the jammer you're not so if
you<00:05:32.280> don't<00:05:32.610> like<00:05:32.850> motion<00:05:33.120> sensors<00:05:33.570> and<00:05:33.720> you

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
you don't like motion sensors and you

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.030 
you don't like motion sensors and you
think<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.080> other<00:05:34.169> teams<00:05:34.350> using<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.830> lot<00:05:35.010> of

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
think the other teams using a lot of

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.170 
think the other teams using a lot of
them<00:05:35.160> and<00:05:35.340> they're<00:05:35.430> hiding<00:05:35.640> in<00:05:35.729> this<00:05:35.850> building

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
them and they're hiding in this building

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.969 
them and they're hiding in this building
then<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:37.080> know<00:05:37.200> what<00:05:37.350> go<00:05:37.530> with<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.740> jammer

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
then you know what go with the jammer

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.350 
then you know what go with the jammer
lightweight<00:05:38.400> combo<00:05:38.760> who<00:05:38.910> doesn't<00:05:39.270> really

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
lightweight combo who doesn't really

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.999 
lightweight combo who doesn't really
matter<00:05:39.570> to<00:05:39.750> me

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.529
