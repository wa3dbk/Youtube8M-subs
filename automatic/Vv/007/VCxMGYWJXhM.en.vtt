00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
this is still one I use I like this lamb

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.020 
this is still one I use I like this lamb
because<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:37.109> first<00:03:37.470> ingredient<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.549> here<00:03:38.849> is

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
because the first ingredient in here is

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.530

at<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.849> same<00:04:09.030> time<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:09.900> make<00:04:10.139> you<00:04:10.260> feel

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
at the same time it can make you feel

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.789 
at the same time it can make you feel
dry<00:04:10.889> because<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:11.940> alkaline<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:13.500> want<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
dry because it's so alkaline you want to

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.780 
dry because it's so alkaline you want to
use<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.919> toner<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:15.450> bring<00:04:15.959> your<00:04:16.469> pH<00:04:16.859> balance

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
use a toner to bring your pH balance

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.140 
use a toner to bring your pH balance
your<00:04:18.300> toner<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.590> more<00:04:19.860> acidic<00:04:20.340> so

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
your toner is going is more acidic so

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.330 
your toner is going is more acidic so
it's<00:04:21.420> going<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.690> bring<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.380> alkaline

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
it's going to bring that alkaline

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.200 
it's going to bring that alkaline
cleanser<00:04:24.530> back<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.220> your<00:04:26.340> normal<00:04:26.640> ph

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
cleanser back down to your normal ph

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.130 
cleanser back down to your normal ph
which<00:04:27.660> is<00:04:27.810> between<00:04:27.960> 4.5<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.160> 5.5<00:04:29.540> so<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.960> is

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
which is between 4.5 to 5.5 so this is

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.130 
which is between 4.5 to 5.5 so this is
why<00:04:31.320> this<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.620> very<00:04:31.980> important<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:33.480> your<00:04:33.720> skin

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
is that a healthy pH then you're going

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.010 
is that a healthy pH then you're going

be fine and healthy skin the same way

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.190 
be fine and healthy skin the same way
your<00:04:50.640> skin<00:04:50.790> is<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.210> good<00:04:51.450> pH<00:04:51.750> then<00:04:52.080> this

your skin is that a good pH then this

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.420 
your skin is that a good pH then this

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
could be nice and healthy it's going to

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.610 
could be nice and healthy it's going to
always<00:04:53.610> look<00:04:53.970> good<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.510> it's<00:04:55.050> also<00:04:55.230> going<00:04:55.530> to

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
always look good and it's also going to

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.380 
always look good and it's also going to
even<00:04:55.890> out<00:04:55.980> your<00:04:56.160> skin<00:04:56.220> tone<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.880> have<00:04:57.120> some

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
even out your skin tone you have some

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.430 
even out your skin tone you have some
people<00:04:57.810> have<00:04:58.440> blotchiness<00:04:59.100> on<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.640> skin<00:04:59.970> and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
people have blotchiness on the skin and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.530 
people have blotchiness on the skin and
they<00:05:01.440> might<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.800> discoloration<00:05:02.400> well<00:05:03.330> if

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
they might have discoloration well if

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.600 
they might have discoloration well if
you<00:05:03.720> have<00:05:03.930> your<00:05:04.080> pH<00:05:04.440> balance<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.100> check<00:05:05.310> then

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
you have your pH balance and check then

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.700 
you have your pH balance and check then
that<00:05:05.820> can<00:05:06.000> help<00:05:06.300> minimize<00:05:06.570> some<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.230> that<00:05:07.440> also

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
that can help minimize some of that also

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.870 
that can help minimize some of that also
so<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:09.240> me<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.010> most<00:05:11.250> important

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
so this to me it's the most important

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.450 
so this to me it's the most important
thing<00:05:12.120> in<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.510> skin<00:05:12.840> care<00:05:13.110> routine<00:05:13.260> like<00:05:14.100> if<00:05:14.340> I

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
thing in the skin care routine like if I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.310 
thing in the skin care routine like if I
run<00:05:14.700> out<00:05:14.730> of<00:05:14.850> this<00:05:15.090> I'm<00:05:15.390> going<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.140> store

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
run out of this I'm going to the store

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.560 
run out of this I'm going to the store
to<00:05:16.380> get<00:05:16.620> some<00:05:16.800> more<00:05:16.980> because<00:05:17.790> this<00:05:18.210> is<00:05:18.390> very

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
to get some more because this is very

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.690 
to get some more because this is very
important<00:05:18.960> I<00:05:19.140> didn't<00:05:19.470> realize<00:05:19.530> how<00:05:20.160> important

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
important I didn't realize how important

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.970 
important I didn't realize how important
a<00:05:20.790> toner<00:05:21.030> was<00:05:21.360> until<00:05:22.260> I<00:05:22.290> really<00:05:22.770> really

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
a toner was until I really really

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.370 
a toner was until I really really
started<00:05:23.400> studying<00:05:23.850> about<00:05:24.480> skin<00:05:24.930> care<00:05:25.170> at

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
started studying about skin care at

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.620 
started studying about skin care at
school<00:05:25.770> and<00:05:26.040> I<00:05:26.460> noticed<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:26.880> big<00:05:26.910> difference<00:05:27.120> in

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
school and I noticed a big difference in

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.950 
school and I noticed a big difference in
my<00:05:27.750> skin<00:05:27.810> my<00:05:28.770> skin<00:05:28.800> tone<00:05:29.400> became<00:05:29.880> more<00:05:30.180> even<00:05:30.690> um

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
my skin my skin tone became more even um

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.040 
my skin my skin tone became more even um
I<00:05:31.710> don't<00:05:32.040> have<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.430> many<00:05:32.610> breakouts<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.630> my

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
I don't have as many breakouts and my

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.540 
I don't have as many breakouts and my
skin<00:05:34.290> jus<00:05:34.440> feels<00:05:34.740> good<00:05:34.980> it<00:05:35.130> feels<00:05:35.160> really

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
skin jus feels good it feels really

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.790 
skin jus feels good it feels really
smooth<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.150> my<00:05:36.210> pores<00:05:36.570> look<00:05:37.050> smaller<00:05:37.110> because

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
smooth in my pores look smaller because

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.640 
smooth in my pores look smaller because
you<00:05:38.550> minimize<00:05:39.060> Lumpur<00:05:39.480> sucking<00:05:39.840> your<00:05:39.990> pH<00:05:40.290> back

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650
