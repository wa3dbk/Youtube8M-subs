00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
mean you could really you could put some

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.160 
mean you could really you could put some
mineral<00:02:11.430> oil<00:02:11.489> or<00:02:11.910> something<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> blade

mineral oil or something on the blade
if<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.590> really

they're coming stock an unusual feature

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.660 
they're coming stock an unusual feature
with<00:02:35.440> their<00:02:35.530> at<00:02:35.620> knives<00:02:35.830> they<00:02:36.129> have<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.340> coil

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
with their at knives they have this coil

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.020 
with their at knives they have this coil
here<00:02:37.120> which<00:02:37.629> is<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.780> slight<00:02:38.700> indent<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
here which is a slight indent in the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.680 
here which is a slight indent in the
blade<00:02:40.239> but<00:02:40.959> often<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.260> tall<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.920> an

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
blade but often the tall is just a an

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.759 
blade but often the tall is just a an
unaged<00:02:43.690> part<00:02:44.019> of<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.170> blade<00:02:44.349> where<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.680> can

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
unaged part of the blade where you can

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.979 
unaged part of the blade where you can
put<00:02:44.950> your<00:02:45.069> finger<00:02:45.400> this<00:02:45.819> one<00:02:46.030> has<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> as<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.720> cut

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
put your finger this one has a as a cut

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.210 
put your finger this one has a as a cut
out<00:02:47.019> quite<00:02:47.440> cut<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.769> find<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.130> quite

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
out quite cut I find it quite

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.009 
out quite cut I find it quite
comfortable<00:02:48.459> actually<00:02:48.849> and<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.630> find<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.930> quite

comfortable actually and I find it quite

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.960 
comfortable actually and I find it quite
useful<00:02:50.260> when<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:50.769> doing<00:02:51.010> very<00:02:51.190> fine<00:02:51.730> work

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

gives you a lot of extra control it's
quite<00:02:55.480> an<00:02:55.569> interesting<00:02:55.750> feature<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:57.370> you

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
quite an interesting feature and you

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.880 
quite an interesting feature and you
don't<00:02:58.510> often<00:02:58.629> see<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.049> on<00:02:59.349> some<00:02:59.590> knives<00:02:59.769> you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
don't often see that on some knives you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.530 
don't often see that on some knives you
do<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:00.579> it's<00:03:00.700> nice<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.849> have<00:03:01.120> actually<00:03:01.450> I

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
do but it's nice to have actually I

and been very pleased with it I'm going
to<00:03:14.290> quickly<00:03:14.440> show<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.680> sheathing<00:03:14.950> systems

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
to quickly show the sheathing systems

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.740 
to quickly show the sheathing systems
because<00:03:15.579> they<00:03:15.670> are<00:03:15.910> interesting<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.599> once

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
you put a lot of work and thought into

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.460 
you put a lot of work and thought into
these<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:21.130> shoes<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.549> come<00:03:21.819> with<00:03:21.970> are<00:03:22.470> this

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
these the shoes they come with are this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.520 
these the shoes they come with are this
is<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> plastic<00:03:23.889> sheet<00:03:24.690> has<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> double<00:03:26.079> lock<00:03:26.260> on

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
is a plastic sheet has a double lock on

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.849 
is a plastic sheet has a double lock on
the<00:03:26.739> knife<00:03:26.889> so<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:28.630> nice<00:03:28.780> lock<00:03:29.049> in<00:03:29.230> like<00:03:29.650> this

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
the knife so the nice lock in like this

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.400 
the knife so the nice lock in like this
and<00:03:30.069> then<00:03:30.220> there's<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.840> band<00:03:31.840> round<00:03:32.109> there<00:03:32.290> as

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and then there's a band round there as

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.759 
and then there's a band round there as
well

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
well

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.699 
well
so<00:03:32.889> you<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.099> double<00:03:33.250> locking<00:03:33.549> mechanism

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
so you have a double locking mechanism

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.650 
so you have a double locking mechanism
you<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:35.739> buy<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.040> knives<00:03:36.359> with<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.450> sheath

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
you can buy the knives with the sheath

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.349 
you can buy the knives with the sheath
with<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.889> they<00:03:38.950> call<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.190> tech<00:03:39.400> locks<00:03:39.639> which

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
with what they call the tech locks which

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.050 
with what they call the tech locks which
are<00:03:40.660> systems<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.829> can<00:03:41.950> use<00:03:42.160> which<00:03:42.519> screw<00:03:42.880> on
