look here what we did is a light bar
across<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> windshield<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.350> split<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> in

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
across the windshield and we split it in

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.290 
across the windshield and we split it in
the<00:00:25.890> middle<00:00:27.050> red<00:00:28.050> blue<00:00:28.730> strobing<00:00:29.730> back<00:00:30.090> and

the middle red blue strobing back and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.200 
the middle red blue strobing back and
forth<00:00:31.550> we<00:00:32.550> also<00:00:32.730> did<00:00:34.520> lights<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> forks

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
forth we also did lights on the forks

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.190 
forth we also did lights on the forks
and<00:00:36.770> those<00:00:37.770> Walternate<00:00:38.780> red<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.960> blue<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
and those Walternate red and blue and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.580 
and those Walternate red and blue and
strobe<00:00:41.030> as<00:00:42.030> well<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> strip<00:00:42.989> across<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
strobe as well as a strip across the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
strobe as well as a strip across the
fender<00:00:44.719> and<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.469> alternates<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.820> we'll

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
fender and that also alternates so we'll

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.369 
fender and that also alternates so we'll
go<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.750> turn<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.079> back<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:51.379> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
go back up and turn these back on and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.729 
go back up and turn these back on and
we'll<00:00:52.680> zoom<00:00:53.010> back<00:00:53.219> around<00:00:54.320> here's<00:00:55.320> your<00:00:55.530> red

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
we'll zoom back around here's your red

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
we'll zoom back around here's your red
and<00:00:55.770> blue<00:00:56.070> for<00:00:56.610> craps<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.239> here's<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.420> side

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
and blue for craps and here's your side

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.340 
and blue for craps and here's your side
light<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.920> red<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.070> blue<00:01:06.020> these<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.080> all

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
light and red and blue these are all

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
light and red and blue these are all
done<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> clear<00:01:08.070> tubing<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.820> flexible

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
done in a clear tubing with flexible

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.230 
done in a clear tubing with flexible
arrays<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.290> millimeter<00:01:10.740> spacing

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
arrays with one millimeter spacing

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.490 
arrays with one millimeter spacing
allowing<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.360> bike<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> very

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
allowing this bike to have a very

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
allowing this bike to have a very
stealth<00:01:13.950> look<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.700> these<00:01:14.820> lights<00:01:15.180> are<00:01:15.390> off

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
stealth look when these lights are off

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
stealth look when these lights are off
it's<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.500> difficult<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> tell<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's very difficult to tell that this is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.120 
it's very difficult to tell that this is
a<00:01:18.060> police<00:01:18.479> bike<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> we'll<00:01:20.340> head<00:01:20.490> down<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
a police bike and we'll head down to the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
a police bike and we'll head down to the
to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> saddlebag<00:01:23.759> rails<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.810> we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
to the saddlebag rails as you can see we

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.789 
to the saddlebag rails as you can see we
did<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> side<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.159> red<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> blue<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
did two on the side one red one blue and

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
did two on the side one red one blue and
we<00:01:28.799> wrapped<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.610> around<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> back<00:01:33.020> we

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we wrapped them right around the back we

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.580 
we wrapped them right around the back we
did<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.560> both<00:01:34.740> sides<00:01:36.140> including<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
did this on both sides including the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.800 
did this on both sides including the
blue<00:01:37.770> lights<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.280> license<00:01:38.729> plate<00:01:38.820> tag<00:01:40.220> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
blue lights on the license plate tag and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.389 
blue lights on the license plate tag and
we'll<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.439> turn<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.799> emergency

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
we'll back up and turn these emergency

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.289 
we'll back up and turn these emergency
lights<00:01:44.610> off<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:47.180> what<00:01:48.180> exactly

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
lights off so you can see what exactly

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.020 
lights off so you can see what exactly
we<00:01:48.869> did<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:50.149> we'll<00:01:51.149> go<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:53.030> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
we did here we'll go back down in you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
we did here we'll go back down in you
can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.509> flexible<00:01:55.140> arrays<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> we

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can see the flexible arrays that we

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.819 
can see the flexible arrays that we
attached<00:01:57.229> underneath<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.560> rail<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
attached underneath the rail and we

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.059 
attached underneath the rail and we
wrapped<00:02:02.130> them<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:03.619> around<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> back<00:02:07.069> and

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
wrapped them here around the back and

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.119 
wrapped them here around the back and
again<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.550> gives<00:02:08.819> us<00:02:09.000> bike

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
again this gives us bike

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.289 
again this gives us bike
very<00:02:10.759> stealthy<00:02:11.420> look<00:02:12.819> because<00:02:13.819> other<00:02:14.209> than

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
very stealthy look because other than

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.880 
very stealthy look because other than
the<00:02:14.510> blue<00:02:14.810> running<00:02:15.200> lights<00:02:15.500> that<00:02:15.739> were

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
the blue running lights that were

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.550 
the blue running lights that were
mounted<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.609> Lake<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:18.200> looks<00:02:18.379> like<00:02:18.530> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
mounted on this Lake it looks like a

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.410 
mounted on this Lake it looks like a
stock<00:02:18.920> Harley<00:02:19.250> going<00:02:19.670> down<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:20.000> road<00:02:22.420> until

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
stock Harley going down the road until

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.160 
stock Harley going down the road until
you<00:02:23.599> go<00:02:23.780> too<00:02:23.840> fast<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:26.390> officer<00:02:26.810> decides

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
you go too fast and the officer decides

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.849 
you go too fast and the officer decides
to<00:02:27.379> turn<00:02:27.560> all<00:02:27.769> these<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:30.379> a<00:02:30.409> complete

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
to turn all these on this is a complete
