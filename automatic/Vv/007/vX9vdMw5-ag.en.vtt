00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.800
 fashion is so today it's a 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.560
 big motor trucks with a bus there 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.930
 frankly I'm really surprised 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.440
 this vehicle because frankly see 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.540
 a bus in monster truck 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.019
 it's completely at the waldhof no I 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.940
 would then say with the height of the bus 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.469
 frankly you're doing everything 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.620

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.480

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.860

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.120
 put a lot so big gg to you then 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.420
 this vehicle frankly there is nothing to 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.280
 say 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.380
 good after the counter i would say they 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.600
 have a little too quickly 80 km h to 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.850
 a little fast but honestly 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.910
 this vehicle it is really what the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 fuck 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.510
 he should even do that in life 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.430
 real big words his retirement like 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.750
 that but hey I think we see that in 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.790
 the street we fart a cable but a vehicle 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.400
 like that yeah frankly on gta 5 that 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.170
 could be cool hue clash 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.000
 thank for killing someone a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.470
 congratulations then you have to say opinions 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.540
 of this vehicle in the comments 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.830
 but frankly it's a vehicle 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.560
 frankly who is archi archi style and 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.790
 there is nothing else to say 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.640
 a bolt of the shot they went down 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.870
 super bass moss has made small 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 small openings but it's not too much 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.930
 serious 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.690
 there is even fire coming out of filing 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.310
 buff each speed that passes there 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.440
 has nothing to say two vehicles that's 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.090
 really great and it's a superb 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.510
 beautiful vehicle 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.860
 where there he goes to the water there no bah 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.810
 yes and that suspension it goes cream 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.470
 in the water look at me this is 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.360
 really what the fuck and do not see her 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.190
 normally with a normal bus we would have 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.489
 already sunk while there we are 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 with suspensions in the water and that that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.750
 really does not hurt I think we 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.540
 can shop like that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.400
 After seeing that on fashion history gta 5 pc 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.569
 but I think I buy gta5 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.860
 possible because frankly with the 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.470
 modes that we can do that can really 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.480
 to be stylish if you see this video I 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.660

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 really not bad I do not know what you 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.019

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.750
