00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
and sometimes you have to go from the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.920 
and sometimes you have to go from the
other<00:02:12.560> direction<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:14.480> do<00:02:14.540> come<00:02:14.780> off

other direction to that they do come off

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.660 
other direction to that they do come off
relatively<00:02:15.410> easily<00:02:15.680> because<00:02:16.250> they<00:02:16.580> are

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
relatively easily because they are

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.540 
relatively easily because they are
Hollow<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.690> then<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.980> make<00:02:19.130> sure<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
Hollow and then to make sure that it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.190 
Hollow and then to make sure that it
lays<00:02:19.730> flat<00:02:19.760> against<00:02:20.540> whatever<00:02:20.720> you're<00:02:21.050> going

lays flat against whatever you're going
to<00:02:21.320> attach<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.460> take<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.880> pair<00:02:23.840> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
to attach it to I just take a pair of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.130 
to attach it to I just take a pair of
chain<00:02:24.080> nose<00:02:24.140> pliers<00:02:24.530> close<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:25.460> up<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:27.080> just

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
chain nose pliers close them up and just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.200 
chain nose pliers close them up and just
push<00:02:27.560> down<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.070> side<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.790> try<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.000> make

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
push down with the side to try to make

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.840 
push down with the side to try to make
sure<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.690> goes<00:02:29.990> flat<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:31.670> you're

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850
