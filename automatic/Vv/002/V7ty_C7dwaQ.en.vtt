flash<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:13.500> already<00:00:13.650> have<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.250> button<00:00:15.059> over

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
flash and I already have a button over

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.060 
flash and I already have a button over
here<00:00:15.570> i've<00:00:15.960> called<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.199> car<00:00:16.500> button<00:00:16.830> because

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
here i've called it car button because

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.820 
here i've called it car button because
of<00:00:17.190> its<00:00:17.310> shape<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:18.050> there's<00:00:19.050> nothing<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.619> my

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
of its shape and there's nothing on my

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.950 
of its shape and there's nothing on my
timeline<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.490> i'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.730> build<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.180> menu<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
timeline so i'm going to build a menu in

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.920 
timeline so i'm going to build a menu in
my<00:00:22.260> timeline<00:00:22.760> by<00:00:23.760> adding<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> car<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.930> kind

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
my timeline by adding the car and kind

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.339 
my timeline by adding the car and kind
of<00:00:28.050> organizing<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> maybe<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.140> some

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
of organizing it so maybe this is some

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.729 
of organizing it so maybe this is some
sort<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.969> animation<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.239> about

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
sort of animation all about

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.500 
sort of animation all about
transportation<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.160> solar<00:00:35.700> power<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
transportation or solar power or

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
transportation or solar power or
anything<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> nature<00:00:38.989> and<00:00:40.040> once<00:00:41.040> i<00:00:41.160> have

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
anything of that nature and once i have

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.450 
anything of that nature and once i have
these<00:00:41.460> three<00:00:41.730> objects<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.329> each<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
these three objects here each one is a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.569 
these three objects here each one is a
duplicate<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> how<00:00:47.309> flash

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
duplicate of this so how flash

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.220 
duplicate of this so how flash

side or perhaps go into your window and

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.330 
side or perhaps go into your window and
look<00:00:59.219> for<00:00:59.399> properties<00:00:59.640> right<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
look for properties right there in the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
look for properties right there in the
properties<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.210> indicates<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> an

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
properties it indicates that this is an

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.880 
properties it indicates that this is an
instance<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> car<00:01:05.610> button<00:01:06.260> each<00:01:07.260> button<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
instance of car button each button is a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
instance of car button each button is a
distinct<00:01:08.580> instance<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.930> why<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> has

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
distinct instance and that's why it has

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.080 
distinct instance and that's why it has
the<00:01:10.530> space<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:11.010> an<00:01:11.100> instance<00:01:11.460> name<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.000> I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the space for an instance name so I'm

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
the space for an instance name so I'm
going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.270> name<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.530> C<00:01:13.530> button<00:01:14.220> 1<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
going to name this C button 1 and I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
going to name this C button 1 and I
could<00:01:16.560> name<00:01:16.710> each<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.310> differently<00:01:17.820> C<00:01:18.360> button

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
could name each one differently C button

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
could name each one differently C button
2<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:21.110> C<00:01:22.110> button<00:01:22.380> 3<00:01:24.830> now<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.040> have<00:01:26.189> all

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
2 and C button 3 now that I have all

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.149 
2 and C button 3 now that I have all
three<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> those<00:01:27.049> it's<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.409> easy<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.860> add

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
three of those it's really easy to add

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
three of those it's really easy to add
code<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:30.770> activate<00:01:31.770> these<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> right<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
code to activate these so right now I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.380 
code to activate these so right now I
have<00:01:34.619> nowhere<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.280> jump<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.180> I'm

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
have nowhere for them to jump to so I'm

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.280 
have nowhere for them to jump to so I'm
going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.570> add<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:38.060> little<00:01:39.060> animation<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
going to add on a little animation here

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.780 
going to add on a little animation here
go<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> another<00:01:40.920> frame<00:01:42.079> let's<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.790> i'll

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
go on to another frame let's see i'll

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.620 
go on to another frame let's see i'll
add<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> new<00:01:45.180> layer<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.689> let<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.750> label<00:01:49.290> these

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
add a new layer and let me label these

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.819 
add a new layer and let me label these
buttons<00:01:53.149> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> label<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.840> actions

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
buttons going to label this one actions

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.620 
buttons going to label this one actions
with<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> capital<00:01:56.369> A<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:59.119> this<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.479> going

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
with a capital A and this one is going

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:09.229 
with a capital A and this one is going
to<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:03.290> maybe<00:02:04.290> step<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.250> some<00:02:05.549> video<00:02:08.239> so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to be maybe step one of some video so

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.960 
to be maybe step one of some video so
then<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.599> go<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.489> add<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.550> new

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
then I can go out here add a new

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.290 
then I can go out here add a new
keyframe

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
keyframe

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.510 
keyframe
put<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.050> my<00:02:14.230> drawing<00:02:14.560> whatever<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> happens<00:02:15.280> to

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
put in my drawing whatever it happens to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.780 
put in my drawing whatever it happens to
be<00:02:18.690> etc<00:02:19.690> etc<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.170> now<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:20.980> two<00:02:21.280> distinct

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
be etc etc so now I have two distinct

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.900 
be etc etc so now I have two distinct
frames<00:02:22.650> here's<00:02:23.650> how<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.860> coding<00:02:24.250> works<00:02:24.400> when

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
frames here's how the coding works when

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.830 
frames here's how the coding works when
i<00:02:24.970> click<00:02:25.210> on<00:02:25.560> actions<00:02:26.910> click<00:02:27.910> on<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.360> frame

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
i click on actions click on the frame

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.220 
i click on actions click on the frame
where<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.590> want<00:02:29.830> my<00:02:29.920> coding<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> be<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:32.020> in

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
where I want my coding to be and then in

frame too and so now that I have it in
frame<00:04:05.260> too<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:07.420> play<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:10.269> when<00:04:10.690> I<00:04:10.720> do

you've added an instance name to your

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.780 
you've added an instance name to your
button<00:04:24.310> and

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
button and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.540 
button and
set<00:04:25.970> up<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.270> keyframe<00:04:26.960> on<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.590> timeline<00:04:27.860> where

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
set up a keyframe on the timeline where

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.720 
set up a keyframe on the timeline where
you<00:04:28.700> want<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:28.940> action<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.630> occur<00:04:29.720> I<00:04:30.730> hope
