00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
at the 75 a 76 millimeter wheels overall

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.830 
at the 75 a 76 millimeter wheels overall
they're<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.320> nice<00:00:25.680> their<00:00:26.210> smooth<00:00:27.210> ride<00:00:27.630> on

they're very nice their smooth ride on
and<00:00:28.199> they're<00:00:28.920> pretty<00:00:29.699> drift<00:00:30.390> day<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.630> that's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and they're pretty drift day so that's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
and they're pretty drift day so that's
nice<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.369> typical<00:00:32.820> Evan<00:00:33.180> factor<00:00:33.660> formula<00:00:33.930> is

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
nice the typical Evan factor formula is

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
nice the typical Evan factor formula is
very<00:00:34.350> drifted<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.719> it's<00:00:36.719> nice<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:38.090> where

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
very drifted so it's nice to have where

you thanks to 75 a i got these wheels
for<00:00:57.660> grip<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.520> i<00:01:00.980> can<00:01:01.980> slide<00:01:02.989> just<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.199> easily

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
for grip but i can slide just as easily

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.830 
for grip but i can slide just as easily
i<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.129> slide<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.180> as<00:01:06.270> easily<00:01:06.420> kind

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

of<00:01:06.930> 86<00:01:07.350> antarians<00:01:08.060> so<00:01:09.060> there's<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.510> much<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> a

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
of 86 antarians so there's not much of a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.030 
of 86 antarians so there's not much of a
big<00:01:11.640> difference<00:01:12.030> between<00:01:12.689> getting<00:01:13.590> into<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
big difference between getting into the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.480 
big difference between getting into the
slide<00:01:15.619> these<00:01:16.619> wheels<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.369> for

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
slide these wheels are really good for

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.179 
slide these wheels are really good for
Sam<00:01:17.670> sighs<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> drift<00:01:18.750> them

Sam sighs if you want to drift them

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.440 
Sam sighs if you want to drift them
there<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.729> two-for-one<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> tease

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
there really is a two-for-one a tease

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.100 
there really is a two-for-one a tease
just<00:01:22.630> see<00:01:23.200> checks<00:01:24.719> it's<00:01:25.719> all<00:01:25.810> really<00:01:26.020> smooth

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
just see checks it's all really smooth

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.990 
just see checks it's all really smooth
compared<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.409> other<00:01:30.130> wheels<00:01:30.369> that<00:01:30.640> I<00:01:30.670> had<00:01:30.850> on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
compared to other wheels that I had on

compared to other wheels that I had on
their<00:01:31.149> setup<00:01:32.850> 86<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:33.969> Tyrians<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:36.189> slide<00:01:36.789> a

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
their setup 86 I Tyrians they slide a

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.850 
their setup 86 I Tyrians they slide a
little<00:01:38.320> bit<00:01:38.770> more<00:01:39.159> noise<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.439> their<00:01:41.740> little

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
little bit more noise and their little

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.789 
little bit more noise and their little
more<00:01:42.270> bouncing<00:01:43.270> on<00:01:43.360> your<00:01:43.479> slide<00:01:43.750> but<00:01:44.649> not

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
more bouncing on your slide but not

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.919 
more bouncing on your slide but not
necessarily<00:01:45.310> really<00:01:45.700> as<00:01:45.880> more<00:01:46.179> chattery<00:01:46.630> but

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
necessarily really as more chattery but

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.319 
necessarily really as more chattery but
just<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.530> little<00:01:47.770> more<00:01:49.409> bounce<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:51.329> kinda

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
just a little more bounce to it kinda

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.730 
just a little more bounce to it kinda
it's<00:01:53.229> not<00:01:53.469> a<00:01:53.500> smooth<00:01:54.009> as<00:01:54.189> for<00:01:54.520> example<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:56.500> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's not a smooth as for example like a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.510 
it's not a smooth as for example like a
a<00:01:56.770> cool<00:01:57.340> classics<00:01:57.819> which<00:01:58.569> just<00:01:59.490> slide<00:02:00.490> right

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
a cool classics which just slide right

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
along the pavement like this this is

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.499 
along the pavement like this this is
more<00:02:02.590> like<00:02:02.619> got<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.009> kind<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.280> like<00:02:03.399> that<00:02:06.509> look

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
more like got a kind of like that look

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.389 
more like got a kind of like that look
these<00:02:07.659> wheels<00:02:07.899> are<00:02:07.989> broken<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.590> they're

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
these wheels are broken in they're

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.650 
these wheels are broken in they're
definitely<00:02:11.310> lot<00:02:12.310> slide<00:02:12.940> your<00:02:12.970> then<00:02:13.420> out<00:02:13.630> of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
definitely lot slide your then out of

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.240 
definitely lot slide your then out of
the<00:02:13.810> box<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.260> when<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.739> box<00:02:15.010> and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the box so when they're out of box and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.809 
the box so when they're out of box and
they<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.549> this<00:02:16.590> glassy<00:02:17.590> shiny<00:02:18.099> coat<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.579> them

they have this glassy shiny coat on them

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.699 
they have this glassy shiny coat on them
they're<00:02:19.660> much<00:02:20.470> more<00:02:20.769> grippy<00:02:21.190> then<00:02:22.470> there<00:02:23.470> as<00:02:23.680> a

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
they're much more grippy then there as a

they're much more grippy then there as a
result<00:02:24.130> after<00:02:24.340> sliding<00:02:25.030> them<00:02:25.329> I'm<00:02:25.959> just

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
result after sliding them I'm just

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.930 
result after sliding them I'm just
riding<00:02:26.560> them<00:02:26.829> a<00:02:26.859> lot<00:02:27.069> so<00:02:27.459> if<00:02:27.549> you<00:02:27.670> want<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:27.850> get

riding them a lot so if you want to get

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.640 
riding them a lot so if you want to get
these<00:02:28.060> wheels<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.510> all-out<00:02:28.930> downhill<00:02:29.410> don't

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
these wheels for all-out downhill don't

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.970 
these wheels for all-out downhill don't
slide<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> lot<00:02:30.280> um<00:02:31.500> overall<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.769> wheels

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
slide a lot um overall the wheels

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.460 
slide a lot um overall the wheels
they're<00:02:33.760> good<00:02:33.940> for<00:02:34.120> sliding<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> as<00:02:35.230> far<00:02:35.410> as

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
they're good for sliding and as far as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.440 
they're good for sliding and as far as
downhill<00:02:36.040> they're<00:02:36.639> great<00:02:36.880> they're<00:02:37.090> not<00:02:37.269> going
