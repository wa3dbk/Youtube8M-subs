00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.480
 We are in telephone communication with 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.250
 a colleague of the Colombian press 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.530
 alejandro munévar to talk about 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.009
 party this afternoon how about alexander 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.780
 good afternoon hello nicholas I greet you from 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.740
 of Barranquilla here in Colombia with the 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.710
 temperature plus or minus 34 35 degrees and 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.779
 very good how are we facebook 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.580
 we will have to start this football party 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.970
 since it mentions the temperature for 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.289
 3 and 30 hours Peruvian time than what 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.270
 expected temperature 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.920
 37 are expected at 3:30 in the afternoon 36 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.820
 degrees in the metropolitan area what is 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 what is playing to support the team by 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 the heat of the people and the heat of 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.610
 the court because it releases a humidity is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.199
 amazing coffee an area like the same 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.210
 colombia selection what and what 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.010
 we know good time in colombia 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.710
 by the way, Alejandro, you know that 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.829
 the codes in football do then that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.800
 there are diplomatic gestures I think I do not 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.470
 because pekerman highlights the game very much 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.220
 Peruvian you in the press also 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.920
 They think the same thing really worries them 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.930
 the Peruvian action 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 It is worrying what happens with Peru 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.710
 because it's good but it comes from getting 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.570
 again in the tie comes from 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.270
 winning a very important match 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.610
 an incredible performance of pizarro and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.740
 paolo guerrero have good moments in 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.509
 your clubs and the worrying ones 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.090
 the fan like those of the Colombian 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.250
 common the one on foot is isolated know that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.990
 Racing to reach the world's 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.899
 journalists we worry because 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.729
 We know that Peru is getting involved and is 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.890
 a complicated rival for the direction 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.539
 Colombia for everything it means for 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.270
 the history of Peru through the history of 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.100
 guadalest because it comes with equipment that 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.929
 is not valid is a team that does not come out 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.060
 between life very easy and remember the 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.429
 last time in Lima Colombia, but here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 did not have to suffer enough then it's 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.360
 worrying what is good and if we go 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 further back in the tie for 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.750
 france 98 with goal of pereda we beat them 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.000
 that party and in 2002 it also seems 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.140
 with a goal for the World Cup 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.239
 2002 there have been I think good games 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.430
 football proposals 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.490
 It has been left a little localía not 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.770
 that sense 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.870
 yes sir what happens here is that 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.640
 we leave aside the local james more 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.250
 because as you well say in the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.930
 last two heats but came here 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 to make night you're something way to 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.610
 tertiary also so that it has also 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.790
 been pieces after the lawyer who gives you 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.650
 50 four years ago because it is one thing 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.570
 apart but they have made us that they are and the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.160
 Local and we were made to feel what 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.050
 maybe now people are 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.000
 engaged in the elections are 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.340
 committed to football created the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.840
 football is the useless flourish in the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.730
 half of the field which we were 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.590
 accustomed and are looking beyond 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.170
 which is a group in attack is obtained with 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.290
 fast a more competitive football some 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.700
 way the argentina will arrive therefore the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.940
 people are happy that's why you have to 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.370
 attack but it is worrying that the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.560
 Peruvian selection arrives with very good 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.390
 level and colombia then good comes from a 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.460
 tie with argentina that you very 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.740
 well you should have to be distributed 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.180
 lesson colombia tan total a great match 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.380
 from colombia good we are brothers 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.510
 happily and this is a party 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.430
 sport to go finalizing alejandro 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.990
 two questions in one have the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.630
 alignments 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.750
 already defining a bit the panorama 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.490
 painting us the court Alejandro 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.540
 so much Colombia loses with the losses that 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.879
 have 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.269
 but Colombia the casualties that will have 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.340
 will be easily replaced remember 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.319
 that the alignment of Colombia could be 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.609
 david ospina long road this arrive 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.049
 on the right side 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.290
 big carlos the defender of 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.730
 independent of holy faith in the center 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.129
 accompanying mario alberto yepes in the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.319
 left side and pablo gunman task and 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.870
 here is the mystery because you do not know 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.090
 go to palencia of the imposing one that militates 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.069
 in Brazilian football to go and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.359
 Aguilar square towers for the little 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.219
 what you want but that of the 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.060
 locality barranquillera in the have 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:10.970
 any recipe already and it serves you and if there 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.500
 a key help with what helped 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.569
 a sensitive low that leave her 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.549
 Rodriguez but an improvement at its best 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.109
 moment to me I had barely raising their 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.940
 short levels and in colombia still 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.829
 had not shown what the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.410
 his football what he had shown us 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.849
 in previous matches for Colombia 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.990
 with you but there are with your legs 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:36.800
 rodríguez juan guillermo square 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.990
 aldo leao ramírez who is exculpated 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.760
 for people yellow cards will be 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.070
 easily replaced by magnetite 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.980
 has the Peruvian lineup also 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.790
 farfán finally you believe at this time 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.820
 it will be low 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.129
 sir the Peruvian lineup you have it 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.259
 Over there 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.969
 the alignment person yes sir be a 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.619
 by raúl fernández canal I get the one from 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.769
 herrera carlos zambrano alberto 

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:05.069
 rodríguez yoshimar yotún 

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:07.589
 Vargas Alvaro broad that selection 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.499
 Claudio Pizarro and Paolo Guerrero 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:12.659
 is not that is not yet known why 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.909
 talks a lot this week that could 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.519
 jump to pizarro one of the two 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.749
 is not fully confirmed one by one 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.639
 resentment he had in the party 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:25.050
 earlier and that's what the press says 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.990
 they manage in a certain way if players 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.949
 they handle the garment in a certain way 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.949
 practically chiva 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:42.449
 but that certainly is a big shock 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.949
 of strategists would not mark on the one hand and 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:47.060
 pekerman on the other 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:50.530
 Alejandro thank you very much 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.530
 nicholas to you thank you very much
