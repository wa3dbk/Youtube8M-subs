00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:16.009
 fear is not the same 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 fast or not infected maybe 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 be our least concern in the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.519
 game but the fight for survival would be 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 even more lonely without them 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.260
 In this video we will see the stages of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.160
 infections that challenge humans must 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160
 you saved there 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.280
 we started talking about the dreaded corridors 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.280
 the initial stage of code sep 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 the transformation starts in a few days 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.700
 after infection most of the time 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.219
 appear to be weak and still human 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.219
 nasal and ocular bleeding 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.329
 is possible in your red eyes with 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.040
 are alert and as the name says 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.040
 competes aggressively towards you 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.990
 the pursuers have frog speed 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.700
 sound and the ferocity of installers 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.310
 most notable physical features are the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.240
 fungus growth is only one side of the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.969
 head 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 preserving a single eye that can 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.569
 being your victim in the distance 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:44.479
 it is believed that they stay like this for a few days 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.479
 or up to one year after being infected 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.819
 with double the strength of one year 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.739
 installers are deadly and true 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.289
 codes apps hosts 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.079
 they have extinct pointed and 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.569
 high intelligence despite not 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:11.280
 they see guelssi by the noise and 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:13.799
 produce sounds to install them the worm or 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.500
 Pufferfish is the final fourth stage of 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.590
 large and dangerous infections they 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.900
 take up to 15 years to develop 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.420
 becoming the rarest of those infected 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.730
 with the body covered by the fire that serves 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.609
 as a kind of armor he is 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.280
 bulletproof but its weak point is 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:36.709
 fire the molotovs flamethrower 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.709
 weaken leaves you uncontrolled 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.330
 although they are predictable and not slow 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.730
 to see their main attack is to play 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.250
 micro-toxins that explode by touching 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.980
 anything spreading wounding itself 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.650
 your target 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.870
 even after the death of an infected 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.510
 fungus continue to grow on plants in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.790
 around the body and may spread through the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.580
 area until it starts to emit spores 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.230
 infecting anyone who breathes it 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.590
 this is usually the case in 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.660
 closed and moist as sewage basements 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.060
 and basements 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.520
 if you liked share on your networks 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.380
 social do not forget to let me like it 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.210
 enroll in the channel if you still 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.210
 They have not done so soon 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.209
