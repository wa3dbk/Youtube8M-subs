00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.790
 of comfort who does not like and comfort in our tumultuous traffic means 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.700
 have an automatic or automated gearbox 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.530
 one of the most recent releases in this area that has gone through a lot of force 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.720
 when the ball stops 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.520
 'everyone is late is what is success is success 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.860
 the success of this way our plans of the opposition on the Flemish 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.750
 cheaper than the automatic weight change 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.109
 until it becomes a fluvial port of s 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.529
 It's the same as the daughter. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.340
 What is called love? 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.560
 is a 5-speed manual gearbox with clutch that has a module 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.760
 which automatically switches automatically 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.429
 the best of you in the field 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:45.659
 is that in auto brigade mode it saves fuel 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.640
 when compared to conventional what do the doors at the correct time 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.040
 did not interfere in performance because they did not steal happened 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.840
 but we are quiet during the changes as 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.760
 the bridge that will facilitate this feature with more 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.210
 short of the second 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.650
 3rd and 4th gears 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.460
 improved 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.850
 more sporty 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.540
 well diminish when using the sport option in which casualties are stretched 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.210
 and exchanges made faster 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.680
 on consumption 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.720
 or manual option 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 what can be done is a laundry meter behind the wheel 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.880
 as the set made only eight pounds more than the conventional 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.330
 the performance is practically the same as the paul octopus 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.950
 there is only a small loss but accelerations and resumption on account of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.270
 ease of system action 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 in consumption 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.609
 it's very difficult 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.430
 in our defense segment 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.790
 it's true hometown of roads 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.910
 arrived at good averages of seven point two kilometers per liter of alcohol 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
 in February three kilometers from the center of brasilia 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.219
 another characteristic unchanged is the more comfortable behavior 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 makes curves very well thanks to a suspension of 10 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
 but it penalizes a little comfort as of this internal space and provoked much 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.289
 noise 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.079
 Overall finish and correct grips help lessen the problem 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:22.009
 in the safety issue so as not to lose the custom in the middle of the back seat was 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 with three-point belt support 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.999
 with evolution is worth it or not 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.459
 for those who have two thousand and five hundred reais more at the time of 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.559
 buy the point 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:36.149
 and does not care about the breaststroke course during the gear shifts 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:37.979
 it's a good 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.090
 finally the automated exchange 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.210
 besides comfort and economy 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.210
 It was a pleasure to drive the car 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.519
 and we see on the attack alone the first bar show of the car 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.879

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.209
