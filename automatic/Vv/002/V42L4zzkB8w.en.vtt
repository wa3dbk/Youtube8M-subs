design which I'll get into there in a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.180 
design which I'll get into there in a
second<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:21.330> particular<00:02:21.600> model<00:02:21.990> from<00:02:22.769> bokor

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
second this particular model from bokor

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.320 
second this particular model from bokor
is<00:02:23.909> individually<00:02:24.780> serialized<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.940> each<00:02:27.060> knife

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
is individually serialized so each knife

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.890 
is individually serialized so each knife
has<00:02:27.599> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
has a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.830 
has a
Vigil<00:02:28.200> serial<00:02:28.560> number<00:02:28.879> and<00:02:29.879> if<00:02:30.329> you<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.569> see

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
Vigil serial number and if you can see

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.009 
Vigil serial number and if you can see
here<00:02:31.909> I'm<00:02:32.909> going<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.329> get<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.540> or<00:02:33.689> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.870> see

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
here I'm going to get it or you can see

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.940 
here I'm going to get it or you can see
it<00:02:34.189> this<00:02:35.189> is<00:02:35.250> knife<00:02:35.549> number<00:02:35.970> three<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.019> there

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
it this is knife number three and there

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
it this is knife number three and there
are<00:02:38.010> three<00:02:38.220> digits<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> serial<00:02:39.269> number<00:02:39.720> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
are three digits in the serial number so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.259 
are three digits in the serial number so
I<00:02:39.930> assume<00:02:40.200> they're<00:02:40.409> gonna<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:41.030> less<00:02:42.030> than<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
I assume they're gonna be less than a

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.319 
I assume they're gonna be less than a
thousand<00:02:42.720> knives<00:02:42.900> made

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
I've had a hard time getting these like

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.660 
I've had a hard time getting these like
I<00:02:46.920> said<00:02:47.720> um<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.870> got<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.049> few<00:02:49.290> up<00:02:49.439> men<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.890> this
