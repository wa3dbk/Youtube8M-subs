why people are working so hard so the
big<00:00:52.230> reason<00:00:53.719> I've<00:00:54.719> said<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> my<00:00:55.199> books<00:00:55.559> for

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
big reason I've said in my books for

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
big reason I've said in my books for
years<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.309> savers<00:00:56.850> were<00:00:57.090> losers<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> very

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
years that savers were losers is very

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.479 
years that savers were losers is very

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
simply because in 1971 the dollar stop

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
simply because in 1971 the dollar stop
being<00:01:02.850> money<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.329> became<00:01:03.719> debt<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.860> Mike

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
thousand years this has been the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.699 
thousand years this has been the
predominant<00:02:21.300> currency<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.050> became<00:02:22.410> money

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
predominant currency it became money

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.039 
predominant currency it became money
when<00:02:22.920> somebody<00:02:23.310> mended<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.790> into<00:02:24.330> coins<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
when somebody mended it into coins and

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.660 
when somebody mended it into coins and
Lydia<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.440> about<00:02:25.830> 680<00:02:26.370> BC<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.769> each<00:02:28.769> unit<00:02:29.459> had

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the same buying power as the next one

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.140 
the same buying power as the next one
they<00:02:31.590> became<00:02:31.890> interchangeable<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.940> let<00:02:33.060> me

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
they became interchangeable so let me

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.020 
they became interchangeable so let me
ask<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.620> printing<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> money<00:02:35.819> out

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
ask you this this printing of money out

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.699 
ask you this this printing of money out
of<00:02:36.060> just<00:02:36.330> paper<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.989> has<00:02:37.140> been<00:02:37.290> tried<00:02:37.500> before

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
of just paper this has been tried before

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.289 
of just paper this has been tried before
isn't<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.840> many<00:02:39.840> many<00:02:40.560> many<00:02:41.549> times<00:02:41.670> and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
isn't it many many many times and

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.440 
isn't it many many many times and
there's<00:02:42.780> always<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.260> result<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.880> get<00:02:45.030> far

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
there's always one result you get far

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.650 
there's always one result you get far
far<00:02:45.720> higher<00:02:46.250> prices<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.430> everything<00:02:48.150> but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
far higher prices of everything but

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.330 
far higher prices of everything but
especially<00:02:48.720> real<00:02:49.470> money<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.070> start

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
especially real money when they start

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
especially real money when they start
creating<00:02:50.609> a<00:02:50.910> whole<00:02:51.180> lot<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.480> currency

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
creating a whole lot of currency

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.380 
creating a whole lot of currency
eventually<00:02:52.709> gold<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.459> silver<00:02:53.760> lie<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.150> wait

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
eventually gold and silver lie in wait

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.569 
eventually gold and silver lie in wait
and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:55.440> when<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> public<00:02:56.010> senses<00:02:56.430> this

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
and then when the public senses this

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.660 
and then when the public senses this

cup of coffee no in fact they have

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.789 
cup of coffee no in fact they have
ruined<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.019> by<00:03:52.140> putting<00:03:52.349> ink<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:53.069> can't

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
ruined it by putting ink on you can't

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.949 
ruined it by putting ink on you can't
you<00:03:55.799> can't<00:03:56.040> write<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> list<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:57.030> there<00:03:57.269> it<00:03:57.629> would

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
you can't write a list so there it would

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.479 
you can't write a list so there it would
have<00:03:57.989> been<00:03:58.079> more<00:03:58.379> valuable<00:03:58.560> at<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.129> point<00:03:59.400> if

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
have been more valuable at this point if

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.030 
have been more valuable at this point if
it<00:03:59.610> was<00:03:59.730> black<00:03:59.940> right<00:04:00.180> did<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.170> Greeks<00:04:01.650> did

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
it was black right did the Greeks did

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.080 
it was black right did the Greeks did
the<00:04:02.190> same<00:04:02.370> thing<00:04:02.610> when<00:04:02.730> they<00:04:02.760> started

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
the same thing when they started

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.850 
the same thing when they started
flipping<00:04:03.480> coins<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.200> take<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.530> silver

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
flipping coins you just take the silver

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.949 
flipping coins you just take the silver
off<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.760> Romans<00:04:06.209> tried<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
off of it the Romans tried it the

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.930 
off of it the Romans tried it the
English<00:04:07.409> tried<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.069> Germans<00:04:08.519> tried<00:04:08.760> it

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
English tried it the Germans tried it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.390 
English tried it the Germans tried it
the<00:04:09.120> Chinese<00:04:09.360> try<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.170> now<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.769> u.s.<00:04:11.190> is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the Chinese try it and now the u.s. is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.420 
the Chinese try it and now the u.s. is
trying<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.810> that's<00:04:13.049> why<00:04:13.290> saving<00:04:13.920> money<00:04:14.099> is

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
trying and so that's why saving money is

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.949 
trying and so that's why saving money is
probably<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.970> biggest<00:04:15.209> mistake<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.840> could

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
probably the biggest mistake you could

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.560 
probably the biggest mistake you could
