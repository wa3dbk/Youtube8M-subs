00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 there 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.200
 it is a very sensitive part to me it touches me 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.530
 a lot because mostly I live among people 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.530
 very poor 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.930
 us what we are doing 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.930
 it's just that the sexes people 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.469
 Solidarity was sensitized a little 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.990
 more and they do not see things just like 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.960

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.310
 next victim but this should not see 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:40.409
 the things that happen around you with 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.729
 indifference because the day it's your turn 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:47.039

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.469

 its valley bottom to where the people of 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:03.430
 oil there we see it we wait for it 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.020
 nice because you're worried 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:10.150
 worrying about the people more 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:13.260
 needed and that's a good job 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.260
 you know that to me 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.790
 it affects me a lot that I can 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.190
 for the people of my town 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.700
 a very poor area 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.440
 and we 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.860
 what we want is to work for them 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.870
 devote time and effort to improve 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.540
 their living conditions because it is not 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:43.420
 possible the state as your assistance to 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:48.070
 rhythm is good and it's bad 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:50.530
 but I think we should get our 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.340
 people are self-sufficient that they are 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.449
 able to produce their things create 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:02.039
 cooperatives so that I 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:04.319
 the spirit of teamwork is 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.839
 develop and not depend so much on 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:09.629
 the gifts that the government has left because 

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:12.479
 If so, we will have partnerships 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:13.920
 parasitic throughout life and that has 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.900
 what to change 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.580
 I agree with you, well, because 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.320
 they listened to oil paintings if they want 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.720
