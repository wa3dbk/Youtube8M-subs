in<00:01:35.030> 3-way<00:01:36.030> SLI<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> need<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.530> old<00:01:37.710> 311

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in 3-way SLI so you need the old 311

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.980 
in 3-way SLI so you need the old 311
buyers<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.210> from<00:01:39.240> customer

service<00:01:40.350> Taiwan<00:01:40.800> and<00:01:42.530> there's<00:01:43.530> another<00:01:43.740> big

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
service Taiwan and there's another big

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.960 
service Taiwan and there's another big
problem<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> 02<00:01:45.390> 08<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.700> vcore<00:01:47.700> would

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
problem with the 02 08 the vcore would

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
problem with the 02 08 the vcore would
not<00:01:48.150> operate<00:01:48.360> correctly<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.800> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.100> put<00:01:50.280> 1

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
not operate correctly so if you put 1

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.520 
not operate correctly so if you put 1
volt<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.270> would<00:01:51.479> give<00:01:51.710> 1.2<00:01:52.710> volts<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
volt it would give 1.2 volts so be very

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.460 
volt it would give 1.2 volts so be very
careful<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.220> that<00:01:56.250> especially<00:01:56.940> on<00:01:57.420> air

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.650 

coming<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> N<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.399> 200<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.360> clearly

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
coming to the N for 200 I can clearly

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.700 
coming to the N for 200 I can clearly
see<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> difference<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:06.720> benefit<00:02:07.200> increase

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
see a difference in the benefit increase

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.029 
see a difference in the benefit increase
especially<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.970> crisis<00:02:09.569> 64<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> Crysis

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
enthusiast the stuttering is gone so it

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.540 
enthusiast the stuttering is gone so it
can<00:02:19.620> now<00:02:19.830> operate<00:02:22.100> now<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.220> looks<00:02:23.400> like

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
can now operate now it looks like

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.490 
can now operate now it looks like
another<00:02:24.030> bottle<00:02:24.480> neck<00:02:24.630> comes<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.200> little

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
another bottle neck comes with a little

another bottle neck comes with a little
bitches<00:02:25.860> ram<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> put<00:02:27.900> really<00:02:28.530> plead<00:02:28.800> be

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
bitches ram so I put really plead be

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.170 
bitches ram so I put really plead be
playable<00:02:30.380> but<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.590> would<00:02:31.740> run<00:02:31.950> out<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.280> ram<00:02:32.730> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
playable but it would run out of ram so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.320 
playable but it would run out of ram so
the<00:02:34.140> Raptor<00:02:34.890> would<00:02:35.360> start<00:02:36.360> acting<00:02:38.330> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
the Raptor would start acting the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.930 
the Raptor would start acting the
biggest<00:02:39.690> difference<00:02:39.900> i<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.500> see<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:41.069> crisis

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
biggest difference i can see in crisis

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.780

very<00:02:47.790> high<00:02:48.060> system<00:02:48.510> requirements<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.709> can

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
very high system requirements now I can

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.760 
very high system requirements now I can
put<00:02:50.160> everything<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:51.450> very<00:02:51.690> high<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.560> wasn't
