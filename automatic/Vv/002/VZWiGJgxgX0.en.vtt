00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.280
 Hello my name is Constantin Genich 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.559
 we continue our video blog in the video 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
 forecasts on the site of fish bookmakers with us 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.789
 Champions League 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 second matches and two games 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.939
 I decided to throw it for a video review 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.980
 meeting in london at stamford bridge and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 Chelsea will play with Galatasaray first 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.660
 the game as we remember made another 11 chelsea 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 lost in the last round stopped and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.180
 a little bit complicated the task of fighting 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 for championship championship well pavel it 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 one story Champions League at all 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.129
 another galatasaray turn is trying 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.800
 catch up 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 fenerbahÃ§e self championship final round 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.000
 played away 00 but how 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.120
 already noted the statement after all the corner of the king 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.489
 was a day more to prepare for 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
 the return match in London seems to me 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.949
 here is a clear favorite of course 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.180
 is a chelsea and for a bad game should 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 sure to follow good how 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.530
 said one of the brothers of old age 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 so it seems to me that the game is not 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.450
 get over productive over 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.590
 eventful so modest 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.560
 pragmatic and rational as he loves 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 floss in such key matches victory 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 Chelsea seems to me quite probable so 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.600
 what we forecast for this meeting is a victory 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 chelsea through down that match will be 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.140
 less than 200 goals scored and Chelsea win 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 10 or 20 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.119
 I think that is quite real with a very 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.780
 good odds 3 and 2 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.850
 another game in england will take place on the floor 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 herbs for distressed manchester united 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.500
 which burns absolutely everything 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 lost liverpool 03 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.170
 Well, the coil line does not say that there 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 loose chair or already cracking 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 this dice but generally cracks in the side chair 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.240
 in the rain oh I myself probably if also 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.810
 about play in the Olympiaks Champions League 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.020
 then a suitcase station back liverpool for 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.430
 David Moyas Olympiacos is very strong 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.830
 fighting team but 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.780
 after all this united united plays u 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.550
 yourself at home 02 after the first match 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.800
 handicap to win 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.960
 I'm not quite sure that this handicap 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 United plays but what manchester 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.780
 will win this meeting with me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.550
 virtually no doubt on 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.250
 I would suggest that you try 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.550
 consider Manchester option your minus 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.350
 1 and minus 1 is an expense for example on the site 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.570
 betting match and there is such a proposal with 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.640
 a good coefficient of 173 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.530
 Soon -1 Manchester United against 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.420
 Olympiacos coefficient 173
