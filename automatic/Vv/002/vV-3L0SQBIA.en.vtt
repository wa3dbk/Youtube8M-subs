ever seen yeah I was trying to room my
water<00:00:11.400> that's<00:00:11.759> because<00:00:12.090> there's<00:00:12.300> an<00:00:12.450> idea<00:00:13.019> out

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
water that's because there's an idea out

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.680 
water that's because there's an idea out
there<00:00:13.349> that<00:00:13.769> our<00:00:13.799> actual<00:00:14.549> thoughts<00:00:14.690> projected

experiments on the cellular structure of
water<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.580> became<00:00:26.849> widely<00:00:27.090> known<00:00:27.269> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
water and this became widely known in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.620 
water and this became widely known in
the<00:00:27.990> film<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.189> bleep<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.390> in

then he throws the petri dishes and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.229 
then he throws the petri dishes and
looked<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.890> them<00:00:41.040> under<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.399> microscope<00:00:41.790> he

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
looked at them under a microscope he

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.910 
looked at them under a microscope he
reported<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> ice<00:00:43.230> crystals<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.710> had

reported that the ice crystals that had

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100 
reported that the ice crystals that had

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a bunch of positive thoughts were much

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
a bunch of positive thoughts were much
more<00:00:46.350> aesthetically<00:00:46.950> pleasing<00:00:47.070> and
