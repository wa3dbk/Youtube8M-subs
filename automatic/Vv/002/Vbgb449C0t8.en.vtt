00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello guys today we have the second 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.620
 part of the body from the horse of the animals and on this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.380
 lesson we'll talk about muscle 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.380
 and nervous tissue let's start with muscle tissue 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.789
 what is the function of muscle tissue 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 reduction 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.110
 thanks to muscular shrink walls 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.310
 esophagus intestinal stomach and also our 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:52.960
 heart 2 function is motor 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:55.180
 function it is that to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 muscles are attached to our bones thanks to 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.910
 which is the movement 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.910
 muscle tissue features 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:20.440
 muscle tissue consists of three 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.440
 varieties is smooth muscle 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:32.020
 it consists of cells which are called 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 myocytes 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.190
 myocytes 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.969
 the second species is 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.969
 striated muscle tissue 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:13.560
 she is also called the devil on and she 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:21.459
 consists of muscle fibers 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 fibers we can not control 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:29.190
 it lines the walls of the vessels of the esophagus 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.360
 stomach hollow organs 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.580
 striated musculature and and we 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.520
 can still be called skeletal is that 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.090
 musculature that attaches to our 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.480
 bones 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.150
 another type of muscle tissue 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.260
 are heart muscles she 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:53.950
 is intermediate between smooth and 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:56.410
 striated cardio her 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.069
 feature is heart automatics 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.610
 able to shrink without such some 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.700
 the action of external factors is also between 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.190
 cardiac musk muscle cells 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.150
 are nexus inserts and 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.950
 these are such records that accelerate 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.930
 transmission of nerve impulses therefore 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.860
 nerve impulse goes faster through the heart 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.860
 muscle tissue properties 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.760
 muscle tissue 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.760
 two properties are abbreviations and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.310
 excitation 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.469
 that is, there is no muscle tissue is capable 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.379
 be excited for example like cardio and 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.870
 also the ability to shrink in response to 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.750
 nerve impulse where is 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.359
 muscle tissue muscle tissue we can 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.489
 meet in hollow organs such as 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.599
 esophagus 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.709
 blood vessels lymphatic vessels 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.400
 striated and flight risk 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.469
 muscle tissue we will meet in 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.799
 the locomotor system is attached 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.590
 to the bones and heart we will meet of course 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.120
 same in the heart of the following horse which we 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:31.229
 Today we will consider 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:42.840
 will nerve tissue functions nervous 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:45.449
 tissues are homeostasis homeostasis is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:52.110
 maintaining consistency of the internal environment 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:56.090
 organism and organ regulation 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.090
 and organ systems of the body 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.039
 organs and systems 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.930
 features of nervous tissue 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.060
 no natka consists of neurons and 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 neuroglia 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.620
 that is, the intercellular substance nerve 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.090
 tissue fluid is inserted one a 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.390
 you can't see cells 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:57.620
 milans and neuroglia form together 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:06:00.410
 nerve tissue property of nerve tissue 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.920
 properties of the nervous tissue is 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.920
 excitability and conductivity 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.760
 and conductivity 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.140
 so let us draw this neuron with you 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:34.240
 structural and functional unit 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:39.540
 the nervous tissue of the world consists of the body in 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.540
 body are the nucleus and organelles and 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:56.620
 mind neurons have long processes they 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:59.610
 are called axons generally axon dressed 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.610
 myelin sheath 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.370
 she is white and thanks to that 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.970
 all are formed and substance and white 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.470
 brain matter gray matter brain 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:20.759
 formed by bodies 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.680
 neurons and white matter is formed 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:26.590
 shoots 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.960
 also in neurons have short spines 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.960
 they are called dendrites 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.480
 dendrite 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.620
 so guys today we talked to you 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.139
 about muscle and nerve tissue 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.169
 it was the second part of the duck theme 

00:07:55.139 --> 00:08:00.570
 animals the next in the third part we 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:03.330
 let's talk about connective tissue 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.800
 she put everything up for me today 

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.800
 thank you for your attention
