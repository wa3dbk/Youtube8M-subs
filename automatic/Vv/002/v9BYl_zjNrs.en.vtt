 face of the eyes I do not have my game with 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.570
 the price mix slice and is worrying 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.250
 it's just that since there is a 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.260
 proposed after there may be others 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 features we do not know in 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.570
 anyway that's what will we fall it 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.220
 five minutes ago I'm doing a little 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.500
 video to explain that to you because 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 my bitch is still 100% that leaves 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 I still have to announce you 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.729
 a little bit of these things for 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.570
 warn the most people so 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.909
 know that the price range 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 will arrive right after maintenance so 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.220
 which is currently going on which has 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 started I can not tell you too much I 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.549
 believe it started at 7 pm and the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.500
 stopped 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.850
 ouch it'll be up to everything until 21h so 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 I think the video will come out 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.110
 by the way until around 9 pm like that 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.150
 will allow people who will discover this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.170
 name who will not have followed too much they will 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.770
 launch their game we see the pitchfork and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.900
 boom prices 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.729
 it happens on youtube which are for my 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 subscribers bout saw me obbadi musicians 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.030
 he'll explain it to us that's nickel 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.479
 in short I do not know more than you except 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 we can already tickle by pulling more 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.680
 early excuse me conclusions ah yes 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.450
 you 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.650
 did not doubt that there is on a slice of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.850
 price like that it would be totally 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.650
 finally stupid finally true basically there are some 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.780
 goals there are goals behind this 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.060
 price range is I think the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.900
 first goal is to block 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.120
 credit sites pretty like that it's 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.110
 like that guys I'll make you a 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 comment of what I think I 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.550
 do not say anything in the case I attend I 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.040
 think I'll do a video later 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.190
 or I will explain my feelings more 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.290
 all that is and explain a 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.760
 little bit a little bit behind the scenes 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.980
 excess late over see what I want 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.420
 to say in short I think it's a good 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.940
 thing when as a bad thing 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.800
 must know that this loot for 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.030
 rand is fair enough the game for 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.830
 know who has who have millions and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.630
 millions on their account and you 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.020
 you often find yourself with 100,000 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.190
 some subscribers see some 50000 credit 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.620
 and I understand that it can be 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.150
 frustrating because you can not do it 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.030
 and well this price range has for 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.380
 aims to make fair for all 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.269
 the world actually makes it simply 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 it's either you have to be lucky in 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.630
 the packs must win matches 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.400
 have to play to play toys 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.489
 clearly I only see it like that for 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.780
 the moment I do not have I do not have I 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.160
 do not have as I tell you allah knows 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.989
 not fallen yet I 'm not going under them 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.340
 eyes but do I think that I 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.680
 see on twitter and on networks 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.269
 social it's just like that and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.150
 that so we can do these 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.640
 ads well on the announced end of the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.170
 credit sites but there may be 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.810
 that's why I'm a little bit 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.430
 in the in the future we do not know what 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.110
 that can happen we do not know if 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.430
 maybe he'll retract we do not 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.920
 do not know what's going to happen guys 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.150
 it is in any case announced it will be 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.530
 produce there may be loopholes and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.030
 all this but in any case do not seek 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.790
 not the flaws for now let's talk 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.470
 simply clearly the fork 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.720
 prices are entering the market for 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.950
 drum transfers from 15 short I do not see 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.840
 not too much I can say 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.660
 besides game for those who have had 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.210
 little worries about game controls 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.620
 I'm aware do not worry 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.690
 I try to talk to my partner 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.850
 besides played I think talking to my 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.040
 partner to find out what they are going 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.670
 do after 7 after this range of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.590
 price that arrives 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.010
 what will happen on their side 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.760
 just so the gains it was 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.890
 to warn you 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.150
 I do not have good on the price bracket 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.590
 of all the players I told you I 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.170
 that of azhar under the eyes the skin 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.910
 to enlighten me a little bit I saw that 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.250
 that of messi would turn between 5 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.250
 million and 7 million I believe finally 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.110
 in short, all the same for purpose also 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.210
 we will not hide stabilize the 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.410
 market it aims to stabilize the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.270
 market and I think it's not no 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.070
 plus one so bad thing because he 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.440
 did that tumble that rise again 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.030
 it will stabilize it we will see a market 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.530
 a little quieter certainly there will be 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.690
 fluctuations 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.710
 it's obligatory but they will be a lot 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.200
 less high yes what I mean 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.610
 after i actually wait for it all the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.900
 thing that scares me the most 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.790
 this price range frankly 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.070
 clearly it's not the credit sites 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.420
 frankly personally it passes me 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.070
 under the nose clearly I say 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.320
 clearly net it goes under my nose 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.420
 I do not care the only thing that makes me 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.130
 shit clermont I tell you the word it's 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.590
 that I'm afraid that the purchase resale for 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.919
 that there for that to excuse me the purchase 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.440
 resale it stinks i'm that in the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.580
 factual I can not say I'm not going 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.440
 not under the eyes again but 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.030
 it stinks I will do as I have you 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.850
 says at the beginning of the video a video 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.470
 after which we will have attended for a 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.700
 week a little bit of all that I'm going 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.110
 besides enjoy it I think during 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.690
 this week to make a lot of buying 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.590
 resale communicate with people who 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.530
 do the charming I tried to 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.610
 talk to a cigarette i on twitter fit 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.050
 United States our legs I would like 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.740
 talk to them to know a little bit 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.960
 also felt 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.070
 finally short so here's the friends it's going 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.250
 bring a lot of novelties 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.280
 we'll see how it's going to be 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.460
 take it as good or as bad 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.690
 for now I'm not going to decide 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.910
 I have my personal opinion for now 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.680
 I made you a little bit but 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.880
 I announce to you that in another 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.250
 video I think had compared the rap 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.940
 I may try to talk to 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.590
 other people 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.640
 it can be quite interesting to 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.560
 communicate with others who 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.850
 may have 10 points of view 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.790
 different opinions 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.050
 so just play this little 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.520
 video did this like my phone 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.470
 no longer has battery so I got 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.030
 well finished short, I still have to 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.560
 hurry that I hurry up so that 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.120

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.730
 limit that I hope you go 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.380
 to be able to see it before the update 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.730
 that the end that the match ends as 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.910
 that you will be aware 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.490
 just before it comes back that the 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.440
 return servers finds themselves at 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.690
 the normal brief simply that the 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.760
 servers it that the roles that the 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.010
 waiters and opens to me I got there
