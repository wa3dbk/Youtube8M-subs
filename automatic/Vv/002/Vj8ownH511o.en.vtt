okay<00:00:00.240> here's<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.690> steps<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.170> set

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
okay here's the steps to set

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.710 
okay here's the steps to set
discrimination<00:00:02.149> take<00:00:03.149> your<00:00:03.330> little<00:00:03.480> out<00:00:03.689> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
discrimination take your little out to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.289 
discrimination take your little out to
its<00:00:03.990> ten<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.380> you've<00:00:04.529> washed<00:00:04.879> put<00:00:05.879> it<00:00:05.970> at<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
its ten that you've washed put it at the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.820 
its ten that you've washed put it at the
inside<00:00:06.830> and<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:07.980> your<00:00:08.099> puppy<00:00:12.650> normally<00:00:13.650> you

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
inside and with your puppy normally you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.320 
inside and with your puppy normally you
would<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.009> put<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.400> dog<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.910> sniffing<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
would just put the dog for sniffing the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.000 
would just put the dog for sniffing the
tin<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:16.109> she's<00:00:16.289> further<00:00:16.560> along<00:00:16.830> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
tin but because she's further along I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
tin but because she's further along I
don't<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.340> want<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.520> go<00:00:17.640> backwards<00:00:18.050> so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
don't really want to go backwards so

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
don't really want to go backwards so
let's<00:00:19.710> just<00:00:19.890> pretend<00:00:20.039> like<00:00:20.279> we've<00:00:20.520> done<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
let's just pretend like we've done that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
let's just pretend like we've done that
now<00:00:23.539> good<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.779> idea<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> get<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> dog<00:00:25.590> sent<00:00:25.859> me

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
now good the idea to get the dog sent me

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500 
now good the idea to get the dog sent me
the<00:00:26.039> tin<00:00:26.250> she's<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.029> she<00:00:27.150> knows<00:00:27.330> there's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the tin she's not that she knows there's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.689 
the tin she's not that she knows there's
only<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.619> now<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.949> away<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.369> want<00:00:29.609> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
only one so now right away you want to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:46.180 
only one so now right away you want to
add<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:30.090> tips<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.750> keep<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.679> tip<00:00:41.629> alright

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.619 

again<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.579> doesn't<00:00:47.760> matter<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.239> she<00:00:48.360> picks<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
again it doesn't matter if she picks it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
again it doesn't matter if she picks it
up<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.079> dog<00:00:49.260> does<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
up at this dog does so I'm not going to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
up at this dog does so I'm not going to
go<00:00:50.430> backwards<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> if<00:00:52.350> everyone<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> tin

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
go backwards but if everyone in the tin

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
go backwards but if everyone in the tin
feed<00:00:53.579> her<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:53.879> out<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> tin<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.750> let

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
feed her right out of the tin and let

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.620 
feed her right out of the tin and let
her<00:00:54.960> go

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.590 

yeah<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:05.190> dog<00:01:05.340> can<00:01:05.520> do<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.120> can<00:01:06.360> either

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
yeah the dog can do that you can either

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
yeah the dog can do that you can either
go<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.440> more<00:01:07.680> tens<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.370> 10<00:01:09.290> with<00:01:10.290> food<00:01:10.620> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
go up to more tens like 10 with food or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.380 
go up to more tens like 10 with food or
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.520> empty<00:01:13.850> good<00:01:14.850> when

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you can just put it on empty good when

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.000 
you can just put it on empty good when
you<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.080> probably<00:01:16.320> helps<00:01:16.620> to<00:01:16.740> throw

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
you do that it probably helps to throw

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.560 
you do that it probably helps to throw
the<00:01:17.160> food<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.760> a<00:01:17.820> chance<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> move<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the food so you have a chance to move it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:28.450 
the food so you have a chance to move it
she<00:01:19.530> comes<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:39.999 

get<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.290> here

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.169 

think<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> wrong<00:01:41.399> line<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.609> just<00:01:41.850> ignore

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
think that the wrong line I just ignore

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:43.419 
think that the wrong line I just ignore
it

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.740 
it
good<00:01:44.429> now<00:01:46.579> I'm<00:01:47.579> actually<00:01:47.729> gonna<00:01:48.000> switch<00:01:48.299> pins

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
good now I'm actually gonna switch pins

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.080 
good now I'm actually gonna switch pins
so<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.469> tin<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> not<00:01:50.039> had<00:01:50.310> any<00:01:50.549> doing<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
in discrimination now what I would do is

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.020 
in discrimination now what I would do is
this<00:02:43.880> point<00:02:44.270> this<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.930> where<00:02:45.080> she's<00:02:45.260> at<00:02:45.410> now<00:02:45.440> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
this point this is where she's at now I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.190 
this point this is where she's at now I
would<00:02:47.030> make<00:02:47.210> a<00:02:47.240> point<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.630> getting<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.990> lot<00:02:48.170> more

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
would make a point of getting a lot more

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.910 
would make a point of getting a lot more
tins<00:02:49.810> working<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.900> lot<00:02:51.080> more<00:02:51.290> shapes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
