00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello people are going to make a 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.840
 Here I go, I'll tell you something. 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
 how do you reconfigure the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.820
 your receiver 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.580
 We have received 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.680
 There are several questions on the page where we 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.330
 we make available frequencies and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.820
 parameters and configure your 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.740
 receiver and people have no doubts 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.930
 that the pope then Joseph does not make the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.140
 simple video last place I have here 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.840
 a telesystem receiver looks 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.269
 this common receiver and you have there and we 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.370
 let's reconfigure this receiver 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.379
 the next question is passing here ah 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.420
 ah ah ah motion was here is 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.760
 but it's the same as you have in 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.860
 Your house, you see here. This is the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.640
 remote control on your receiver 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.309
 You will hit the menu key it goes 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.870
 enter this screen and you can even 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.469
 proving the ball to her who will do 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.730
 You go in setup here had to 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:03.360
 start you give ok you gave here you 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.940
 opened on this screen where it has 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.490
 my antenna and tv manager 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.130
 it is precisely in this TV manager that 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.910
 you will find the parameters to be 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 operated 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.280
 You from here the selection ok I'll tighten the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.990
 ok from my remote 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.299
 He went on the page you see here. 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 O you have entered the settings will 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.939
 press ok once again here selection 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.710
 I pressed ok and entered this here is the 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:35.200
 old frequency 3676 5.900 polarization 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.310
 Horizontal popularity is what we 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.640
 we will modify and here below we have the - 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.729
 where you will do the reconfiguration of the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.580
 that we have stated - move the little set 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:52.150
 up and down control 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.230
 turn 7 to the sides and dictate 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.810
 setinha ok exit had menu add 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.140
 delete to pay everything start then we 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.680
 Let's re-edit this frequency. I press 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 Okay, he already opened here. I'll put the 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:17.260
 new frequency here 02 typing on my 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 remote control 09 14 18 7 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.860
 I will now tighten the O button on the side to 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.130
 to be able to go to another field 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.240
 down or to another field and is the symbol 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.910
 milk 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.670
 You'll put it here for control. 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.670
 remote 11 thousand and 500 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.900
 11,500 now I'll hit the line key 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.330
 down here from the remote control 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.360
 it goes to polarity this 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.050
 polarity is vertical is only you click 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.860
 here on the vertical side and now 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.130
 I'm okay and I'll signal the signal already starts to 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.430
 appear here I can even start the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.860
 here and the blue button on the remote control 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.709
 each key here this the best each 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.030
 The design of this monitor represents a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.810
 start your remote control 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.920
 blue button 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 the grip here he goes there program everyone 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.940
 or just open minded 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.130
 It started there. 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.299
 look for will appear soon appeared 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.190
 Here O new time and a new era 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.940
 and he has already saved 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.980
 I will not show start again instead 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.099
 to be all me because only open from the 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.220
 ok it will appear at the same time again 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.530
 time executive radio new time and radio 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.280
 nuevo tiempo pronto is already configured 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.650
 The signal is already arriving here and 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.510
 so watch this question a lot 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.760
 of polarity 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.579
 the old frequency was in polarity 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.170
 horizontal the current frequency is in 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.269
 vertical polarity 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.970
 if you happen to put these 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.950
 parameters here and you were not able to 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.079
 sign you could not get here 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.849
 appear the channels here is has proven 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.989
 that your antenna point is not 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.060
 automatic 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.829
 so what are you going to have to do? 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.560
 a better technique technician you do this 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.919
 actually calling the technician 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.440
 and then if you set the parameters and not 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.690
 it has come to the very likely end that your 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.479
 good that points out of your pen 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.960
 you'll have to turn it 90 degrees to 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.449
 arrive at radical formality 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.280
 this is the problem now most of the 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.690
 Kids already have it already does this 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.570
 automatically 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.560
 It's good, there's only a few. 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.280
 details in practice for you is 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.949
 receiver reconfiguration 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.449
 if you want some more information 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:59.570
 go to the rio site tiempo.com bar 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.220
 engineering are born with 11 receivers 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.560
 ancient you have 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.450
 stopping there has a mailing list 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.840
 because you can take something 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.460
 absurd good good sheik to do is 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.160
 like this 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.580
 It's easier for you this is called. 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.580
 the time 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.370
 that easy 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:29.610
 here we guarantee - already pointed out 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.330
 coordinates have a good championship, that's it 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.330
 a hug
