you<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.800> used<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.160> cube<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.580> lot<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
you have used your cube a lot the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.390 
you have used your cube a lot the
turning<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.930> both<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.259> these<00:01:04.500> cubes<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
turning on both of these cubes is very

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.969 
turning on both of these cubes is very
very<00:01:05.640> different<00:01:05.880> while<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> zanchi<00:01:07.320> fuse

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
very different while the zanchi fuse

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
very different while the zanchi fuse
that<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> very<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:08.820> fast<00:01:09.329> very<00:01:09.659> very

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200

smooth the pan she gives you a blocky
kind<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> feeling<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.249> is<00:01:14.399> much<00:01:14.670> more

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
kind of feeling but it is much more

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
kind of feeling but it is much more
smoother<00:01:15.179> than<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> Zhen<00:01:15.840> Chi<00:01:15.869> aura<00:01:16.259> cutting

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
smoother than the Zhen Chi aura cutting

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
very easily but 45 degree is not

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.160 
very easily but 45 degree is not
possible<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.520> cube<00:01:23.960> reversed<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.109> a

piece on the zhanchi you can easily do

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:45.139 
piece on the zhanchi you can easily do
45<00:01:42.299> degrees<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.920> reverse<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.609> the<00:01:44.639> same<00:01:44.939> as

out which holds it inside and the pan

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.879 
out which holds it inside and the pan
she<00:03:09.489> has<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.760> different<00:03:10.150> mechanism<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:11.409> is<00:03:11.620> kind

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
she has a different mechanism it is kind

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.399 
she has a different mechanism it is kind
of<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.129> rough<00:03:12.340> surface<00:03:12.549> on<00:03:13.120> its<00:03:13.540> edge<00:03:14.109> right

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
of a rough surface on its edge right

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.220 
of a rough surface on its edge right
here<00:03:14.579> which<00:03:15.579> increases<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.449> it's<00:03:16.659> friction

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
here which increases the it's friction

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.390 
here which increases the it's friction
with<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:18.299> Hendra<00:03:19.299> piece<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.199> is<00:03:20.409> in<00:03:21.040> place

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
with the Hendra piece and it is in place

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.309 
with the Hendra piece and it is in place
during<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:22.060> salt<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.569> it<00:03:22.689> has<00:03:22.870> never<00:03:23.049> bothered

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
during a salt and it has never bothered

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.770 
during a salt and it has never bothered
me<00:03:23.650> yet<00:03:23.680> both<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.489> these<00:03:24.639> cubes<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.209> an<00:03:25.329> anti

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
me yet both of these cubes have an anti

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.770 
me yet both of these cubes have an anti
popping<00:03:26.169> mechanism<00:03:27.180> which<00:03:28.180> does<00:03:28.479> not<00:03:28.629> allow

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
popping mechanism which does not allow

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.369 
popping mechanism which does not allow
their<00:03:29.259> features<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.889> fly<00:03:30.129> out<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:31.169> the<00:03:32.169> San

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
their features to fly out but the San

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.469 
their features to fly out but the San
she<00:03:32.680> is<00:03:32.919> almost<00:03:33.250> unbearable<00:03:33.669> while<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.269> plan

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:34.479 
she is almost unbearable while the plan

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.390 
she is almost unbearable while the plan
she<00:03:34.689> can<00:03:34.840> still<00:03:35.109> pop<00:03:35.439> if<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.829> have<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.220> at

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
she can still pop if you have it at

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.149 
she can still pop if you have it at
really<00:03:37.120> loose<00:03:37.329> tensions<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.139> YouTube<00:03:38.650> but

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
really loose tensions like a YouTube but

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.189 
really loose tensions like a YouTube but
now<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.579> have<00:03:39.849> tightened<00:03:40.329> this<00:03:40.449> cube<00:03:40.720> this

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
now that I have tightened this cube this

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.349 
now that I have tightened this cube this
cube<00:03:41.439> has<00:03:41.650> never<00:03:41.919> popped<00:03:42.220> on<00:03:42.370> me<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:42.759> also<00:03:43.000> the

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
cube has never popped on me and also the

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.119 
cube has never popped on me and also the
zen<00:03:43.540> she<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.840> almost<00:03:43.989> perfect<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.889> it<00:03:44.979> will

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
zen she is almost perfect and it will

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.729 
zen she is almost perfect and it will
never<00:03:45.159> pop<00:03:45.609> ok<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.299> now<00:03:46.479> let<00:03:46.689> me<00:03:46.720> show<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.049> some

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
never pop ok so now let me show you some

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.099 
never pop ok so now let me show you some
salt<00:03:48.009> on<00:03:48.189> both<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.459> these<00:03:48.699> cubes<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.659> will<00:03:49.930> be

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
salt on both of these cubes so I will be

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.159 
salt on both of these cubes so I will be
solving<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.650> zhanchi<00:03:50.889> first<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.870> will<00:03:52.870> not<00:03:53.019> be

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
solving the zhanchi first I will not be

00:03:53.169 --> 00:04:00.030 
solving the zhanchi first I will not be
timing<00:03:53.379> the<00:03:53.590> souls<00:03:58.049> these<00:03:59.049> souls<00:03:59.349> are<00:03:59.590> just<00:03:59.889> to

recommendations I recommend both of

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.529 
recommendations I recommend both of
these<00:04:55.680> cubes<00:04:56.039> while<00:04:56.580> the<00:04:56.729> pan<00:04:56.970> cheese<00:04:57.240> for

these cubes while the pan cheese for

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.180 
these cubes while the pan cheese for
people<00:04:57.960> who<00:04:58.110> like<00:04:58.320> much<00:04:58.590> more<00:04:58.620> smoother
