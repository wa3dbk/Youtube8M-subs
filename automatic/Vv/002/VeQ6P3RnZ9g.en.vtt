to be in our category and I'm gonna give
you<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.989> quick<00:00:43.170> overview<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> these<00:00:43.949> if

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
you just a quick overview of these if

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.650 
you just a quick overview of these if
you're<00:00:44.250> looking<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.640> more<00:00:44.790> specific<00:00:45.300> details

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you're looking for more specific details

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
you're looking for more specific details
on<00:00:45.870> each<00:00:45.930> two<00:00:46.290> then<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.130> video<00:00:47.400> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
on each two then we have a video for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.030 
on each two then we have a video for
each<00:00:48.120> shoe<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.750> check<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.860> let's

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
each shoe you can check it out but let's

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.370 
each shoe you can check it out but let's
just<00:00:50.190> start<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> sort<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> broad<00:00:51.690> look

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
just start with a sort of a broad look

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.530 
just start with a sort of a broad look
at<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.739> snowshoes<00:00:53.120> mostly<00:00:54.120> flat<00:00:54.360> or

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
at these snowshoes mostly flat or

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.639 
at these snowshoes mostly flat or
rolling<00:00:54.690> terrain<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.380> they're<00:00:55.530> designed

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
rolling terrain is what they're designed

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.440 
rolling terrain is what they're designed
for<00:00:56.100> such<00:00:56.970> as<00:00:57.180> golf<00:00:57.660> course<00:00:57.989> maybe<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.380> meadow

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
for such as golf course maybe a meadow

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.389 
for such as golf course maybe a meadow
you<00:01:00.450> know<00:01:00.540> out<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.809> back<00:01:00.989> door<00:01:01.399> gentle

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you know out your back door gentle

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
you know out your back door gentle
rolling<00:01:02.730> terrain<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.420> mostly<00:01:04.019> packed<00:01:04.409> snow

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
rolling terrain and mostly packed snow

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.200 
rolling terrain and mostly packed snow
the<00:01:05.159> reason<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.579> that<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the reason for that is because the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
the reason for that is because the
traction<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.810> these<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.200> fairly<00:01:07.770> moderate<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
traction on these is fairly moderate so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740 
traction on these is fairly moderate so
they're<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.670> gonna<00:01:08.790> grip<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.509> if

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
they're not gonna grip really good if

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
they're not gonna grip really good if
it's<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.380> deep<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:10.860> steep<00:01:11.219> if

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's really deep and really steep if

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
it's really deep and really steep if
you're<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:12.719> you're<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.899> some<00:01:13.079> deeper

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
you're you know if you're in some deeper

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780 
you're you know if you're in some deeper
snow<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.829> oh<00:01:13.890> no<00:01:14.040> problem<00:01:14.340> at<00:01:14.430> all

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
snow and that oh no problem at all

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.459 
snow and that oh no problem at all
but<00:01:15.119> certainly<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.840> aren't<00:01:16.049> designed<00:01:16.350> for

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
but certainly these aren't designed for

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.410 
but certainly these aren't designed for
challenging<00:01:17.399> terrain<00:01:17.579> so<00:01:18.090> let's<00:01:18.240> take<00:01:18.359> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
challenging terrain so let's take a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.139 
challenging terrain so let's take a
quick<00:01:18.509> look<00:01:18.719> here<00:01:18.780> starting<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.729> tubs

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
quick look here starting with the tubs

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:22.730 
quick look here starting with the tubs
explore<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.079> have<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.289> men's<00:01:22.469> and<00:01:22.649> women's

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
explore we have the men's and women's

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.459 
explore we have the men's and women's
and<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.209> tubs<00:01:24.420> explore<00:01:24.810> again<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.319> get

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
and with the tubs explore again you get

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:27.769 
and with the tubs explore again you get
pretty<00:01:25.829> moderate<00:01:26.219> traction<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.999> just<00:01:27.539> enough

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:27.779 
pretty moderate traction so just enough

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:30.649 
pretty moderate traction so just enough
to<00:01:27.899> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.170> grip<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.529> moderate<00:01:28.859> rain<00:01:29.659> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
to kind of grip on moderate rain the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.090 
to kind of grip on moderate rain the
binding<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.109> very<00:01:31.289> simple<00:01:31.679> and<00:01:31.770> easy<00:01:31.859> to<00:01:32.069> use

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
binding is very simple and easy to use

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
binding is very simple and easy to use
just<00:01:33.029> basically<00:01:33.479> pulling<00:01:34.319> on<00:01:34.499> this<00:01:34.649> loop<00:01:34.859> here

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just basically pulling on this loop here

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.169 
just basically pulling on this loop here
we'll<00:01:35.130> tighten<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.429> around<00:01:35.520> your<00:01:35.759> foot<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
we'll tighten it around your foot you

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.239 
we'll tighten it around your foot you
have<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.329> heel<00:01:36.450> strap<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.840> well<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.289> touch<00:01:37.979> all

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
have a heel strap as well and touch all

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.529 
have a heel strap as well and touch all
that<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.549> snowshoes<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.119> what's<00:01:39.299> called<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
that our snowshoes have what's called a

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.419 
that our snowshoes have what's called a
fully<00:01:39.749> rotating<00:01:40.229> toe<00:01:40.380> cord<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:41.069> what<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
fully rotating toe cord so what that

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.249 
fully rotating toe cord so what that
means<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.789> when<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.969> take<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.149> step<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:42.990> snow

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
means is when you take a step the snow

you to pick the shoe off the ground

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.590 
you to pick the shoe off the ground
maybe<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.460> step<00:02:40.610> over<00:02:40.730> obstacles

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
maybe just step over obstacles

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.530 
maybe just step over obstacles
unlike<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> tubs<00:02:42.910> which<00:02:43.910> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.209> stays<00:02:44.390> on

unlike the tubs which kind of stays on
the<00:02:44.630> ground<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.959> might<00:02:45.050> kind<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.380> hit<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> log<00:02:45.890> if

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
the ground it might kind of hit a log if

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.400 
the ground it might kind of hit a log if
you're<00:02:46.250> stepping<00:02:46.550> over<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.290> other

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
you're stepping over it and the other

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.410 
you're stepping over it and the other
nice<00:02:48.620> feature<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.430> binding<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:50.300> has

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
nice feature of this binding is it has

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
nice feature of this binding is it has
an<00:02:50.600> extraordinary<00:02:51.320> amount<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.860> articulation

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
an extraordinary amount of articulation

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.900 
an extraordinary amount of articulation
so<00:02:53.300> your<00:02:53.780> foot<00:02:53.990> can<00:02:54.140> really<00:02:54.350> find<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.980> natural

so your foot can really find a natural
step<00:02:56.300> even<00:02:56.930> if<00:02:57.080> you're<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.350> on<00:02:57.440> uneven<00:02:57.709> terrain

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
step even if you're in on uneven terrain

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.180 
step even if you're in on uneven terrain

would say that out of the three here

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.600 
would say that out of the three here
this<00:03:19.730> one<00:03:19.850> probably<00:03:20.000> has<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.360> most<00:03:20.570> traction
