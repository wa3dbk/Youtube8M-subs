everything<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.290> locks<00:00:43.559> it's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
everything it's it's your locks it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.680 
everything it's it's your locks it's
having<00:00:44.129> proper<00:00:44.460> glass<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.149> having<00:00:45.510> just

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
having proper glass it's having just

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
having proper glass it's having just
everything<00:00:46.170> sort<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.469> set<00:00:46.680> up<00:00:46.800> correctly<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
everything sort of set up correctly the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.209 
everything sort of set up correctly the
alarm<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.750> component<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
alarm is one component of it and one of

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.450 
alarm is one component of it and one of
the<00:00:50.370> wrist<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.110> people<00:00:53.100> assume

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the wrist I think is that people assume

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
the wrist I think is that people assume
that<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.090> putting<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.840> real<00:00:55.559> basic

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that you know putting in a real basic

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
that you know putting in a real basic
little<00:00:56.250> alarm<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> somehow

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
little alarm is going to somehow

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.720 
little alarm is going to somehow
increase<00:00:58.620> their<00:00:58.800> level<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> security<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
increase their level of security and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
increase their level of security and
it's<00:00:59.850> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> help<00:01:00.149> them<00:01:00.359> out<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.660> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
it's going to help them out if they have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's going to help them out if they have
a<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> break-in<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> unfortunately<00:01:02.699> they

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
a have a break-in and unfortunately they

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
a have a break-in and unfortunately they
don't<00:01:03.449> learn<00:01:03.600> until<00:01:03.780> after<00:01:04.199> break<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.240> an

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
don't learn until after break in that an

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
don't learn until after break in that an
alarm<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.659> just<00:01:06.810> not<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> deterrent<00:01:07.320> anymore

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
don't care because they know that if

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
don't care because they know that if
unless<00:01:15.689> an<00:01:15.960> alarm<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.320> set<00:01:16.439> with<00:01:16.560> immediate

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
unless an alarm is set with immediate

at an alarm system is an alarm is not a

at an alarm system is an alarm is not a
deterrent<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.810> also<00:02:16.989> very<00:02:17.470> important<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069

not<00:02:25.120> terribly<00:02:26.220> effective<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.370> certainly

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
not terribly effective it's certainly

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.390 
not terribly effective it's certainly
not<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.849> deterrent<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.920> you're<00:02:30.040> gonna<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.310> an

alarm it needs to be monitored but it's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.600 
alarm it needs to be monitored but it's
only<00:02:32.260> worth<00:02:32.590> monitoring<00:02:33.130> if<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.489> has

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
only worth monitoring if it has

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.490 
only worth monitoring if it has
immediate<00:02:33.910> response<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:35.019> know<00:02:35.140> having

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
immediate response you know having

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530 
immediate response you know having
having<00:02:36.340> an<00:02:36.519> alarm<00:02:36.730> monitoring<00:02:37.239> where<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
it's going to take 30 minutes or someone

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.350 
it's going to take 30 minutes or someone
to<00:02:41.500> respond<00:02:41.940> start<00:02:42.940> having<00:02:43.150> sort<00:02:43.330> of

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to respond start having sort of

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.479 
to respond start having sort of
questionable<00:02:44.080> value<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
questionable value with with that so

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.910 
questionable value with with that so
it's<00:02:45.670> is<00:02:46.150> having<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.599> alarm<00:02:46.900> monitored<00:02:47.530> with

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's is having the alarm monitored with

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.740 
it's is having the alarm monitored with
immediate<00:02:48.430> response<00:02:48.819> is<00:02:49.090> where<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.390> all<00:02:49.450> sort

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
immediate response is where it all sort

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.180 
immediate response is where it all sort
of<00:02:49.810> makes<00:02:49.989> sense<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.620> sort<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.860> take<00:02:50.980> away

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
of makes sense so you sort of take away

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.670 
of makes sense so you sort of take away
one<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.459> those<00:02:51.580> components<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:53.440> really

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
one of those components it it really

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.009 
one of those components it it really
offers<00:02:53.920> significantly<00:02:54.640> less<00:02:54.790> value<00:02:55.269> you

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
offers significantly less value you

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.600 
offers significantly less value you
really<00:02:56.319> need<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.500> push<00:02:56.680> your<00:02:56.799> security<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.370> as

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
really need to push your security out as

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.460 
really need to push your security out as
far<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:57.910> possible<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.750> you're<00:02:59.019> detecting

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
far as possible so that you're detecting

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680 
far as possible so that you're detecting
people<00:02:59.769> as<00:02:59.980> early<00:03:00.400> as<00:03:00.489> possible<00:03:00.730> basically

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
people as early as possible basically

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.210 
people as early as possible basically
just<00:03:01.720> making<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.380> harder<00:03:02.590> for<00:03:02.769> people<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.100> get

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
just making it harder for people to get

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.340 
just making it harder for people to get
easily<00:03:03.730> onto<00:03:04.090> your<00:03:04.239> property<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.049> lock
