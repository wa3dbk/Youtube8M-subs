I I feel like honestly I feel like it
took<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> things<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> been<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
took the things that have been so

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.970 
took the things that have been so
overdone<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.649> overdone

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
overdone and they really are so overdone

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
overdone and they really are so overdone
but<00:00:59.219> for<00:01:00.120> example<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.690> know<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
but for example you know like when the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
but for example you know like when the
girls<00:01:01.260> light<00:01:01.469> gets<00:01:01.649> pulled<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> bed

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
girls light gets pulled in the bed

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
girls light gets pulled in the bed
that's<00:01:03.090> been<00:01:03.270> done<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.629> death<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.619> thought

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that's been done to death but I thought

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.310 
that's been done to death but I thought
it<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.070> kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> cool<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.360> looked<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:07.110> if

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it was kind of cool it looked at if

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.060 
it was kind of cool it looked at if
something<00:01:07.560> about<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> looked<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> little

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
something about it looked a little

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.469 
something about it looked a little
different<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.939> even<00:01:09.270> though<00:01:09.299> I'm

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
different so even though I'm

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.149 
different so even though I'm
disappointed<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.920> looks

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
