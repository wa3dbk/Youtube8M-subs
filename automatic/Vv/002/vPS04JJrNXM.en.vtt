in<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.210> group<00:00:29.420> as<00:00:29.630> well<00:00:29.750> it's<00:00:29.990> definitely<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.349> lot

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
in a group as well it's definitely a lot

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.499 
in a group as well it's definitely a lot
easier<00:00:30.679> than<00:00:30.890> doing<00:00:31.099> it<00:00:31.310> solo<00:00:31.759> after<00:00:32.390> that

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
easier than doing it solo after that

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.820 
easier than doing it solo after that
you're<00:00:32.629> going<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:32.809> need<00:00:32.989> to<00:00:33.110> summon<00:00:33.379> them<00:00:33.650> and

you're going to need to summon them and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.320 
you're going to need to summon them and
sometimes<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.400> can<00:00:34.489> take<00:00:34.519> a<00:00:34.699> few<00:00:34.790> seconds

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.939 
sometimes it can take a few seconds
before<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.750> can<00:00:35.870> summon<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.290> second<00:00:36.650> one<00:00:36.769> so

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
before you can summon the second one so

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
difficult so what you want to do is get

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.330 
difficult so what you want to do is get
into<00:01:05.899> a<00:01:05.960> group<00:01:06.259> and<00:01:06.470> then<00:01:06.560> go<00:01:06.710> into<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:07.009> portal

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.980 
into a group and then go into the portal
together<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.970> then<00:01:08.300> it's<00:01:08.420> really<00:01:08.690> really

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
together and then it's really really

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.540 
together and then it's really really
easy<00:01:09.020> to<00:01:09.500> take<00:01:09.679> him<00:01:09.830> down<00:01:09.860> but<00:01:10.250> it<00:01:10.369> does<00:01:10.520> look

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
easy to take him down but it does look

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.070 
easy to take him down but it does look
really<00:01:10.880> cool<00:01:11.119> for<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.390> boss<00:01:11.600> there<00:01:11.899> weren't
