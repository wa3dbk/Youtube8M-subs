00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.799
 Hello my name is biology reciprocity 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.820
 and we will present them to the bond of origin of life 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.909
 nahla today you will learn 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:23.509
 the theory of spontaneous generation or also called the journey be and there was 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.899
 gnv the experiments several scientists 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.479
 on the formation of the first living being 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.210
 I went away laughing 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.080
 chemical evolution 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.470
 the conditions of the primitive earth the appearance of the first living being 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.310
 hypothesis of being an actor or to keep up the change 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.510
 this dimension of the actions in the case who signs the line 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.100
 the formation of the earth 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.690
 is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.570
 we were from a cloud in the only result 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.150
 which gave salt 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.830
 Today, the citizen has with democracy, she takes the form of a 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.660
 salt 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.600
 and up to approximately 4,000-55 billion years 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.460
 and it is with the fumbling side assist 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.970
 of this cosmic dust 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 arrivals are requested to provide the formation of land 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.830
 even because we are going to address today is the origin of life then how was it 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.659
 that emerged 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.640
 the first living beings 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 well into the middle of the 19th century was believed to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.280
 spontaneously occur in non-living matter 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.610
 only today we know that to appear on the server 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.110
 and only through playback 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.010
 so we talk about the concept of today more diverse 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.610
 the trip 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.800
 before we discussed how the first molecules 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 capable of reproducing transformed 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.980
 in primitive environments we have to understand 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.520
 it is not as it has been shown that only life generates life or 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.370
 which does not affect months of life, the part of a gross material is a matter 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.870
 commented 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.920
 is today whether they are widely accepted but not always so for years 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.850
 believed it had after being examined part of the nothing or is a raw material 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.059
 to transform 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:13.099
 today we know that life has arisen in special and unique conditions 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.969
 it is a lie in all the mind urged as the sides have guns 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.099
 I wanted you to see this picture 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.779
 in this photo that they appear 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.899
 However, it was not always like this 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:29.439
 for years I believe in the idea of ​​the spontaneous generation of life, 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.429
 concept of comprehensiveness 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.229
 the life being formed through 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.500
 owner of a raw material 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.689
 there are some scientists some researchers 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.839
 that they were supporters of the trip 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.209
 that would abort a lot with this 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.079
 saw tv 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.999
 the best referee thing that gave me everything 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.590
 and olinda and discard 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.840
 and we can also observe that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.259
 in contrast to the defenders of the trip they 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:05.329
 we have critics the crisis comments were to this theory dh agency be 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.919
 of spontaneous generation 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.319
 What happened to fashion? 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.989
 today the contribution of the two stages to nike the pastor
