 Welcome to Keynes TV like 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.210
 visit the canes today 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.260
 opening training dfl game week against 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.180
 the düsseldorf panther 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.300
 the game is the same time 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
 qualification for the eurobowl 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.019
 Europapokal finale das kieler 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.760
 absolutely want to reach a big one 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 Of course, attention is on 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 quarterback nickel most likely he is the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.450
 only player entitled to play beck 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 this weekend and come after five 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 weeks injury break again in the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.219
 training the canes back we use the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.739
 opportunity with quarterback nick larsen 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.840
 about his healing process over his 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.640
 progress in training and over his 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.660
 goals for the game against the düsseldorf 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.660
 panther to speak 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.480
 So do not say that he is 100 percent 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.100
 restored is the one has good 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.960
 Healed, the healing process is good 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.610
 It was a difficult one for him 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.870
 time to just sit on the bench and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.460
 not to be able to play 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.330
 and he is looking forward to going crazy 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 finally back into the game 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.260
 to be able to intervene 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.850
 Here we see a bit 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.100
 in the training work and the first 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.440
 impressions are outstanding and we are 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.600
 We sure that is not a big prop 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.340
 in the team on saturday against düsseldorf 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.810
 panther will be 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.730
 and of course we also use the chance 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.440
 talk to headcoach patrick sum 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.360
 a lot of work in the past days 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.780
 has invested in the team again 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.830
 on course for success 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.930
 The team has two serious defeats 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.819
 what must you do? 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.290
 week to motivate the boys and what 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.900
 He makes it different and back in the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.750
 success track to come so in order to 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.299
 motivate if we definitely 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.310
 drive a little earlier düsseldorf 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.510
 or stay overnight at the team but again 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.010
 to bring closer together 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.840
 otherwise it would be the end of the week 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.989
 Probability a bit 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.120
 shut down and during the siemens 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.269
 We will become what we work 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.370
 implement shutdown and straight 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.069
 because we have so many injured 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.109
 we just make it simpler with that 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.900
 which actually have little playing time 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.280
 now a lot of playing time get too 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.420
 have to focus very little 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.299
 therefore wait 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.040
 quaterback lamaze is back in 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.569
 training has gone so far 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.890
 good as I've heard is also from 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.209
 doctor were clarified for the weekend 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.099
 you will use it quite completely 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.569
 important for our team was not in vain 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.520
 our star is a quarterback and believes 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.780
 you have already seen 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.210
 painful to the Brunswick game 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.200
 so far of course have been happy 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.060
 that he is back 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.150
 because he is definitely our leader 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.550
 our difference maker in the open one 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.440
 victory in düsseldorf meant moving into 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.300
 European Cup final motivates that the 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.730
 In addition, there is also a youth 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.440
 there is no pressure at all 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.590
 That is always a motivation when you are 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.750
 has the chance to play remodeling game and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.430
 because the potential ring to win the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.480
 Ultimate this is the ultimate for 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.490
 a photo player 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.840
 insofar the motivation is already there 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.250
 Anyway, very high thanks to the sum 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.080
 So much of the training of the keel 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.850

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.820
