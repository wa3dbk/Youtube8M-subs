00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
to explain how the rich crash mechanic

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.599 
to explain how the rich crash mechanic
works<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.199> two<00:00:19.410> powers<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.369> can

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
works so there are two powers you can

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.340 
works so there are two powers you can
use<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.119> enter<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> rage<00:00:21.779> mode

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
use to enter the rage mode

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.130 
use to enter the rage mode
these<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.279> relentless<00:00:24.029> anger<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.720> severe

these are relentless anger and severe

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.820 
these are relentless anger and severe
punishment

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
punishment

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
punishment

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
once you have entered the rage mode it

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
once you have entered the rage mode it
lasts<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.670> eight<00:00:29.849> seconds<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.539> they<00:00:30.990> call

lasts for eight seconds and they call
down<00:00:31.470> for<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.160> skills<00:00:32.460> instance<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> 10
