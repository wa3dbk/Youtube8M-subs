00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
this is it an upright this is it when it

this is it an upright this is it when it
switches<00:02:41.709> as<00:02:42.069> you<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.370> see<00:02:42.610> there's<00:02:42.909> very

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
switches as you can see there's very

switches as you can see there's very
little<00:02:43.299> delay<00:02:43.690> there<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.739> still<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.010> little

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
little delay there is still a little

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.770 
little delay there is still a little
more<00:02:45.400> lag<00:02:45.610> than<00:02:45.879> what<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> would<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.420> some

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
more lag than what you would see on some

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.030 
more lag than what you would see on some
of<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:46.959> newer<00:02:47.109> Android<00:02:47.470> devices<00:02:47.709> and

iphone 4 that's actually one of the
biggest<00:02:52.150> problems<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.049> have<00:02:53.079> with<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
biggest problems that we have with the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.770 
biggest problems that we have with the
blackberry<00:02:54.129> torch<00:02:54.430> it's<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.819> nice<00:02:54.970> device<00:02:55.450> but

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
blackberry torch it's a nice device but

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.559 
blackberry torch it's a nice device but
it<00:02:55.870> feels<00:02:56.019> slow<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:57.010> processor<00:02:57.549> is<00:02:57.579> only<00:02:57.730> 624

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
it feels slow the processor is only 624
