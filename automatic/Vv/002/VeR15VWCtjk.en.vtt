00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.070
 O 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.449
 outside the season 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.340
 who it is as a new proposed and htc inclusion that aims to better serve the 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.230
 2nd energy dp in the testimony when the Dutchman that the gaucho team 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.929
 he saw 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.550
 In fact, we're training. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.650
 we lend and toss of morumbi agreements with the habit to the keyboard not 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.300
 I promise it's strange though. 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 is that I feel more comfortable there in humans and even 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.180
 I useful 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.270
 I make rivers 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 that the increase 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.550
 such as in May 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 It's very easy to laugh as well. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.460
 other points 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.400
 from santo daime 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 occurs in three message boxes 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 even though the menu part starts 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.090
 if the features of what does commented michael owen to the right what I 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.020
 think 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.230
 we got 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.600
 and if we give students so easy 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.250
 I think 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 this is a subject can be defined 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 so here we have sign-up sign-ups 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.680
 enke we can be bsco had already censored navigation 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.550
 but why run 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.990
 inter and saints 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.910
 neuer 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.960
 however the story 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 field we see here 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 any team 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.030
 flat creams means she has this power with the cache produced 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 It is equally clear by correcting 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.260
 from then on 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.770
 the controlled robot 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 that any other 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:18.079
 click here all 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 easy 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.209
 on top of someone 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.209
 with the help of road as to contact any other 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.399
 wherever you try 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.399
 to the system 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.869
 hetherington the illuminated 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.809
 when we have few sesi pride to give account wang zhizhi philomena no 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.809
 keyboard size and the man nÃ© delivered 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.529
 I might want 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.849
 as it tells us 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.160
 is what causes a strangeness at first but then 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.679
 s 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.929
 it becomes easy communication 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.509
 - 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:03.509
 and I'm enjoying the year 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.409
 little technical study 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.649
 as shown first visit 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.649
 fair attack yesterday had no funds 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:20.019
 the shampoo for example surf the skin of the face tasks 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:21.989
 ef 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.789
 just be 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:25.359
 the form was an internal matter 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.859
 he comes back 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.049
 which makes it easy 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.759
 along with the son I'll go there 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.149
 or I think he inherits 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.109
 and even 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.799
 3- May 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.289
 and the sector is extremely hot 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:42.329
 with the 25% 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.329
 the flight was the largest of the larger river 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.659
 at 65 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.659
 now 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.179
 long muno 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.179
 with the athletic 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.999
 that despite the disaster said mitchell 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:05.659
 I consider p 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.659
 a bet that 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.659
 and this 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.659
 in the wake of this segment as one of the new teams 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.919
 case
