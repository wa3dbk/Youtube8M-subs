00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
running Samsung's TouchWiz so let's see

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.150 
running Samsung's TouchWiz so let's see
how<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.270> fare<00:00:18.600> now<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> freshly<00:00:19.710> booted<00:00:19.980> both

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
how they fare now I freshly booted both

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.590 
how they fare now I freshly booted both
these<00:00:20.340> devices<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.880> haven't<00:00:21.150> opened<00:00:21.210> any

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
these devices I haven't opened any

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.090 
these devices I haven't opened any
applications<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.410> see<00:00:22.560> there's<00:00:22.740> nothing

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
applications you can see there's nothing

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
applications you can see there's nothing
in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> reasons<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.670> both<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
in the reasons for both these are the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.660 
in the reasons for both these are the
applications<00:00:25.350> I'll<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.590> testing<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> will

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
applications I'll be testing out I will

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
applications I'll be testing out I will
try<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.119> accurate<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.750> possibly<00:00:28.109> can

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
try and be as accurate as I possibly can

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.870 
try and be as accurate as I possibly can
but<00:00:28.500> take<00:00:28.680> into<00:00:28.949> account<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.310> bit<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> human

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
but take into account a bit of human

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
but take into account a bit of human
error<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:30.960> go<00:00:31.109> now<00:00:31.830> while<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
error so here we go now while this is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.410 
error so here we go now while this is
going<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.730> let<00:00:32.910> me<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.149> tell<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> little

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
going on let me just tell you a little

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.209 
going on let me just tell you a little
bit<00:00:33.690> about<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> specs<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.530> Nexus<00:00:34.860> 5<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
bit about the specs the Nexus 5 is

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
bit about the specs the Nexus 5 is
running<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> Snapdragon<00:00:36.120> 800<00:00:36.660> clocked<00:00:36.870> at

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
running the Snapdragon 800 clocked at

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.650 
running the Snapdragon 800 clocked at
2.3<00:00:37.620> gigahertz<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.550> Galaxy<00:00:38.940> s5<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.270> running

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
2.3 gigahertz the Galaxy s5 is running

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.110 
2.3 gigahertz the Galaxy s5 is running
the<00:00:39.750> Snapdragon<00:00:40.320> 801<00:00:40.649> clocked<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.430> 2.5

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the Snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.5

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
the Snapdragon 801 clocked at 2.5
gigahertz<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.870> has<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.530> newer<00:00:43.710> processor

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
gigahertz so it has the newer processor

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
gigahertz so it has the newer processor
and<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> higher<00:00:44.730> clock<00:00:45.000> rate<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.629> far<00:00:45.870> what

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and a higher clock rate but so far what

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
and a higher clock rate but so far what
we've<00:00:46.110> seen<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.680> two<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.190> really

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
we've seen as these two are really

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.610 
we've seen as these two are really
evenly<00:00:48.000> matched<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> poping<00:00:49.050> speed<00:00:49.379> both

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
evenly matched to a poping speed both

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.650 
evenly matched to a poping speed both
are<00:00:49.770> pretty<00:00:49.950> much<00:00:50.100> identical<00:00:50.510> Facebook<00:00:51.510> was

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
are pretty much identical Facebook was

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
are pretty much identical Facebook was
the<00:00:51.780> only<00:00:51.930> area<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> Galaxy<00:00:52.980> s5<00:00:53.280> was

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the only area where the Galaxy s5 was

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
the only area where the Galaxy s5 was
quite<00:00:53.730> away<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.180> front<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.110> quite

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
quite away in front and I'm not quite

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.689 
quite away in front and I'm not quite
sure<00:00:55.350> why<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.129> may<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.399> due<00:00:56.670> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
sure why that is that may be due to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.369 
sure why that is that may be due to
network<00:00:57.000> activity<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> don't<00:00:58.199> quite<00:00:58.320> know

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
network activity but I don't quite know

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.110 
network activity but I don't quite know
I<00:00:58.500> did<00:00:58.739> test<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.399> once<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> every

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
I did test it more than once and every

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
I did test it more than once and every
time<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> galaxy<00:01:00.719> s5<00:01:00.930> did<00:01:01.170> win<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> pretty

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
time the galaxy s5 did win but in pretty

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
time the galaxy s5 did win but in pretty
much<00:01:02.370> every<00:01:02.789> application<00:01:03.270> other<00:01:03.600> than<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
much every application other than that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
much every application other than that
they<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.409> very<00:01:04.680> neck-and-neck<00:01:04.979> trading

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
they are very neck-and-neck trading

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.550 
they are very neck-and-neck trading
blows<00:01:05.939> each<00:01:06.210> way<00:01:06.420> sometimes<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> Nexus<00:01:07.350> 5

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
blows each way sometimes the Nexus 5

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
blows each way sometimes the Nexus 5
would<00:01:07.740> win<00:01:07.890> sometimes<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> galaxy<00:01:09.240> s5<00:01:09.510> would

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
would win sometimes the galaxy s5 would

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
would win sometimes the galaxy s5 would
win<00:01:09.900> for<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> camera<00:01:10.710> opening<00:01:11.040> speed<00:01:11.280> I'll

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
win for the camera opening speed I'll

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.250 
win for the camera opening speed I'll
use<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> new<00:01:11.880> Google<00:01:12.240> camera<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.750> both<00:01:12.900> first

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
use the new Google camera for both first

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
use the new Google camera for both first
and<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> Nexus<00:01:14.250> 5<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and you can see the Nexus 5 was just a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
and you can see the Nexus 5 was just a
hair<00:01:15.150> quicker<00:01:15.420> than<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> galaxy<00:01:16.080> s5<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.560> then

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
hair quicker than the galaxy s5 I then

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.620 
hair quicker than the galaxy s5 I then
cleared<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> memory<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.820> both<00:01:17.970> cameras<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
cleared the memory for both cameras and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.149 
cleared the memory for both cameras and
I<00:01:18.750> use<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> Samsung<00:01:19.350> camera<00:01:19.830> app<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
I use the Samsung camera app on the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
I use the Samsung camera app on the
Galaxy<00:01:20.520> s5<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.000> once<00:01:21.630> again<00:01:21.900> you'll<00:01:22.080> see<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
Galaxy s5 and once again you'll see the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
Galaxy s5 and once again you'll see the
Nexus<00:01:22.650> 5<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.400> comes<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.060> top<00:01:24.330> so

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
Nexus 5 it just comes out on top so

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
Nexus 5 it just comes out on top so
moving<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> multitasking<00:01:25.920> both<00:01:26.100> these

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
moving on to multitasking both these

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
moving on to multitasking both these
devices<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.909> 2<00:01:27.119> gigabytes<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.689> RAM<00:01:27.900> firstly

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
devices have 2 gigabytes of RAM firstly

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.929 
devices have 2 gigabytes of RAM firstly
I<00:01:28.470> wanted<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> test<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> responsiveness

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I wanted to test out the responsiveness

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.210 
I wanted to test out the responsiveness
of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.360> multitask<00:01:30.900> button<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of the multitask button so if we do that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.410 
of the multitask button so if we do that
here<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> Nexus<00:01:33.240> 5

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here you can see that the Nexus 5

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
here you can see that the Nexus 5
definitely<00:01:33.930> wins<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.350> area<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> Galaxy

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
definitely wins in this area the Galaxy

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
definitely wins in this area the Galaxy
s5<00:01:35.460> has<00:01:35.490> quite<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> delay<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.110> actually

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
s5 has quite a delay when you actually

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
s5 has quite a delay when you actually
look<00:01:37.619> at<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> slow<00:01:38.310> motion<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
look at it in slow motion I think this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
look at it in slow motion I think this
is<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.259> galaxy<00:01:40.619> s5<00:01:40.829> going

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is actually down to the galaxy s5 going

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
is actually down to the galaxy s5 going
into<00:01:41.490> immersive<00:01:42.000> mode<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.479> you're<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
into immersive mode when you're in the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.200 
into immersive mode when you're in the
multitasking<00:01:43.409> section<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.430> does<00:01:44.909> slow<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
multitasking section but it does slow it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.550 
multitasking section but it does slow it
down<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> multitask<00:01:46.259> very

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
down and if you want to multitask very

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
down and if you want to multitask very
quickly<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.820> definitely<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
quickly you can definitely see it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.700 
quickly you can definitely see it's
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> slow<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:48.960> whereas<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> Nexus

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
going to slow you down whereas the Nexus

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.410 
going to slow you down whereas the Nexus
5<00:01:49.860> doesn't<00:01:50.280> now<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.820> terms<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> actually

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
5 doesn't now in terms of actually

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
5 doesn't now in terms of actually
switching<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> applications<00:01:52.470> again<00:01:52.740> you'll

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
switching the applications again you'll

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.770 
switching the applications again you'll
notice<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> Galaxy<00:01:53.610> s5<00:01:53.909> has<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.180> delay<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.570> can

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
notice the Galaxy s5 has a delay you can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
notice the Galaxy s5 has a delay you can
see<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> pretty<00:01:55.229> evidently<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.610> slow

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
see it pretty evidently here in the slow

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.459 
see it pretty evidently here in the slow
motion<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> Nexus<00:01:57.600> 5<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.780> pretty<00:01:58.140> quick<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
motion the Nexus 5 is pretty quick to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.770 
motion the Nexus 5 is pretty quick to
respond<00:01:58.860> again<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> galaxy<00:02:00.030> s5<00:02:00.270> having<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
respond again the galaxy s5 having that

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.569 
respond again the galaxy s5 having that
delay<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> status<00:02:01.619> bar<00:02:01.890> disappears<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
delay when the status bar disappears and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
delay when the status bar disappears and
reappears<00:02:02.689> now<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.840> may<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.020> seem<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
reappears now that may not seem like a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.899 
reappears now that may not seem like a
massive<00:02:04.920> deal<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:05.670> want<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
massive deal to but if you want to

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.310 
massive deal to but if you want to
switch<00:02:06.090> between<00:02:06.119> your<00:02:06.540> apps<00:02:06.719> very<00:02:07.020> quickly

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
switch between your apps very quickly

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
switch between your apps very quickly
this<00:02:07.680> delay<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.550> slow<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
this delay is going to slow you down and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
this delay is going to slow you down and
it<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.420> become<00:02:09.569> pretty<00:02:10.020> annoying<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> it's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
it can become pretty annoying and it's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.290 
it can become pretty annoying and it's
pretty<00:02:11.160> evident<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.670> it's<00:02:11.819> not<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> one-off

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pretty evident that it's not a one-off

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.890 
pretty evident that it's not a one-off
this<00:02:12.599> has<00:02:12.720> pretty<00:02:12.900> much<00:02:13.080> happened<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.530> every

this has pretty much happened with every

this has pretty much happened with every
application<00:02:14.319> I've<00:02:14.439> tested<00:02:14.860> on<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
Nexus 5 is definitely the more

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.020

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
of its multitasking speed now I

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.229 
of its multitasking speed now I
mentioned<00:02:21.189> previously<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.849> both<00:02:22.060> these

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.490 
having to reload the applications

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
Samsung bloatware on the galaxy s5 it's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.399 
Samsung bloatware on the galaxy s5 it's

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
using up more of the memory so less is

quick in that department in terms of the
general<00:03:09.939> UI<00:03:10.359> I<00:03:10.540> would<00:03:10.870> say<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.230> Nexus<00:03:11.530> 5<00:03:11.709> has<00:03:11.859> a

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
general UI I would say the Nexus 5 has a

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.039 
general UI I would say the Nexus 5 has a
slight<00:03:12.310> edge<00:03:12.519> over<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.970> galaxy<00:03:13.180> s5<00:03:13.629> it<00:03:13.870> just

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
slight edge over the galaxy s5 it just

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.750 
slight edge over the galaxy s5 it just
feels<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.439> little<00:03:14.680> bit<00:03:14.769> more<00:03:14.799> fluid<00:03:15.220> that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
feels that little bit more fluid that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.399 
feels that little bit more fluid that
little<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.180> more<00:03:16.329> responsive<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.049> opening

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
little bit more responsive or opening

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.229 
little bit more responsive or opening
menus<00:03:17.829> and<00:03:18.040> doing<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.489> small<00:03:18.760> things<00:03:19.030> and

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
menus and doing the small things and

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.539 
menus and doing the small things and
when<00:03:20.169> you<00:03:20.199> kind<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.560> add<00:03:20.739> all<00:03:20.889> those<00:03:21.069> things<00:03:21.129> up

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
when you kind of add all those things up

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:22.920 
when you kind of add all those things up
it<00:03:21.699> does<00:03:21.849> make<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.060> difference<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.660> hard<00:03:22.840> to

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
it does make a difference it's hard to

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.089 
it does make a difference it's hard to
watch<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.139> put<00:03:23.260> your<00:03:23.410> finger<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.829> but<00:03:23.919> when

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
watch you put your finger on it but when

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.189 
watch you put your finger on it but when

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
you've got both devices in your hands at

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.900 
you've got both devices in your hands at
the<00:03:26.260> same<00:03:26.410> time<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.889> you<00:03:26.949> play<00:03:27.099> with<00:03:27.250> them<00:03:27.430> you

the same time and you play with them you
can<00:03:28.090> definitely<00:03:28.269> see<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.019> Nexus<00:03:29.349> 5<00:03:29.500> is

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.289 
can definitely see that the Nexus 5 is
the<00:03:29.889> more<00:03:30.040> snappy<00:03:30.370> device<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.879> sometimes

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
the more snappy device and sometimes

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.509 
the more snappy device and sometimes
that<00:03:31.510> TouchWiz<00:03:31.959> lag<00:03:32.199> still<00:03:32.919> rears<00:03:33.190> its<00:03:33.400> ugly

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
that TouchWiz lag still rears its ugly
