I use the key color colorizer now let's
customize<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.149> item<00:01:26.509> key<00:01:26.690> provider

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.450 

then<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> set<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> predefined<00:01:40.800> color<00:01:41.130> schema

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
then I set the predefined color schema

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.620 
then I set the predefined color schema
to<00:01:41.940> palette<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.540> close<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.440> editor<00:01:44.630> all

right the Cartesian map application is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.200 
right the Cartesian map application is
done<00:01:48.060> let's<00:01:48.930> run<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.690 

and<00:01:55.810> that's<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:56.320> thanks<00:01:57.010> for<00:01:57.040> watching<00:01:57.550> and
