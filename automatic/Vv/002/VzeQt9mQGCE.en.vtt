Indesit built-in oven however the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
Indesit built-in oven however the
procedure<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.340> similar<00:00:26.699> no<00:00:27.269> matter<00:00:27.510> what

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
procedure is very similar no matter what

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.529 
procedure is very similar no matter what
make<00:00:27.990> or<00:00:28.170> model<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:29.119> process<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.240> very

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
make or model you have process is very

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.150 
make or model you have process is very
straight<00:00:30.869> forward<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.349> lot<00:00:31.650> easier<00:00:32.070> than

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
straight forward a lot easier than

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.549 
straight forward a lot easier than
people<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.630> door<00:00:33.840> glass<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.290> come

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
people think the door glass will come

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.040 
people think the door glass will come
with<00:00:35.010> brackets<00:00:35.610> attached<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
with brackets attached so it's just a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
with brackets attached so it's just a
matter<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.350> screwing<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> inner

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
matter of screwing it on to the inner

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
matter of screwing it on to the inner
door<00:00:38.820> frame<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.450> let's<00:00:40.079> take<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> look<00:00:40.500> how<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
door frame so let's take a look how you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.910 
door frame so let's take a look how you
do<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.270> first<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.899> need<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> remove<00:00:43.680> the

do it first of all we need to remove the
door<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.480> main<00:00:45.690> oven<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.100> by

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
door from the main oven we do this by

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.490 
door from the main oven we do this by
lifting<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.820> hinge<00:00:48.059> lock<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.750> both<00:00:49.440> sides

lifting the hinge lock up on both sides

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.810 
lifting the hinge lock up on both sides
now<00:00:52.500> when<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> close<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> oven<00:00:53.520> door

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the hinge locks will prevent the door

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.319 
the hinge locks will prevent the door
from<00:00:56.610> closing<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.949> hinges<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.789> separate
