00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Cléber Machado gave an interview to the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 spectacular sport like vanderlei 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.770
 Luxembourg and asked him is with the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.860
 player who was working the most to 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.360
 chem he was a player that forced the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.530
 he gets better 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 he said that the most 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.320
 The questioner he had was you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.359
 saying that Alex because he finishes 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 seeming to ask me and dial 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.650
 if the lefty guy was not questionable 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 time so it forced lead 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 improve 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 taking this hook in the piece of this 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.710
 Do you think that football 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.420
 still has a prejudice with a player 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 who thinks too much is questioning 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 play some points some clubs some 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 a football culture with the team 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.370
 who played so much time in Brazil and in 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 Italy that has passed is not ready 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 for this type of player yet 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.309
 I think we can not generalize by 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.609
 example wandeléria direct 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.170
 he did things that suddenly ended 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.969
 Do not ask to come from all over the world. 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 speaking but wants to do this because it has 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.780
 reason to do so because in the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.030
 my head 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.210
 after a while you play 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.860
 football starts learning some things 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.799
 and you start to win or lose the game 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 in small details and with my 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.820
 coach and if turkey had 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.670
 difficulty had an episode at the end of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.770
 supercopa in which I started to scream for 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.330
 crychan christian come forward more 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.340
 three four meters 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.409
 We're going to take the goal on a ball that goes 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.560
 to fish here, you want a 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.430
 ceará who is the best passer of the team 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.320
 finished the first time the coach 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.159
 turned to me and said do not cliché 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.229
 pamphlet leaves the trash behind was looks 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.329
 who is alone is unmarked 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.799
 nobody is floating there is nothing left 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.770
 for him the first hour said that it was 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.610
 we take a goal that the guy spends a lot 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.130
 well the ball 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.899
 not need first ball of the second 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.579
 time we went out on the attack 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.149
 corinthians did not leave got in 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.340
 asked for a split ball from our 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.110
 center of the cat the dutch team 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 with the galatasaray quarterback over 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 steering wheel on my back in between 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.430
 me and cristian 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 she caught the ball has ball we take 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.500
 goal 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.920
 the first thing I did when 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 I arrived 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.800
 teixeira was questioned in relations that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.180
 is whether people are prepared or not 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.880
 I do not worry about that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.739
 me when I 'm on a team and are surprised 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.110
 with the champion and in the wine 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.930
 I have a participation of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.970
 some active way within that day 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 giving a lot of laugh for example at the beginning 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.030
 but the controversial move is turned off 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.980
 Alex said that he is very young 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.470
 totally the opposite of that I always 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.930
 I was a guy that I tried to talk to. 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.200
 tried to exchange ideas with his partner 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.390
 want a coach because for many a 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.519
 participatory is crazy and that neither 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.540
 pedrito runs pay is what runs to 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.209
 damn it 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.209
 so there are many who are 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.049
 prepared we have to be prepared not to 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.180
 I accept 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.290
 is full of people who do not really 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.239
 is prepared 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.290
 last week had the case of Rogerio 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.090
 played in the South American game that he 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.769
 requested an amendment by means of a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 I promise they will put the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.440
 game that I thought at that moment 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.250
 would need a reference player 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.049
 in the area such and ney franc did not put the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.030
 player repeated put another player 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.739
 then at a press conference said that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.310
 did not like the way rogério ceni 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:33.120
 made the request is each in his today the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.070
 cene plays such and 16 scale singles who 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.750
 will be the substitute for rogério ceni 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.130
 came in an interview said who was not 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.040
 well this anyway 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.109
 but you think the player is valid 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.590
 participate in this way suggested 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:49.200
 and a game scheme during the week 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.420
 for example the coach should talk 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.920
 with your players because you have to 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.920
 stretches even for losing a player 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.370
 injured and it rains several times there 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.739
 steering wheel that gets stuck and a steering wheel 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.930
 who is more loose exchanging conversation what? 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.600
 Do you think we should do better? 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.690
 I have an episode that struck me a lot 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.880
 It was when we vanderlei on the cruise we 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.530
 we lost in the Brazilian Cup final in the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.760
 rio de janeiro we lost edu 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.780
 dracena the tiago for yellow cards and 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.650
 wanderley joined the field at the end 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.850
 about the game 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.100
 swearing up and over there at the end of the year 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.980
 Let's leave the maracanã was pane but if 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.770
 he also keeps it, but I did it 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.960
 to divert the total focus because not 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.850
 You do not have the water we have injury 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.370
 recovered from injury and has 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.460
 gladstone who is juvenile and has never played 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.550
 I have two days to break my head. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:53.520
 and wanderley with us and spoke 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.230
 there she imagines that bring jardel 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.420
 was a midfielder and a defender 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.700
 but then I'll have to improvise two 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.740
 two positions and I do not want 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.680
 they said he was one of the leaders of the 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.210
 It 's a boy, it's good that we do not 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.520
 had seen the question of playing 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.260
 had seen Vanderlei play in the 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.350
 Boy it's good to see Minas Gerais football. 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.050
 good so good it with him that the most 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.720
 old will hold the old vanderlei 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.520
 called the girl said you will play the 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.040
 brazil cup final 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.840
 and then use good older staff 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.270
 got pissed off in the concentration 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.220
 but will debut in the crowded mine and 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.640
 Can you be a champion of the Brazil Cup and such? 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.800
 and such and such but who suddenly define 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.200
 a certain doubt that vanderlei had 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.550
 was a touch of nx zero proposes that the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.130
 People are going to hold the wave. 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.210
 I was in the mining area. 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:48.240
 diaper né 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.400
 but there will already be 20 until the day of the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.320
 Game, how's this love story? 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.350
 we come in we are in the 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.170
 hose lecture enters a small package 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.660
 for each player and delivered two 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.820
 history programs and was a 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.270
 fine and one of gladstone not thin 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.970
 another manchin the sister was the uprising and 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.940
 everybody open the little packs 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.290
 we opened and those tracks that the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.090
 sellers before the decisions and all 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.350
 world was the right track great with 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.060
 gladson the photos we used the track there was the 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.440
 big story dream now you open it 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.470
 the larger package 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.600
 stone was the last was a scam 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:34.650
 the winning goal was one 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:39.500
 diaper in a hand and the track there the vanderlei 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.500
 said so now you choose 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:47.290
 if you shit top you get the aristizabal champion 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.090
 picked up the band's diaper threw on the wall 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.860
 so the boy was born to be 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.229
 because neither the track nor the pressure 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.229
 It turned out to be a million for sure.
