00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
actually came up with about seven

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.690 
actually came up with about seven
different<00:00:51.440> drugstore<00:00:52.440> alternatives<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
different drugstore alternatives and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.600 
different drugstore alternatives and
they<00:00:54.120> are<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.100> about<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> same

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
they are basically all about the same
exact<00:00:57.090> shade<00:00:57.780> as<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.590> Mac<00:00:59.040> lip<00:00:59.340> liner<00:00:59.610> in

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.299 
exact shade as the Mac lip liner in
stores<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.660> decided<00:01:01.170> why<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.680> fill<00:01:02.219> my

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
stores so I decided why not fill my

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.910 
stores so I decided why not fill my
video<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.940> knew<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.540> there<00:01:03.840> are<00:01:04.110> some<00:01:04.649> out

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there on YouTube already but it seems

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.940 
there on YouTube already but it seems
like<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.030> some<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:10.140> pile<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.680 
like I have some in my little pile that
I've<00:01:11.250> never<00:01:11.490> seen<00:01:11.880> anybody<00:01:12.180> talk<00:01:12.659> about
