00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.750 

let's<00:03:26.290> first<00:03:26.500> talk<00:03:26.620> about<00:03:26.680> managing<00:03:27.430> cheaper

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
let's first talk about managing cheaper

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.970 
let's first talk about managing cheaper
when<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.030> run<00:03:28.180> low<00:03:28.300> on<00:03:28.330> energy<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> cheaper

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
when you run low on energy so cheaper

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.500 
when you run low on energy so cheaper
can<00:03:30.190> be<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> good<00:03:30.520> cool<00:03:30.700> down<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.030> use<00:03:31.210> when<00:03:31.450> you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
can be a good cool down to use when you

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.090 
can be a good cool down to use when you
run<00:03:31.630> low<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.780> energy<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.440> gain<00:03:32.620> those<00:03:32.770> extra

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100
