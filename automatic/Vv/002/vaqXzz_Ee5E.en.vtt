00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.769 
want Peter doesn't want to be apart from
her<00:01:34.289> so<00:01:34.829> that's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.279> deep<00:01:35.729> inner<00:01:36.119> conflict<00:01:36.689> that

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
her so that's a deep inner conflict that

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:39.260 
her so that's a deep inner conflict that
he<00:01:36.929> has<00:01:37.139> to<00:01:37.349> navigate<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.249> it's<00:01:38.520> painful<00:01:39.090> and

he has to navigate and it's painful and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.899 
he has to navigate and it's painful and
it<00:01:39.569> creates<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.020> very<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.590> think<00:01:40.829> real<00:01:41.279> dynamic

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it creates a very I think real dynamic

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.580 
it creates a very I think real dynamic
between<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> two<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.659> them<00:01:42.749> and<00:01:42.959> the<00:01:43.289> question

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
between the two of them and the question

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
between the two of them and the question
becomes<00:01:43.889> whether<00:01:44.219> or<00:01:44.459> not<00:01:44.609> they<00:01:44.969> can<00:01:45.029> share<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
becomes whether or not they can share a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.779 
becomes whether or not they can share a
path<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.380> whether<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.859> path<00:01:47.069> is<00:01:47.249> gonna<00:01:47.459> take

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
path or whether that path is gonna take
