00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.480
 today we will talk about technology 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.630
 there is no future this material no no 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.180
 burns recent from it does not form 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.739
 cracks it neither splits 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.889
 according to the experts has 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.189
 frost is 300 thousand cycles 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.169
 but in a block plant 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.609
 from the field styrene concrete 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.480
 This is the first plant on which was 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.100
 established experimental 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.949
 equipment 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.780
 enterprise 15 years 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.590
 and on it on the country with the subsequent 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.730
 producing more ordinary labor 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.720
 that is not his fault is dirty and not very 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.670
 noisy 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150
 under the roof of the workshop, a place for nests was chosen 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.240
 swallows about a dozen as they say 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.630
 no comment 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.860
 gene chief 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.990
 also such a policy is the body of the dead or heat and 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.010
 new species dictated 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.360
 consisting of exactly polystyrene ps granules 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.770
 and german basalt fiber special 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 supplements ivan day 10 more starts for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.559
 three years a little 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.580
 this script 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.389
 then 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:03.629
 the machine is called sphere um 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.760
 infrastructures evaluation series 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.600
 for example polystyrene is such that she has 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 large amount of air 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.080
 and crystal lattice 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.200
 lends this issue a move by 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 of this 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.120
 material address reduction 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.650
 the percentage of offerings in hectares is reached 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.120
 most of the track 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.220
 technology was developed 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.570
 Engineer and now General 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 director of scientific production 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.720
 slaughterhouse enterprises Borisov 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.460
 Alekseevich Puzanov 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.640
 it is patented in russia and abroad 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.750
 in the preparation of a mixture of basalt fiber 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 under pressure 5 atmospheres evenly 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.420
 distributed worldwide 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.909
 and it turns out reinforced searches 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.560
 robby tons 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.549
 in the equipment was given remarkable but on 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.850
 really 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.140
 on these several billion 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 and if we assume that these 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.670
 billions 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.290
 recorded by the public 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.930
 finished products it turned out that 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.020
 design 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.060
 on Monday 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.530
 now family 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 the fact is that we can for many decades 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.840
 fine 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.079
 but really needs 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.809
 evenly distribute 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.849
 heat forming windows 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 believers are fatherly months 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.639
 in decision 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 it's all over 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.590
 it must be emphasized that all 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.249
 components make up aquavit Russian 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.010
 it is strong and durable material 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.909
 at the conclusion of the Federal Service for Supervision 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.719
 environmental characteristics he 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.619
 compares with a tree 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:38.909
 but it's great warm and 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.539
 sound insulation properties of high 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.600
 degree of fire safety 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.840
 we have a certification protocol 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.269
 test center for that metalworker 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.659
 actual fire resistance limit 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.400
 constructions and lateral shaped 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.559
 polystyrene concrete is at least 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.949
 one hundred eighty four minutes 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.309
 after three hours of testing the match 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.379
 have been discontinued experimental 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.889
 designs only collapsed 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.079
 plaster 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.449
 in the face of close 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.249
 actually conducted similar 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 there will be no attempt 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.089
 tests will be solved now water 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:26.419
 I wonder what both pictures are tons of block 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:28.369
 which lies below the experimental 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.090
 absorbs the whole head 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.450
 and the assembly of polystyrene concrete 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.619
 just let go of the edges 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:35.549
 built on the walls of this technology 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.739
 it is possible to mount items large 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.699
 masses on the usual death and samarium see 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:42.489
 according to the test results show 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.599
 with a diameter of 4 millimeters in length 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.939
 40 millimeters withstood the load 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.099
 eighty eight kilos 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.559
 the characteristics of this material are 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.649
 so they allow 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.379
 all these letters for the next year delay 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.759
 him 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.249
 Sunday 70 cases 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:02.239
 letting 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.890
 and before serving new 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.580
 energy saving standards 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.829
 energy efficiency 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:07.969
 thus achieved 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.969
 indicator in 4 all all all all thousand 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:12.669
 this is a very high figure 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.469
 heat saving 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:15.729
 as well as resistance 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.209
 sales structure which 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.659
 dropped out of this material even very 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:19.650
 high 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.979
 introduced sections 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.979
 if yes that is, if the press machine for 15 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.589
 seconds does one year seal it with 

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:28.559
 all sides because what is the concept like 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:30.180
 transmits ia rosbalt 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.199
 spray 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.509
 here in the Caucasus 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.009
 100 schools 100 hospitals 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.419
 12 hours shop conditions then product 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.730
 to throw out 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.650
 where in three days they gain 70 percent 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.510
 strength 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.920
 and another 30 during the week made 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.090
 from the heat pipe music the basis of the new 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.560
 construction technology 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.900
 fuser system 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.930
 house building 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.699
 developed by us she suggests 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.510
 running heat 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.569
 after prizes 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.009
 all items for 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.729
 bringing to mind 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.960
 block column which is paired with monthly 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.630
 building elements as well as wall 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.919
 partitioning blocks blog corner blocks and 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.460
 the overlaps before us the Egyptians whose 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.590
 know what any and on development 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.590
 for regions 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.330
 seven to nine points any country can 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.080
 reach required volumes 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.340
 the value of the flesh couple energy saving for 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.360
 score 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.939
 in warming with these first panels of ours 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.529
 so we build 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:32.559
 the wall installation process is simple and efficient 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.039
 butko is set friend 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.999
 on the other in four rows in the post are filled 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.749
 reinforcement and concrete as a result inside 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.359
 warm family is obtained 

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:43.299
 monolithic reinforced concrete 

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:45.969
 lattice with powerful vertical 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.469
 carrier pillars and horizontal 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:49.740
 jumpers 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.569
 the lock on the block of the recess groove excludes 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.150
 blowing through macro porous 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.590
 the structure of the material wall is more a 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.860
 the premises creates a comfortable 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.819
 microclimate 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.990
 such designs has enhanced 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.409
 having traveled with a plaster composition which makes it easier 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.090
 finishing process row a first time 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.570
 all this stuff went for three days 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.599
 church 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.810
 by 40 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.810
 five people I'll tell you that she is much 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.960
 easier not much faster 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.360
 summarize 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.000
 when building on turbo boost technology you 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.789
 save three times first on the erection 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.669
 foundation wall with heat pipes in private 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.060
 house on this technology can 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.280
 do without applying 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.080
 expensive technique second when 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.979
 construction of supporting structures 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.490
 with less wall thickness does not produce 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.650
 require additional 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.620
 insulation 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.270
 there is already well kept 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.780
 Decoration Materials 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.470
 and finally the cost of heating such a house 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.330
 2 3 times less 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.379
 We hope our tour you 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.039
 liked
