00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
as well make it functional but this is

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.359 
as well make it functional but this is
it<00:02:01.869> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> slip<00:02:02.259> out<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.530> your<00:02:02.560> hands<00:02:03.009> not

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
spring about locking mechanism now if I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.250 
spring about locking mechanism now if I
move<00:02:47.560> my<00:02:47.739> wrist<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.489> can<00:02:48.820> swing<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.120> out<00:02:49.390> but

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
move my wrist I can swing it out but

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.720 
move my wrist I can swing it out but
that's<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.560> something<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.950> keep<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.250> mind<00:02:51.310> if

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that's just something to keep in mind if

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.789 
that's just something to keep in mind if
you<00:02:51.820> have<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.120> use<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.900> high<00:02:53.530> dress

you have to use this in a high dress
situation<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:56.049> think<00:02:56.890> if<00:02:57.040> they<00:02:57.190> would<00:02:57.370> have<00:02:57.400> put

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
situation I think if they would have put

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.640 
situation I think if they would have put
the<00:02:57.820> thumb<00:02:58.480> play<00:02:58.690> on<00:02:58.870> hill<00:02:59.079> it<00:02:59.440> would<00:02:59.530> have

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
the thumb play on hill it would have

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.259 
the thumb play on hill it would have
made<00:02:59.739> it<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.190> much<00:03:00.220> battle<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:03.120> you'll<00:03:04.120> be

coastal ak-47 review this this lock with
coupled<00:03:57.040> with<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.400> thumb<00:03:57.970> plate<00:03:58.269> makes<00:03:59.080> it

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
coupled with the thumb plate makes it

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.580 
coupled with the thumb plate makes it
very<00:03:59.379> easy<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.920> open<00:04:00.160> up<00:04:00.780> even<00:04:01.780> press<00:04:02.319> down<00:04:02.560> on

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
very easy to open up even press down on

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.000 
very easy to open up even press down on
the<00:04:02.769> lock<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.370> sling<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:03.670> open<00:04:04.150> and<00:04:04.980> swing<00:04:05.980> it

the lock and sling it open and swing it

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:13.559 
the lock and sling it open and swing it
close<00:04:09.060> but<00:04:10.800> and<00:04:11.800> they<00:04:12.519> supposedly<00:04:13.060> hold<00:04:13.450> the

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
close but and they supposedly hold the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.259 
close but and they supposedly hold the
same<00:04:13.810> amount<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.260> weight<00:04:14.470> I<00:04:15.030> possibly<00:04:16.030> like

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
same amount of weight I possibly like

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.539 
same amount of weight I possibly like
the<00:04:16.450> old<00:04:16.780> locking<00:04:17.229> mechanism<00:04:17.769> battle<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:19.060> but

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the old locking mechanism battle and but

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.800 
the old locking mechanism battle and but
supposedly<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.820> new<00:04:21.970> triad<00:04:22.389> lock<00:04:22.630> is

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
supposedly the new triad lock is

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.590 
supposedly the new triad lock is
stronger<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.500> our<00:04:24.040> last<00:04:24.250> longueuil<00:04:24.760> we'll<00:04:25.330> see

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
stronger in our last longueuil we'll see

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.080 
stronger in our last longueuil we'll see
how<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:25.780> goes<00:04:25.930> with<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.380> test<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.830> time<00:04:26.970> I'm<00:04:27.970> a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
how it goes with the test of time I'm a

review<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.290> said<00:04:32.850> it's<00:04:33.850> very<00:04:34.210> similar<00:04:34.720> to

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
review like I said it's very similar to

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.860 
review like I said it's very similar to
the<00:04:35.139> old<00:04:35.970> ak-47<00:04:36.970> except<00:04:37.300> for<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.479> locking

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
the old ak-47 except for the locking

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.659 
the old ak-47 except for the locking
mechanism<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:39.840> thumb<00:04:40.840> stud<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.669> the

mechanism and the thumb stud and the

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.320 
mechanism and the thumb stud and the
shape<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.090> handle<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:45.120> they're<00:04:46.120> both

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
shape of the handle and they're both

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.530 
shape of the handle and they're both
very<00:04:46.720> comfortable<00:04:47.320> in<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.530> hand<00:04:48.060> but<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.090> can

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
very comfortable in the hand but I can

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.629 
very comfortable in the hand but I can
tell<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:49.870> that<00:04:50.200> I'm<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.590> lot<00:04:50.889> more<00:04:50.950> confident

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.090 
that this one that your fingers won't
slip<00:04:55.210> up<00:04:55.450> on<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.050> blade<00:04:56.260> with<00:04:56.530> this<00:04:56.710> one<00:04:56.950> that

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
slip up on the blade with this one that

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.950 
slip up on the blade with this one that
I<00:04:57.190> am<00:04:57.310> with<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.550> older<00:04:57.850> one<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.240> still<00:04:58.479> love<00:04:58.720> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
old style of recon one but this one is

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.190 
old style of recon one but this one is
definitely<00:05:03.639> a<00:05:04.000> lot<00:05:04.360> better<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.900> organ

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200
