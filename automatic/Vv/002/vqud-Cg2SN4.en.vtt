00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.319

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.109
 the old woman and the bet 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.910
 an old lady was one day at the bank of scotia carrying a bag full of 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:30.630
 money 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.350
 insisted that he wanted to talk to the president of the bank to open a 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.070
 savings account because 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.450
 its a lot of money 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.780
 After much arguing, the client was brought before the bank president 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 he is always right 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 the president of the bank asked him how much he wanted to enter 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.510
 she said 165 thousand pounds and beat her bag on the table 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 the president was naturally curious to know where he had 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.150
 she took out so much money and asks her if I am surprised that she carries so much money 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.380
 where did he get it from 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.010
 the old context I make bets 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 bets 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020
 asked the president 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 what kind of bet 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.870
 the old lady answers good for example has put you 25 thousand 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.330
 pounds to which your balls are square 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 the president let out a laugh and said that's a stupid bet 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.260
 you can never win with a bet of this type 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.160
 the old challenge 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.190
 well you would be willing to accept my bet of course 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.020
 answered the president 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.440
 I bet 25 thousand pounds that my balls are not square 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.900
 the old woman said in agreement 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.820
 but since there is a lot of money at stake 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.070
 I can come tomorrow at 10 o'clock with my lawyer to act as a witness 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.010
 Of course 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.300
 the president replied confidently 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.480
 that night the president was very nervous about the set and it happened long 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.320
 time looking at his balls in the mirror turning from side to side 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.910
 and again 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.710
 He had a rigorous examination and was absolutely convinced that his 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.830
 balls were not square and I would win the bet 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.200
 the next morning 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.420
 At ten o'clock 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.629
 the old woman appeared with her lawyer in the president's office 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.899
 made the appropriate presentations and repeated the bet 25 thousand pounds to that 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.509
 the president's balls are square 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.099
 the president accepted the bet again and the old woman asked him to 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.169
 lower your pants so everyone could see 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.979
 the director took them 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.009
 the old woman came over and looked at her balls carefully and asked if 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.829
 I could touch them 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.189
 in agreement the president said 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.699
 25 thousand pounds is a lot of money and I understand that I want to be absolutely 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.519
 safe 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.840
 then he realized that the lawyer was hitting his head against the 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.539
 wall 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.619
 the president asked the old woman what happens to her lawyer 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:53.619
 she answered nothing just that I bet with the 100 thousand pounds that today 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.599
 At 10 I would have the balls of the president of the Bank of Scotland in my 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.809
 hands
