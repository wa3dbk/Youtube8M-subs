my fingers at the crown of my head and
pushing<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.560> forward<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:38.159> we<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.519> this

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
pushing it forward so we get all this

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.800 
pushing it forward so we get all this
volume<00:02:40.379> on<00:02:40.799> top<00:02:41.189> and<00:02:41.579> then<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.599> want<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
