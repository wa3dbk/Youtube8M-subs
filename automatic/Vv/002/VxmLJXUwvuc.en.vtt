00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.110 

I<00:00:48.890> practice<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.100> call<00:00:50.310> evolutionary

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
I practice what I call evolutionary

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
I practice what I call evolutionary
architecture<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.310> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
architecture you don't have all the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.210 
architecture you don't have all the
ideas<00:00:53.970> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.270> beginning<00:00:54.630> but<00:00:55.350> they<00:00:55.530> come<00:00:55.830> as

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
ideas in the beginning but they come as

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.750 
ideas in the beginning but they come as
as<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.970> go<00:00:57.630> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.110> process<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:59.160> buildings

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
as you go into the process of buildings

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.990 
as you go into the process of buildings
up<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.110> grandparents<00:01:01.970> homestead<00:01:02.970> of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
up when my grandparents homestead of

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.469 
up when my grandparents homestead of
this<00:01:03.360> land<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:05.250> old-growth<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.330> with

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this land the old-growth which is with

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.590 
this land the old-growth which is with
these<00:01:06.690> big<00:01:07.020> huge<00:01:07.320> stumps<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.460> about<00:01:08.850> here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
these big huge stumps are all about here

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.859 
these big huge stumps are all about here
I've<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.890> been<00:01:11.070> logged<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:12.690> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I've just been logged so it was the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.960 
I've just been logged so it was the
first<00:01:13.140> time<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.710> virgin<00:01:14.130> forest<00:01:14.160> was<00:01:14.880> cut

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
first time the virgin forest was cut

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.960 
first time the virgin forest was cut
here<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.920> so<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> had<00:01:17.160> this<00:01:17.340> idea<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:18.119> just

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
here and so I had this idea of just

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
here and so I had this idea of just
building<00:01:20.970> little<00:01:21.149> houses<00:01:21.390> on<00:01:21.810> top<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.350> them

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
building little houses on top of them

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.460 
building little houses on top of them
and<00:01:22.860> find<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:24.060> mushroom<00:01:24.750> analysis<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and find a little mushroom analysis you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.090 
and find a little mushroom analysis you
know<00:01:26.300> that's<00:01:27.300> exactly<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> did

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.690 

living<00:01:32.100> roofs

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
living roofs

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.670 
living roofs
make<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> sense<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.289> know<00:01:34.410> they're<00:01:34.590> not

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
make a lot of sense you know they're not

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
make a lot of sense you know they're not
just<00:01:34.740> beautiful<00:01:35.550> they're<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:35.910> practical

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
just beautiful they're very practical

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.639 
just beautiful they're very practical
because<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.600> never<00:01:36.750> wear<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.050> there<00:01:37.500> always

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
because they never wear out there always

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.930 
because they never wear out there always
