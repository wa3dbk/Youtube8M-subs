00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:15.670
 then here are the 458 special on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.990
 test circuit of fiorano 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.990
 we put ourselves on the straight 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.220
 unload 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.650
 all the engine power 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.650
 and all the gears up to the sixth 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:41.860
 powerful braking combined with 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.860
 changed just a site in climbing 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.870
 the fast lines of this chicane are 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.290
 possible thanks to the low weight and the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.290
 grip and michelin pilot sport cup 2 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.470
 here in this braking curve it is 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:05.550
 been possible thanks to the maximum 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.430
 integration of abs and electrons e 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.800
 difference here we come in one 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.310
 next curve where the oversteer 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.310
 out 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.719
 you have been granted because you have been 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.729
 recognized by the site slip 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.259
 I read the intrage check I met 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 traditional in the same curve there 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.770
 instead he would have cut by penalizing the 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.390
 performance output 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.310
 after the hairpin we come to the curve 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.960
 fast where the rear extractor is 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 position in the maximum position 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 load afforded 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.610
 to travel the maximum speed la 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 steering precision on the 458 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.380
 special gives us the feeling of control 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.710
 also to ideas in all others 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.710
 conditions 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.980
 and again on the straight she changed it 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:04.320
 with the new strategy of change 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:06.180
 fast characterizes the car and renders 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.870
 a response to the shift command 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.870
 immediate
