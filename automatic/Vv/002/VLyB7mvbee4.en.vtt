00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it's a it's a three-dimensional Mouse so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's a it's a three-dimensional Mouse so
basically<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> do<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:27.269> can<00:00:29.720> okay

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but basically the three-dimensional

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
but basically the three-dimensional
mouse<00:00:33.660> will<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> ahead<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.100> can

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
they have even a little blender tutorial
here<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.520> whatever<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.360> can<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.600> there's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
like a come a tower at the top of the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.770 
like a come a tower at the top of the
mouse<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.140> move<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> around<00:00:46.610> the

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
mouse and as you move it around the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.029 
mouse and as you move it around the
three<00:00:48.780> dimensions<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> move<00:00:49.829> through

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
three dimensions as you move through

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
three dimensions as you move through
dimensional<00:00:50.430> Mouse<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:51.030> viewport<00:00:51.480> will

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
dimensional Mouse your viewport will

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.590 
dimensional Mouse your viewport will
move<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.949> real<00:00:53.129> time<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.239> example<00:00:54.539> right

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
move in real time so for example right

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.160 
move in real time so for example right
now<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.410> touching<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.739> mouse<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.730> just

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
now I'm not touching the mouse I'm just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.990 
now I'm not touching the mouse I'm just
manipulating<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.980> 3d<00:00:59.340> Mouse<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> I'm

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
manipulating this this 3d Mouse and I'm

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
manipulating this this 3d Mouse and I'm
able<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.600> cruise<00:01:00.809> through<00:01:01.079> my<00:01:01.199> scene

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
able to kind of cruise through my scene

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
able to kind of cruise through my scene
what's<00:01:02.219> nice<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.000> still<00:01:03.239> use

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
what's nice is that you can still use

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.359 
what's nice is that you can still use
the<00:01:03.570> mouse<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.769> example<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.280> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the mouse so for example if you're in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
the mouse so for example if you're in
edit<00:01:05.519> mode<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.030> could<00:01:06.180> select<00:01:06.510> some<00:01:06.810> pieces

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
edit mode you could select some pieces

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.030 
edit mode you could select some pieces
you<00:01:08.040> could<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.369> your<00:01:08.549> 3d<00:01:08.939> mouse<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.390> move<00:01:09.689> your

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
you could use your 3d mouse to move your

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
you could use your 3d mouse to move your
viewport<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:12.060> still<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.420> your<00:01:12.450> mouse

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
viewport and you still have your mouse

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.730 
viewport and you still have your mouse
hand<00:01:13.020> free<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.549> editing<00:01:14.700> okay<00:01:15.740> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
hand free to do your editing okay it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
hand free to do your editing okay it
takes<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.909> bit<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.119> getting<00:01:18.240> used<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
takes a bit of getting used to but the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.690

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the the 10 beta 4 and because here is

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.789 
the the 10 beta 4 and because here is
the<00:01:44.579> URL<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
the URL for it

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
the URL for it
here<00:01:47.180> because<00:01:48.180> YouTube<00:01:48.659> won't<00:01:48.869> let<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.140> put

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
here because YouTube won't let me put

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
here because YouTube won't let me put
the<00:01:49.500> URL<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> show<00:01:50.729> notes<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.090> don't

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the URL and in the show notes I don't

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.690 
the URL and in the show notes I don't
think<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> could<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> search

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
think so or you could just do a search

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.929 
think so or you could just do a search
for<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.079> they'll<00:01:55.770> bring<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.310> you

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
for this and they'll bring you here you

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.429 
for this and they'll bring you here you
just<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.240> ahead<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> download<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.899> after

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
just go ahead and download it after

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.389 
just go ahead and download it after
you've<00:01:58.560> done<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.860> everything<00:01:59.130> should<00:01:59.340> be

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
you've done that everything should be

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
you've done that everything should be
fine<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.320> you're<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> windows

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
fine if you're if you're on the windows

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.490 
fine if you're if you're on the windows
I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.250> it'll<00:02:02.369> work<00:02:02.460> ok<00:02:02.909> anyway<00:02:03.420> once<00:02:04.350> you've

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
I think it'll work ok anyway once you've

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.499 
I think it'll work ok anyway once you've
done<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.009> em<00:02:05.310> down<00:02:06.090> into<00:02:06.329> your

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
done that you go em down into your

can setup you can choose any application
that<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.870> want<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.290> use<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.590> like

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that you want to use it with like

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
that you want to use it with like
Photoshop<00:02:14.270> or<00:02:14.450> something<00:02:14.630> or<00:02:15.200> 3d<00:02:15.650> code<00:02:15.860> or

Photoshop or something or 3d code or

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.280 
Photoshop or something or 3d code or
whatever<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.780> then<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:18.020> choose<00:02:18.260> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
whatever and then you can choose that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.700 
whatever and then you can choose that
and<00:02:18.680> go<00:02:19.280> ahead<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.730> set<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.240> what<00:02:20.450> each<00:02:21.140> axis

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
and go ahead and set up what each axis

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.100 
and go ahead and set up what each axis
does<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:23.000> sensitivity<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:23.780> everything

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
does and the sensitivity and everything

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
does and the sensitivity and everything
in<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.130> oops<00:02:25.550> as<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.180> can<00:02:26.300> see<00:02:26.510> I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
in that and so oops as you can see I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.740 
in that and so oops as you can see I
must<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.200> already<00:02:27.940> done<00:02:28.940> something<00:02:29.390> there

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.730 

okay<00:02:36.520> already<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:38.210> that's<00:02:39.050> one<00:02:39.320> thing<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.590> be

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
okay already so that's one thing to be

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.680 
okay already so that's one thing to be
aware<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.980> if<00:02:40.700> you<00:02:40.880> were<00:02:40.970> using<00:02:41.150> for<00:02:41.360> example<00:02:41.480> a

for example right now we're in View mode
and<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.860> could<00:03:07.040> set<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.430> current<00:03:07.730> item<00:03:07.970> so

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
and you could set to current item so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.180 
and you could set to current item so
that<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.720> actually<00:03:08.870> move<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.890> current

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
that you can actually move the current

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
item with the 3d mouse and once you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.690 
item with the 3d mouse and once you
start<00:03:12.410> using<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.670> gets<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.300> be<00:03:14.420> pretty

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
start using it it gets to be pretty

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.800 
start using it it gets to be pretty
pretty<00:03:16.700> user-friendly<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.390> whatever<00:03:17.660> it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
pretty user-friendly or whatever it's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.340 
pretty user-friendly or whatever it's
it's<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.230> bit<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.590> a<00:03:19.630> it's<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.720> bit<00:03:20.900> strange<00:03:21.140> at

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
it's a bit of a it's a bit strange at

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.720 
it's a bit of a it's a bit strange at
first<00:03:21.380> because<00:03:21.920> you<00:03:22.040> have<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.250> kind<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.459> learn

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
first because you have to kind of learn

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.440 
first because you have to kind of learn
some<00:03:23.000> new<00:03:23.030> muscle<00:03:23.480> memory<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:25.700> it's<00:03:26.209> nice

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
some new muscle memory but it it's nice

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.730 
some new muscle memory but it it's nice
because<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.810> frees<00:03:26.990> up<00:03:27.020> your<00:03:27.230> other<00:03:27.320> hand<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
because it frees up your other hand to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.150 
because it frees up your other hand to
do<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.790> know<00:03:28.850> object<00:03:29.300> manipulation<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:30.160> you

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
do you know object manipulation and you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.710 
do you know object manipulation and you
can<00:03:31.280> just<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.610> pretty<00:03:31.880> much<00:03:31.970> use<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.510> as<00:03:32.690> a

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
can just I pretty much use it just as a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.100 
can just I pretty much use it just as a
viewport<00:03:33.080> tool<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.970> alright<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.300> that's<00:03:35.870> that

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
viewport tool so alright so that's that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.530 
viewport tool so alright so that's that
back<00:03:36.350> to<00:03:36.500> blender<00:03:36.890> here<00:03:37.120> let's<00:03:38.120> take<00:03:38.240> a<00:03:38.300> look

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
back to blender here let's take a look

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.310

at<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> couple<00:03:38.870> of<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> new<00:03:39.410> tools<00:03:39.709> here<00:03:40.190> in

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
at a couple of the new tools here in

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.650 
at a couple of the new tools here in
32.5<00:03:42.320> 9<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:43.550> only<00:03:43.820> like<00:03:44.000> really<00:03:44.300> cool<00:03:44.450> ones

let's go ahead and select this guy here
and<00:03:46.310> then<00:03:46.520> put<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.630> 3d<00:03:47.870> cursor<00:03:49.120> somewhere<00:03:50.120> a

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
and then put the 3d cursor somewhere a

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.640 
and then put the 3d cursor somewhere a
bit<00:03:51.220> put<00:03:52.220> like<00:03:52.459> over<00:03:52.700> isn't<00:03:52.880> off<00:03:53.000> here<00:03:55.959> okay<00:03:56.959> so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
bit put like over isn't off here okay so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.520 
bit put like over isn't off here okay so
basically<00:03:58.280> select<00:03:58.820> an<00:03:59.330> object<00:03:59.600> oops

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
basically select an object oops

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.400 
basically select an object oops
you<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.280> see<00:04:01.400> here<00:04:01.550> I'm<00:04:01.640> still<00:04:01.940> having<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.510> bit

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
you can see here I'm still having a bit

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.130 
you can see here I'm still having a bit
of<00:04:03.500> time<00:04:03.680> getting<00:04:03.980> used<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.400> 3d<00:04:04.880> mouse

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
of time getting used to this 3d mouse

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.979 
of time getting used to this 3d mouse
okay<00:04:06.140> select<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.590> object<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.160> then<00:04:07.989> position

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
okay select the object and then position

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.590 
okay select the object and then position
the<00:04:09.020> 3d<00:04:09.380> cursor<00:04:09.560> where<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:09.980> want<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:11.420> to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
the 3d cursor where you want it to

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.530 
the 3d cursor where you want it to
happen<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.310> there's<00:04:13.310> some<00:04:13.880> new<00:04:14.000> tools<00:04:14.239> here

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
happen but there's some new tools here

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.960 
happen but there's some new tools here
if<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.810> hit<00:04:15.290> shift<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.920> and<00:04:16.220> go<00:04:16.549> into<00:04:16.700> curve

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
if you hit shift a and go into curve

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.510 
if you hit shift a and go into curve
there's<00:04:17.930> two<00:04:18.080> new<00:04:18.200> things<00:04:18.230> there's<00:04:18.770> a<00:04:18.830> die<00:04:19.010> v2

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
there's two new things there's a die v2

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.120 
there's two new things there's a die v2
mesh<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.940> add<00:04:20.120> tree<00:04:20.440> AB<00:04:21.440> tree<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.770> can<00:04:21.890> add<00:04:22.010> by

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
mesh and add tree AB tree you can add by

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.480 
mesh and add tree AB tree you can add by
itself<00:04:22.430> but<00:04:22.880> if<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.450> want<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.660> add<00:04:23.780> IV

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
itself but if you want to add IV

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.010 
itself but if you want to add IV
domestically<00:04:25.490> let's<00:04:26.390> say<00:04:26.479> you're<00:04:26.630> doing<00:04:26.840> like

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
domestically let's say you're doing like

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.310 
domestically let's say you're doing like
a<00:04:27.110> row

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
a row

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.450 
a row
call<00:04:27.590> him<00:04:27.740> or<00:04:27.830> something<00:04:28.100> you<00:04:28.190> want<00:04:28.370> the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
call him or something you want the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.850 
call him or something you want the
ionized<00:04:28.850> IV<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.360> grows<00:04:29.570> over<00:04:29.900> it

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
ionized IV that grows over it

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.890 
ionized IV that grows over it
we<00:04:31.070> should<00:04:31.280> do<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.670> select<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.480> object

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
we should do is select the object

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.270 
we should do is select the object
position<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.380> 3d<00:04:33.500> cursor<00:04:33.800> where<00:04:34.100> you<00:04:34.130> want

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
position the 3d cursor where you want

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.940 
position the 3d cursor where you want
the<00:04:34.400> IV<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.820> start<00:04:35.030> growing<00:04:35.240> out<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:36.050> then

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
the IV to start growing out of and then

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.370 
the IV to start growing out of and then
just<00:04:37.220> hit<00:04:37.310> shift<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:37.780> curve<00:04:38.780> add<00:04:39.170> IV<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.310> mesh

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
just hit shift a curve add IV to mesh

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.380 
just hit shift a curve add IV to mesh
okay<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:43.100> then<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:43.610> can<00:04:43.640> see<00:04:43.940> here

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
okay and then you can see here

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.260 
okay and then you can see here
especially<00:04:45.380> if<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:45.830> Z<00:04:46.070> on<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.880> keyboard<00:04:46.970> you

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
especially if it's Z on the keyboard you

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.480 
especially if it's Z on the keyboard you
can<00:04:47.420> see<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.840> IV<00:04:48.140> has<00:04:48.260> grown<00:04:48.560> from<00:04:49.280> where

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
can see that the IV has grown from where

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.250 
can see that the IV has grown from where
we<00:04:49.640> had<00:04:49.840> originally<00:04:52.270> told<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:53.480> position<00:04:54.200> in

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
we had originally told it position in

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.290 
we had originally told it position in
the<00:04:54.320> 3d<00:04:54.380> cursor<00:04:54.740> and<00:04:55.070> then<00:04:55.610> once<00:04:55.760> we<00:04:55.910> do<00:04:56.090> that

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
the 3d cursor and then once we do that

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.740 
the 3d cursor and then once we do that
there's<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.750> whole<00:04:57.050> new<00:04:57.230> panel<00:04:57.680> here<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.750> IV

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
there's a whole new panel here of IV

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.580 
there's a whole new panel here of IV
editing<00:05:00.230> options<00:05:00.800> now<00:05:01.640> I've<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:02.780> far<00:05:02.810> I've<00:05:03.170> I

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
editing options now I've so far I've I

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.920 
editing options now I've so far I've I
found<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.310> thing<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.670> be<00:05:04.820> extremely<00:05:05.300> touchy

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
found this thing to be extremely touchy

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.110 
found this thing to be extremely touchy
so<00:05:06.920> but<00:05:07.220> basically<00:05:07.550> what<00:05:07.760> you're<00:05:07.880> supposed<00:05:08.090> to

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
so but basically what you're supposed to

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.990 
so but basically what you're supposed to
do<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.390> once<00:05:08.630> you've<00:05:09.070> made<00:05:10.070> some<00:05:10.340> edits<00:05:10.670> to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
do is once you've made some edits to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.060 
do is once you've made some edits to
these<00:05:11.260> options<00:05:12.260> you're<00:05:12.740> supposed<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:12.980> hit

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
these options you're supposed to hit

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.420 
these options you're supposed to hit
update<00:05:13.250> IV<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:13.970> then<00:05:14.750> you<00:05:14.870> can<00:05:15.050> see<00:05:15.260> that<00:05:15.470> the

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
update IV and then you can see that the

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.620 
update IV and then you can see that the
IV<00:05:17.000> will<00:05:17.120> change<00:05:17.680> if<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.860> change<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.910> length

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
IV will change if you change the length

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.440 
IV will change if you change the length
and<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.830> size<00:05:22.040> I've<00:05:22.430> noticed<00:05:22.730> that<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:23.270> will

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
and the size I've noticed that it will

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.850 
and the size I've noticed that it will
tend<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.870> kind<00:05:24.080> of<00:05:24.110> freak<00:05:24.320> out<00:05:24.410> on<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> bit

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
tend to kind of freak out on you a bit

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.700 
tend to kind of freak out on you a bit
but<00:05:25.840> anyway<00:05:26.840> you<00:05:26.900> can<00:05:26.990> go<00:05:27.230> ahead<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.590> just

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
but anyway you can go ahead and just

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.670 
but anyway you can go ahead and just
start<00:05:28.040> changing<00:05:28.430> these<00:05:28.630> Update<00:05:29.630> IV<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.620> you

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
start changing these Update IV so you

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.870 
start changing these Update IV so you
can<00:05:30.860> see<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.280> can<00:05:31.370> get<00:05:31.490> different<00:05:31.670> types

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
can see that you can get different types

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.380 
can see that you can get different types
of<00:05:32.180> IV<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:32.990> then<00:05:33.050> later<00:05:33.290> on<00:05:33.880> you<00:05:34.880> know<00:05:35.000> you<00:05:35.270> can

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
of IV and then later on you know you can

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.560 
of IV and then later on you know you can
go<00:05:35.510> ahead<00:05:35.600> and<00:05:35.720> these<00:05:36.850> leaves<00:05:37.850> here<00:05:38.090> must<00:05:38.510> be

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
go ahead and these leaves here must be

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.470 
go ahead and these leaves here must be
you<00:05:39.350> know<00:05:39.470> textured<00:05:39.950> I<00:05:40.130> think<00:05:41.000> each<00:05:41.120> one<00:05:41.300> comes

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
you know textured I think each one comes

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.000 
you know textured I think each one comes
with<00:05:41.600> its<00:05:41.780> own<00:05:41.840> UV<00:05:42.140> map<00:05:42.350> or<00:05:42.500> whatever<00:05:42.620> but

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
with its own UV map or whatever but

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.130 
with its own UV map or whatever but
that's<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.030> basics<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.450> it<00:05:44.510> so<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.780> can<00:05:44.960> start

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
that's the basics of it so you can start

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.990 
that's the basics of it so you can start
growing<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.560> onto<00:05:45.890> buildings<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.490> whatnot

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
growing that onto buildings and whatnot

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.480 
growing that onto buildings and whatnot
and<00:05:47.470> it's<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.590> good<00:05:48.740> starting<00:05:48.980> off<00:05:49.130> point<00:05:49.340> you

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
and it's a good starting off point you

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.120 
and it's a good starting off point you
can<00:05:49.610> see<00:05:49.790> here<00:05:50.030> that<00:05:50.770> kind<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.800> creates<00:05:52.070> these

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
can see here that kind of creates these

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.120 
can see here that kind of creates these
like<00:05:52.340> tendrils<00:05:52.760> for<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.950> you<00:05:54.950> can<00:05:55.040> go

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
like tendrils for you and you can go

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.860 
like tendrils for you and you can go
ahead<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:55.430> start<00:05:55.610> editing<00:05:55.760> those<00:05:56.180> I<00:05:56.480> guess

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
ahead and start editing those I guess

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.560 
ahead and start editing those I guess
you<00:05:56.960> could<00:05:57.520> tab<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.790> you<00:05:59.060> can<00:05:59.210> start<00:05:59.450> editing

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
you could tab and you can start editing

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.490 
you could tab and you can start editing
these<00:05:59.930> if<00:06:00.890> you<00:06:01.250> want<00:06:01.430> to<00:06:01.580> manually<00:06:01.910> I<00:06:02.060> guess

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
these if you want to manually I guess

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.710 
these if you want to manually I guess
okay<00:06:03.500> that's<00:06:04.490> that<00:06:05.920> you<00:06:06.920> okay<00:06:07.910> the<00:06:08.330> other<00:06:08.450> one

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
okay that's that you okay the other one

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.930 
okay that's that you okay the other one
is<00:06:08.990> you<00:06:09.710> can<00:06:09.830> just<00:06:09.950> use<00:06:10.160> this<00:06:10.310> tool<00:06:10.760> by<00:06:10.910> itself

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
is you can just use this tool by itself

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.000 
is you can just use this tool by itself
just<00:06:11.540> hit<00:06:11.660> shift<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:12.050> curve<00:06:12.770> add<00:06:13.180> tree<00:06:14.380> okay<00:06:15.380> so

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
just hit shift a curve add tree okay so

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.700 
just hit shift a curve add tree okay so
now<00:06:16.190> we<00:06:16.610> have<00:06:16.640> a<00:06:16.820> tree<00:06:17.360> in<00:06:17.390> the<00:06:17.600> scene<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.110> what

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
now we have a tree in the scene and what

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.340 
now we have a tree in the scene and what
this<00:06:18.830> does<00:06:19.070> is<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:20.270> programmatically<00:06:20.990> creates

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
this does is it programmatically creates

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.180 
this does is it programmatically creates
a<00:06:21.440> tree<00:06:21.680> for<00:06:21.920> you<00:06:22.600> so<00:06:23.600> again<00:06:24.410> you<00:06:24.800> know<00:06:24.890> there's

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
a tree for you so again you know there's

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.440 
a tree for you so again you know there's
a<00:06:25.250> million<00:06:25.460> different<00:06:25.610> options<00:06:26.090> for<00:06:26.330> this

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
a million different options for this

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.330 
a million different options for this
tree<00:06:26.810> but<00:06:27.470> let's<00:06:27.740> go<00:06:27.890> over<00:06:27.920> some<00:06:28.190> of<00:06:28.220> the

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
tree but let's go over some of the

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.890 
tree but let's go over some of the
basics<00:06:28.760> if<00:06:28.910> you<00:06:29.000> hit<00:06:29.120> bevel<00:06:29.510> under<00:06:29.750> geometry

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 
basics if you hit bevel under geometry

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.810 
basics if you hit bevel under geometry
then<00:06:30.680> you<00:06:30.800> can<00:06:30.950> see<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.310> actual<00:06:31.610> tree

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
then you can see the actual tree

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.600 
then you can see the actual tree
branches<00:06:32.410> alright<00:06:33.410> and<00:06:33.590> then<00:06:34.220> you<00:06:34.340> can<00:06:34.490> go

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
branches alright and then you can go

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.770 
branches alright and then you can go
ahead<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:34.850> mess<00:06:34.970> with<00:06:35.090> that<00:06:35.240> until<00:06:35.570> you're

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 
ahead and mess with that until you're

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.150 
ahead and mess with that until you're
fine<00:06:36.740> with<00:06:36.950> it

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
fine with it

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.010 
fine with it
of<00:06:37.910> course<00:06:38.240> the<00:06:38.570> other<00:06:38.690> thing<00:06:38.750> you'll<00:06:38.990> want

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
of course the other thing you'll want

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.510 
of course the other thing you'll want
probably<00:06:39.680> is<00:06:39.860> you'll<00:06:40.250> want

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
probably is you'll want

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.180 
probably is you'll want
to<00:06:40.669> show<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.180> leaves<00:06:41.440> it<00:06:42.440> show<00:06:42.680> leaves<00:06:42.919> the

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
to show the leaves it show leaves the

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.430 
to show the leaves it show leaves the
leaves<00:06:43.340> will<00:06:43.520> come<00:06:43.550> up<00:06:44.080> the<00:06:45.080> other<00:06:45.199> nice<00:06:45.410> thing

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
leaves will come up the other nice thing

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.170 
leaves will come up the other nice thing
I<00:06:45.949> found<00:06:46.129> out<00:06:46.280> is<00:06:46.340> that<00:06:46.460> and<00:06:46.789> of<00:06:46.940> course<00:06:47.000> you

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180 
I found out is that and of course you

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.850 
I found out is that and of course you
can<00:06:47.389> just<00:06:47.569> keep<00:06:47.720> messing<00:06:48.169> with<00:06:48.349> these<00:06:48.530> until

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
can just keep messing with these until

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.619 
can just keep messing with these until
you<00:06:48.919> get<00:06:49.039> it<00:06:49.159> the<00:06:49.250> way<00:06:49.340> you<00:06:49.370> want<00:06:49.610> the<00:06:50.330> final

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:50.629 
you get it the way you want the final

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:52.540 
you get it the way you want the final
thing<00:06:50.810> that<00:06:51.080> I<00:06:51.289> found<00:06:51.500> that<00:06:51.650> is<00:06:51.830> nice<00:06:52.039> is<00:06:52.310> um

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
thing that I found that is nice is um

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.510 
thing that I found that is nice is um
you<00:06:52.940> can<00:06:53.090> you<00:06:53.240> if<00:06:53.810> you<00:06:53.840> use<00:06:54.289> armature<00:06:54.800> you'll

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
you can you if you use armature you'll

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.899 
you can you if you use armature you'll
see<00:06:55.669> an<00:06:55.789> armature<00:06:56.300> has<00:06:56.449> been<00:06:56.629> created<00:06:57.020> and

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
see an armature has been created and

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.719 
see an armature has been created and
then<00:06:58.909> if<00:06:59.090> we<00:06:59.270> go<00:07:00.139> into<00:07:00.379> our<00:07:00.530> armature<00:07:01.009> tab<00:07:01.370> and

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
then if we go into our armature tab and

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:02.920 
then if we go into our armature tab and
hit<00:07:01.849> x-ray<00:07:02.300> you'll<00:07:02.419> be<00:07:02.509> able<00:07:02.569> to<00:07:02.720> see<00:07:02.840> it

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
hit x-ray you'll be able to see it

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.589 
hit x-ray you'll be able to see it
easier<00:07:05.590> okay<00:07:06.849> so<00:07:07.849> now<00:07:07.970> I<00:07:08.000> select<00:07:08.419> this

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 
easier okay so now I select this

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.939 
easier okay so now I select this
armature<00:07:08.900> and<00:07:09.169> now<00:07:09.349> it's<00:07:09.530> just<00:07:09.800> like<00:07:09.919> a

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
armature and now it's just like a

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:11.379 
armature and now it's just like a
regular<00:07:10.129> armature<00:07:10.639> you<00:07:10.759> can<00:07:10.879> go<00:07:10.970> into<00:07:11.120> pose

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
regular armature you can go into pose

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.529 
regular armature you can go into pose
mode<00:07:11.560> and<00:07:12.560> you<00:07:12.650> start<00:07:12.919> posing<00:07:13.159> this<00:07:14.060> armature

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
mode and you start posing this armature

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.330 
mode and you start posing this armature
and<00:07:14.569> you<00:07:15.199> can<00:07:15.349> see<00:07:15.470> you<00:07:15.590> can<00:07:15.740> actually<00:07:15.889> use<00:07:16.220> it

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
and you can see you can actually use it

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.770 
and you can see you can actually use it
also<00:07:16.490> as<00:07:16.789> kind<00:07:17.000> of<00:07:17.030> like<00:07:17.090> a<00:07:17.210> tree<00:07:17.389> modeling

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
also as kind of like a tree modeling

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.309 
also as kind of like a tree modeling
tool<00:07:17.960> you<00:07:18.470> can<00:07:18.620> go<00:07:18.740> ahead<00:07:18.830> and<00:07:18.949> position<00:07:19.580> these

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 
tool you can go ahead and position these

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:25.510 
tool you can go ahead and position these
branches<00:07:21.340> any<00:07:22.340> way<00:07:22.580> you<00:07:22.639> want<00:07:22.970> or<00:07:24.400> you<00:07:25.400> could

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 
branches any way you want or you could

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.939 
branches any way you want or you could
animate<00:07:25.819> them<00:07:26.120> and<00:07:26.389> as<00:07:27.229> you<00:07:27.289> saw<00:07:27.560> before<00:07:27.740> I

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
animate them and as you saw before I

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.710 
animate them and as you saw before I
kind<00:07:28.159> of<00:07:28.220> clicked<00:07:28.430> out<00:07:28.550> of<00:07:28.729> it<00:07:28.849> it<00:07:29.360> said<00:07:29.599> there

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 
kind of clicked out of it it said there

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.800 
kind of clicked out of it it said there
was<00:07:29.810> a<00:07:29.840> thing<00:07:30.229> for<00:07:30.409> um<00:07:30.650> armature<00:07:31.490> animation<00:07:32.120> so

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
was a thing for um armature animation so

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.990 
was a thing for um armature animation so
you<00:07:33.349> could<00:07:33.620> go<00:07:33.770> ahead<00:07:33.830> and<00:07:33.979> set<00:07:34.550> that<00:07:34.669> up<00:07:34.699> and

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
you could go ahead and set that up and

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.100 
you could go ahead and set that up and
have<00:07:35.539> it<00:07:36.909> you<00:07:37.909> know<00:07:38.000> do<00:07:38.210> some<00:07:38.419> wind<00:07:38.719> gusting

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.110 
have it you know do some wind gusting
