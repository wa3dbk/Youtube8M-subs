00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
little too big to pass through that

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.289 
little too big to pass through that
safety<00:01:25.869> ring<00:01:26.140> but<00:01:27.039> on<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.430> other<00:01:27.549> hand<00:01:27.670> it's

just the right size if I want to load

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.200 
just the right size if I want to load
516<00:01:31.060> since<00:01:31.390> pellets<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.710> I'll<00:01:32.979> show<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.549> here

516 since pellets and I'll show you here
you<00:01:35.020> know<00:01:35.140> if<00:01:35.229> I<00:01:35.320> pour<00:01:35.680> these<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:37.329> don't

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
you know if I pour these in and I don't

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.099 
you know if I pour these in and I don't
want<00:01:37.630> to<00:01:37.719> do<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:38.049> too<00:01:38.439> awful<00:01:38.859> fast<00:01:40.109> otherwise

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
want to do it too awful fast otherwise

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.289 
want to do it too awful fast otherwise
they'll<00:01:41.469> kind<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.890> bunch<00:01:42.159> up<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.820> get<00:01:43.030> in<00:01:43.149> each

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
they'll kind of bunch up and get in each

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.359 
they'll kind of bunch up and get in each
other's<00:01:43.659> way<00:01:43.930> but<00:01:44.289> if<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.590> don't<00:01:44.770> do<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:44.950> at<00:01:45.130> to

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
other's way but if I don't do it at to

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.539 
other's way but if I don't do it at to
wrap<00:01:45.670> at<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.969> rate<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:47.109> makes<00:01:47.829> it<00:01:48.009> real<00:01:48.219> easy<00:01:48.250> to

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
wrap at a rate it makes it real easy to

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.270 
wrap at a rate it makes it real easy to
reload<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.570> so<00:01:50.259> if<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.649> had<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.829> bunch<00:01:51.100> of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
reload and so if you had a bunch of

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.190 
reload and so if you had a bunch of
these<00:01:51.399> extra<00:01:51.909> tubes<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.750> wanted<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.049> get

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
these extra tubes and you wanted to get

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.230 
these extra tubes and you wanted to get
them<00:01:53.350> all<00:01:53.500> loaded<00:01:53.770> up<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.340> ready<00:01:54.399> you<00:01:54.909> know

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
them all loaded up and ready you know

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.149

this could be a nice little funnel to
use<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.969> lot<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.270> times<00:02:01.479> like<00:02:01.689> even<00:02:01.990> if<00:02:02.109> you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
use and a lot of times like even if you

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.520 
use and a lot of times like even if you
just<00:02:02.259> buy<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:03.119> repeater<00:02:04.119> unit<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:04.869> magazine

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
just buy the repeater unit and magazine

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.040 
just buy the repeater unit and magazine

barrel usually it's going to come with a
mouthpiece<00:02:10.630> one<00:02:11.500> thing<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.800> watch<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.160> for

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
mouthpiece one thing to watch out for

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.119 
mouthpiece one thing to watch out for
them<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.080> mouthpieces<00:02:14.560> have<00:02:15.099> a

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
them some of the mouthpieces have a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.830 
them some of the mouthpieces have a
little<00:02:16.019> like<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.050> crossbar<00:02:17.950> mold

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
little like a crossbar mold

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.570 
little like a crossbar mold
and<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.410> good<00:02:20.530> feature<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.099> you<00:02:21.220> want<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and that's a good feature if you want to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.600 
and that's a good feature if you want to
use<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.760> on<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.480> blowgun<00:02:23.370> without<00:02:24.370> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.070 
repeater action the repeater action
usually<00:02:27.700> will<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:28.030> its<00:02:28.209> own<00:02:28.420> safety

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
usually will have its own safety

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.589 
usually will have its own safety
crossbar<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.130> kind<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.340> redundant<00:02:30.790> but

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
crossbar so it's kind of redundant but

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.449 
crossbar so it's kind of redundant but
if<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.930> mouthpiece<00:02:32.410> has<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.890> then<00:02:33.310> you

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
if the mouthpiece has that then you

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.670 
if the mouthpiece has that then you
won't<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.760> able<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.120> use<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:35.200> know<00:02:35.350> for<00:02:35.650> a

reloading funnel the thing is though you

reloading funnel the thing is though you
can<00:02:38.620> order<00:02:38.950> these<00:02:39.480> mouthpieces<00:02:40.480> of<00:02:40.810> separate

what<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.560> can<00:02:59.769> do<00:02:59.920> then<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.430> go<00:03:00.640> up<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> 50

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
what I can do then is go up to a 50

what I can do then is go up to a 50
caliber<00:03:02.049> mouthpiece<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.959> course<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.470> is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
caliber mouthpiece and of course this is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.130 
caliber mouthpiece and of course this is
just<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:06.010> 40<00:03:06.340> caliber<00:03:06.370> magazine<00:03:07.360> tube<00:03:07.690> so<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
just a 40 caliber magazine tube so it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.070 
just a 40 caliber magazine tube so it
fits<00:03:08.650> here<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> little<00:03:09.130> loosely<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.390> have<00:03:10.930> to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
fits here a little loosely so I have to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.170 
fits here a little loosely so I have to
kind<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.830> know<00:03:11.860> remember<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.700> hold<00:03:12.910> it

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
kind of you know remember to hold it

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.300 
kind of you know remember to hold it
there<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.569> place<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.200> doesn't<00:03:14.230> drop<00:03:14.769> off<00:03:15.040> at

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
there in place so it doesn't drop off at

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.479 
there in place so it doesn't drop off at
the<00:03:15.400> wrong<00:03:15.580> moment<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.780> with<00:03:16.959> these<00:03:17.489> even

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
the wrong moment now with these even

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.190 
the wrong moment now with these even
though<00:03:18.640> this<00:03:18.819> is<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> bigger<00:03:19.450> opening<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:20.110> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
though this is a bigger opening in the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920 
though this is a bigger opening in the
50<00:03:20.500> caliber<00:03:20.709> mouthpiece<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:22.209> seems<00:03:22.630> like<00:03:22.720> I

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
50 caliber mouthpiece it seems like I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.729 
50 caliber mouthpiece it seems like I
have<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.230> use<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.470> little<00:03:24.250> bit<00:03:24.690> gentler<00:03:25.690> rate<00:03:26.530> of

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
have to use a little bit gentler rate of

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.949 
have to use a little bit gentler rate of
flow<00:03:27.250> when<00:03:27.760> I'm<00:03:27.880> pouring<00:03:28.209> these<00:03:28.420> things<00:03:28.720> down

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
flow when I'm pouring these things down

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.229 
flow when I'm pouring these things down
so<00:03:29.290> they<00:03:29.440> have<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.560> tendency<00:03:30.160> to<00:03:30.190> kind<00:03:30.519> of<00:03:30.760> clump

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
so they have a tendency to kind of clump

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.569 
so they have a tendency to kind of clump
up<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.590> kind<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:32.859> lift<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.220> up<00:03:33.430> a

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
up but I can kind of lift this up a

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.940 
up but I can kind of lift this up a
little<00:03:33.700> bit<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.390> agitate<00:03:35.079> that<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.440> little<00:03:35.769> bit

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
little bit and agitate that a little bit

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.050 
little bit and agitate that a little bit
and<00:03:36.609> let<00:03:36.910> them<00:03:37.030> drop<00:03:37.269> on<00:03:37.540> down<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.700> then<00:03:39.700> if<00:03:39.910> I

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
and let them drop on down and then if I

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.390 
and let them drop on down and then if I
pour<00:03:40.420> on<00:03:40.600> another<00:03:41.079> group<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.680> them<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:44.410> really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
pour on another group of them and really

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.520 
pour on another group of them and really
it<00:03:45.609> looks<00:03:45.760> like<00:03:45.910> I've<00:03:46.090> got<00:03:46.120> too<00:03:46.690> many<00:03:46.989> on<00:03:47.290> there

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
it looks like I've got too many on there

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.640 
it looks like I've got too many on there
probably<00:03:48.489> dropping<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.630> at<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.049> end<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.440> got

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
probably dropping you at the end I got

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.259 
probably dropping you at the end I got
kind<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:50.950> carried<00:03:51.160> away<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.609> was<00:03:51.700> already<00:03:51.970> full

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
kind of carried away it was already full

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.560 
kind of carried away it was already full
so<00:03:52.540> I'm<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:53.920> that's<00:03:54.010> kind<00:03:54.579> of<00:03:54.670> fun<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.390> mean

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
so I'm but that's kind of fun I mean

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.420 
so I'm but that's kind of fun I mean
there's<00:03:55.750> other<00:03:55.959> ways<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.590> reload<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.250> and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
there's other ways you can reload it and

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.640 
there's other ways you can reload it and
we'll<00:03:57.700> look<00:03:57.850> at<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.030> in<00:03:58.450> some<00:03:59.290> other<00:03:59.440> videos

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
we'll look at that in some other videos

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.979 
we'll look at that in some other videos
like<00:04:00.519> even<00:04:00.850> if<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.030> don't<00:04:01.209> have<00:04:01.420> these<00:04:01.540> extra

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
like even if you don't have these extra

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.710 
like even if you don't have these extra
magazine<00:04:02.560> tubes<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.340> use<00:04:03.519> for<00:04:03.910> Speed<00:04:04.239> loading

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
magazine tubes to use for Speed loading

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750 
magazine tubes to use for Speed loading
you<00:04:05.260> know<00:04:05.380> if<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.590> do<00:04:05.769> have<00:04:06.100> them<00:04:06.280> once<00:04:06.609> you

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
you know if you do have them once you

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.789 
you know if you do have them once you
got<00:04:06.940> one<00:04:07.150> loaded<00:04:07.540> up<00:04:07.720> if<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.079> want<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.380> reload

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
got one loaded up if you want to reload

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.650 
got one loaded up if you want to reload
the<00:04:08.829> once<00:04:09.280> trapped<00:04:09.609> under<00:04:09.940> your<00:04:10.030> slingshot

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
the once trapped under your slingshot

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.289 
the once trapped under your slingshot
you<00:04:11.350> just<00:04:11.620> kind<00:04:11.859> of<00:04:11.950> get<00:04:12.220> them<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.670> end<00:04:12.880> and

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
you just kind of get them in the end and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.840 
you just kind of get them in the end and
drop<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.950> you've<00:04:15.100> got<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.459> reloaded

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
drop that in and you've got it reloaded

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.659 
drop that in and you've got it reloaded
you<00:04:16.419> know<00:04:16.539> pretty<00:04:16.720> much<00:04:16.840> instantly<00:04:17.560> but<00:04:18.370> you

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
you know pretty much instantly but you

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.190 
you know pretty much instantly but you
know<00:04:18.789> if<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:18.970> don't<00:04:19.120> have<00:04:19.329> tools<00:04:19.630> like<00:04:19.930> that

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
know if you don't have tools like that

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.050 
know if you don't have tools like that
or<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.680> don't<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:21.039> these<00:04:21.220> mouthpieces

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
or if you don't have these mouthpieces

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.659 
or if you don't have these mouthpieces
to<00:04:22.389> use<00:04:22.570> as<00:04:22.780> funnels<00:04:23.229> there<00:04:23.889> are<00:04:24.010> still<00:04:24.250> some

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
to use as funnels there are still some

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.969 
to use as funnels there are still some
techniques<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.389> use<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:26.200> reload<00:04:26.620> pretty

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
techniques you can use to reload pretty

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.670 
techniques you can use to reload pretty
quickly<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.669> by<00:04:27.760> hand<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.599> so<00:04:29.349> I'll<00:04:29.440> go<00:04:29.650> over

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
quickly just by hand and so I'll go over

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.300 
quickly just by hand and so I'll go over
some

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
some

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.350 
some
those<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:31.480> I<00:04:31.510> thought<00:04:32.020> of<00:04:32.080> so<00:04:32.590> far<00:04:32.890> in

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
those that I thought of so far in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.950 
those that I thought of so far in
another<00:04:34.360> video<00:04:34.600> or<00:04:35.050> two<00:04:36.180> other<00:04:37.180> things<00:04:37.300> that

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
another video or two other things that

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.540 
another video or two other things that
you<00:04:38.200> can<00:04:38.620> do<00:04:39.900> modification<00:04:40.900> wise<00:04:41.140> if<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:42.370> get

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
you can do modification wise if you get

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.580 
you can do modification wise if you get
one<00:04:42.730> of<00:04:42.820> these<00:04:42.910> including<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.750> blowgun<00:04:44.200> or<00:04:44.500> if

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
one of these including the blowgun or if

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.510 
one of these including the blowgun or if
you've<00:04:44.740> already<00:04:44.920> got<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.250> blow<00:04:45.520> gun<00:04:45.660> barrel<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
you've already got a blow gun barrel and

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.360 
you've already got a blow gun barrel and
of<00:04:48.670> course<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.180> may<00:04:49.360> like<00:04:50.250> shooting<00:04:51.250> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
of course you may like shooting the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.390 
of course you may like shooting the
blowgun<00:04:51.760> itself<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.780> I<00:04:52.900> hope<00:04:53.080> you<00:04:53.230> do<00:04:53.440> but<00:04:54.220> you

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
blowgun itself and I hope you do but you

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.550 
blowgun itself and I hope you do but you
know<00:04:54.520> let's<00:04:55.000> say<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.570> you<00:04:55.690> don't<00:04:55.900> or<00:04:56.260> let's

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
know let's say that you don't or let's

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.770 
know let's say that you don't or let's
just<00:04:56.770> say<00:04:56.950> you've<00:04:57.190> already<00:04:57.580> got<00:04:57.820> several<00:04:58.510> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
just say you've already got several and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.380 
just say you've already got several and
so<00:04:59.020> you're<00:04:59.590> willing<00:04:59.770> to<00:05:00.130> kind<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.550> sacrifice<00:05:01.360> a

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
so you're willing to kind of sacrifice a

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.920 
so you're willing to kind of sacrifice a
barrel<00:05:02.020> one<00:05:02.680> thing<00:05:02.890> you<00:05:02.980> could<00:05:03.190> do<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.930> instead

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
barrel one thing you could do is instead

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.440 
barrel one thing you could do is instead
of<00:05:05.080> using<00:05:05.260> one<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.620> these<00:05:05.800> tubes<00:05:06.340> as<00:05:06.790> the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
of using one of these tubes as the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.350 
of using one of these tubes as the
magazine<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.470> strap<00:05:08.980> on<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.490> your<00:05:09.730> slingshot

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
magazine to strap on to your slingshot

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.250 
magazine to strap on to your slingshot
there<00:05:10.810> if<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.920> don't<00:05:12.100> like<00:05:12.340> plastic<00:05:13.150> and<00:05:13.450> and

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
there if you don't like plastic and and

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.530 
there if you don't like plastic and and
I<00:05:14.410> like<00:05:14.680> these<00:05:14.860> actually<00:05:15.490> one<00:05:15.880> nice<00:05:16.120> thing<00:05:16.150> is

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
I like these actually one nice thing is

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.420 
I like these actually one nice thing is
they're<00:05:16.750> see-through<00:05:17.020> so<00:05:17.860> it<00:05:17.980> makes<00:05:18.100> it<00:05:18.250> real

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
they're see-through so it makes it real

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.280 
they're see-through so it makes it real
easy<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.700> keep<00:05:18.910> track<00:05:18.970> of<00:05:19.300> your<00:05:19.450> pellets<00:05:19.990> and

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
easy to keep track of your pellets and

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.440 
easy to keep track of your pellets and
they're<00:05:21.190> actually<00:05:21.550> quite<00:05:21.730> tough<00:05:22.210> little

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
they're actually quite tough little

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.020 
they're actually quite tough little
tubes<00:05:22.870> but<00:05:23.260> let's<00:05:23.530> say<00:05:23.710> that's<00:05:23.980> just<00:05:24.100> not<00:05:24.580> your

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
tubes but let's say that's just not your

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.960 
tubes but let's say that's just not your
style<00:05:25.390> you<00:05:25.900> prefer<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:26.560> metal<00:05:27.070> magazine<00:05:27.640> tube

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
style you prefer a metal magazine tube

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.210 
style you prefer a metal magazine tube
then<00:05:28.690> you<00:05:28.870> could<00:05:29.020> actually<00:05:29.170> cut<00:05:29.620> off<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.770> length

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
then you could actually cut off a length

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.730 
then you could actually cut off a length
of<00:05:30.430> thus<00:05:30.760> you<00:05:31.750> know<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.170> then<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.500> could

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
of thus you know and then you could

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.120 
of thus you know and then you could
strap<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.820> aluminum<00:05:34.600> tube<00:05:34.930> on<00:05:35.230> instead<00:05:36.010> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
strap that aluminum tube on instead of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.190 
strap that aluminum tube on instead of
the<00:05:36.220> plastic<00:05:36.400> tube<00:05:37.060> and<00:05:37.420> they're<00:05:37.870> pretty<00:05:38.140> much

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
the plastic tube and they're pretty much

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.820 
the plastic tube and they're pretty much
the<00:05:38.710> same<00:05:38.980> outer<00:05:39.640> diameter<00:05:40.510> so<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.500> know<00:05:41.620> that

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
the same outer diameter so you know that

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.880 
the same outer diameter so you know that
that<00:05:42.100> would<00:05:42.250> definitely<00:05:42.430> work<00:05:43.290> also<00:05:44.290> you<00:05:44.770> know

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
that would definitely work also you know

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.860 
that would definitely work also you know
here<00:05:45.190> you<00:05:45.370> got<00:05:45.550> plenty<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:45.970> barrel<00:05:46.450> so<00:05:46.660> if<00:05:46.750> you

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
here you got plenty of barrel so if you

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.020 
here you got plenty of barrel so if you
wanted<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.230> actually<00:05:47.410> make<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:48.040> longer<00:05:48.400> than

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
wanted to actually make it longer than

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.090 
wanted to actually make it longer than
the<00:05:49.180> original<00:05:49.690> magazine<00:05:49.930> tube<00:05:50.560> so<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:50.860> you

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
the original magazine tube so that you

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.400 
the original magazine tube so that you
got<00:05:51.250> more<00:05:51.490> pellet<00:05:51.880> capacity<00:05:52.540> you<00:05:53.140> could<00:05:53.320> do

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
got more pellet capacity you could do

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.620 
got more pellet capacity you could do
that<00:05:53.560> as<00:05:53.860> long<00:05:53.890> as<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.490> you<00:05:54.790> know<00:05:54.910> doesn't

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
that as long as it you know doesn't

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.500 
that as long as it you know doesn't
interfere<00:05:55.960> with<00:05:56.440> your<00:05:56.650> elbow<00:05:57.430> or<00:05:57.700> anything

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
interfere with your elbow or anything

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.090 
interfere with your elbow or anything
like<00:05:58.540> that<00:05:58.690> you<00:05:59.290> know<00:05:59.320> when<00:05:59.560> you're<00:05:59.710> using<00:05:59.920> a

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
like that you know when you're using a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.550 
like that you know when you're using a
slingshot<00:06:00.660> so<00:06:01.660> those<00:06:01.870> are<00:06:02.020> just<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.320> few<00:06:02.350> ideas

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
slingshot so those are just a few ideas

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.590 
slingshot so those are just a few ideas
of<00:06:03.010> how<00:06:03.460> you<00:06:03.520> can<00:06:03.850> use<00:06:03.910> these<00:06:04.360> other

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
of how you can use these other

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.890 
of how you can use these other
components<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.620> kind<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:05.980> you<00:06:06.940> know<00:06:06.970> keep

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
components to kind of you know keep

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.460 
components to kind of you know keep
modifying<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.800> thing<00:06:09.240> so<00:06:10.240> hopefully<00:06:10.750> you

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.470 
modifying the thing so hopefully you

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.110 
modifying the thing so hopefully you
enjoyed<00:06:11.800> that<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:12.370> like<00:06:12.550> I<00:06:12.580> said<00:06:12.820> we'll<00:06:13.000> look

enjoyed that and like I said we'll look

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.540 
enjoyed that and like I said we'll look
at<00:06:13.270> some<00:06:13.300> reloading<00:06:13.810> techniques<00:06:14.470> in<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:15.220> next

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
at some reloading techniques in the next

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:25.629 
at some reloading techniques in the next
one<00:06:16.030> or<00:06:16.120> two<00:06:16.270> videos<00:06:16.720> thanks<00:06:17.680> for<00:06:17.710> watching
