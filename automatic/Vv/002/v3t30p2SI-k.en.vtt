00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.980

 promised I'll show you the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.190
 best reviews but not on this video 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.900
 it will be on the next because I have 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.759
 read all your opinions you have extremely 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.379
 many to share your opinions and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 frankly thank you that makes it look great 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.359
 pleasure 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 but what we're going to do is I'm going 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.420
 take the opinions that will have the most 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.800
 like because a lot you you 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 repeat you think a little bit the same thing 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.070
 and that's what we're going to do 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 that the opinions that will have the most of 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.369
 we're going to say the 3/4 play them 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 mistresses would comment on them and here we go 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.640
 did like that as I wanted to say in 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.989
 the other video there is a lot of information 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.969
 I could do a one hour video 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.800
 so we'll take the main ones that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.600
 marked me this week two 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 today and so this is the first 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.430
 it is the one of casillas and of airé to a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.120
 video or casias and airy to this are 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 completely ignored the arrival of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 missions that it was the camp 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.980
 drive for so spain costa 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 the two players 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 completely ignored we were talking about a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.149
 departure from casillas but today he 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 about four hours ago he denied 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 he said i am in madrid and i will stay 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 in madrid so it tells us a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 terrible competition because 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.670
 normally aired to should do his 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.680
 arrival at real madrid and so me my 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.220
 question is because what is it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.170
 you think 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.900
 if you are in the place of rafael 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.850
 benitez you choose casias or aire 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.080
 in my opinion it is complicated because 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 behind it's really a very very 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.810
 great guardian but casillas is a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.189
 legend in real madrid and even on the to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.049
 many who criticize him that's a 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.850
 very very big goalkeeper so the choice there 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.810
 is really very complicated for for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.400
 rafael benitez 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 the other info always real madrid on 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.509
 now talking about the bb jc one of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.720
 marca it seems to me so this is benzema 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.640
 beill ramés why because rafael 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.590
 benitez would seemingly placed 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.610
 benzema at number 10 in front of cristiano 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.470
 ronaldo in tip 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.640
 on the right the mass and on the left beill 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.990
 what do you think about it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.130
 Madrid supporters or even if you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.780
 do not support the madeleine but 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 from that of this new device that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.960
 would like to set up rafael benitez 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.790
 for my part I think it would be 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.200
 maybe a good idea but me 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.030
 personally I see more a rat metz 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 say it because it's huge 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 enormously in May 10 on the sides I 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.540
 always found 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.250
 a good that say then benzema 10 for 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.909
 me it's bullshit and bullshit 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.700
 monumental 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.350
 after ronaldo in bb why not and the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.940
 left that why not the second info 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.560
 a big info so it concerns the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.150
 barça every time so we talked about 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.010
 real then we talk about the barça the barça 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.660
 would he rig a game of liga 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.430
 that's the question we ask ourselves 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.350
 the Spanish league opened an investigation 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.270
 on the match barca la corogne and and she 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.950
 so has the last day of liga the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.070
 barça led 2-0 and then 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.530
 resume from 2 and defender alberto 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.200
 lopo de deportivo the coruna said a 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.209
 entrusted to a journalist that xavi that he 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.450
 had asked xavi for forgiveness to lift the 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.100
 foot 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.900
 an investigation that is in the news 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.090
 deportivo but who they accuse the league 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.140
 to be anti barça since I do not know if 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.510
 you know it but it's pretty much 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.130
 two years that no player of the month has 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.600
 Barcelona, ​​while no less than 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.070
 seven years I think he would have 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600
 deserved what are you thinking is this 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.860
 that the deportivo world is right 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.810
 criticize the league saying they are 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.130
 high anti barça yes or no 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.360
 Reply me in the comments me 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.190
 I think yes there is still a 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.900
 anti barça thing especially compared to that 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.050
 what they pointed out the fact of not having 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.070
 for two years offered no trophy of 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.360
 player of the month a Barcelona player 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.280
 while I think she has a lot 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.200
 who would have deserved it I say that and I am 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.480
 Madrid supporters so here we go 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.950
 yesterday the guest of rmc de luis fernandez to 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.870
 19 hours it was vincent labrune the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.459
 President of the olympique de marseille 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.420
 is she said a lot of things 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.000
 so that's why I'm going to 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.070
 list a little the main things 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.360
 that he has who said it so there is he said 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.160
 that there are many offers for toast 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.170
 imbula so imbula at the thresholds would 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.400
 very close very close by leaps and bounds 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.090
 valence i will ask you the question 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.230
 do you think it's a 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.100
 good or bad thing for him good 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.570
 I think it will be a little night 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.739
 unanimity but I think it will be 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.000
 a very good thing for him 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.730
 then he said that formalization 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.230
 of the bielsa contract extension 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670
 will normally be done next week 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.410
 because yes we talked about that but at 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.450
 little formalization on the part 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.470
 executives then ayew to swansea 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.480
 is what you think it is 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.860
 good thing for him or not me 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.299
 personally I think it's not 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.470
 a good cure to care is a good 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.700
 thing that went first league 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.269
 but swan if I think it's a 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.860
 bad choice 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.150
 it's a good team but I'm not saying 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.380
 it's a very, very nice team but 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.390
 his place I might not have signed a 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.560
 66 and he stated that gignac ayew he 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.880
 wanted to sell them as soon as the season 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.530
 last but finally it was not 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.299
 did he find their 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.950
 substitutes so here we go gignac 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.840
 certainly and it's about to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.910
 100% he will leave we do not know yet 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.360
 the destination we speak about moscow on 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.340
 talk about the cottage in mexico and the team 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.660
 artix to yesterday so we'll see last 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.230
 info we talked about marseille whose 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.480
 we are talking 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.980
 paris saint-germain obviously paris 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.030
 holy germain and so we were told there 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.190
 few days ago that ibrahimovic 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.350
 wish had said yes to milan ac 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.000
 but here we have these exits to some 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.740
 minutes ibrahimovic said you are 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.880
 very very loud to relay the rumors 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.590
 but what you thought 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.030
 call galliani and ben no the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 journalists did not do it and he 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.710
 should have done it since precisely he 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.250
 there is no any advance with Milan 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.420
 ac ibra said he was ready to stay in paris 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.890
 Saint Germain who lives very beautiful 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.480
 things and that he for now his 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.340
 future he is to sin and he wants 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.350
 to stay in paris saint germain 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.150
 so the question for you supporters of the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.500
 psg is what you would like to see 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.010
 whether or not we know it's a very 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.060
 great player 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.380

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.820
