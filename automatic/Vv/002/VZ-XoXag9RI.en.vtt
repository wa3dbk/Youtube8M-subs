00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
the first thing that struck me is that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
really massive head but now I'm so he's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
division 1 so at fighting just to stay
in<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.619> all<00:01:25.799> i<00:01:25.830> needed<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.430> point<00:01:26.880> and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in it all i needed was one point and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.569

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.469 
thought maybe I could go and get
something<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> game<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.450> just

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
something from the game but it was just

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
something from the game but it was just
such<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> frustrating<00:01:34.170> experience<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:35.250> me<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
such a frustrating experience for me and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
such a frustrating experience for me and
I<00:01:35.549> thought<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:36.479> probably<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> get

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I thought I'm probably not going to get

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.690 
I thought I'm probably not going to get
anything<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.130> game<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> have

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
anything from this game and you have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.249 
anything from this game and you have
games<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.240> sometimes<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.780> FIFA<00:01:40.049> this

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
games like that sometimes in FIFA this

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.990 
games like that sometimes in FIFA this
was<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> most<00:01:40.829> annoying<00:01:41.430> thing<00:01:41.670> because

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
was the most annoying thing because

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
was the most annoying thing because
manggala<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:42.810> couldn't<00:01:43.229> beat<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.950> guy<00:01:44.159> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
manggala just couldn't beat that guy and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.460 
manggala just couldn't beat that guy and
get<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> ball<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.090> elderson<00:01:46.079> ended<00:01:46.380> up

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
get the ball and then elderson ended up

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.870 
get the ball and then elderson ended up
going<00:01:46.680> into<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> box<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.220> taking<00:01:47.579> David

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
going into the box and taking David

going into the box and taking David

staying<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> middle<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.460> i<00:01:59.549> ended<00:01:59.790> up

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
staying in the middle and i ended up

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.789 
staying in the middle and i ended up
diving<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.719> annoying<00:02:00.990> because<00:02:01.320> i<00:02:01.469> felt

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
diving which was annoying because i felt

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
diving which was annoying because i felt
i<00:02:01.920> probably<00:02:02.310> could<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.610> gone<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.939> get<00:02:03.149> an

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
i probably could have gone on to get an

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.940 
i probably could have gone on to get an

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.360 
don't know it all adds up somewhere but
I<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:18.600> only<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.840> 376<00:02:19.680> coins<00:02:19.890> from<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.160> as<00:02:20.280> you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
I we only get 376 coins from that as you

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.800 
I we only get 376 coins from that as you
can<00:02:20.400> see<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:20.700> only<00:02:20.850> had<00:02:21.000> five<00:02:21.210> shots<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.690> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
can see we only had five shots and the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.240 
can see we only had five shots and the
only<00:02:21.930> tree<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.260> which<00:02:22.410> were<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.650> target<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
only tree of which were on target so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.220 
only tree of which were on target so
probably<00:02:23.910> didn't<00:02:24.240> deserve<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.660> win<00:02:24.780> anyways

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

pretty<00:02:54.030> decent<00:02:54.390> formation<00:02:54.930> as<00:02:55.050> well<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
pretty decent formation as well and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900 
pretty decent formation as well and
Lenin<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:55.890> his<00:02:55.980> ID<00:02:56.310> on<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> wings<00:02:56.760> are

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
Lenin and his ID on the wings are

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.190 
Lenin and his ID on the wings are
probably<00:02:57.150> quite<00:02:57.360> good<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.750> know<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:58.080> his

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
probably quite good but I know it's his

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.020 
probably quite good but I know it's his
midfield<00:02:58.380> he<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.130> too<00:02:59.310> high<00:02:59.550> high<00:02:59.760> work-rate

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
midfield he is too high high work-rate

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.150 
midfield he is too high high work-rate
players<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:00.960> high<00:03:01.170> work-rate<00:03:01.500> player<00:03:01.920> so

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
players and one high work-rate player so

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.070 
players and one high work-rate player so
I<00:03:02.190> figured<00:03:02.610> he's<00:03:03.180> probably<00:03:03.450> not<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.020> be

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
I figured he's probably not going to be

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.800 
I figured he's probably not going to be
very<00:03:04.260> good<00:03:04.860> at<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.610> maintaining<00:03:06.540> possession

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
very good at the maintaining possession

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
very good at the maintaining possession
in<00:03:07.050> midfield<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.710> hoped<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.460> able<00:03:08.490> to

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
in midfield and I hoped to be able to

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.630 
in midfield and I hoped to be able to
exploit<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.180> somehow<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.290> them<00:03:10.640> Aaron

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
exploit that somehow but them Aaron

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.250 
exploit that somehow but them Aaron
Lennon<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.120> kind<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.570> he<00:03:12.750> had<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> shot<00:03:13.110> on<00:03:13.230> goal

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
Lennon was kind of he had a shot on goal

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.540 
Lennon was kind of he had a shot on goal
there<00:03:13.560> that<00:03:13.680> was<00:03:13.770> deflected<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.310> from<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
there that was deflected and from the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.770 
there that was deflected and from the
counter-attack<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.300> pretty<00:03:15.540> much<00:03:15.630> just

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
counter-attack I pretty much just

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.630 
counter-attack I pretty much just
destroyed<00:03:16.500> with<00:03:16.710> Luis<00:03:16.980> Muriel<00:03:17.130> look<00:03:17.460> at<00:03:17.550> him

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
destroyed with Luis Muriel look at him

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.370 
destroyed with Luis Muriel look at him
he<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:17.850> spreads<00:03:18.300> his<00:03:18.420> defense<00:03:18.780> apart<00:03:19.080> there

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
he just spreads his defense apart there

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.590 
he just spreads his defense apart there
and<00:03:19.560> makes<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.430> easy<00:03:20.460> for<00:03:20.820> Muriel<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.420> run

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
and makes it so easy for Muriel to run

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.270 
and makes it so easy for Muriel to run
true<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:21.990> can't<00:03:22.320> give<00:03:22.620> space<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.250> that

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
true and you can't give space like that

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.550 
true and you can't give space like that
to<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> player<00:03:23.850> like<00:03:23.880> Muriel<00:03:24.300> because<00:03:25.140> he's<00:03:25.320> so

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
to a player like Muriel because he's so

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.200 
to a player like Muriel because he's so
fast<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.070> he's<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.400> clinical<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.090> the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
the Portuguese team because the games

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.080 
the Portuguese team because the games
are<00:05:20.440> getting<00:05:20.770> tougher<00:05:21.130> now<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.490> had<00:05:21.910> a<00:05:21.940> look

up settling for Lucho Gonzalez who looks
alright<00:05:36.610> I<00:05:36.670> haven't<00:05:37.120> really<00:05:37.240> heard<00:05:37.480> that<00:05:37.750> he's

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
alright I haven't really heard that he's

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.320 
alright I haven't really heard that he's
much<00:05:38.500> much<00:05:38.800> better<00:05:39.010> than<00:05:39.310> his<00:05:39.520> original<00:05:39.760> card

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
much much better than his original card

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.120 
much much better than his original card
but<00:05:40.570> i<00:05:40.600> think<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.080> midfield<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.680> quite<00:05:41.920> weak

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
but i think the midfield is quite weak

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.190 
but i think the midfield is quite weak
like<00:05:42.520> manggala<00:05:42.940> can<00:05:43.240> cover<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.630> defense<00:05:43.930> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
like manggala can cover the defense and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.350 
like manggala can cover the defense and
after<00:05:44.890> that<00:05:45.010> against<00:05:45.490> better<00:05:45.730> judgment<00:05:46.240> I

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
after that against better judgment I

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.510 
after that against better judgment I
opened<00:05:46.780> the<00:05:46.840> pack<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.290> I<00:05:47.890> did<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.400> because

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
opened the pack and I did that because

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.280 
opened the pack and I did that because
you<00:05:49.060> know<00:05:49.090> when<00:05:49.420> you<00:05:49.510> win<00:05:49.660> division<00:05:49.990> when<00:05:50.140> you

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
you know when you win division when you

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.570 
you know when you win division when you
