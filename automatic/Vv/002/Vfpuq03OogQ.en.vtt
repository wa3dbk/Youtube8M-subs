like sensei's divining top is good card

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.080 
like sensei's divining top is good card
selection<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.800> top<00:03:59.800> plays<00:04:00.070> much<00:04:00.430> better<00:04:00.820> with

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
selection and top plays much better with

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.490
