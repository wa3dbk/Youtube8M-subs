of<00:00:38.470> glass<00:00:38.799> we<00:00:39.040> want<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.309> talk<00:00:39.519> about<00:00:39.699> is

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
of glass we want to talk about is

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.689 
of glass we want to talk about is
tempered<00:00:40.540> glass<00:00:40.720> this<00:00:41.710> glass<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.370> reheated

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
tempered glass this glass is reheated

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.110 
tempered glass this glass is reheated
and<00:00:43.330> then<00:00:44.110> cooled<00:00:44.650> down<00:00:44.949> in<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.309> controlled<00:00:45.489> way

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
and then cooled down in a controlled way

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240 
and then cooled down in a controlled way
and<00:00:46.150> you<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.780> see<00:00:46.809> we've<00:00:47.199> got<00:00:47.440> controlled

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
and you can see we've got controlled

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.810 
and you can see we've got controlled
stress<00:00:48.940> in<00:00:49.210> there<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.949> shrinks<00:00:51.549> on<00:00:51.699> the

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
stress in there it shrinks on the

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.960 
stress in there it shrinks on the
outside<00:00:52.299> it<00:00:52.659> makes<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.110> glass<00:00:53.350> very<00:00:53.830> tough

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.060 

this<00:00:57.970> is<00:00:58.119> our<00:00:58.239> bologna<00:00:58.629> vial<00:00:58.989> they<00:00:59.769> blow<00:01:00.040> a

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
this is our bologna vial they blow a

down<00:01:02.710> at<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.010> bottom<00:01:03.189> and<00:01:03.519> cool<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.330> in<00:01:04.449> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
down at the bottom and cool it in the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.680 
down at the bottom and cool it in the
outside<00:01:05.019> air<00:01:05.320> as<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:06.220> cools<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:07.240> outside

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
outside air as it cools the outside

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.690 
outside air as it cools the outside
shrinks<00:01:08.320> it<00:01:08.470> puts<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.860> glass<00:01:09.100> into

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
shrinks it puts the glass into

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.350 
shrinks it puts the glass into
compression<00:01:10.890> inside<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.700> under<00:01:13.060> tension

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
compression inside it's under tension

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.130 
compression inside it's under tension
and<00:01:13.840> that<00:01:13.870> makes<00:01:14.470> the<00:01:14.650> glass<00:01:14.830> very<00:01:15.220> weak

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.360 
very small pieces these are actually a
lot<00:02:20.640> safer<00:02:21.090> than<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.140> jagged<00:02:22.620> ones<00:02:22.830> from<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
lot safer than the jagged ones from the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.580 
lot safer than the jagged ones from the
annealed<00:02:24.030> glass<00:02:26.660> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.780> our<00:02:27.900> Bologna<00:02:28.260> vial

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
annealed glass this is our Bologna vial

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.020 
annealed glass this is our Bologna vial
this<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.100> last<00:02:29.310> thing<00:02:29.610> we're<00:02:29.820> going<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
this is the last thing we're going to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.090 
this is the last thing we're going to
break<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.540> want<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.230> show<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.800> tough

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
break I want to show you that it's tough

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.370 
break I want to show you that it's tough
on<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.459> outside<00:02:32.810> we'll<00:02:33.810> hit<00:02:33.989> it<00:02:34.110> with<00:02:34.140> this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
on the outside we'll hit it with this

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.500 
on the outside we'll hit it with this
plunger<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.820> hit<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.180> pretty<00:02:36.330> hard

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
plunger and you can hit it pretty hard

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.369 
plunger and you can hit it pretty hard
and<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.830> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> break

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.229 

that's<00:02:43.379> that<00:02:43.650> tough<00:02:44.069> compression<00:02:44.879> layer<00:02:45.060> on

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
that's that tough compression layer on

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.630 
that's that tough compression layer on
the<00:02:45.390> outside<00:02:46.909> if<00:02:47.909> I<00:02:48.000> turn<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.450> over<00:02:49.549> it's<00:02:50.549> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the outside if I turn it over it's a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.309 
the outside if I turn it over it's a
little<00:02:50.849> hole<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.390> top<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.049> we're<00:02:52.200> going

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
little hole on the top and we're going

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.619 
little hole on the top and we're going
to<00:02:52.349> drop<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.950> wire<00:02:53.280> through<00:02:53.640> see<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.599> a

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
to drop this wire through see it's got a

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.670 
to drop this wire through see it's got a
sharp<00:02:54.989> point<00:02:55.319> there<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.959> won't<00:02:58.139> take<00:02:58.379> much

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
sharp point there and it won't take much

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.500 
sharp point there and it won't take much
just<00:03:00.139> a<00:03:01.139> little<00:03:01.409> drop<00:03:02.010> down<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> bottom<00:03:02.879> and

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
just a little drop down the bottom and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.379 
just a little drop down the bottom and
it<00:03:04.079> breaks
