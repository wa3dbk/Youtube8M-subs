00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
couldn't have petals on the stage

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.800

there's<00:00:14.740> way<00:00:15.099> too<00:00:15.130> much<00:00:15.339> mayhem<00:00:15.580> going<00:00:16.000> on<00:00:16.180> so

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
there's way too much mayhem going on so

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.420 
there's way too much mayhem going on so
my<00:00:16.960> roadie<00:00:17.170> would<00:00:17.410> crank<00:00:17.650> things<00:00:17.859> up<00:00:18.130> and<00:00:18.310> some

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
my roadie would crank things up and some

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.859 
my roadie would crank things up and some
of<00:00:18.520> the<00:00:18.580> guitar<00:00:18.820> has<00:00:18.970> had<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.150> push-pull<00:00:19.630> pot

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
of the guitar has had a push-pull pot

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.990 
of the guitar has had a push-pull pot
right<00:00:20.109> on<00:00:20.260> my<00:00:20.350> volume<00:00:20.590> next<00:00:21.430> to<00:00:21.490> my<00:00:21.609> volume<00:00:21.789> the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
right on my volume next to my volume the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.400 
right on my volume next to my volume the
tone<00:00:22.180> control<00:00:22.539> actually<00:00:22.840> that<00:00:23.109> would<00:00:23.230> be<00:00:23.260> a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
tone control actually that would be a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.130 
tone control actually that would be a
like<00:00:23.859> kind<00:00:24.160> of<00:00:24.250> wallet<00:00:24.580> own<00:00:24.789> and<00:00:25.090> that<00:00:25.750> that

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
like kind of wallet own and that that

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.000 
like kind of wallet own and that that
was<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.320> best<00:00:26.439> I<00:00:26.560> can<00:00:26.619> do<00:00:26.830> with<00:00:26.980> that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
was the best I can do with that

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.500 
was the best I can do with that
occasionally<00:00:27.670> they<00:00:27.760> be<00:00:27.849> an<00:00:27.939> effect<00:00:28.240> plugged

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
occasionally they be an effect plugged

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.080 
occasionally they be an effect plugged
in<00:00:28.689> by<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.930> roadie<00:00:29.470> or<00:00:29.740> I<00:00:30.400> would<00:00:30.910> have<00:00:30.939> a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
in by the roadie or I would have a

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.020 
in by the roadie or I would have a
outboard<00:00:31.929> gear<00:00:32.019> that<00:00:32.559> went<00:00:32.860> through<00:00:33.160> one<00:00:33.850> end

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
outboard gear that went through one end

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.060 
outboard gear that went through one end
of<00:00:34.149> my<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.690> know<00:00:34.809> equipment<00:00:35.380> that<00:00:35.559> would<00:00:35.890> give

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
of my you know equipment that would give

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.819 
of my you know equipment that would give
the<00:00:36.219> sound<00:00:36.489> but<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.450> course<00:00:38.410> if<00:00:38.530> you've<00:00:38.649> seen

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
the sound but of course if you've seen

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.740 
the sound but of course if you've seen
me<00:00:38.980> in<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.129> past<00:00:39.309> like<00:00:39.579> eight<00:00:40.149> years<00:00:40.510> nine

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
me in the past like eight years nine

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.889 
me in the past like eight years nine
years<00:00:40.809> whatever<00:00:42.120> mostly<00:00:43.120> I'm<00:00:43.270> using<00:00:43.540> very

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
years whatever mostly I'm using very

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.410 
years whatever mostly I'm using very
analog<00:00:44.320> style<00:00:44.680> petals<00:00:45.160> which<00:00:45.399> these<00:00:46.090> are<00:00:46.270> very

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
analog style petals which these are very

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.000 
analog style petals which these are very
similar<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.780> pedals<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.260> used<00:00:47.440> actually<00:00:47.829> on<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
similar to pedals I used actually on the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.310 
similar to pedals I used actually on the
revenge<00:00:48.370> record<00:00:48.760> when<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.750> guitar<00:00:50.050> tones

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
revenge record when the guitar tones

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.110 
revenge record when the guitar tones
really<00:00:50.710> took<00:00:50.860> off<00:00:51.039> two<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.460> to<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:51.699> new<00:00:51.910> height<00:00:52.090> I

really took off two it to a new height I

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.069 
really took off two it to a new height I
thought<00:00:52.449> of<00:00:53.160> wildness<00:00:54.160> you<00:00:54.430> know<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.780> very

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
thought of wildness you know one very

with it really going to stretch it out
and<00:01:20.900> then<00:01:20.930> because<00:01:21.410> of<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.620> chain<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:22.010> I

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
and then because of the chain that I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.350 
and then because of the chain that I
have<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:22.400> in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.580> order<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.270> in
