even<00:06:09.160> start<00:06:09.340> bleeding<00:06:09.640> right<00:06:09.970> away<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.900> was

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
even start bleeding right away it was

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.710 
even start bleeding right away it was
like<00:06:11.350> when<00:06:12.160> it's<00:06:12.310> a<00:06:12.370> la<00:06:12.400> 24<00:06:13.000> hours<00:06:13.240> after<00:06:13.690> i

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
like when it's a la 24 hours after i

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.420 
like when it's a la 24 hours after i
push<00:06:13.990> it<00:06:14.020> all<00:06:14.230> the<00:06:14.290> way<00:06:14.410> through<00:06:14.740> and<00:06:15.280> i

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
push it all the way through and i

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.860 
push it all the way through and i
started<00:06:15.730> cleaning<00:06:15.880> it<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.180> then<00:06:16.450> it<00:06:16.570> started

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870
