00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.110
 They are and well, well, welcome to 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.180
 what is the second episode of re 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.360
 disparate and let's see how it goes 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.610
 let's play with someone random I do not know 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 who do not know who is going to be let me 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.910
 active my volume I thought it explained to the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.009
 see create but this time do not believe me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.910
 I think that the fart is solved 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.809
 let's play with someone not so dense 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 because good I do not want to do 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.019
 reig rescue so fast then good 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.699
 let's start here what is the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.309
 game we're going to see hopefully that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.750
 accept and obviously therefore the services 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.269
 I will try to make a time 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 predetermined in fact I do not want to be 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.010
 spend a lot precisely because of that is that 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.210
 this I'm going to have a chronometer here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.550
 more or less to measure how is the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.920
 business we will be able to fast game 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.690
 and let's see how it goes we'll see 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.760
 if you wear it if it gets sexy the fart 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.980
 connecting you will connect a game 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.990
 automatically let's hope it's a 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.850
 good game or in any case I will have 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.250
 what to look for is the only bad thing here 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.440
 came in Ivan can not connect me to the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.240
 session we are going to look for a game does 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.430
 while I was going to play with the killer I saw that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.260
 It was a while ago that they saw him in the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.990
 list and did not accept then for the raffle 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.820
 I did not get in and then well let's see 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.290
 how are we going to band precisely that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.080
 killer beat is the one that does not accept then 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.820
 I will not I will not get was 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.130
 played with Malaga was well pig 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.470
 in victories but the net if it cracked 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.430
 let's play with it we will see how 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.630
 pass band 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.460
 more than anything and I smoked pig monkeys 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.590
 another objective of this series is 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.630
 reach the maximum range to see if you can 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.400
 then we go rank 9 I call rank 9 from 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.050
 about half a year ago 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.720
 in fact since it came out in September 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.670
 October I left it as it does not take long 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.900
 time september october november lo 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.210
 I left like in November and gloves 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.490
 November in mother range 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.539
 then this good one accepts is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.280
 camping darn lobbies camperos 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.569
 and it's the bad thing is the bad bands 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.930
 that's precisely why the other episode 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.549
 who saw it saw it more in short one was 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.829
 more dynamic because I started then later 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.150
 the part was already started but 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.600
 well here it appears we can do a lot 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.580
 let's play with this one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.850
 We hope this vato accepts because if 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:35.220
 there are not two that do not accept first that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.770
 hitachi yes i am the mother band ok we are going to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.440
 start it was txistu wood and you do not know 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.620
 that if it's not like first hockey and I went up 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.540
 maybe that comes with the speed of 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.690
 team of the characters we are going to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.250
 wait if we win to see with caracas and 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.080
 clothing combat purchase 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.510
 accused we are going to put the cachi 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.470
 Y 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.560
 and we are going to put 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.210
 the wood of the black tunic we 're going to 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.270
 play in reinforcement type let's how 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.010
 we are going and good as I said this series 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.360

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.850
 that you like I hope you leave your like 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.800
 I hope it does not get the minimum of people 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.240
 white that they want to see me suffer here I 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.590
 I think that would be the most beautiful thing 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.600
 you could do for me to leave me a 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.830
 like for watching me suffer here in this 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.200
 part in this game in this damn 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.510
 game 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.860
 and well let's go against one with the wta is 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 that I am lousy using with and 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:31.019
 the storm generations in 2 likes 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.019
 a lot and I'm disgusting we 're going 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.830
 damn everything well 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.820
 worth mother 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.460
 are they applying my van 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.460
 damn it 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.650
 to minimal efforts stuck 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.950
 all mothers to the most demanded 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.630
 today that I force with those reinforcements so I do not 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.470
 I can do anything already lost the 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.470
 said reinforcements 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.789
 and I learned my two reinforcements of so 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.789
 forces that is the business 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.980
 is that if not keeping at the end like 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.510
 reinforcement 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.510
 and this is bugger hands 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.009
 although I already have them 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.810
 in this you can not have the girl very 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.140
 followed by chinga I changed from that time 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.160
 of pinches attack profile and wood 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.160
 it just comes attacking 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.840
 in fact the meat 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.840
 and that good women publish 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.490
 my biggest problem in this game 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.320
 it was not bad it was not bad however what 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.790
 fart 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.020
 however the reinforcements brought the 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.780
 wey harmed enough about all 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.410
 endorsement and mother tells me bit of 180 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.630
 meters I had them and I tried it in the 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.640
 The main problem was that it had a 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.130
 kick in the eggs and it has been a lot 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.940
 time but good was not so bad 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.570
 band was not a break because the truth 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.840
 is that he played me in a decent way 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.370
 So, well, now, yes, I 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.700
 I will play verse on Sundays especially 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.230
 I'm recording I do not know if on Wednesday or 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.060
 Thursday through Thursday this is recorded by 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.340
 Sundays for good serious both 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.200
 episodes and they look like ok ok 2 good band 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.270
 I've done here, I'm saying goodbye, it's not good 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.270
 leave your like see you next and bye 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.400
