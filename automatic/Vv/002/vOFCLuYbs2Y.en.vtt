00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.280
 today I'm going to show you how to do these 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.810
 beautiful so cute that you tell me today is 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.270
 very easy the first thing that you have to 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.760
 do is untangle your hair and leave it 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.090
 totally smooth to facilitate the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.670
 work 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.890
 You are going to divide your hair into parts with 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.530
 help a clamp and you will take wicks 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.689
 of your hair the first hidden idea 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.849
 of a small plate at the end like 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.010
 what I'm using and the only thing you have 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.830
 what to do is to entangle your hair between 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.830
 iron and stretch it down 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 do not forget to use a protective thermos 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.310
 of hair so as not to burn it or damage it or 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.770
 so that the damage is less 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.950
 the other idea to make one more wave 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.410
 high is to use the iron making a 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.570
 turn inside and turn out 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.570
 as I am doing in the image 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.610
 you will have something like that but on the contrary 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.350
 if you want something much more formed and a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.479
 little more volume in your hair 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.700
 uses a clamp 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.700
 I'm using a revlon clamp 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 Actually what you have to know is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:27.260
 that the less thick the clip 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.510
 the volume of your hair will be better 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.640
 you must wait a few minutes after 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.630
 wrap your street in the clip and you'll have 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.630
 something like this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.399
 repeat this process in all 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 strands of your hair the more 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:47.659
 fine to the baby better the finished 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.659
 of the risk 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.590
 take the other parts of your hair that 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.800
 you said but before that do not forget 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.770
 spray or fixer on those that already 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 performed and hold with a clamp for 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 Do not get off so soon, especially 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.230
 If your street is very very lazy this is going to 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.680
 help so that it does not break down so 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.680
 soon 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.400
 Repeat this process for all your hair 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.930
 and with patience you will have some curls 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.340
 very well formed and very hair 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.340
 loaded with a lot of volume 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.860
 especially when you release the clamps with 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.760
 those that subject themselves to those that already 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.760
 they have fixer 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.350
 you can place yourself a little more so that the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.320
 hairstyle will last you much longer so 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.050
 it's a more natural finish opens the waves 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.210
 with your fingers make a bow this you 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.210
 it will help to have a lot more volume 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.569
 while you make up you read a magazine 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.450
 listen to music or dance your hair 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.560
 will adapt much greater volume than that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.560
 I already had with the waves 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.790
 I like this look because it 's a little 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.069
 dared 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.319
 but I would like you to comment 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.180
 that what they like to use more the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.180
 straight hair on curly hair 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.800
 I hope you liked it very much
