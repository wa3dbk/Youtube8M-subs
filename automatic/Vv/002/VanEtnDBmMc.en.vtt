00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.240
 Hello Hi, please tell me what are you 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 I'm doing 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.980
 cassette fires directly there 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.330
 my steel you and our region 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:24.119
 chimney installation chimney installation 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.210
 stoves here and including fucking come on with 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.859
 you dwell on the bath 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 furnaces 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.670
 please tell me what they are 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.260
 bath stove and advantages and disadvantages 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.980
 can divide the bathnae reason three 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.649
 categories 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.140
 light steel metal to glimpses 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.329
 small 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.700
 heavy heat capacious brick then rather 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.030
 to Russian bath stoves refers as is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.960
 combined something in between 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.760
 metal and heavy heating stove 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 basically most people choose 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.699
 of course now for the lungs that is you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.880
 sweat if such a sad type 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.510
 casters harville and then separate 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 like burzhuek something pluses of course such 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.930
 you drown an hour and a half you have a bath ready 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.600
 but you have to save and constantly 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.180
 cons of such a furnace still hard 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 humidity temperature 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.180
 practically there are more than 10 percent not 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.060
 rises here and if such a comparison 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 the project next to a piece of meat hang and she 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.740
 baked here is a minus for health 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.409
 but quickly comfortably heavy enough 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.590
 heat capacious as if eliminating such minuses 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.640
 nice and good heat warms up 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.820
 body is not high temperature 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 humidity wishes there are up to sixty 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.310
 eighty percent but minus is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.610
 that you have to pay a bath 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.149
 day 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.460
 that is, you have to drown me there from 3 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.649
 till 6 o'clock this reason 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.350
 however during the day you can 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:10.560
 soared that is prepared the stove 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.300
 bath and all not soared cool and maybe 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 be there any subtleties 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.430
 which should pay attention here 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 people are facing a furnace choice 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.190
 there may be some norms there still 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.780
 what is the most important thing of course to draw 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.360
 attention to fire regulations 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.970
 because bath cookies are the most dangerous 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.950
 In this regard, there is very big 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.280
 temperature is reached that is 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.220
 in fact the flame is in the lady enters 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.430
 600 700 to 800 degrees if we break 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.940
 all cuttings are normative we can and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.890
 to burn a bath 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.860
 pay attention to the fire spare 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.300
 there is such a moment that after all 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.790
 Finnish and Turkish Russian bath not 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 differs only in two parameters 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.890
 temperature and humidity all that is if 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 we make it wet there 90 percent and 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.660
 temperature is about 40 degrees 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.799
 will there be a Turkish bath will we do 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.360
 60 degrees and wet there 60 80 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.760
 percent off and russian bath 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.090
 well, if we make a wet plant 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.400
 percent 10 there is then 120 same films 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.640
 company parameters only 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.799
 temperature and humidity that is at 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.109
 the choice of food is certainly worth it 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.540
 pay attention to what a person is 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.670
 wants to add what he has here 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.590
 these two parameters are gentle and well 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.900
 respectively, that is, from the sauna 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.670
 Finnish no longer achieve a humidity of 80 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.790
 percent but rides options like how 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.910
 combinations 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.570
 if you can say so let Finnish 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.519
 sauna and parallel it is a steam generator 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.620
 new people do not go as a rule 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.900
 saves money 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.760
 well, I heard the last question 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.280
 you recently designed your 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.680
 heating stove need something 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.829
 briefly tell the guy 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:12.170
 Well, it's like new concepts, something 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:14.659
 average not even three days small liver 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.930
 heat capacious that is, it weighs 500 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.350
 kilo pluses and definitely in that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.520
 it is very fast at the facility 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:29.030
 24 hours this is possible without connection 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.699
 connect through the flap that is essentially 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.120
 This is a kind of replacement for cooking stoves. 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:38.780
 cooking cookies are not very nice so 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.440
 let's say and this we will have to say more 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.780
 aesthetic laurel will i be there it is very 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.240
 interesting but we think about it with you 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.240
 tell you the next interview thank you
