and<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.280> flop<00:01:31.429> comes<00:01:31.460> King<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.090> five<00:01:32.360> well<00:01:32.990> if

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
and the flop comes King for five well if

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.779 
and the flop comes King for five well if
you<00:01:33.140> you<00:01:33.380> catch<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.799> King<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.190> flop<00:01:34.429> it

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
you you catch that King on the flop it

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.190 
you you catch that King on the flop it
really<00:01:35.000> sucked<00:01:35.330> into<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.600> river<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.049> if

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
really sucked into the river and if

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.359 
really sucked into the river and if
somebody<00:01:36.440> has<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> better<00:01:36.830> kicker<00:01:37.039> than<00:01:37.250> you

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
somebody has a better kicker than you

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.279 
somebody has a better kicker than you
ace<00:01:37.759> king<00:01:38.119> or<00:01:38.240> king<00:01:38.390> queen<00:01:38.630> you're<00:01:39.080> just<00:01:39.200> gonna

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
ace king or king queen you're just gonna

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.950 
ace king or king queen you're just gonna
be<00:01:39.440> losing<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:39.709> lot<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.069> money<00:01:40.220> with<00:01:40.369> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.140 

probably<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> trickiest<00:01:47.190> hands<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.820> play<00:01:47.940> are

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
probably the trickiest hands to play are

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.969 
probably the trickiest hands to play are
those<00:01:48.270> pesky<00:01:48.630> middle<00:01:49.110> pairs<00:01:49.350> I'll<00:01:49.799> talk<00:01:49.950> about

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
those pesky middle pairs I'll talk about

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
those pesky middle pairs I'll talk about
Jack's<00:01:50.430> tens<00:01:50.880> nines<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> even<00:01:51.960> eights<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
Jack's tens nines and even eights really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
Jack's tens nines and even eights really
now<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:53.549> early<00:01:53.880> position<00:01:54.060> there's<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.810> couple

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
now from early position there's a couple

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.140 
now from early position there's a couple
ways<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.260> can<00:01:55.350> approach<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.740> limping<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.909> sort

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
ways you can approach it limping is sort

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.660 
ways you can approach it limping is sort
of<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.390> cautious<00:01:58.110> way<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.770> see<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.369> happens

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of a cautious way to see what happens

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
of a cautious way to see what happens
behind<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.720> generally<00:02:01.470> it<00:02:02.130> goes<00:02:02.280> along

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
behind you but generally it goes along

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580 
behind you but generally it goes along
with<00:02:02.610> my<00:02:02.820> style<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.540> would<00:02:03.659> be<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> raise<00:02:04.110> with

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
with my style it would be to raise with

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.899 
with my style it would be to raise with
these<00:02:04.740> hands<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> try<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> sort<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.700> isolate

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
these hands and try to sort of isolate

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
these hands and try to sort of isolate
and<00:02:06.450> maybe<00:02:06.750> play<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.020> against<00:02:07.290> one<00:02:07.409> opponent

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and maybe play it against one opponent

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.190 
and maybe play it against one opponent
now<00:02:08.399> from<00:02:08.640> middle<00:02:08.880> position<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:09.989> depend

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
now from middle position it would depend

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.570 
now from middle position it would depend
on<00:02:10.319> what<00:02:10.500> happened<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.890> head<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.280> if

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
on what happened the head of you if

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520 
on what happened the head of you if
nobody's<00:02:12.090> raised<00:02:12.300> yet<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:12.930> again<00:02:13.200> you'd

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
nobody's raised yet well again you'd

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.660 
nobody's raised yet well again you'd
play<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.250> would<00:02:14.400> in<00:02:14.459> early

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
play just like you would in early

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.820 
play just like you would in early
position<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.209> you're<00:02:15.480> raised<00:02:15.690> however<00:02:16.500> if

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
position and you're raised however if

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.050 
position and you're raised however if
somebody's<00:02:17.190> already<00:02:17.310> raised<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.760> front<00:02:17.910> of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
somebody's already raised in front of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.520 
somebody's already raised in front of
you<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:18.600> looking<00:02:18.720> down<00:02:18.989> into<00:02:19.200> eights

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you and you're looking down into eights

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.890 
you and you're looking down into eights
I<00:02:19.800> don't<00:02:20.790> know<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.180> guys<00:02:21.330> are<00:02:21.360> raising<00:02:21.540> really

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
I don't know the guys are raising really

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.030 
I don't know the guys are raising really
position<00:02:22.260> chances<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.650> he's<00:02:22.739> got<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> real

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
position chances are he's got a real

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830 
position chances are he's got a real
good<00:02:23.160> hand<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.760> eight<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.269> think<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.690> would

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
good hand with eight I think I would

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.630 
good hand with eight I think I would
just<00:02:24.930> call<00:02:25.260> there<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> flop<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.400> catch

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
just call there and see a flop you catch

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.120 
just call there and see a flop you catch
an<00:02:26.760> eight<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.420> we've<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> real<00:02:28.080> hand<00:02:28.350> from

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
an eight now we've got a real hand from

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.070 
an eight now we've got a real hand from
late<00:02:29.280> position<00:02:29.760> if<00:02:30.180> nobody's<00:02:30.660> enter<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> pot

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
late position if nobody's enter the pot

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
late position if nobody's enter the pot
yet<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.620> perfect<00:02:32.250> kind<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.760> hand<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.090> want

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.130 
can two eights or two nines be good
that's<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.880> save<00:02:45.239> some<00:02:45.450> money<00:02:45.540> throw

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that's the time to save some money throw

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.900 
that's the time to save some money throw
it<00:02:46.230> away<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.800> don't<00:02:47.010> find<00:02:47.280> yourself<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> bad

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it away and don't find yourself in a bad

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.790 
it away and don't find yourself in a bad
spot<00:02:48.239> with<00:02:48.420> eight<00:02:48.630> up<00:02:48.900> against<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.319> bigger<00:02:49.560> pair

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
spot with eight up against a bigger pair

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.720 
spot with eight up against a bigger pair
like<00:02:50.010> Queens<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.579> kings<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.430> need<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.670> be

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
like Queens or kings you need to be

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.920 
like Queens or kings you need to be
really<00:02:56.970> careful<00:02:57.180> when<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:57.570> playing<00:02:57.750> small

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
really careful when your playing small

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.569 
really careful when your playing small
pairs<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.799> early<00:02:59.130> position

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
pairs in early position

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.520 
pairs in early position
I<00:02:59.730> advise<00:03:00.299> just<00:03:00.329> limping<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.290> trying<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I advise just limping in and trying to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.920 
I advise just limping in and trying to
see<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.739> flop<00:03:01.920> cheaply<00:03:02.549> now<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.420> could<00:03:03.660> fold

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
see the flop cheaply now you could fold

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.300 
see the flop cheaply now you could fold
and<00:03:04.260> that's<00:03:04.500> probably<00:03:04.739> what<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.010> books<00:03:05.190> would

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
and that's probably what the books would
