00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
think it's not the pressure definitely

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.679 
think it's not the pressure definitely
not<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> pressure<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.479> think<00:01:27.630> he

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
not the pressure because I think he

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
not the pressure because I think he
thrives<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:28.610> yes<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
thrives on it but don't yes I was like I

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.530
