00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
 we 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.400
 Hello dear friends, your maracasi 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.040
 and today I would like to show you 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.580
 team battle and generally a few words 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.930
 say about this mode i play along with 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.289
 tap and with players who 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.810
 automatically we got here 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.330
 against pretty serious guys not in 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.420
 In principle, good statistics show that 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.909
 they often hang in these team battles 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.080
 and that means it will not be easy for us 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:43.299
 because I am not the most experienced commander 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.670
 and in general I do not tell in detail there 

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:48.790
 where to go where to get up about 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.159
 this square but already there from skill 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 acting players are drooling they can play 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.640
 then of course they will drag there so here I am 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.739
 So I decided to distribute a team of three 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.339
 heavy tanks on the center because they 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:08.259
 if they can hold back a blow and 50100 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:11.890
 su 122 44 we have on the brilliant way crane 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.180
 on this bird he is a type of farm and we also have 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.439
 there is t2lt 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.869
 he is like the light of us who knows ul t2lt 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:23.350
 his review is very bad somewhere 260 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.679
 meters for a discount and it's basically just 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.049
 with horns can normally shine at all 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.109
 I believe that a team battle and not completely 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.030
 bad of course 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:38.229
 flaws in playing a bit pretty 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.600
 interesting fights do not last long often 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 throw against not very experienced players 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.119
 it 's like a plus such a minus 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.299
 principle throws and against serious 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.549
 teams as it is now necessary 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.799
 really sweat coming up 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.770
 tactics every player needs to say that 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.560
 he needs to do otherwise maybe 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.579
 confusion right now we are very much 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.030
 stretched out 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.090
 and enemy light tanks are traveling on Zelenka 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.429
 of course they are dying but it's not just like that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.340
 opponents cook here rush is not 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.170
 shine now to the crane he has thrown 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.220
 says there are several tanks on Zelenka 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.250
 barely he hid in the lowland now very 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.770
 I would need a light t2lt but I sent it 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.260
 mistakenly thinking that the opponents 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.180
 this setup will not be rashit on Zelenka 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.450
 and here we are still shining 1390 from above and here 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.650
 opponents still here I began to embroider 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.590
 distracted while saying what to do and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.440
 enemy tanks are snapping up on the crane we 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.470
 of course immediately begin to cram in 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.510
 the board in principle our position is not that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.630
 too bad maybe even enemies 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.660
 We expected that we will be here and we 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.730
 We are beginning to actively tune with those straight 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.730
 on board and that's basically not bad 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.080
 it turned out we have the top ten we immediately 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.170
 took away the truth 1390 shot us the board here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.230
 but it's not a big loss from me yet 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.959
 provtykal could have fired on the fcm 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.450
 It is worth noting our 50100 which 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.269
 time made the legs end up saving and 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.510
 kept us trunk that is very important 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.600
 and the opponents took only one crane 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.140
 of course we will avenge him and for now 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.570
 we win though not very strong in 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.450
 principle I like this team fights 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.109
 that much depends on it 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.750
 individual skill 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.230
 but of course the team actions here too 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.410
 means a lot but one player and here 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.720
 can do more than for example 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.609
 in those latitudes and we are still waiting 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.299
 leave can not be attacked because 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.450
 if we go 1390 will start shooting us at 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.609
 poop and it will be very bad because of what 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.549
 I have to wait for now but tell you 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.410
 some more team battles like i already 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.350
 they said not bad but personally to me 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.359
 liked at least the fights there 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.389
 Do not last long, that is, let's go on it 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.289
 dynamic though there are of course such 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:21.079
 difficult fights when you have to wait 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.210
 against strong rivals but usually everything 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.540
 ends in the first 5 minutes 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.240
 which is generally very good 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.790
 as well as we often fall against the weak 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.990
 teams do not know what it is connected with 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.270
 just be lucky 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.900
 but it seems to me so far in these battles 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 plays a lot of inexperienced players and strong 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.620
 the team they have something and can really 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.210
 have a pretty high chance of winning 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.700
 as it seemed to me in this mode 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.860
 you can farm very well because 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.630
 that fights fast and as I said and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.210
 can spend more 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.370
 besides, it seemed to me that the loans 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.340
 give out and experience more slaughtering if 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.650
 you win maybe even coefficient 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.830
 higher than usual but I can 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.010
 mistaken of course but in general farm 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.970
 Iâ€™ve gotten pretty good at 50,000 I 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.300
 even on goldie took out calmly that I 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.430
 I consider very good results 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.120
 but back to the events that occurred 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.790
 in battle, I saw that t2lt pulled up to the base 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.310
 and it broke 1390 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.890
 I realized that you need to push because 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.080
 now there are fewer opponents and we 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:36.650
 should their just the amount now 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.260
 crush 1 get all our damage out of 3 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.400
 although I had to go because u 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.390
 me most hp 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.050
 Well, how did the trick of this Isa 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.750
 third and of course she has no chance 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.910
 we get it now need faster 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.060
 go and get the last here 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.230
 enemy is and fcm 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.870
 1390 is coming now too, but we have 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:07.070
 shot 3 so i have to tank y 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:10.640
 I have a lot of hp 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.130
 do still have 1390's he 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.290
 center shoots kill isa third 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:21.230
 I leave quickly start to come down so 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:24.080
 as I have experienced set the third big 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.009
 I certainly get 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:32.090
 all is well left only to get 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:34.370
 1390 we are glad here in principle it is good that 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.039
 we went to the attack because if 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.740
 this 1390 would not do that later 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:42.139
 recharge and continue again 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.159
 It was well left to take this 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.599
 light french tank and such here 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:50.449
 impressions of my team battles 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:53.270
 Basically, a lot like me definitely 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:54.219
 back to them and on this friends I swami 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.690
 say goodbye 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.690
 successful fights for you
