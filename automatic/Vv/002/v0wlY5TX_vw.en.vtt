00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
feet on both floors both F and B is set

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
feet on both floors both F and B is set
to<00:00:25.830> 8<00:00:26.039> feet<00:00:26.369> he<00:00:26.880> would<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> change<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.689> so

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
to 8 feet he would like to change it so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.460 
to 8 feet he would like to change it so
it's<00:00:28.230> 9<00:00:28.650> feet<00:00:29.039> below<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.670> 8<00:00:29.910> foot<00:00:30.449> above<00:00:30.900> now

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it's 9 feet below an 8 foot above now

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
it's 9 feet below an 8 foot above now
you<00:00:31.529> can<00:00:31.769> do<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.099> one<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.610> time<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you can do this one at a time in the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.660 
you can do this one at a time in the
specifications<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
specifications so you can just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
specifications so you can just
automatically<00:00:36.360> type<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.200> let's<00:00:37.440> say<00:00:37.649> we

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
automatically type in like let's say we

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.880 
automatically type in like let's say we
put<00:00:37.980> 109<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> 1/8<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.260> hit<00:00:40.469> tab<00:00:40.860> on

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
put 109 and 1/8 here and I hit tab on

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
put 109 and 1/8 here and I hit tab on
the<00:00:41.100> keyboard<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:42.210> will<00:00:42.270> adjust<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.469> plan

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the keyboard this will adjust the plan

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.389 
the keyboard this will adjust the plan
so<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.579> 9<00:00:45.360> feet<00:00:45.719> below<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.440> 8<00:00:47.010> feet

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so there is 9 feet below and 8 feet

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.150 
so there is 9 feet below and 8 feet
above<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:48.320> look<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.829> actually

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
above well look at it it actually

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340 
above well look at it it actually
changed<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> 85<00:00:51.149> inches<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
changed it to 85 inches so it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
changed it to 85 inches so it
compensated<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> already<00:00:54.000> existing

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
compensated for the already existing

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.569 
compensated for the already existing
roof<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
roof that you have so you have to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.930 
roof that you have so you have to
manually<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.859> 97<00:00:59.760> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
manually then go into this and go 97 and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
manually then go into this and go 97 and
1/8<00:01:00.870> inch<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> they've

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
1/8 inch and there it go and they've

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
1/8 inch and there it go and they've
forced<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.840> instead<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.320> going

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
forced it in but instead of going

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
forced it in but instead of going
through<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> trouble<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.939> making<00:01:06.890> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
through the trouble of making that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.490 
through the trouble of making that
happen<00:01:08.220> through<00:01:08.820> every<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.450> room<00:01:09.810> the

it manually but if you want to quickly

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.050 
it manually but if you want to quickly
switch<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> should<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.879> just

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
switch it to what it should be you just

make<00:02:09.300> sure<00:02:09.330> there's<00:02:09.720> default<00:02:10.229> checks<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.830> all

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
make sure there's default checks in all

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.140 
make sure there's default checks in all
the<00:02:11.099> room<00:02:11.310> gonna<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.180> here

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
the room gonna go in here

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.880 
the room gonna go in here
the<00:02:13.329> defaults<00:02:13.750> are<00:02:13.900> checked<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:14.620> good<00:02:14.860> to

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the defaults are checked so it's good to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.699 
the defaults are checked so it's good to
go<00:02:15.370> it'll<00:02:15.909> automatically<00:02:16.629> set<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> way

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
go it'll automatically set it to the way

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.910 
go it'll automatically set it to the way
it<00:02:17.829> was<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.939> let's<00:02:19.150> say<00:02:19.360> this<00:02:19.629> room<00:02:19.989> was<00:02:20.379> jacked

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it was so let's say this room was jacked

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.210 
it was so let's say this room was jacked
up<00:02:21.129> like<00:02:21.459> at<00:02:21.700> 84<00:02:22.269> inches<00:02:22.599> or<00:02:22.840> something<00:02:23.049> if<00:02:23.829> I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
up like at 84 inches or something if I

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.149 
up like at 84 inches or something if I
wanted<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.579> simply<00:02:24.970> solve<00:02:25.329> it<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.829> would<00:02:26.829> double

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
wanted to simply solve it I would double

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.910 
wanted to simply solve it I would double
click<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.989> click<00:02:28.989> on<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.290> default<00:02:29.439> and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
click it and click on the default and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.740 
click it and click on the default and
it'll<00:02:30.189> set<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.579> back<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:31.000> what<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.269> should<00:02:31.299> be

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
it'll set it back to what it should be

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.069 
it'll set it back to what it should be
as<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.129> was<00:02:33.129> registered<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.970> defaults<00:02:34.450> so

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
as it was registered in the defaults so

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.990 
as it was registered in the defaults so
that's<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.379> simple<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:35.950> easy<00:02:36.129> way<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.579> change

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
that's the simple and easy way to change

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.199 
that's the simple and easy way to change
