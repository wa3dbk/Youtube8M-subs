00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 I record the recipes in the afternoon 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 Then we dine what I have recorded. 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.150

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.220
 fast food but if it is to choose a self 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.080
