basically all I did was I got two
flathead<00:00:21.750> screwdrivers<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.910> get<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
flathead screwdrivers you get up in the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.839 
flathead screwdrivers you get up in the
spring<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.439> under<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> spring<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.580> little

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
spring here under the spring is little

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
spring here under the spring is little
circle<00:00:27.269> plate<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.310> pry<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.710> then

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
circle plate you just pry it up and then

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.740 
circle plate you just pry it up and then
basically<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> circle<00:00:33.239> plate<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.719> have

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
basically on the circle plate you have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.069 
basically on the circle plate you have
like<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.610> big<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.270> drive<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> figure<00:00:36.989> eight

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
like a big you drive like a figure eight

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
like a big you drive like a figure eight
with<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.309> big<00:00:38.610> hole<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.510> valve<00:00:39.719> fits

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with one big hole that the valve fits

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
with one big hole that the valve fits
into<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.879> hole

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
into and then you have one little hole

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.350 
into and then you have one little hole
and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.890> little<00:00:47.129> notch<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> on

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and then that little notch on the on

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
and then that little notch on the on
there<00:00:48.870> fits<00:00:49.530> inside<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.039> little<00:00:50.250> hole<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
there fits inside the little hole and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.150 
there fits inside the little hole and
then<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:51.180> valve<00:00:51.360> won't<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> able<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> go<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.230> so

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then the valve won't be able to go up so

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
then the valve won't be able to go up so
the<00:00:53.280> valve<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:53.730> come<00:00:53.910> out<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the valve can't come out so to get the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.319 
the valve can't come out so to get the
valve<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.129> pry<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
valve out you pry it up and then you

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.080 
valve out you pry it up and then you
sort<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> flick<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> circle<00:00:59.070> bit<00:00:59.250> with<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
sort of flick that circle bit with the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
sort of flick that circle bit with the
whole<00:01:00.239> spring<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.840> get<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.230> flat<00:01:01.620> heads<00:01:01.859> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
whole spring you get two flat heads and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
whole spring you get two flat heads and
you<00:01:02.879> push<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> over<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.899> until<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.070> valve

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you push this over a bit until the valve

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
you push this over a bit until the valve
pops<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:06.360> through<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> big<00:01:07.110> hole<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.500> then

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
pops out through the big hole and then

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.310 
pops out through the big hole and then
you<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.040> valve<00:01:08.220> out<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.780> yeah

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you can get your valve out and then yeah

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.789 
you can get your valve out and then yeah

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that then I'll try the lawnmower shop as

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.639 
that then I'll try the lawnmower shop as
well<00:01:50.689> I'm<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:51.960> sure<00:01:52.259> where<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> get

I'm<00:01:59.280> thinking<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.640> shading<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> eyebrows

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
I'm thinking of shading the eyebrows

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.840 
I'm thinking of shading the eyebrows
just<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> file<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.520> other<00:02:02.610> words

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
just with like a file so in other words

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.209 
just with like a file so in other words
I'm<00:02:02.939> not<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.149> shaving<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.740> basically

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
I'm not really shaving them so basically

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.270 
I'm not really shaving them so basically
I'll<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.610> get<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> file<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.860> from<00:02:07.860> all<00:02:08.129> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.330 
I'll just get a file and from all this
black<00:02:08.550> crap<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.149> I'll<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.170> pile<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.860> over

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340

there
old<00:02:12.750> nice

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
old nice

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.580 
old nice
file<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.520> down<00:02:15.080> until<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.560> a

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
file it all down until I have like a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.060 
file it all down until I have like a
nice<00:02:17.480> grew<00:02:18.480> from<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:21.050> downwards<00:02:22.070> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
nice grew from about there downwards so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.550 
nice grew from about there downwards so
that<00:02:23.100> bent<00:02:23.790> sort<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:24.330> carbon<00:02:24.810> mark<00:02:25.050> gives<00:02:25.380> me<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that bent sort of carbon mark gives me a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.330 
that bent sort of carbon mark gives me a
really<00:02:25.860> good<00:02:26.100> example<00:02:26.820> where<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.920> grind<00:02:28.920> or

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
really good example where to grind or

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.090 
really good example where to grind or
file<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.350> reckon<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> file<00:02:31.620> should<00:02:31.890> work

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
file I reckon the file should work

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
file I reckon the file should work
really<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:32.520> because<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.000> quite<00:02:33.420> soft

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
really well because it's quite soft

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.820 
really well because it's quite soft
aluminium<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:36.000> not<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> file

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
aluminium here if not because the file

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.620 
aluminium here if not because the file
seems<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.400> best<00:02:38.520> way<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.820> get<00:02:41.300> very<00:02:42.300> accurate

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
seems the best way to get very accurate

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.800 
seems the best way to get very accurate
I<00:02:43.140> don't<00:02:44.040> really<00:02:44.610> think<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.910> dremel<00:02:45.330> would<00:02:45.450> be

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
I don't really think a dremel would be

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.000 
I don't really think a dremel would be
very<00:02:46.050> accurate<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.740> might<00:02:46.860> like

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
very accurate because it might like

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.130 
very accurate because it might like
sleeping<00:02:47.550> in<00:02:47.700> grind<00:02:48.300> over<00:02:48.600> here<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:48.900> something

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
sleeping in grind over here or something

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.530 
sleeping in grind over here or something
like<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.650> yeah<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.030> I'm<00:02:51.090> gonna<00:02:51.240> let<00:02:51.390> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
like that so yeah so I'm gonna let the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.680 
like that so yeah so I'm gonna let the
valves<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.050> shave<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.590> eyebrows<00:02:53.570> you're<00:02:54.570> not

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
valves and shave the eyebrows you're not

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.000 
valves and shave the eyebrows you're not
going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> get<00:02:54.960> ahead<00:02:55.110> from<00:02:55.410> here<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.680> know<00:02:55.950> if

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
going to get ahead from here I know if

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
going to get ahead from here I know if
that<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.340> find<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.030> or<00:02:57.240> we'll<00:02:57.420> try<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.750> find<00:02:58.020> it

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that go find it or we'll try to find it

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.380 
that go find it or we'll try to find it
if<00:02:58.590> he<00:02:58.740> does<00:02:58.950> then<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.670> he<00:02:59.880> doesn't<00:03:00.060> then<00:03:00.330> I

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
if he does then if he doesn't then I

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.180 
if he does then if he doesn't then I
just<00:03:00.540> got<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> tip<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.200> try<00:03:01.440> find<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.770> head<00:03:01.950> and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
just got a tip and try find a head and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.670 
just got a tip and try find a head and
then<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.720> put<00:03:03.990> this<00:03:04.080> little<00:03:04.200> engine<00:03:04.410> back

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
then I can put this little engine back

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.950 
then I can put this little engine back
together<00:03:04.880> took<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> side<00:03:06.180> cover<00:03:06.420> off<00:03:06.630> only<00:03:06.840> at

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
together took the side cover off only at

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.020 
together took the side cover off only at
25<00:03:07.260> seconds<00:03:07.530> took<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.250> side<00:03:08.430> cover<00:03:08.700> off<00:03:08.880> and

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
25 seconds took the side cover off and

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.320 
25 seconds took the side cover off and
the<00:03:09.750> prediction<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.530> muggy<00:03:11.070> oil<00:03:11.400> crap<00:03:11.970> was

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
the prediction of the muggy oil crap was

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.980 
the prediction of the muggy oil crap was
true<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:13.470> you<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.740> see<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.720> don't<00:03:15.720> know<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:15.930> you

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
true if you can see I don't know if you

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.200 
true if you can see I don't know if you
can<00:03:16.080> see<00:03:16.200> down<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:16.650> like<00:03:16.860> gummy<00:03:17.460> greasy

can see down there so like gummy greasy

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.450 
can see down there so like gummy greasy
looking<00:03:18.510> oil<00:03:18.750> where<00:03:19.710> should<00:03:19.890> be<00:03:20.010> oil<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.370> I'll

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
looking oil where should be oil so I'll

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.260 
looking oil where should be oil so I'll
clean<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.730> up

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270
