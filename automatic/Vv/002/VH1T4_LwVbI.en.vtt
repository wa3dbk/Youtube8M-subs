00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
rather than just book learning they

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.430 
rather than just book learning they
might<00:02:02.119> go<00:02:02.270> out<00:02:02.479> into<00:02:02.720> nature

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
it culminates in our honor program and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.440 
it culminates in our honor program and
what<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.710> is<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.700> last<00:02:14.210> couple

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450

what that is is that in the last couple
months<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:14.960> student's<00:02:15.320> program<00:02:15.680> our

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
months of a student's program our

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.590
