fact<00:02:01.580> that<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.819> horse<00:02:02.000> is<00:02:02.209> by<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.500> Wildcat

fact that the horse is by the Wildcat

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.570 
fact that the horse is by the Wildcat
now<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.580> Wildcat<00:02:05.239> is<00:02:05.869> loan<00:02:06.289> grade<00:02:06.619> one<00:02:06.890> came

going<00:02:10.069> six<00:02:10.310> furlongs<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:10.849> I<00:02:10.879> think<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.330> based

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
going six furlongs so I think that based

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.589 
going six furlongs so I think that based
on<00:02:12.050> breeding<00:02:12.500> there<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.370> little<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.390> a

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
on breeding there is a little bit of a

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.630 
on breeding there is a little bit of a
concern<00:02:14.900> there<00:02:15.140> with<00:02:15.620> Wildcat<00:02:16.099> red<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.459> for

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
concern there with Wildcat red but for

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.940 
concern there with Wildcat red but for
me<00:02:16.790> Wildcat<00:02:17.750> red<00:02:17.930> has<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> little<00:02:18.440> bit<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.680> a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
me Wildcat red has a little bit of a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.220 
me Wildcat red has a little bit of a
look<00:02:19.160> like<00:02:19.640> tuples<00:02:20.150> buried<00:02:20.420> here<00:02:20.570> tuples<00:02:21.050> Berg

back<00:02:21.770> in<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> day<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.370> horse<00:02:22.790> was<00:02:23.000> really

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
back in the day that horse was really

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.309 
back in the day that horse was really
fast<00:02:23.750> on<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.020> front

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
fast on the front

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.080 
fast on the front
and<00:02:24.409> he<00:02:24.530> had<00:02:24.620> some<00:02:24.799> really<00:02:25.099> fast<00:02:25.400> maiden

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
and he had some really fast maiden

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.220 
and he had some really fast maiden
special<00:02:26.120> weight<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.870> then<00:02:26.959> he<00:02:27.079> actually

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
special weight and then he actually

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.979 
special weight and then he actually
pulled<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.709> upset<00:02:27.739> over<00:02:28.549> hard<00:02:28.849> spun<00:02:29.150> leading

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
pulled the upset over hard spun leading

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.929 
pulled the upset over hard spun leading
up<00:02:30.139> to<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.379> Arkansas<00:02:30.769> Derby<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.310> he<00:02:31.700> was<00:02:31.819> able

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
up to the Arkansas Derby so he was able

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.250 
up to the Arkansas Derby so he was able
to<00:02:32.090> stretch<00:02:32.329> out<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.629> speed<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:33.109> bit

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
to stretch out that speed a little bit

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.339 
to stretch out that speed a little bit
longer<00:02:33.499> so<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.189> wildcat<00:02:34.790> read<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.359> think<00:02:36.019> that<00:02:36.079> if

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
longer so a wildcat read I think that if

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.289 
longer so a wildcat read I think that if
he<00:02:36.439> does<00:02:36.590> go<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.950> Derby<00:02:37.249> it<00:02:37.430> does<00:02:37.700> ensure

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
he does go to the Derby it does ensure

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.660 
he does go to the Derby it does ensure
another<00:02:38.810> really<00:02:39.230> hot<00:02:39.379> pace<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:40.189> I<00:02:40.249> see<00:02:40.459> him<00:02:40.549> as

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
another really hot pace do I see him as

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.580 
another really hot pace do I see him as
a<00:02:40.700> legitimate<00:02:41.000> Kentucky<00:02:41.719> Derby<00:02:41.959> contender<00:02:42.439> I

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
a legitimate Kentucky Derby contender I

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.259 
a legitimate Kentucky Derby contender I
think<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.370> he's<00:02:43.459> got<00:02:43.639> the<00:02:43.760> talent<00:02:43.939> to<00:02:44.120> be<00:02:44.239> a

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
think that he's got the talent to be a

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.879 
think that he's got the talent to be a
really<00:02:44.629> nice<00:02:44.810> horse<00:02:45.109> but<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.439> do<00:02:45.530> think<00:02:45.799> that

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
really nice horse but I do think that

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.289 
really nice horse but I do think that
the<00:02:46.010> mile<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.159> a<00:02:46.310> quarter<00:02:46.459> is<00:02:46.700> gonna<00:02:46.909> be<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> big

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
the mile and a quarter is gonna be a big

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.390 
the mile and a quarter is gonna be a big
stretch<00:02:47.659> I<00:02:47.840> think<00:02:48.079> if<00:02:48.170> they<00:02:48.230> decide<00:02:48.560> to<00:02:48.590> go<00:02:48.920> as

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
stretch I think if they decide to go as

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.789 
stretch I think if they decide to go as
you're<00:02:49.670> looking<00:02:49.790> at<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.290> pedigree<00:02:51.290> tree<00:02:51.560> the

Wildcat on the top side to me it just

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.640 
Wildcat on the top side to me it just
looks<00:02:54.799> a<00:02:55.040> little<00:02:55.310> bit<00:02:55.489> more<00:02:55.930> like<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.109> really

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
looks a little bit more like a really

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.009 
looks a little bit more like a really
fast<00:02:58.040> six<00:02:58.760> or<00:02:58.879> seven<00:02:58.939> for<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.359> long<00:02:59.510> time<00:02:59.719> Ford

fast six or seven for a long time Ford

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.929 
fast six or seven for a long time Ford
he<00:03:00.439> stretched<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.859> speed<00:03:01.069> out<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.549> took

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
he stretched the speed out and took

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.629 
he stretched the speed out and took
advantage<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.629> a<00:03:02.750> pace<00:03:03.129> favoring<00:03:04.129> racetrack

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
advantage of a pace favoring racetrack

advantage of a pace favoring racetrack
at<00:03:04.879> gulfstream<00:03:05.569> park<00:03:05.599> but<00:03:06.379> he<00:03:06.469> is<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.590> hard

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
at gulfstream park but he is a hard

at gulfstream park but he is a hard
Trier<00:03:07.189> and<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.609> think<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.090> having<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:08.959> speed

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
Trier and I think that having that speed

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.170 
Trier and I think that having that speed
and<00:03:09.620> being<00:03:09.980> able<00:03:10.099> to<00:03:10.310> carry<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.730> amount<00:03:11.090> of

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
maybe a little bit longer as we get

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.569 
maybe a little bit longer as we get
closer<00:03:14.419> to<00:03:14.659> the<00:03:14.750> Derby<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.260> think<00:03:15.919> similar<00:03:16.370> to

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
closer to the Derby I think similar to

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.250 
closer to the Derby I think similar to
let's<00:03:16.849> say<00:03:16.939> tryn<00:03:17.209> avert<00:03:17.419> who<00:03:17.780> ironically

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
let's say tryn avert who ironically

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.619 
let's say tryn avert who ironically
enough<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> son<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.340> tuples<00:03:19.939> Berg<00:03:20.150> who<00:03:20.359> kind

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
enough is a son of tuples Berg who kind

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.569 
enough is a son of tuples Berg who kind
of<00:03:20.719> fits<00:03:20.870> that<00:03:20.989> same<00:03:21.169> profile<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:21.829> think<00:03:22.430> that

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
of fits that same profile I think that

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.550 
of fits that same profile I think that
Wildcat<00:03:22.939> red<00:03:23.180> might<00:03:23.659> be<00:03:23.810> one<00:03:23.930> of<00:03:24.019> those<00:03:24.109> horses

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
Wildcat red might be one of those horses

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.860 
Wildcat red might be one of those horses
that<00:03:24.739> has<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.430> lot<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.760> talent<00:03:26.180> gifts<00:03:26.689> to<00:03:26.780> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
that has a lot of talent gifts to the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.649 
that has a lot of talent gifts to the
Derby<00:03:27.230> sets<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.980> pace<00:03:28.189> and<00:03:28.579> then<00:03:28.939> finds<00:03:29.569> out

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
Derby sets the pace and then finds out

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.969 
Derby sets the pace and then finds out
that<00:03:29.689> amount<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.139> quarters<00:03:30.409> too<00:03:30.530> much<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
that amount of quarters too much and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.039 
that amount of quarters too much and
then<00:03:31.099> might<00:03:31.310> later<00:03:31.819> on<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.209> year<00:03:32.239> go<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:32.900> to

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
then might later on in the year go on to

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.569 
then might later on in the year go on to
be<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.199> really<00:03:33.500> nice<00:03:33.680> sprinter<00:03:34.099> if<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:34.340> look<00:03:34.459> at

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
be a really nice sprinter if you look at

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.399 
be a really nice sprinter if you look at
some<00:03:34.729> of<00:03:34.819> those<00:03:34.909> seven<00:03:35.569> furlong<00:03:35.930> races<00:03:36.319> like

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
some of those seven furlong races like

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.349 
some of those seven furlong races like
the<00:03:36.530> woody<00:03:36.709> Stephens<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.489> New<00:03:37.849> York<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.209> think

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
the woody Stephens in New York I think

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.179 
the woody Stephens in New York I think
that<00:03:38.599> would<00:03:38.659> be<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:39.049> really<00:03:39.500> good<00:03:39.680> spot<00:03:39.919> later

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189
