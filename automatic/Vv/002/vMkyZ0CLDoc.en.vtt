at<00:04:39.820> first<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.270> thought<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.660> was<00:04:40.870> just<00:04:41.020> having<00:04:41.230> an

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
at first I thought I was just having an

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.130 
at first I thought I was just having an
experience<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.640> had<00:04:42.940> initiated<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.960> was

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
experience that I had initiated and was

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.000 
experience that I had initiated and was
you<00:04:44.470> know<00:04:44.560> going<00:04:45.100> flying<00:04:45.460> somewhere<00:04:45.790> but<00:04:46.480> I

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
you know going flying somewhere but I

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.220 
you know going flying somewhere but I
think<00:04:48.010> now<00:04:48.190> what<00:04:48.460> my<00:04:49.060> interpretation<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.900> of

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
think now what my interpretation is of

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.010 
think now what my interpretation is of
it<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.710> is<00:04:50.980> that<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.370> UFO<00:04:52.330> would<00:04:52.630> have<00:04:52.750> dropped

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
it is is that a UFO would have dropped

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.430 
it is is that a UFO would have dropped
down<00:04:53.260> into<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.800> house<00:04:54.420> and<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:56.110> house<00:04:56.230> not

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
down into the house and the house not

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.890 
down into the house and the house not
being<00:04:56.500> an<00:04:56.800> obstacle<00:04:57.130> for<00:04:57.280> it<00:04:57.720> basically<00:04:58.720> down

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
being an obstacle for it basically down

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.050 
being an obstacle for it basically down
into<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.320> space<00:04:59.560> around<00:04:59.770> the<00:05:00.010> bedroom<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.790> my

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
into the space around the bedroom and my

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.430 
into the space around the bedroom and my
god<00:05:01.770> sort<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:02.920> pulled<00:05:03.760> me<00:05:03.910> out<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.120> body<00:05:04.440> into

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
god sort of pulled me out of body into

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.960 
god sort of pulled me out of body into
the<00:05:05.470> UFO<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.160> then<00:05:06.250> we<00:05:06.340> shot<00:05:06.550> up<00:05:06.700> through<00:05:06.910> the
