00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.679

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.749

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:43.940

 about surviving that he is disappointed and there is the death that measures 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.320

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.260
 10 fps with this type of walking 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.140
 very difficult afterwards 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.190

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.510

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 differences in as always even though it is unimaginable 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.350
