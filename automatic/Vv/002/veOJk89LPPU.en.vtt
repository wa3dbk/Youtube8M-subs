in a very easy way for visually impaired
people<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.270> we've<00:00:19.109> coded<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.010> darlene

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
people and we've coded it and darlene

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.980 
people and we've coded it and darlene
python<00:00:20.910> who<00:00:21.119> will<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.330> presenting<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.869> at

python who will be presenting it at
python<00:00:22.380> conference<00:00:23.510> so<00:00:24.510> basically<00:00:24.960> if<00:00:25.320> one

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
python conference so basically if one

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.670 
python conference so basically if one
has<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> visual<00:00:26.580> handicap<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:28.050> could<00:00:28.230> use<00:00:28.439> this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
has a visual handicap we could use this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.070 
has a visual handicap we could use this
to<00:00:28.980> learn<00:00:29.130> Braille<00:00:29.429> yeah<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.840> how

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to learn Braille yeah you know in how

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.420 
to learn Braille yeah you know in how
fast<00:00:34.520> still<00:00:35.540> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> testing<00:00:36.989> mode<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
fast still in the testing mode but the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819 
fast still in the testing mode but the
point<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.149> noted<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
point to be noted is that if you are

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.970 
point to be noted is that if you are
visually<00:00:41.219> impaired<00:00:42.020> Braille<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.620> your

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
visually impaired Braille is like your

constantly decreases our time taken to
learn<00:00:59.940> Braille<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.570> our<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> reason<00:01:01.350> being

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
like the first step and since it's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.430 
like the first step and since it's
repeated<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.820> nature<00:02:20.180> we<00:02:20.270> thought<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.290> be

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
repeated in nature we thought it can be

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.150 
repeated in nature we thought it can be
automated

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
automated

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.040 
automated
you<00:02:22.340> are<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:22.550> 20<00:02:22.910> year<00:02:23.030> olds<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.330> engineering

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
you are like 20 year olds so engineering

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.920 
you are like 20 year olds so engineering
students<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.670> what<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.150> medial<00:02:26.570> think<00:02:26.810> on

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
students so what the medial think on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.210 
students so what the medial think on
these<00:02:27.110> lines<00:02:27.290> because<00:02:27.620> normally<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.130> would

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
these lines because normally you would

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.010 
these lines because normally you would
be<00:02:28.340> thinking<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.880> other<00:02:29.180> things<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.630> party

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
be thinking of other things like party

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:38.830 
be thinking of other things like party
and<00:02:30.050> life<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.890> we<00:02:37.400> were<00:02:37.610> thinking<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:38.540> what

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
and life and so we were thinking of what

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.100 
and life and so we were thinking of what
could<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:40.810> quite<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> interesting

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
could be the quite a interesting

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.860 
could be the quite a interesting
brainwave<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.190> use<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.730> in<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.060> area<00:02:44.270> where<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
brainwave to use it in a area where it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.260 
brainwave to use it in a area where it
has<00:02:45.020> such<00:02:45.290> large<00:02:45.740> implication<00:02:46.460> for<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.150> many

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
has such large implication for so many

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:56.010 
has such large implication for so many
people<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.870> India<00:02:48.680> has<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> huge<00:02:49.540> problem<00:02:50.540> with

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.950 

realize<00:02:57.020> how<00:02:57.440> important<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.280> could<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.690> see

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
realize how important it could be I see

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.860 
realize how important it could be I see
until<00:03:00.380> is<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:01.340> other<00:03:01.580> soil<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.210> see<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.750> don't

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
until is like other soil I see you don't

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.990 
until is like other soil I see you don't
think<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.070> just<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.400> project<00:03:04.580> yeah

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
think it's like just a project yeah

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.810 
think it's like just a project yeah
other<00:03:05.480> people<00:03:05.780> see<00:03:06.050> it's<00:03:06.380> very<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:07.160> sort<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.760> a

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
other people see it's very it sort of a

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.290 
other people see it's very it sort of a
culture<00:03:08.210> in<00:03:08.920> these<00:03:09.920> colleges<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.760> have

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
culture in these colleges that you have

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.120 
culture in these colleges that you have
an<00:03:11.450> idea<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.990> just<00:03:12.440> make<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.980> you

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
an idea and you just make it and you

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.750 
an idea and you just make it and you
learn<00:03:13.340> things<00:03:13.610> on<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:13.910> way<00:03:14.030> yeah<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.320> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
learn things on the way yeah so the the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.220 
learn things on the way yeah so the the
utility<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.820> not<00:03:17.000> important<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.570> yeah<00:03:17.810> you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
utility is not important to you yeah you

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.380 
utility is not important to you yeah you
know<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.380> not<00:03:18.860> very<00:03:19.040> important<00:03:19.610> about<00:03:19.790> okay

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
know you not very important about okay

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.660 
know you not very important about okay
what<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> end<00:03:20.989> product<00:03:21.260> yeah<00:03:27.220> then<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.489> mean

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
what is the end product yeah then I mean

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.780 
what is the end product yeah then I mean
when<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.910> told<00:03:29.120> some<00:03:29.390> people<00:03:32.950> okay<00:03:33.950> let<00:03:34.160> let's

C's<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:01.520> see

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
C's I see

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.240 
C's I see
and<00:04:03.700> image<00:04:04.700> processing<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.510> pie<00:04:06.250> lots

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
and image processing with the pie lots

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.369 
and image processing with the pie lots
of<00:04:07.459> reference<00:04:08.209> fields<00:04:08.840> people<00:04:09.019> are<00:04:09.230> walking

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
of reference fields people are walking

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.199 
of reference fields people are walking
on<00:04:09.680> this<00:04:10.159> could<00:04:10.489> potentially<00:04:11.030> affect

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
on this could potentially affect

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.570 
on this could potentially affect
millions<00:04:11.659> in<00:04:11.989> that<00:04:12.140> sense<00:04:12.440> if<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.799> is<00:04:12.980> taken<00:04:13.459> to

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
millions in that sense if it is taken to

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.180 
millions in that sense if it is taken to
its<00:04:13.670> logical<00:04:13.730> extreme<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.170> how<00:04:15.830> many<00:04:15.890> million

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
its logical extreme so how many million

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.159 
its logical extreme so how many million
in<00:04:16.430> India<00:04:16.669> need<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.479> learn<00:04:17.660> Braille<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.079> if

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
in India need to learn Braille and if

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:29.230 
in India need to learn Braille and if
because<00:04:18.470> you're<00:04:18.650> mentioning<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:28.070> 10%<00:04:28.699> in<00:04:29.180> the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
because you're mentioning and 10% in the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.930 
because you're mentioning and 10% in the
US<00:04:29.690> with<00:04:30.020> 10%<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:32.300> population<00:04:36.639> in<00:04:37.639> Braille

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
US with 10% of the population in Braille

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.480 
US with 10% of the population in Braille
literacy<00:04:38.180> when<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.690> say<00:04:38.840> literacy<00:04:39.320> yeah<00:04:39.530> if

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
literacy when you say literacy yeah if

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.460 
literacy when you say literacy yeah if
you<00:04:42.490> so<00:04:43.490> these<00:04:43.669> six<00:04:44.260> combination<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.380> these

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
you so these six combination of these

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.640 
you so these six combination of these
six<00:04:45.710> buttons<00:04:46.100> come<00:04:46.490> give<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:46.910> all<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.330> Oh

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
six buttons come give you all the Oh

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.590 
six buttons come give you all the Oh
so<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:49.010> have<00:04:49.190> basically<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:50.000> raise<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.389> 6

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
so you can have basically to raise to 6

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600 
so you can have basically to raise to 6
that's<00:04:50.900> 64<00:04:51.680> different<00:04:51.830> characters<00:04:52.340> or<00:04:52.550> you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
that's 64 different characters or you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.520 
that's 64 different characters or you
know<00:04:52.699> 26<00:04:53.180> alphabets<00:04:53.570> 10<00:04:53.870> numbers<00:04:54.260> some

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
know 26 alphabets 10 numbers some

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.860 
know 26 alphabets 10 numbers some
special<00:04:54.860> characters<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.490> few<00:04:55.729> so<00:04:56.539> that<00:04:56.570> is

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
special characters and a few so that is

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.790 
special characters and a few so that is
a<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.500> okay<00:04:58.340> that<00:04:58.520> should<00:04:58.699> be<00:04:59.470> next<00:05:00.470> you<00:05:00.620> have<00:05:00.770> a

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
a a okay that should be next you have a

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.820 
a a okay that should be next you have a
C<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:01.100> in<00:05:01.729> corresponding<00:05:02.600> sound<00:05:03.350> output

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
C and in corresponding sound output

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.520 
C and in corresponding sound output
yes<00:05:04.310> found<00:05:04.550> out<00:05:04.669> who's<00:05:04.850> actually<00:05:04.970> saying<00:05:05.530> you

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
yes found out who's actually saying you

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:17.980 
yes found out who's actually saying you
want<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.740> hear<00:05:06.889> the<00:05:07.010> side

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.680 

so<00:05:18.990> this<00:05:19.260> is<00:05:19.380> what<00:05:19.530> is<00:05:19.650> making<00:05:20.480> so<00:05:21.480> what

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
so this is what is making so what

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.240 
so this is what is making so what
happens<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.520> Indian<00:05:23.520> languages<00:05:26.990> Indian<00:05:28.250> all

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
happens to Indian languages Indian all

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.490 
happens to Indian languages Indian all
languages<00:05:29.790> have<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.180> slight<00:05:30.840> variations<00:05:33.500> you

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
languages have the slight variations you

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.080 
languages have the slight variations you
can<00:05:34.680> extend<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:35.250> because<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.700> once<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:35.940> have

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
can extend it because of once you have

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.970 
can extend it because of once you have
the<00:05:36.210> character<00:05:36.600> mapping<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.170> ya<00:05:37.350> know<00:05:37.680> the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
the character mapping and ya know the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.530 
the character mapping and ya know the
thing<00:05:38.160> then<00:05:38.340> it<00:05:38.460> is<00:05:38.580> very<00:05:38.760> easy<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.060> extend<00:05:39.480> the

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
thing then it is very easy to extend the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.970 
thing then it is very easy to extend the
same<00:05:39.690> software<00:05:40.050> what<00:05:40.500> were<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.770> biggest

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
same software what were the biggest

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.040 
same software what were the biggest
challenges<00:05:41.100> in<00:05:41.640> this<00:05:41.790> project<00:05:42.030> soft<00:05:42.720> pace<00:05:42.900> I'd

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.830 

like<00:05:49.050> some<00:05:49.530> we<00:05:49.680> learn<00:05:49.860> on<00:05:50.010> our<00:05:50.070> own<00:05:50.130> but<00:05:50.840> being

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
like some we learn on our own but being

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.500 
like some we learn on our own but being
computer<00:05:52.200> science<00:05:52.440> students<00:05:52.800> but<00:05:53.510> hardware

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
computer science students but hardware

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.780 
computer science students but hardware
yeah<00:05:58.280> learn<00:05:59.280> something

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
yeah learn something

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.750 
yeah learn something
yeah<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.750> now<00:06:00.960> what<00:06:01.170> next<00:06:01.380> how<00:06:01.620> do<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.890> how<00:06:02.700> do

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
yeah and now what next how do you how do

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.580 
yeah and now what next how do you how do
you<00:06:02.910> expand<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:03.540> you<00:06:03.630> take<00:06:03.900> see<00:06:04.350> it<00:06:04.440> as<00:06:04.560> a

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
you expand it to you take see it as a

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.659 
you expand it to you take see it as a
real<00:06:04.800> global<00:06:05.220> project<00:06:05.610> one<00:06:05.760> day<00:06:07.669> the

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
real global project one day the

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.250 
real global project one day the
implications<00:06:09.390> I<00:06:09.510> mean<00:06:09.660> we<00:06:09.780> intend<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.080> take

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
implications I mean we intend to take

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.130 
implications I mean we intend to take
this<00:06:10.470> forward<00:06:10.770> and<00:06:11.100> since<00:06:11.460> once<00:06:11.760> this<00:06:12.330> is<00:06:12.540> this

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
this forward and since once this is this

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.950 
this forward and since once this is this
has<00:06:13.350> started<00:06:13.740> working<00:06:14.130> I<00:06:14.340> could<00:06:14.700> show<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:14.960> so

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
has started working I could show you so

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.210 
has started working I could show you so
this<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.680> ultimate<00:06:17.640> next<00:06:17.820> extensibility<00:06:18.660> like

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
this is ultimate next extensibility like

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.280 
this is ultimate next extensibility like
right<00:06:20.220> now<00:06:20.490> the<00:06:20.550> font<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.180> kind<00:06:21.390> of<00:06:21.480> big<00:06:21.660> we

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
right now the font is kind of big we

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.170 
right now the font is kind of big we
could<00:06:22.470> just<00:06:22.620> have<00:06:22.950> another<00:06:23.310> cover<00:06:23.669> over<00:06:24.000> this

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
could just have another cover over this

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.540 
could just have another cover over this
which<00:06:24.480> could<00:06:24.630> just<00:06:24.750> make<00:06:25.260> the<00:06:25.680> font<00:06:25.919> as<00:06:26.190> the

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
which could just make the font as the

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.920 
which could just make the font as the
standard<00:06:26.970> size<00:06:27.150> your<00:06:27.330> brain<00:06:27.510> and<00:06:27.720> if<00:06:27.840> you

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
standard size your brain and if you

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.260 
standard size your brain and if you
could<00:06:28.080> have<00:06:28.200> Marable<00:06:28.910> technology<00:06:29.910> then<00:06:30.060> you

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
could have Marable technology then you

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.150 
could have Marable technology then you
could<00:06:30.419> just<00:06:30.450> you<00:06:30.690> know<00:06:30.720> very<00:06:31.500> but<00:06:31.650> it<00:06:31.980> could

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
could just you know very but it could

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.610 
could just you know very but it could
not<00:06:32.340> be<00:06:32.400> just<00:06:32.940> restricted<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:33.900> visually

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
not be just restricted to visually

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.690 
not be just restricted to visually
impaired<00:06:34.800> people<00:06:34.979> what<00:06:35.370> if<00:06:35.460> you<00:06:35.550> were

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
impaired people what if you were

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.680 
impaired people what if you were
standing<00:06:35.880> in<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.120> crowded<00:06:36.390> bus<00:06:36.510> and<00:06:36.630> you

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
standing in the crowded bus and you

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.330 
standing in the crowded bus and you
wanted<00:06:36.930> to<00:06:36.990> read<00:06:37.140> something<00:06:37.380> if<00:06:37.950> you<00:06:38.130> learn

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
wanted to read something if you learn

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.010 
wanted to read something if you learn
Braille<00:06:38.520> try<00:06:38.790> something<00:06:39.180> on<00:06:39.240> your<00:06:39.390> finger<00:06:39.720> you

Braille try something on your finger you
could<00:06:40.590> maybe<00:06:40.860> you<00:06:41.100> read<00:06:41.250> on<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.400> way<00:06:41.580> or

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
could maybe you read on the way or

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.390 
could maybe you read on the way or

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
you can make one is the repetitive mode

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.180 
you can make one is the repetitive mode
where<00:07:03.419> you<00:07:03.510> learn<00:07:03.750> learn<00:07:04.140> the<00:07:04.320> alphabets<00:07:04.650> yeah

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
where you learn learn the alphabets yeah

well<00:07:41.539> now<00:07:41.809> we're<00:07:41.989> thinking<00:07:42.139> about<00:07:42.379> out<00:07:42.879> having

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 
well now we're thinking about out having

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:46.119 
well now we're thinking about out having
a<00:07:44.089> random<00:07:44.569> character<00:07:44.719> display<00:07:45.349> and<00:07:45.860> again

a random character display and again

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:48.219 
a random character display and again
basically<00:07:46.579> you<00:07:46.669> give<00:07:46.849> the<00:07:47.029> speech<00:07:47.629> input<00:07:47.869> and

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:48.229 
basically you give the speech input and

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:49.839 
basically you give the speech input and
it's<00:07:48.409> so<00:07:48.649> check<00:07:49.009> whether<00:07:49.279> it's<00:07:49.459> if<00:07:49.639> it's

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:49.849 
it's so check whether it's if it's

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:52.239 
it's so check whether it's if it's
correct<00:07:50.059> then<00:07:50.449> yeah<00:07:51.079> then<00:07:51.769> you<00:07:51.889> will<00:07:52.039> you<00:07:52.099> get

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:52.249 
correct then yeah then you will you get

00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:53.409 
correct then yeah then you will you get
a<00:07:52.279> feedback<00:07:52.519> that<00:07:52.819> it's<00:07:52.939> correct<00:07:53.209> if<00:07:53.269> it's

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419 
a feedback that it's correct if it's

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:55.149 
a feedback that it's correct if it's
wrong<00:07:53.569> then<00:07:53.869> you<00:07:54.019> get<00:07:54.139> a<00:07:54.169> feedback<00:07:54.499> about<00:07:54.619> what

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.790 
wrong then you get a feedback about what
I<00:07:55.189> see<00:07:55.459> it<00:07:55.639> should<00:07:55.849> be<00:07:55.999> and<00:07:56.929> we<00:07:57.439> think<00:07:57.679> that

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 
I see it should be and we think that

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.249 
I see it should be and we think that
this<00:07:58.129> can<00:07:58.339> be<00:07:58.519> like<00:07:58.729> both<00:07:59.149> um<00:07:59.509> you<00:08:00.139> know
