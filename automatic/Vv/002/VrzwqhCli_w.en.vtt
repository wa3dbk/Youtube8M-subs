one or two every year for the next five
to<00:00:15.179> six<00:00:15.420> years<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> maybe<00:00:16.710> more<00:00:16.980> maybe<00:00:17.160> less

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
to six years and maybe more maybe less

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980 
to six years and maybe more maybe less
or<00:00:17.670> worse<00:00:17.940> we'll<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.359> we'll<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.720> what

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
or worse we'll see we'll see what

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.529 
or worse we'll see we'll see what
happens<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.770> find<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> whiskey<00:00:20.550> but

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
happens as we as we find the whiskey but

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
happens as we as we find the whiskey but
basically<00:00:21.810> from<00:00:22.199> each<00:00:22.740> year<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.340> hope<00:00:23.490> with

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
basically from each year we hope with

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.099 
basically from each year we hope with
the<00:00:23.910> change<00:00:24.210> sum<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:24.930> actually

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the change sum up what was actually

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.450 
the change sum up what was actually
happening<00:00:25.289> at<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.859> point<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
happening at that point in the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
happening at that point in the
distillery<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.109> 1964<00:00:28.109> which<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
distillery in the 1964 which is the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.070 
distillery in the 1964 which is the
oldest<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.279> we've<00:00:29.369> done<00:00:29.750> and<00:00:30.750> will

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
oldest one that we've done and will

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.530 
oldest one that we've done and will
probably<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.529> all<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.540> it's

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
probably be all this one that we do it's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
probably be all this one that we do it's
just<00:00:33.809> nice<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:34.739> bit<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.070> insight

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
just nice to see a little bit of insight

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
just nice to see a little bit of insight
into<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.090> happened<00:00:36.840> at<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
into what actually happened at the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
into what actually happened at the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
distillery because that affects the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.030 
distillery because that affects the
flavor<00:00:39.329> quite<00:00:39.600> dramatically<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.550> 1964

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
legs I'm nice and fat but that's because

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.770 
legs I'm nice and fat but that's because
we<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.470> 42.2<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.360> take<00:01:27.600> an

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we know it's at 42.2 but they take an

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.330 
we know it's at 42.2 but they take an
age<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.229> mean<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.470> could<00:01:28.590> probably<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
age I mean we could probably we here for

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.429 
age I mean we could probably we here for
a<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:29.939> long<00:01:30.210> time<00:01:30.420> before<00:01:30.840> any<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
a very very long time before any of that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.789 
a very very long time before any of that
begins<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> appear<00:01:32.720> yeah<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.259> let's<00:01:34.350> I'm<00:01:34.530> just

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
begins to appear yeah but let's I'm just

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.050 
begins to appear yeah but let's I'm just
beginning<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.189> come<00:01:35.369> down<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:38.189> this

beginning to come down now and then this
is<00:01:39.210> where<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> big<00:01:39.570> difference<00:01:39.930> comes<00:01:41.540> when

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
is where the big difference comes when

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
is where the big difference comes when

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.999 
but it's Highland Park smoke but just
strong<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.909> on<00:02:00.060> steroids<00:02:00.600> basically

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
strong it's just on steroids basically

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.760 
strong it's just on steroids basically
the<00:02:02.009> reason<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> simple

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the reason for that is and it is simple

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.590 
the reason for that is and it is simple
one<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.130> honest<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.670> back<00:02:05.850> 40<00:02:06.390> years

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
one to be honest if you go back 40 years

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.229 
one to be honest if you go back 40 years
and<00:02:06.659> thing<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.640> think<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.149> was

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and thing and you think of it what was

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.940 
and thing and you think of it what was
happening<00:02:09.599> at<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.810> distillery<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.560> anywhere

else for that matter we didn't have they
control

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

all<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.590> distillery<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.849> do<00:02:14.970> know

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
all that the distillery that we do know

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.880 
all that the distillery that we do know
so<00:02:16.610> 40<00:02:17.610> years<00:02:17.849> ago<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.660> were<00:02:18.870> basically<00:02:19.410> making

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
so 40 years ago we were basically making

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.150 
so 40 years ago we were basically making
whiskey<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.519> blenders<00:02:21.440> 95%<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.590> not<00:02:22.800> more<00:02:23.040> of

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
whiskey for blenders 95% if not more of

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.809 
whiskey for blenders 95% if not more of
that<00:02:23.340> what<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.300> made<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:25.080> sold<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.650> blender<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
that what we made we sold the blender so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.759 
that what we made we sold the blender so
we<00:02:26.910> had<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> specification<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:28.019> match<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.650> we

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
we had a specification to match so we

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.410 
we had a specification to match so we
created<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.160> same<00:02:29.370> whiskey<00:02:29.730> day<00:02:29.940> after<00:02:30.239> day

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
created the same whiskey day after day

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.120 
created the same whiskey day after day
after<00:02:30.569> day<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:32.130> sold<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:33.090> blending

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
after day and then sold it for blending

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.880 
after day and then sold it for blending
however<00:02:35.360> when<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.450> use<00:02:36.660> floor<00:02:37.380> more<00:02:37.620> things

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.339 
however when you use floor more things
and<00:02:38.099> when<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.280> dry<00:02:38.519> your<00:02:38.550> barley<00:02:39.299> with<00:02:39.480> Pete

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and when you dry your barley with Pete

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.100 
and when you dry your barley with Pete
on<00:02:40.590> Orkney<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.060> wind<00:02:42.269> conditions<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.019> I

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
on Orkney and the wind conditions that I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.630 
on Orkney and the wind conditions that I
nail<00:02:43.379> and<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.769> can<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.069> quite<00:02:44.250> severe

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
nail and it can be quite severe

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.520 
nail and it can be quite severe
sometimes<00:02:45.290> depending<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.380> which<00:02:46.500> direction

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
sometimes depending on which direction

sometimes depending on which direction
the<00:02:47.160> wind<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.519> blowing<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.060> how<00:02:49.250> strong<00:02:50.250> as

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the wind is blowing and how strong as

the wind is blowing and how strong as
strong<00:02:51.060> as<00:02:51.209> gusting<00:02:51.599> will<00:02:52.530> determine<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.099> how

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
strong as gusting will determine on how

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.569 
strong as gusting will determine on how
smoky<00:02:53.849> your<00:02:54.120> whiskey<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.900> made<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.430> for

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
smoky your whiskey is made so for

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.860 
smoky your whiskey is made so for
example<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:57.090> you're<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.480> top<00:02:57.599> of<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
example if you're in the top of the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.110 
example if you're in the top of the
pagoda<00:02:58.200> roof<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:58.560> snow<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> wind<00:02:59.700> blows

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
pagoda roof to snow and the wind blows

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.569 
pagoda roof to snow and the wind blows
the<00:03:00.720> wind<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.680> blows<00:03:01.829> through<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.310> paga

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
the wind as it blows through the paga

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.089 
the wind as it blows through the paga
roof<00:03:02.760> sucks<00:03:03.269> smoke<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:04.019> through<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.739> bed<00:03:04.890> of

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
roof sucks smoke up through the bed of

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.710 
roof sucks smoke up through the bed of
the<00:03:05.190> peak<00:03:05.370> through<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.090> bed<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> barley

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the peak through the bed of the barley

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.979 
the peak through the bed of the barley
and<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.590> taken<00:03:07.980> outside<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:09.060> bodily

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
and that is taken outside so your bodily

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.729 
and that is taken outside so your bodily
is<00:03:10.760> less<00:03:11.760> pitted<00:03:12.150> if<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:13.230> wind<00:03:13.410> stopped

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
is less pitted if the wind stopped

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.640 
is less pitted if the wind stopped
blowing<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.849> smoke<00:03:14.970> sits<00:03:15.540> there<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:15.900> then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
blowing the smoke sits there and then

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.259 
blowing the smoke sits there and then
your<00:03:16.799> barley<00:03:17.130> becomes<00:03:17.549> more<00:03:18.269> pitted<00:03:18.799> well<00:03:19.799> in

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
your barley becomes more pitted well in

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.000 
your barley becomes more pitted well in
1964<00:03:21.269> one<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.139> very<00:03:22.350> few<00:03:22.620> days<00:03:22.799> that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
1964 one of the very few days that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.180 
1964 one of the very few days that
happened<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.150> wind<00:03:24.299> didn't<00:03:24.630> blow<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.560> smoky

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
happened the wind didn't blow so a smoky

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.420 
happened the wind didn't blow so a smoky
barley<00:03:26.639> became<00:03:27.630> even<00:03:28.139> more<00:03:28.170> smoke<00:03:28.680> no<00:03:29.250> because

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
barley became even more smoke no because

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.789 
barley became even more smoke no because
we<00:03:29.730> are<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.850> blend<00:03:30.120> none<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.450> thing<00:03:30.799> that's

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
we are a blend none of that thing that's

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.590 
we are a blend none of that thing that's
not<00:03:32.040> our<00:03:32.069> specification<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.359> sell

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
not our specification so we don't sell

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.900 
not our specification so we don't sell
it<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.560> can't<00:03:34.799> sell<00:03:35.069> it<00:03:35.100> so<00:03:35.519> what<00:03:35.639> we<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.880> is

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
it so we can't sell it so what we do is

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.970 
it so we can't sell it so what we do is
we<00:03:36.150> put<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.359> into<00:03:36.480> sherry<00:03:36.750> casks<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.319> we<00:03:37.500> we

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
we put it into sherry casks and we we

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.640 
we put it into sherry casks and we we
leave<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.489> see<00:03:38.850> what<00:03:38.940> happens<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.650> it's

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
leave it and see what happens and it's

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.629 
leave it and see what happens and it's
40<00:03:41.040> years<00:03:41.310> later<00:03:41.600> when<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.370> sweetness<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.579> the

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
40 years later when the sweetness of the

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.970 
40 years later when the sweetness of the
casks<00:03:45.180> catches<00:03:45.810> up<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.380> smokiness<00:03:46.769> of

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
casks catches up with the smokiness of

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.650 
casks catches up with the smokiness of
the<00:03:47.040> peat<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.519> then<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.480> balance

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
the peat and then you have the balance

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.090 
the peat and then you have the balance
is<00:03:49.109> restored<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.880> 64<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> big<00:03:52.019> smoky<00:03:52.769> whiskey

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
is restored so 64 is a big smoky whiskey

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.789 
is restored so 64 is a big smoky whiskey
for<00:03:53.489> Highland<00:03:53.819> Park<00:03:54.030> standards<00:03:54.560> because<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799
