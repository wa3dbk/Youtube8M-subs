 more than write them tutorials this 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.130
 new video we will be watching it together 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.170
 four of the best roms uploaded to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.590
 our channel in this month of July 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.590
 2014 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.690
 Y 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.689
 so well guys you've finished the 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.950
 July we have reached to climb 4 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.540
 roms on the east channel so then nothing 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.330
 let's start with the top before 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.770
 continue I would like this to say that if 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.540
 can participate equally in the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.210
 comments putting what to you 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.040
 it seems to you either this the order 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.830
 Well, it would be great, and also 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.989
 send a greeting to go to Orlando to 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.199
 jonathan daniel méndez and guzmán 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.170
 also tell him that there is not this radio 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.450
 for whatever is not 9 for a 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.750
 bus but not from there to there as a 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.370
 Greetings to all, so, well, let's go 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 to start 4 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.060
 at number 4 the last one placed 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.350
 that is located is the led light 93 version 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.560
 2 that I edited it so to speak 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.050
 a girl named Sophia Serracín this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 because the number 4 leaves her good 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.900
 truth is very good honestly is 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.540
 very fluid but in terms of the error of the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.570
 facebook for me was something that I 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.210
 I use a lot then this one to have that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.580
 failure I think it's a disadvantage to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.530
 just as well being this I almost do not know 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.330
 I did not get much attention but in 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.550
 regarding design and in terms of 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.649
 fluidity and battery life and everything 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.899
 others was great just 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.840
 They left the room because the other 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.509
 have been over in some aspects and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.200
 more than anything in the error of the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:56.720
 facebook and then that's not so this one 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.720
 it would be the number 43 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.200
 in number 3 the rainbow was placed 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:06.560
 kitkat that is by rafael the truth is this 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.160
 Rom is very good kitkat style 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.720
 there more or less well based on 109 with 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.570
 android 4.0 4 your fluency is good your 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.580
 battery life also the truth 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.980
 this robust a lot but the daughter of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.470
 number 3 basically because of the design that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.410
 because he lacked some things not 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.870
 so many, but besides that, it's because 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.630
 had tried many removing then 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.660
 I do not know and try more because not the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.730
 leave a little down on this top but of 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.100
 there for there the truth is a very rom 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530
 good very fluid highly recommended for 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.840
 you want to try me personally 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.300
 liked it very much 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.510
 I would approve it if you have not tried it 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.000
 try the really is great and then 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.000
 that is number 32 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.350
 at number 2 I left the optimus hui 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.170
 George after cutting this rom the truth 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.130
 I loved it has a very original design 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.960
 very different from a lot of roms has a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.420
 style like that I do not know just how in the 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.510
 package and with which it brings that I do not even know 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.850
 which one looks great looks very very handsome 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.880
 very cute at first sight in terms of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.280
 Notification bar is great your 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.820
 fluency is incredible is although it is 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.830
 based on 2.3 that after using it the 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.420
 why I left it in 2.3 is 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.000
 because the start is number one 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.830
 it's zero that moody and I like it 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.600
 more the mode then on this occasion I have 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.330
 let the optimus google 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.420
 in second place basically because 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.150
 I am and I do not like much what but 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.970
 both a week and a half I was 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.310
 trying really was going great I was going super 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 fluid with the appearance more than anything the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.190
 appearance I loved the fluid the 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.070
 fluency was incredible and well nothing is that 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.000
 what makes a good rom not really 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.860
 I liked it a lot 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.050
 also because they recommend one hundred 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.860
 percent and then this has been the number 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.860
 twenty-one 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.220
 in the first place I left or I 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.590
 placed a la roma android style l with 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.160
 lollipop that I really loved this 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.859
 rom 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.620
 although he lacked a lot of things in 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.690
 I liked the design of android 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.580
 very much more than anything the part of the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.610
 configurations that was what most 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.760
 approached android l the part of the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.860
 notifications the truth this one I liked 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.729
 a lot and the best part is that it was 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.580
 fluid 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.320
 that is, it was not the typical rom you say 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.740
 well I created a new rum with a 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.280
 new style different from the others and this 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.250
 It is slow and not that often goes 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.070
 this with this occasion the mixed rice 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.470
 by rafael with great style and more 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.889
 that nothing great is fluid no no 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.340
 they have no 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.860
 no slow if you really do not have anything 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.749
 after it's slow and the truth 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.409
 a lot a lot apart from that I was 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:11.539
 stay sick 9 with android 4.0 4 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.779
 Android style with a gigabyte of 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.060
 space and fluid and good had 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.749
 many things that the truth is 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.240
 cool 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:22.849
 Well, I recommend them if 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.770
 they want to try some rom so try 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.520
 This is great, I recommend them to 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.500
 100% and well that's been number one and 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.930
 good guys here 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.029
 would finish this top have only been four 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.979
 rooms because only four roms I have uploaded 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:39.259
 in July remember that if you liked 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.990
 the video can support with a like 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.789
 this video to know if they are going to 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.400
 want to continue with this series of each end 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.050
 of month you can also participate in the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.029
 comments do not forget to participate in the 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.189
 comments putting the order in which 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.409
 you would put the roms in what order 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.210
 if they were tested or dropped 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.919
 come to try in this month in what 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.379
 order would place them if they would be 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.330
 agreement on how I place them 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.039
 as you have run the rom and 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.619
 which then runs differently in each 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.919
 device also a small notice 

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:13.229
 fast and that probably what in the 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.980
 next video or if in the video 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.740
 following 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.780
 it's basically that I do not have a camera 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.430
 right now and most likely do 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.460
 videos similar to this one 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.550
 with the pure voice and images more than anything 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.860
 informative or curious things like that about 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.320
 the android world and technology because 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.090
 Well, as I say, I do not have a camera 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.280
 straight and most likely it will arrive 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.400
 until like in two weeks like that there's 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:43.120
 out there from August 15 8 then this one 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:47.440
 I do not expect anything to support the videos 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.330
 that are going to come that no not those that 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.980
 and do not take away the support basically 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:54.070
 because they are not going to be recorded but 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.720
 they will be informative so to speak and 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:00.210
 because nothing else I hope that you have 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.210
 liked and see you in the next
