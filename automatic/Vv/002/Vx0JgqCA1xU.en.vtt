00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
I moved the shell dwellers out of this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.250 
I moved the shell dwellers out of this
tank<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.619> just<00:00:20.550> felt<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> space<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:21.539> was

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
tank I just felt all the space here was
just<00:00:22.289> wasted<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.550> put<00:00:23.820> them<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.119> another

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
just wasted so I put them in another

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.640 
just wasted so I put them in another
tank<00:00:24.750> that<00:00:24.990> isn't<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.529> high<00:00:27.199> I'm<00:00:28.199> gonna<00:00:28.380> start

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
tank that isn't so high I'm gonna start

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.870 
tank that isn't so high I'm gonna start
a<00:00:28.740> planning<00:00:29.070> tank<00:00:29.310> once<00:00:29.580> again<00:00:31.610> I'm<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.790> to

no Java friend here be a whole bunch of
different<00:00:42.270> plants<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:43.620> gonna<00:00:43.800> try<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> few

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
different plants up I'm gonna try a few

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.260 
different plants up I'm gonna try a few
different<00:00:44.399> things<00:00:46.700> no<00:00:47.700> co2<00:00:47.969> though<00:00:49.550> but<00:00:50.550> we'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
different things no co2 though but we'll

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.430 
different things no co2 though but we'll
see<00:00:51.510> how<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.809> goes

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440

I'll<00:00:52.770> keep<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.100> guys<00:00:53.129> updated<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.180> tank

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I'll keep you guys updated on this tank

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.760 
I'll keep you guys updated on this tank
so<00:00:54.809> far<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.199> does<00:00:55.350> look<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.649> crap<00:00:57.440> with<00:00:58.440> some

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
so far it does look like crap with some

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.130 
so far it does look like crap with some
stem<00:00:59.449> with<00:01:00.449> stem<00:01:00.719> plants<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.960> them

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
stem with stem plants the way I got them

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.210 
stem with stem plants the way I got them
they<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.820> shape<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.220> this

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
they were kind of out of shape so this

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
they were kind of out of shape so this
has<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:09.060> planted<00:01:09.360> yesterday<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
has just been planted yesterday so I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
has just been planted yesterday so I
have<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.909> give<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.420> time<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
have to give it some time for it to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.520 
have to give it some time for it to
cover<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> roots<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.150> come<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.960> for

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
cover for the roots to come out and for

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
cover for the roots to come out and for
them<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.860> look<00:01:17.009> better<00:01:17.280> than<00:01:17.610> they<00:01:17.759> are<00:01:17.790> right

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
them to look better than they are right

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.929 
them to look better than they are right
now<00:01:19.400> they<00:01:20.400> should<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.820> well<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
now they should do well I think that the

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.649 
now they should do well I think that the
meteor<00:01:23.939> repins

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
meteor repins

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710 
meteor repins
they<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.740> always<00:01:25.979> done<00:01:26.310> done<00:01:26.970> me<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
they have always done done me well so

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.410 
they have always done done me well so
easy<00:01:28.530> plant<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> grow<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> whole<00:01:30.390> bunch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
easy plant to grow I want a whole bunch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.499 
easy plant to grow I want a whole bunch
of<00:01:30.750> other<00:01:30.900> plants<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:33.329> see

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
of other plants here and here and to see

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.560 
of other plants here and here and to see
what<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.810> grow<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> tank<00:01:35.570> definitely

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
what I can grow in this tank definitely

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.510 
what I can grow in this tank definitely
miss<00:01:36.780> growing<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> plants<00:01:38.600> my<00:01:39.600> substrate<00:01:40.049> is

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
miss growing the plants my substrate is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
miss growing the plants my substrate is
the<00:01:41.520> ad<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.880> substrate<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the ad a substrate I think that's one of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.090 
the ad a substrate I think that's one of
the<00:01:43.560> best<00:01:43.890> best<00:01:44.850> ones<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.920> not

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the best best ones you can get it's not

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700 
the best best ones you can get it's not
that<00:01:47.280> expensive

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.490 

so<00:01:51.130> yeah<00:01:51.369> any<00:01:52.000> suggestions<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.750> other<00:01:52.899> plants

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
so yeah any suggestions of other plants

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.969 
so yeah any suggestions of other plants
let<00:01:54.310> me<00:01:54.430> know<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:56.110> should<00:01:56.350> be<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> fun<00:01:56.799> little

know want the all the stem plants that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.620 
know want the all the stem plants that
grow<00:02:21.340> pretty<00:02:21.640> high<00:02:22.620> yeah<00:02:23.910> yeah<00:02:24.910> look<00:02:25.209> look<00:02:25.480> how

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
some hope that some of the shape they're

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.059 
some hope that some of the shape they're
in<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.360> mean<00:02:28.630> look<00:02:28.840> at<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.019> curve<00:02:29.470> that's

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
in I mean look at that curve that's

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.270 
in I mean look at that curve that's
forward<00:02:30.780> but<00:02:31.780> I'm<00:02:32.470> pretty<00:02:32.709> sure<00:02:32.799> they<00:02:33.100> will

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
forward but I'm pretty sure they will

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.190 
forward but I'm pretty sure they will
