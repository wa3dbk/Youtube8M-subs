00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
today we're going to use the nutribullet

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.569 
today we're going to use the nutribullet
and<00:00:31.130> their<00:00:31.279> triple<00:00:31.609> it<00:00:31.759> is<00:00:33.160> basically<00:00:34.160> a

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
vegetables and fruit with ours I'm going

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.900 
vegetables and fruit with ours I'm going
to<00:00:42.320> show<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.559> basic<00:00:42.710> recipe<00:00:43.399> that<00:00:43.550> I<00:00:43.640> can

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
to show you a basic recipe that I can

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.729 
to show you a basic recipe that I can
use<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:45.040> usually<00:00:46.040> start<00:00:46.430> with<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.760> pair<00:00:47.449> and<00:00:48.290> then

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
use I usually start with a pair and then

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.899 
use I usually start with a pair and then
I've<00:00:48.890> already<00:00:49.220> chopped<00:00:49.489> up<00:00:49.699> some<00:00:50.570> celery

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
I've already chopped up some celery

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.100 
I've already chopped up some celery
carrots<00:00:53.409> radishes<00:00:54.409> grapes<00:00:55.629> mixed<00:00:56.629> berries

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
carrots radishes grapes mixed berries

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.150 
carrots radishes grapes mixed berries
and<00:00:57.980> then<00:00:58.430> to<00:00:59.180> emulsify<00:00:59.480> it<00:00:59.809> all<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.770> little

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
and then to emulsify it all is a little

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.749 
and then to emulsify it all is a little
bit<00:01:01.370> of<00:01:01.579> 100<00:01:02.239> percent<00:01:02.329> pure<00:01:02.719> apple<00:01:03.020> juice<00:01:03.050> and

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:03.759 
bit of 100 percent pure apple juice and

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:07.749 
bit of 100 percent pure apple juice and
it<00:01:04.759> all<00:01:04.910> goes<00:01:05.059> into<00:01:05.300> this<00:01:05.509> container<00:01:06.759> which

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
it all goes into this container which

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.810 
it all goes into this container which
will<00:01:07.789> then<00:01:08.119> go<00:01:08.330> into<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.810> nutribullet<00:01:09.820> so

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
will then go into the nutribullet so

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.910 
will then go into the nutribullet so
what's<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.240> law<00:01:11.360> there's<00:01:11.690> a<00:01:11.780> order<00:01:12.170> loading

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
what's the law there's a order loading

vegetables<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:20.149> avoid<00:01:20.390> problems<00:01:20.630> with<00:01:21.020> pears

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
vegetables to avoid problems with pears

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.340 
vegetables to avoid problems with pears
you<00:01:21.820> typically<00:01:23.020> want<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.229> avoid<00:01:24.590> using<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you typically want to avoid using the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.200 
you typically want to avoid using the
seeds<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.700> things<00:01:29.149> like<00:01:29.420> that<00:01:30.850> in<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.000> case

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
seeds and things like that in this case

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.940 
seeds and things like that in this case
though<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.689> can<00:01:32.810> actually<00:01:32.900> use<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.590> seeds<00:01:33.799> if

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
though you can actually use the seeds if

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.340 
though you can actually use the seeds if
you<00:01:34.070> wanted<00:01:34.400> to<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.909> prefer<00:01:35.509> not<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.200> I'm

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
you wanted to I prefer not to so I'm

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.740 
you wanted to I prefer not to so I'm
going<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.530> cut<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:36.829> up<00:01:37.070> no<00:01:38.060> seeds<00:01:38.390> have<00:01:38.540> cut

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
going to cut this up no seeds have cut

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.679 
going to cut this up no seeds have cut
out<00:01:38.840> just<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.259> heart<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.650> this<00:01:39.770> part<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
out just the heart to this part of the

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.749 
out just the heart to this part of the
pear<00:01:41.689> because<00:01:42.079> that's<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.530> way<00:01:42.650> I'm<00:01:43.490> kind<00:01:43.729> of

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
pear because that's the way I'm kind of

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.010 
pear because that's the way I'm kind of
picky<00:01:44.119> I<00:01:44.149> could<00:01:44.509> just<00:01:44.720> write<00:01:44.990> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
picky I could just write and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.710 
picky I could just write and
I<00:01:47.049> just<00:01:47.619> kind<00:01:47.829> of<00:01:47.860> chop<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.540> make<00:01:49.540> sure<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
I just kind of chop it up make sure I

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.840 
I just kind of chop it up make sure I
cut<00:01:49.960> the<00:01:50.170> seat<00:01:50.409> portion<00:01:50.920> just<00:01:53.490> kind<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.549> into

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
cut the seat portion just kind of into

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.130 
cut the seat portion just kind of into
the<00:01:54.909> most<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.479> bite<00:01:55.659> sized<00:01:55.930> squares

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
the most of the bite sized squares

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.899 
the most of the bite sized squares
they're<00:01:56.680> gonna<00:01:56.770> get<00:01:56.979> chopped<00:01:57.250> up<00:01:57.460> every<00:01:57.790> way

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
they're gonna get chopped up every way

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.300 
they're gonna get chopped up every way
my<00:01:58.600> parents<00:01:58.780> are<00:01:58.990> pretty<00:01:59.110> soft<00:01:59.470> so<00:01:59.770> you<00:02:00.130> don't

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
my parents are pretty soft so you don't

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.440 
my parents are pretty soft so you don't
have<00:02:00.399> to<00:02:00.549> go<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.700> little<00:02:00.850> smaller<00:02:01.210> size<00:02:03.450> my

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
have to go a little smaller size my

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.410 
have to go a little smaller size my
parent<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> pair<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:05.170> put<00:02:05.470> in<00:02:05.590> last<00:02:05.830> because<00:02:06.070> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
parent the pair I put in last because it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.419 
parent the pair I put in last because it
it's<00:02:07.420> probably<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.869> easiest<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:08.500> cut<00:02:08.709> up<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
it's probably the easiest to cut up the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.710 
it's probably the easiest to cut up the
hardest<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.910> cut<00:02:10.060> up<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.300> probably<00:02:10.599> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
hardest to cut up is probably the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.150 
hardest to cut up is probably the
carrots<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.780> when<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.959> say<00:02:14.230> glass<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.739> really

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
carrots so and when I say glass I really

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.740 
carrots so and when I say glass I really
meat<00:02:15.340> first<00:02:15.640> because<00:02:16.330> everything's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
meat first because everything's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.070 
meat first because everything's
upside-down<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.670> son<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.870> first

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
upside-down like that son the first

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.449 
upside-down like that son the first
thing<00:02:20.230> I'm<00:02:20.350> going<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.530> put<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.830> will<00:02:21.310> be<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
thing I'm going to put in will be the

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.840 
thing I'm going to put in will be the
pears<00:02:22.620> which<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.890> last<00:02:24.130> level<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.730> get

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
pears which is the last level to get

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.780 
pears which is the last level to get
mixed<00:02:25.060> up

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.009 

then<00:02:31.739> probably<00:02:32.739> go<00:02:32.950> with<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.430> celery<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
then probably go with the celery and the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.949 
then probably go with the celery and the
radishes<00:02:35.790> celery<00:02:36.790> actually<00:02:37.299> mixes<00:02:37.810> and

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
radishes celery actually mixes and

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.270 
radishes celery actually mixes and
breaks<00:02:38.170> down<00:02:38.349> barriers<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:38.920> two

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
breaks down barriers because two

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.670 
breaks down barriers because two
radishes<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.939> put<00:02:40.120> carrots<00:02:40.540> again<00:02:40.689> a<00:02:41.200> little

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
radishes and put carrots again a little

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.479 
radishes and put carrots again a little
trickier

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
trickier

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.240 
trickier
then<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.299> crushing<00:02:43.650> grapes<00:02:44.650> and<00:02:45.010> these

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
then that's crushing grapes and these

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.140 
then that's crushing grapes and these
are<00:02:45.430> seedless<00:02:45.670> grapes<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:47.349> red<00:02:47.530> variety<00:02:48.340> and
