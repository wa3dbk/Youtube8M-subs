00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a roll of quarters is ten dollars so if

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.550 
a roll of quarters is ten dollars so if
you<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> coin<00:01:37.200> start

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you were to put this in the coin start

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
you were to put this in the coin start
one<00:01:38.189> dollar<00:01:38.430> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.729> gone<00:01:38.909> already<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
one dollar would be gone already for

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.120 
one dollar would be gone already for
beach<00:01:39.780> roll<00:01:40.079> quarters<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.680> by<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> time<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
beach roll quarters so by the time you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
beach roll quarters so by the time you
get<00:01:41.280> through<00:01:41.430> these<00:01:41.520> bags<00:01:41.850> you've<00:01:42.750> saved

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
get through these bags you've saved

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.550 
get through these bags you've saved
quite<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> bit<00:01:43.740> off<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> coin<00:01:44.729> store

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
quite a bit off going to the coin store

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
quite a bit off going to the coin store
so<00:01:46.560> then<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:47.189> count<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.729> let's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
so then you just count them out let's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.969 
so then you just count them out let's
say<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.110> some<00:01:49.259> pennies<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
say we got some pennies here like I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.679 
say we got some pennies here like I
didn't<00:01:50.250> jar<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.119> role<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
didn't jar you get your role of a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899 
didn't jar you get your role of a
pennies<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.710> tells<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.280> 50<00:01:53.579> cents

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
pennies it tells you on there 50 cents

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.569 
pennies it tells you on there 50 cents
50<00:01:54.030> pennies<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.659> count<00:01:55.140> them<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.350> BAM<00:01:55.770> these

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
50 pennies you count them out BAM these

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.830 
50 pennies you count them out BAM these
are<00:01:56.729> even<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.149> ones<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.479> don't<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
are even the good ones you don't have to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
are even the good ones you don't have to
close<00:01:58.079> at<00:01:58.290> both<00:01:58.439> ends<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.920> end<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.159> already

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
close at both ends one end is already

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.149 
close at both ends one end is already
crimped<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.649> fold<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.950> shut

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
crimped so then you just fold a shut

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
crimped so then you just fold a shut
then<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.820> can<00:02:02.969> start<00:02:03.119> counting<00:02:03.270> again<00:02:03.860> that's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
then you can start counting again that's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.649 
then you can start counting again that's
the<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.369> hard<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> long<00:02:06.329> way<00:02:06.540> it's

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the the hard way to do the long way it's

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
the the hard way to do the long way it's
not<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.930> bad<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> count<00:02:07.799> on

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
not that bad but you have to count on

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
not that bad but you have to count on
every<00:02:08.129> roll<00:02:08.340> what<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.209> find<00:02:09.450> one

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
every roll what I would do is find one

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.770 
every roll what I would do is find one
once<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.080> count<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.819> go<00:02:11.819> ahead<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.120> trim<00:02:12.569> off

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
once you count one go ahead and trim off

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
once you count one go ahead and trim off
this<00:02:13.020> cardboard

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
this cardboard

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890 
this cardboard
right<00:02:14.310> at<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> level<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.120> penny<00:02:15.360> so<00:02:15.750> it's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
right at the level of the penny so it's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.990 
right at the level of the penny so it's
flush<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> penny<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.460> just<00:02:17.760> cut

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
flush with the penny so you just cut

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.540 
flush with the penny so you just cut
this<00:02:18.120> off<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.600> now<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.080> save<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.860> roll<00:02:20.190> or

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
this off and now you save this roll or

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.130 
this off and now you save this roll or
you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.820> do<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.210> any<00:02:21.390> tool<00:02:21.720> enough<00:02:22.050> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you can do this with any tool enough to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.300 
you can do this with any tool enough to
be<00:02:22.200> cardboard<00:02:22.650> if<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.830> wanted<00:02:23.100> something

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
be cardboard if you wanted something

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.090 
be cardboard if you wanted something
that<00:02:23.460> was<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> little<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.740> long-lasting<00:02:25.740> find

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that was a little more long-lasting find

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.350 
that was a little more long-lasting find
something<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.550> pennies<00:02:26.820> fit<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.180> nicely

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
something that the pennies fit in nicely

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.110 
something that the pennies fit in nicely
like<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.810> maybe<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.170> cigar<00:02:28.500> tube<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.220> plastic

quarters of course whatever but the same
thing<00:03:01.020> applies<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.530> we've<00:03:01.620> got<00:03:01.800> an<00:03:01.890> easy

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
thing applies so that we've got an easy

thing applies so that we've got an easy
way<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.460> count<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.600> have<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.960> do<00:03:04.050> is

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
way to count it all you have to do is

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.260 
way to count it all you have to do is
