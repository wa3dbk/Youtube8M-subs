00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.190 
here pick up the vibrations measure it
and<00:01:48.539> tell<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.349> different<00:01:49.890> tuners<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:51.200> how

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and tell the different tuners how how

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.179 
and tell the different tuners how how
much<00:01:52.379> they<00:01:52.560> need<00:01:52.679> to<00:01:52.799> turn<00:01:53.989> okay<00:01:55.009> right<00:01:56.009> now<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
much they need to turn okay right now I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.490 
much they need to turn okay right now I
need<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.489> just<00:01:56.520> fine-tune<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.360> e<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.349> kind

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
need to just fine-tune this e it's kind

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.660 
need to just fine-tune this e it's kind
of<00:01:58.530> difficult<00:01:58.709> while<00:01:59.189> I'm<00:01:59.310> holding<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
of difficult while I'm holding the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.429 
of difficult while I'm holding the
guitar<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.179> fashion<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.599> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.319> it

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
guitar in this fashion so you can see it

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.730 
guitar in this fashion so you can see it
yourself

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.010 

what<00:02:06.369> would<00:02:06.490> normally<00:02:06.640> take<00:02:06.880> minutes<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.750> do

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
what would normally take minutes to do

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.260 
what would normally take minutes to do
now<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.739> just<00:02:08.770> takes<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.190> matter<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.459> seconds

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.970 

so<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:14.990> go<00:02:15.050> and<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.380> turns<00:02:15.530> itself<00:02:15.770> off

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so there you go and it turns itself off

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.820 
so there you go and it turns itself off
just<00:02:16.490> simply<00:02:16.910> like<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.270> now<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.170> want<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.710> go

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
just simply like that now I want to go

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.290 
just simply like that now I want to go
ahead<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.310> go<00:02:19.670> back<00:02:19.700> into<00:02:20.060> standard<00:02:20.480> mode

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
ahead and go back into standard mode

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.820 
ahead and go back into standard mode
standard<00:02:23.300> tuning<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> first<00:02:24.260> preset<00:02:24.680> is

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
standard tuning and the first preset is

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.260 
standard tuning and the first preset is
that<00:02:24.980> biggy<00:02:25.190> they're<00:02:25.610> selected<00:02:26.150> with<00:02:26.240> a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
that biggy they're selected with a

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.890 
that biggy they're selected with a
joypad<00:02:26.510> hit<00:02:27.260> enter<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.790> once<00:02:29.120> again<00:02:29.240> it'll<00:02:29.510> go

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
joypad hit enter and once again it'll go

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.410 
joypad hit enter and once again it'll go
to<00:02:29.960> its<00:02:30.410> tuning<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.910> then<00:02:32.030> I'm<00:02:32.150> going<00:02:32.330> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
to its tuning and then I'm going to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.030 
to its tuning and then I'm going to
simply<00:02:32.720> strum<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.300> see<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.810> I

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
simply strum it then you can see here I

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.010 
simply strum it then you can see here I
just<00:02:37.040> need<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.490> pluck<00:02:38.330> these<00:02:38.540> strings<00:02:38.930> here

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
just need to pluck these strings here

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.510 
just need to pluck these strings here
and<00:02:42.020> then<00:02:42.110> there<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.290> go<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> went<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.490> just

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
and then there you go so I went in just

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.670 
and then there you go so I went in just
a<00:02:43.730> matter<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:43.940> seconds<00:02:44.300> between<00:02:44.480> dadgad<00:02:45.170> Led
