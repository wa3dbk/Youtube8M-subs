let's<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.610> magnetar<00:00:49.250> which<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.850> know

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
let's get a magnetar which are you know

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.069 
let's get a magnetar which are you know
pretty<00:00:51.210> quick

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
pretty quick

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
pretty quick
they're<00:00:52.920> fairly<00:00:53.070> quick<00:00:53.309> indeed<00:00:53.629> their<00:00:54.629> stats
