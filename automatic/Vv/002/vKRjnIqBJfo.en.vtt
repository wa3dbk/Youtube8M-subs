00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.970 
so I was really excited to watch this
one<00:00:12.179> start<00:00:12.960> out<00:00:13.110> I<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> say<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
one start out I want to say that the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.700 
one start out I want to say that the
animation<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.700> film<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.179> really<00:00:15.710> really

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
animation in this film is really really

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.330 
animation in this film is really really
good

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
good

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.880 
good
like<00:00:17.750> considering<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.320> was<00:00:19.439> all<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> way

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
like considering that it was all the way

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.380 
like considering that it was all the way
back<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.310> they<00:00:20.460> probably<00:00:20.699> didn't<00:00:21.060> have<00:00:21.180> any

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
back then they probably didn't have any

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.290 
back then they probably didn't have any
of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> technology<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:23.100> we<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.970> today<00:00:24.180> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
of the technology that we have today so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
of the technology that we have today so
they<00:00:24.630> had<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> probably<00:00:25.230> draw<00:00:25.439> every<00:00:25.800> single

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
they had to probably draw every single

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.580 
they had to probably draw every single
frame<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.640> every<00:00:27.240> single<00:00:27.900> frame<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.410> this

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
frame and every single frame of this

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.109 
frame and every single frame of this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the dwarfs I love the witch stepmother

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.310 
the dwarfs I love the witch stepmother
person<00:01:02.329> stole<00:01:03.329> me<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> good<00:01:03.930> character

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
person stole me it was a good character

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
person stole me it was a good character
it's<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.280> her<00:01:05.430> appeal<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it's just that I think her appeal is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.200 
it's just that I think her appeal is
more<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:08.630> her<00:01:09.630> being<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.020> naive<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.210> very

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
more of her being very naive and very

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
more of her being very naive and very
innocent<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.590> why<00:01:13.710> most

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
innocent and I think that's why most

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
innocent and I think that's why most
people<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.490> snow<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> because<00:01:15.150> she's<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.600> like

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
like thought out not thought out but

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.420 
like thought out not thought out but
more<00:03:47.140> like<00:03:48.900> spread<00:03:49.900> out<00:03:49.930> kind<00:03:50.560> of<00:03:50.650> ending<00:03:51.160> like

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
more like spread out kind of ending like

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.530 
more like spread out kind of ending like
more<00:03:51.640> evenly<00:03:52.030> paced<00:03:52.299> because<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:53.019> like<00:03:53.980> its<00:03:54.160> bit

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
more evenly paced because I like its bit

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.949 
more evenly paced because I like its bit
endings<00:03:55.540> very<00:03:56.610> like<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.880> goes<00:03:58.120> by<00:03:58.299> very<00:03:58.329> fast

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
endings very like it goes by very fast

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.319 
endings very like it goes by very fast
so<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.260> didn't<00:03:59.620> expect<00:04:00.070> that<00:04:00.310> so<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.790> wish<00:04:01.120> they

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
so I didn't expect that so I wish they

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.000 
so I didn't expect that so I wish they
put<00:04:01.510> more<00:04:01.660> time<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.140> but<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.320> understand<00:04:02.829> why

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
put more time in it but I understand why

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.259 
put more time in it but I understand why
it's<00:04:03.220> so<00:04:03.400> short<00:04:03.670> because<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.970> would've<00:04:04.180> taken

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
it's so short because it would've taken

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.170 
it's so short because it would've taken
more<00:04:04.570> time<00:04:04.840> that's<00:04:05.560> basically<00:04:06.459> yeah<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.970> mean

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
more time that's basically yeah I mean

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.390 
more time that's basically yeah I mean
it<00:04:07.329> wasn't<00:04:07.570> really<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.739> was<00:04:08.860> an<00:04:08.980> alright<00:04:09.160> movie

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
it wasn't really it was an alright movie

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.160 
it wasn't really it was an alright movie
and<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.000> has<00:04:10.150> I<00:04:10.329> think<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.750> has<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> certain

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
and it has I think it has a certain

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.039 
and it has I think it has a certain
charm<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:12.610> really<00:04:13.030> liked<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.870> would

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
charm that I really liked and I would

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:14.759
