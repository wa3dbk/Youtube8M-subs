00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
your this shape then you got to get this

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.160 
your this shape then you got to get this
piece<00:01:41.939> clip-on<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:43.070> just<00:01:44.070> focus<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.430> here

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
piece clip-on there just focus up here

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.149 
piece clip-on there just focus up here
so<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.710> from<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.450> there<00:01:49.820> look<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:51.030> look

up turn up there one there then you turn
the<00:01:57.719> long<00:01:57.930> piece<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.350> free<00:01:58.920> nut<00:01:59.750> simple

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the long piece here free nut simple

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.959 
the long piece here free nut simple
puppies<00:02:01.079> now<00:02:04.219> ok

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
puppies now ok

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.930 
puppies now ok
and<00:02:06.969> we<00:02:07.479> got<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.750> get<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.140> whole<00:02:08.379> face<00:02:08.940> here

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and we got to get this whole face here

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.790 
and we got to get this whole face here
do<00:02:10.629> that<00:02:10.840> move<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:12.810> second<00:02:13.810> dream<00:02:13.959> pace<00:02:14.379> one

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
do that move this second dream pace one

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.110 
do that move this second dream pace one
to<00:02:15.480> turn<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.629> once<00:02:16.840> push<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.379> forward<00:02:17.970> then<00:02:18.970> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
to turn at once push it forward then you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.920 
to turn at once push it forward then you
should<00:02:19.300> hook<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:19.800> get<00:02:20.800> this<00:02:20.980> base<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.569> side

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
should hook up get this base to the side

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.309 
should hook up get this base to the side
just<00:02:23.230> turn<00:02:23.860> around<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:27.010> read<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.459> again

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
just turn around and just read it again

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.860 
just turn around and just read it again
but<00:02:30.450> now<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.840> really<00:02:32.739> easy<00:02:33.010> part<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.910> if

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
but now this is really easy part so if

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.710 
but now this is really easy part so if
you<00:02:34.989> got<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.349> first<00:02:35.680> part<00:02:36.330> turn<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.510> piece

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
you got the first part turn this piece

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.100 
you got the first part turn this piece
here<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:41.220> this<00:02:42.220> way<00:02:42.459> once<00:02:43.170> then<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.200> forgot

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
here that this way once then I forgot

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.180 
here that this way once then I forgot
then<00:02:47.110> turn<00:02:47.380> around<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.599> this<00:02:49.780> face

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
then turn around so to get this face

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.850 
then turn around so to get this face
there<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:52.000> since<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.019> same<00:02:53.290> photon

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
there to there since the same photon

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.550 
there to there since the same photon
they're<00:02:54.069> great<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.930> min<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.370> turn

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
they're great for a min so on that turn

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:05.270 
they're great for a min so on that turn
sincerness<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:01.750> did<00:03:02.079> two<00:03:02.500> runs<00:03:02.799> this<00:03:03.220> way

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
sincerness then did two runs this way

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.150 
sincerness then did two runs this way
get<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.400> face<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.690> if<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.530> turn<00:03:09.040> that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
get this face to that if you turn that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:17.160 
get this face to that if you turn that
once<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.790> then<00:03:09.970> turn<00:03:10.239> around<00:03:14.850> okay<00:03:16.170> let's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
once and then turn around okay let's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.879 
once and then turn around okay let's
look<00:03:17.350> up<00:03:18.510> then<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.600> get<00:03:19.720> give<00:03:20.049> up<00:03:20.200> its<00:03:20.350> ass<00:03:20.560> to

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
look up then you get give up its ass to

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.699 
look up then you get give up its ass to
the<00:03:21.069> turn<00:03:22.000> there<00:03:22.209> what<00:03:25.109> then<00:03:26.109> turn<00:03:26.500> this

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the turn there what then turn this

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.370 
the turn there what then turn this
face<00:03:26.950> once<00:03:27.340> turn<00:03:28.329> up<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.799> turn<00:03:29.799> this<00:03:29.920> place

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
face once turn up is turn this place

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.979 
face once turn up is turn this place
then<00:03:32.380> turn<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:32.980> once<00:03:33.250> again<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.180> lift<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:34.900> up

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
then turn this once again and lift it up

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.699 
then turn this once again and lift it up
