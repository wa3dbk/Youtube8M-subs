board<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.880> fully<00:00:12.120> dried<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.690> eight<00:00:12.840> hours<00:00:13.170> in

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
board is fully dried for eight hours in

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.930 
board is fully dried for eight hours in
the<00:00:13.349> bag<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:13.920> I'm<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.580> leave<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.849> you

the bag so I'm going to leave it to you
boys<00:00:15.179> show<00:00:16.020> them<00:00:16.109> how<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.320> done<00:00:35.090> now<00:00:36.090> let's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
boys show them how it's done now let's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
boys show them how it's done now let's
put<00:00:36.570> our<00:00:36.600> center<00:00:36.930> line<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.649> our<00:00:37.829> rocket

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
put our center line down with our rocket

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
put our center line down with our rocket
ruler<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.930> mark<00:00:40.200> your

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.189 

and<00:00:59.890> with<00:01:00.309> those<00:01:00.579> down<00:01:00.969> you<00:01:01.270> can<00:01:01.480> connect<00:01:01.899> the

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
and with those down you can connect the

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.390 
and with those down you can connect the
dots<00:01:02.469> for<00:01:02.860> your<00:01:03.040> center<00:01:03.370> line<00:01:03.579> which<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:06.250> be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
dots for your center line which will be

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.850 
dots for your center line which will be
used<00:01:06.790> at<00:01:07.000> several<00:01:07.659> stages<00:01:08.049> throughout<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
used at several stages throughout the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:30.540 
used at several stages throughout the
builds<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.810> with<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.380> done<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.920> apply

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
builds and with that done we can apply

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:39.900 
builds and with that done we can apply
the<00:01:30.610> shape<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.920> with<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.250> shape<00:01:39.550> you<00:01:39.729> can

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
the shape now with this shape you can

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.960 
the shape now with this shape you can
see<00:01:40.119> I've<00:01:40.270> cut<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.920> triangles<00:01:42.399> or

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
see I've cut out little triangles or

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.919 
see I've cut out little triangles or
diamonds<00:01:43.420> inside<00:01:43.960> this<00:01:44.590> will<00:01:44.890> let<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.929> align

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
diamonds inside this will let you align

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.969 
diamonds inside this will let you align
your<00:01:47.229> board<00:01:47.770> with<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.670> center<00:01:49.149> line<00:01:49.179> on<00:01:49.979> your

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
your board with the center line on your

00:01:50.979 --> 00:02:07.199 
your board with the center line on your
molds<00:02:04.050> okay<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.520> with<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:06.940> done<00:02:07.179> let's

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
molds okay and with that done let's

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:14.550 
molds okay and with that done let's
trace<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:12.310> I'm<00:02:13.180> tracing<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.780> by<00:02:13.959> hand<00:02:14.290> but

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
trace now I'm tracing this by hand but

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.309 
trace now I'm tracing this by hand but
for<00:02:15.099> edges<00:02:15.489> that<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:15.730> straight<00:02:16.270> i<00:02:16.540> really

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
for edges that are straight i really

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.790 
for edges that are straight i really
suggest<00:02:17.530> using<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.190> ruler<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.410> know<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
suggest using a ruler if you know that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.589 
suggest using a ruler if you know that
you've<00:02:20.980> got<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.520> long<00:02:21.730> straight<00:02:22.090> edge<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
you've got one long straight edge you

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.350 
you've got one long straight edge you
might<00:02:22.780> as<00:02:22.959> well<00:02:23.459> make<00:02:24.459> sure<00:02:24.520> you've<00:02:24.879> got<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
might as well make sure you've got the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.910 
might as well make sure you've got the
best<00:02:25.629> straight<00:02:26.050> edge<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.260> can<00:02:26.590> get<00:02:34.709> there<00:02:35.709> we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
best straight edge you can get there we

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520 
best straight edge you can get there we
go<00:02:36.480> pull<00:02:37.480> off<00:02:37.629> your<00:02:37.810> shape<00:02:38.050> once<00:02:38.319> you're<00:02:38.500> sure

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
go pull off your shape once you're sure

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.280 
go pull off your shape once you're sure
you've<00:02:38.920> got<00:02:39.129> all<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.340> them<00:02:39.610> covered<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.620> voila

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
you've got all of them covered and voila

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.710 
you've got all of them covered and voila
so<00:02:44.290> now<00:02:44.440> I'll<00:02:44.709> be<00:02:44.739> placing<00:02:45.610> my<00:02:46.060> truck<00:02:46.420> holes

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
so now I'll be placing my truck holes

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.589 
so now I'll be placing my truck holes
with<00:02:46.989> our<00:02:47.110> rocket<00:02:47.500> ruler<00:02:47.739> as<00:02:47.860> well<00:02:48.599> there's

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
with our rocket ruler as well there's

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.229 
with our rocket ruler as well there's
two<00:02:49.840> ways<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.200> do<00:02:50.379> this<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:51.220> figure<00:02:52.030> out

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
two ways to do this you can figure out

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.570 
two ways to do this you can figure out
your<00:02:52.360> wheel<00:02:52.780> base<00:02:53.019> from<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.500> center<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.250> work

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
your wheel base from the center and work

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.750 
your wheel base from the center and work
from<00:02:54.819> there<00:02:55.360> or<00:02:56.290> do<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.590> I<00:02:56.769> do<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.250> work<00:02:57.519> from

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
from there or do like I do and work from

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:22.810 
from there or do like I do and work from
the<00:02:57.910> tips

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.570 

you<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.030> align<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:25.020> rocket<00:03:25.500> ruler<00:03:25.860> with

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
you can align the rocket ruler with

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.370 
you can align the rocket ruler with
these<00:03:26.880> diamonds<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.660> middle<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.230> like

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
these diamonds in the middle just like

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.210 
these diamonds in the middle just like

or<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:33.150> punch<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:35.160> make<00:03:35.310> yourself<00:03:35.460> some

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
or a punch you can make yourself some
