00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.850 

I'm<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.480> guitar<00:02:15.900> player<00:02:16.050> which<00:02:16.380> means<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
I'm a guitar player which means that

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.650 
I'm a guitar player which means that
it's<00:02:17.040> hard<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.820> what<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.120> doing<00:02:18.390> from<00:02:18.510> a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
it's hard to see what I'm doing from a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.930 
it's hard to see what I'm doing from a
distance<00:02:19.020> because<00:02:19.230> fast<00:02:19.860> guitar<00:02:20.250> has<00:02:20.550> small

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
distance because fast guitar has small

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.980 
distance because fast guitar has small
little<00:02:21.330> motions

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
little motions

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.840 
little motions
that's<00:02:22.770> why<00:02:22.890> trouble<00:02:23.190> clinics<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's why trouble clinics are so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.310 
that's why trouble clinics are so
popular<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.300> think<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:24.870> drummers<00:02:25.200> have

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
popular I think because drummers have

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.990 
popular I think because drummers have
big<00:02:25.590> huge<00:02:25.800> motions<00:02:26.220> their<00:02:26.400> arms<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.790> moving

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
big huge motions their arms are moving

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.130 
big huge motions their arms are moving
around<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.660> see<00:02:27.690> what<00:02:28.020> they're

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
around and you can see what they're

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.770 
around and you can see what they're
doing<00:02:28.170> from<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> long<00:02:28.770> way<00:02:28.920> away<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.690> I'm

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
doing from a long way away so what I'm

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.180 
doing from a long way away so what I'm
gonna<00:02:30.870> do<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.140> demonstrate<00:02:31.290> some<00:02:31.770> of<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.010> is

[Music]

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.870 

so<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.220> thing<00:03:15.520> is<00:03:15.580> pretty<00:03:16.030> simple<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:18.580> some

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
so the thing is pretty simple it's some

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.180 
so the thing is pretty simple it's some
I<00:03:19.150> think<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.630> good<00:03:19.870> sort<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:20.860> teaching

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
I think this is a good sort of teaching

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.400 
I think this is a good sort of teaching
technique<00:03:21.580> because<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:21.820> makes<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:23.320> know

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
technique because it makes the you know

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.570 
technique because it makes the you know
if<00:03:23.470> you're<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.680> student<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.340> really

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
if you're the student you can really

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.710 
if you're the student you can really
understand<00:03:24.970> what's<00:03:25.090> going<00:03:25.330> on<00:03:25.390> with<00:03:25.570> them

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
understand what's going on with them

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.850 
understand what's going on with them
with<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> picking<00:03:26.170> is<00:03:26.290> you're<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.500> always

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
with a picking is you're not always

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.950 
with a picking is you're not always
picking<00:03:27.310> everything<00:03:27.700> at<00:03:28.270> least<00:03:28.360> I'm<00:03:28.600> not<00:03:28.780> that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
picking everything at least I'm not that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.840 
picking everything at least I'm not that
it<00:03:29.050> rarely<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.190> occasionally<00:03:30.640> I'll<00:03:30.730> do

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
it rarely and occasionally I'll do

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.010 
it rarely and occasionally I'll do
something<00:03:31.030> else<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:34.900> mostly<00:03:35.710> it's<00:03:37.020> mostly

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
something else that's mostly it's mostly

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.420 
something else that's mostly it's mostly
I<00:03:38.110> combine<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.620> two<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.830> like<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.220> sound

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
I combine the two I like that sound

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.700 
I combine the two I like that sound
better
