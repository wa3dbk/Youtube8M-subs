00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
hundred and ninety nine pixels so

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.110 
hundred and ninety nine pixels so
basically<00:03:47.229> what<00:03:47.590> this<00:03:47.949> means<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.819> then<00:03:48.909> we<00:03:49.000> do

basically what this means and then we do

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.319 
basically what this means and then we do
an<00:03:49.239> opening<00:03:49.629> curly<00:03:49.780> braces<00:03:51.180> closing<00:03:52.180> curly

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
braces so my web page is gonna look like

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.170 
braces so my web page is gonna look like
this<00:03:56.699> for<00:03:57.699> 800<00:03:58.419> pixels<00:03:58.900> all<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.409> way<00:03:59.530> up<00:03:59.709> to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
this for 800 pixels all the way up to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.309 
this for 800 pixels all the way up to
1440<00:04:01.180> which<00:04:01.299> is<00:04:01.449> the<00:04:01.540> max<00:04:01.780> width<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.169> I've

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
1440 which is the max width that I've

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.800 
1440 which is the max width that I've
set<00:04:02.590> but<00:04:03.099> when<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.459> device<00:04:03.849> goes<00:04:04.180> smaller

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
set but when the device goes smaller

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.409 
set but when the device goes smaller
than<00:04:05.319> 800<00:04:06.189> pixels<00:04:06.579> who<00:04:06.759> knows<00:04:06.939> that<00:04:07.120> could<00:04:07.269> be

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
than 800 pixels who knows that could be

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.059 
than 800 pixels who knows that could be
around<00:04:07.659> there<00:04:07.959> that's<00:04:08.500> when<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.769> want<00:04:08.979> it<00:04:09.009> to

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
around there that's when I want it to

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.800 
around there that's when I want it to
switch<00:04:09.370> from<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.699> two<00:04:09.879> column<00:04:10.239> layout<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.780> the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
switch from the two column layout to the

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.490 
switch from the two column layout to the
one<00:04:11.139> column<00:04:11.560> layout<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.759> anything<00:04:13.689> smaller

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
one column layout so anything smaller

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.990 
one column layout so anything smaller
than<00:04:14.650> 800<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.489> gonna<00:04:15.639> get<00:04:15.819> these

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
than 800 are gonna get these

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.819 
than 800 are gonna get these
characteristics<00:04:16.810> and<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.409> just<00:04:17.620> need<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
characteristics and I just need to

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.860 
characteristics and I just need to
manipulate<00:04:18.310> those<00:04:18.459> key<00:04:18.729> elements<00:04:18.940> so<00:04:19.750> I've

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
manipulate those key elements so I've

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.240 
manipulate those key elements so I've
got<00:04:20.019> my<00:04:20.169> sidebar<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:22.080> my<00:04:23.080> sidebar<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:24.039> now

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
got my sidebar and my sidebar is now

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.040 
got my sidebar and my sidebar is now
gonna<00:04:25.000> be

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
gonna be

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.640 
gonna be
with<00:04:26.460> 100%<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.699> have<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.090> negate<00:04:28.569> the<00:04:29.199> former

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
with 100% I have to negate the former

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.510 
with 100% I have to negate the former
200<00:04:30.190> pixel<00:04:30.520> wide<00:04:30.789> width<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.990> my<00:04:32.259> sidebar<00:04:32.830> so

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
200 pixel wide width of my sidebar so

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.939 
200 pixel wide width of my sidebar so
it's<00:04:33.699> gonna<00:04:33.789> have<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.000> width<00:04:34.419> 100%<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.620> it's

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
it's gonna have a width 100% and it's

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.710 
it's gonna have a width 100% and it's
gonna<00:04:36.069> be<00:04:36.220> a<00:04:36.250> float<00:04:36.669> none<00:04:36.940> before<00:04:37.509> it<00:04:37.629> was

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
gonna be a float none before it was

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.149 
gonna be a float none before it was
floating<00:04:38.139> to<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.259> left<00:04:38.349> now<00:04:38.800> I'm<00:04:38.860> gonna<00:04:38.979> say

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
floating to the left now I'm gonna say

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.309 
floating to the left now I'm gonna say
no<00:04:39.400> float<00:04:39.849> I'm<00:04:40.479> gonna<00:04:40.659> put<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:40.870> little<00:04:41.020> men

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319

and I'm gonna put in overflow:hidden now

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.300 
and I'm gonna put in overflow:hidden now
the<00:04:58.960> reason<00:04:59.349> I'm<00:04:59.440> putting<00:04:59.469> overflow:hidden

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
the reason I'm putting overflow:hidden

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.850 
the reason I'm putting overflow:hidden
on<00:05:00.909> this<00:05:01.150> new<00:05:01.449> sidebar<00:05:02.110> which<00:05:02.530> really

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
on this new sidebar which really

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.350 
on this new sidebar which really
shouldn't<00:05:03.129> be<00:05:03.219> called<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.460> sidebar<00:05:03.909> anymore

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
shouldn't be called a sidebar anymore

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.230 
shouldn't be called a sidebar anymore
anymore<00:05:05.229> is<00:05:05.409> because<00:05:05.740> I'm<00:05:06.400> gonna<00:05:06.580> be<00:05:06.729> floating

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
anymore is because I'm gonna be floating

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.110 
anymore is because I'm gonna be floating
my<00:05:07.990> list<00:05:08.319> item<00:05:08.650> my<00:05:08.770> anchor<00:05:09.159> elements<00:05:09.610> my<00:05:09.729> menu

items<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.629> the<00:05:11.020> overflow:hidden<00:05:11.560> will<00:05:12.159> help

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
items and the overflow:hidden will help

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.279 
items and the overflow:hidden will help
my<00:05:13.379> will<00:05:14.379> help<00:05:14.710> this<00:05:15.099> container<00:05:16.090> expand<00:05:17.080> and

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 
my will help this container expand and

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.020 
my will help this container expand and
contract<00:05:17.379> to<00:05:17.889> accommodate<00:05:18.520> this<00:05:18.699> floating

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
contract to accommodate this floating

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.119 
contract to accommodate this floating
elements<00:05:19.300> now<00:05:20.289> I'm<00:05:20.409> also<00:05:20.590> gonna<00:05:20.740> go<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:20.949> my
