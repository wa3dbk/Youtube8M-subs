00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.720
 It is true 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.610
 my name is eugenio is electronic and in 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.329
 facilities we are 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.249
 s 5 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.039
 this is a being that counts for what 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.839
 are two guys using two companies 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.630
 different two different companies in the 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.040
 same cell 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.570
 and that is very good for people who 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.240
 has what is a chip for work 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.980
 and another personal chip for what is the 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.080
 family use then you can use both 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.920
 chip on the same cell phone and not have to 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.820
 be with two cell phones at the same time we have 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.980
 which is 3.5 inch 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.880
 we have what is Dual Camera 2 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 megapixel 3.5 audio output for what 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.050
 which are headphones and micro usb which is 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.300
 the universal entry for what 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.060
 download the equipment 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.770
 It is highly recommended to this team or 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 any other always before using it 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.750
 put a microsd memory for what 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.790
 are music videos videos and also for 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.850
 pass some applications that leave you 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 to the memory card and not to fill the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.160
 internal storage of the equipment 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.240
 let's show you a little how to do this 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.100
 which is always going to adjustments we are going to 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.790
 more and let's go to the part of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.790
 Applications 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.479
 here in applications better to show 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.440
 all the applications that we download 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.960
 the team in this case are these 5 and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.850
 as you can see each one is weighing what 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.180
 which is what is the own weight of the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.460
 application and here below shows us 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.990
 how much we have occupied in blue and gray 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.390
 what remains free is always 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.920
 important that we have a little bit of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.080
 free memory for what are the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.480
 text messages and all the things that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.730
 they want to get us to the team later on 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 sd card will show us what 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.880
 applications let us go to the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 card and what is the the busy part 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.890
 of the card in blue and what is so 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.680
 gray all the part that is free in the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 team if there is any application that does not 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.510
 it happens we still click on the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.580
 application and we go to the part that says 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.069
 move to sd card in this case says 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.970
 move the phone because it's already gone 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.850
 to the card 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.610
 another very important thing is that when 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.610
 we put our chip we look if 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.710
 what is it we took the mobile data or 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.660
 not for this it is very important to go to 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.460
 also more settings 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 and here we are going to see what networks are 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.920
 mobile in this case we have a 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.610
 clear chip we click on clear and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.950
 we go to apn that is here below and enap in 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.300
 heres in this clear case automatically 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.380
 to the polar the chip already made us the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.970
 configuration let's see what is all 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.860
 the configuration already made is very 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.650
 important to see that this configuration 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.380
 is already made in the equipment to be able 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.120
 navigate with what is mobile internet in 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.980
 If this cell have what 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.600
 is internet 3g sends 850 2100 so 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.820
 for example in the case of Buenos Aires 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.800
 we have what is internet 3g with 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.600
 Movistar with clear and new people to 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.700
 also able to communicate through 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.500
 the mobile network but at speeds two that 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.230
 good that there are some applications that 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.110
 we went down to the team after what we have 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.239
 is the browser and from the browser 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.340
 we can enter what are different 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.860
 web pages simply with a 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:01.440
 computer here what we are 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.440
 entering automatically is to facebook 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.150
 we go back and something else 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.120
 important in this team is to maintain what 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.699
 what is the button 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.579
 of the medium that will appear to us all 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.830
 things that we have open at the moment 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.199
 we squeeze the little piece of garbage and 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.210
 simply what it does is eliminate those 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.810
 programs to increase ram memory 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.330
 of the good team there we had whatsapp 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.819
 It is one of the best known applications 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.129
 you do not need to explain much about its use 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.430
 but we can also use it in our 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.219
 cellular and here we have what is the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.360
 pool a game that goes down as for 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.340
 show that we can also play 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.169
 some games 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.689
 let's go to what it is 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.590
 we are going to show some game of those that 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.590
 we have here 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.119
 any questions you have about this 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:24.649
 or another team of ours remember that what 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.229
 can do in the question part of 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.299
 mercadolibre that will be answered to 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.149
 brevity remember also what to do 

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:35.059
 click on buy is to commit to pay 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:39.129
 the product offered many thanks 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:39.129
 to see the video see you in the next
