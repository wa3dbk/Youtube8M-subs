00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.610
 good afternoon my name is alexey i 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.320
 professional style 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 Today I want to show the hairstyle that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.800
 we call elastic where fit 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
 girls who have gathered evening somewhere 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900
 go to a disco club for a party and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.670
 here still this hairstyle is done on the net 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.670
 hair we washed them and blow dry 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.160
 a place 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.500
 i use felix birdie hair dryer 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 thanks to the infrared sense not rushed 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.180
 interrupted and therefore not overdry 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.440
 in order to get where the arc on 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.960
 it is desirable to divide the hair into zones 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.420
 example like i did here and now 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 start making curls for this i 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.070
 I 'm using a conical killer felix 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.720
 firmly philips is equipped with an indicator 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.070
 readiness strands we use it for 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.070
 not to damage the hair 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.940
 in order to curl turned out more 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.540
 taut more delineated are starting to twist 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540
 nape 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.980
 if you want to get bigger 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.250
 curls then use a thicker 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:00.820
 part of the cordura and if you need small curls 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.229
 then more subtle well what's left 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.740
 a little fix varnish and our 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.740
 hair ready
