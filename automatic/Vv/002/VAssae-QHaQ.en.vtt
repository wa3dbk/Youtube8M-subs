them quite easy to defeat however if you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.860 
them quite easy to defeat however if you

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
an incredible price when you think there

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.500 
an incredible price when you think there

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
was still n64 games selling for four

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.080 
was still n64 games selling for four
times<00:04:30.780> as<00:04:30.960> much<00:04:31.340> due<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.580> game's<00:04:32.760> poor

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
times as much due to the game's poor

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.270 
times as much due to the game's poor
sales<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.660> expect<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.440> price<00:04:34.650> may<00:04:34.980> start

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
sales I expect that the price may start
