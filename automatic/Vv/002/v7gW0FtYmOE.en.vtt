grade chain whip or SR stands for
sprocket<00:00:17.550> remover<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.590> anyway<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
sprocket remover and anyway it's a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.200 
sprocket remover and anyway it's a
pretty<00:00:20.220> nice<00:00:20.400> solid<00:00:20.760> tool

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
pretty nice solid tool

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960 
pretty nice solid tool
here's<00:00:21.779> another<00:00:21.960> smaller<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.580> this

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
here's another smaller one I think this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.890 
here's another smaller one I think this
is<00:00:24.119> made<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.630> sunlight<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:25.980> sure<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
is made by sunlight but I'm not sure and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
is made by sunlight but I'm not sure and
this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> little<00:00:28.199> less<00:00:28.349> expensive<00:00:28.619> anyway

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
this is a little less expensive anyway

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.740 
this is a little less expensive anyway
I'll<00:00:29.519> show<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.730> how<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> make<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> chain<00:00:30.599> whip

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
I'll show you how to make a chain whip

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.500 
I'll show you how to make a chain whip
pretty<00:00:31.349> easily

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
pretty easily

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.959 
pretty easily
first<00:00:33.510> off<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.930> bought<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> piece<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.770> flat<00:00:35.700> bar

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
first off I bought a piece of flat bar

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.670 
first off I bought a piece of flat bar
here<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.960> steel

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
here this is steel

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.299 
here this is steel
it's<00:00:38.899> 3/16<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.290> inch<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.010> was<00:00:41.100> three

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it's 3/16 by one inch and it was three

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
it's 3/16 by one inch and it was three
feet<00:00:41.460> long<00:00:41.790> even<00:00:42.660> though<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> didn't<00:00:43.110> need<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
feet long even though I didn't need the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.869 
feet long even though I didn't need the
full<00:00:43.590> three<00:00:43.829> feet<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> actually<00:00:44.340> cut<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.730> down

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
full three feet I actually cut it down

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
full three feet I actually cut it down
to<00:00:44.940> eighteen<00:00:45.570> inches<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.140> find<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
to eighteen inches so you can find a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
to eighteen inches so you can find a
shorter<00:00:46.920> piece<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.760> fine<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> got

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
shorter piece that's fine or if you got

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.650 
shorter piece that's fine or if you got
a<00:00:48.539> piece<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.719> scrap<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:51.239> anyway<00:00:51.510> that's

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a piece of scrap around so anyway that's

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.939 
a piece of scrap around so anyway that's
what<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> hear<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> an<00:00:52.980> 18<00:00:53.489> inch<00:00:53.879> long<00:00:54.629> by<00:00:55.199> one

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
what I hear is an 18 inch long by one

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.740 
what I hear is an 18 inch long by one
inch<00:00:56.100> wide<00:00:56.399> by<00:00:57.379> 3/16<00:00:58.379> inch<00:00:58.649> thick<00:00:59.539> the<00:01:00.539> next

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
inch wide by 3/16 inch thick the next

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
inch wide by 3/16 inch thick the next
thing<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> did<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.530> drilled<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.460> holes

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
thing I did was I drilled three holes

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
thing I did was I drilled three holes
into<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.570> bar<00:01:04.519> using<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.960> 9/64<00:01:06.960> inch<00:01:07.229> drill

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
into this bar using a 9/64 inch drill

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
into this bar using a 9/64 inch drill
bit<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.280> probably<00:01:08.939> could<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.210> used<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.510> 1/8

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
bit I probably could have used a 1/8

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.510 
bit I probably could have used a 1/8
inch<00:01:09.900> drill<00:01:10.590> bit<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.189> found<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
inch drill bit if I could have found it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.920 
inch drill bit if I could have found it
but<00:01:12.080> these<00:01:13.080> two<00:01:13.439> holes<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.540> hair

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
but these two holes here are just a hair

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.490 
but these two holes here are just a hair
over<00:01:16.350> two<00:01:16.680> inches<00:01:16.710> apart<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.930> then<00:01:18.930> these<00:01:19.170> two

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
over two inches apart and then these two

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.789 
over two inches apart and then these two
holes<00:01:19.860> over<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:21.259> about<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> half<00:01:22.590> inch

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
holes over here are about a half inch

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
holes over here are about a half inch
apart<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.810> doesn't<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.380> super

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
apart and it doesn't need to be super

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.770 
apart and it doesn't need to be super
precise<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> make<00:01:27.450> sure<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
precise and I want to make sure that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
precise and I want to make sure that
there<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> little<00:01:28.500> ways<00:01:28.619> away<00:01:28.860> from

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
there are just a little ways away from

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.679 
there are just a little ways away from
the<00:01:29.369> edge<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.930> bar<00:01:31.670> using<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.850> chunk<00:01:33.600> of

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the edge of the bar using a chunk of

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
the edge of the bar using a chunk of
chain<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.350> pulled<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.829> bike<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.700> know

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
chain that I pulled off a bike you know

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.160 
chain that I pulled off a bike you know
that<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.509> worn<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:38.689> cut<00:01:39.689> off<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that was just don't worn out I cut off a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
that was just don't worn out I cut off a
couple<00:01:40.200> sections<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.280> chain<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:44.220> part

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
couple sections of chain so this part

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
couple sections of chain so this part
here<00:01:47.000> has<00:01:48.439> three<00:01:50.570> sections<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.170> outer

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
here has three sections of the outer

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.080 
here has three sections of the outer
plates<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.570> two<00:01:54.570> inner<00:01:55.560> plate<00:01:55.920> sections<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
plates and two inner plate sections so

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.350 
plates and two inner plate sections so
there's<00:01:57.810> outer<00:01:58.409> plates<00:01:58.890> at<00:01:59.280> both<00:01:59.700> ends<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
there's outer plates at both ends of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's outer plates at both ends of
that<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.189> piece<00:02:03.950> ends<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.130> an

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that and then this piece ends with an

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.499 
that and then this piece ends with an
outer<00:02:06.229> plate<00:02:07.229> section<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.610> then<00:02:09.330> goes

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
outer plate section there and then goes

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.380 
outer plate section there and then goes
down<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.170> has

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
