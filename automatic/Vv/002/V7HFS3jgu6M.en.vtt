loses the match I do struggle with that
a<00:03:33.209> little<00:03:33.389> bit<00:03:33.690> because<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.530> wasn't<00:03:34.829> what<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
a little bit because it wasn't what I

a little bit because it wasn't what I
grew<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.760> um<00:03:36.049> it's<00:03:37.049> fun<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.500> watch<00:03:37.680> and

grew up on but um it's fun to watch and
I<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.639> ultimately<00:03:38.930> that<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.230> goal
