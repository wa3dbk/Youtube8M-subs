00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.040
 a good nine years ago where is our currency was not yet in the stadium 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.019
 the attitude of the study 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.069
 The Michi g skill is fast made like steel 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 this time Boll often had to stay ahead 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.079
 maybe it already knew 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.210
 Criticism is not quite correct 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.900
 he also spared it better in the game should the double star and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.830
 Mixtures on the other hand, in good conditions a symbol that Kylie suggest 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.190
 Werder lost to ICANN 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.440
 So if I'm here so uncool about their defensive but in the head 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.280
 Whoever is not the one who has to be present for the decisions must have been a user 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.670
 that was so millions of albums weeks intensified b 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.130
 the legs 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.360
 b but little but we have a sympathetic trainer 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 for that the songs have 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 who say for the sensible what she should say about me 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.190
 the BfR recommends Behr 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.250
 recognize that 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.200
 but I would suggest the jammer already made the league what 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.910
 you say so 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.310
 who is not here 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 but this proposal is coming to an end 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.890
 a young team that takes over 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.470
 there you me 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.920
 but here they are 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.980
 Sort of meat specialist salesman he hangs himself 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.390
 at least financially I believe Benedict XVI yes we have the team with 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.820
 which one can definitely identify with, I think that is 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.990
 one of the big points here or 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 we girls 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.260
 being a 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
 These are based 97 minutes 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.220
 goes so 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.130
 However, nobody was saying Gloria from Vivaldi on the question where I am 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 not with the not answers 1 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.870
 that goes 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.840
 What he adds to the forums of medicine for 50 years on the water 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.770
 Championship has to wait 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.049
 feared 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.359
 yes you already 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.769
 get me out of here ne 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.229
 First, it meant good but one last question 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.049
 Eggs or a last festival report but hold on 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.049
 Milk was one of the reasons to be really proud of what you are saying 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:27.159
 APA 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.389
 already very good 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.499
 the maximum number of guests in too bad in the world 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:32.769
 everything was 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 the easier 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.529
 the son was 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.849
 He knows he is not too late 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 but there was something else he left Frings is 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.809
 and 19 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.139
 we are here for the first time in 2007 is the last word 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.959
 yes at least the result that also be like in the body
