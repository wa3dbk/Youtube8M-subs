because hers are perfectly rosy and this

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.969 
because hers are perfectly rosy and this
is<00:01:11.229> why<00:01:11.380> this<00:01:12.040> is<00:01:12.310> cloth<00:01:13.150> tape<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.619> just<00:01:14.650> buy

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
what you would do to tape little man's

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.779 
what you would do to tape little man's
ears<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.350> it's<00:01:32.590> perfectly<00:01:33.039> rose<00:01:33.280> button<00:01:33.640> I'll

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
ears so it's perfectly rose button I'll

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:40.680 
ears so it's perfectly rose button I'll
show<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:34.450> can<00:01:35.070> come<00:01:36.070> here<00:01:36.250> baby

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.350 

so<00:01:41.690> here's<00:01:41.870> what<00:01:42.050> I<00:01:42.080> did<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.560> put<00:01:42.980> tape<00:01:43.520> right

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
so here's what I did I put tape right

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
so here's what I did I put tape right
here<00:01:44.840> on<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.320> crease<00:01:45.970> or<00:01:46.970> I<00:01:47.060> want<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.570> ear<00:01:47.810> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
here on this crease or I want the ear to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.480 
here on this crease or I want the ear to
fall<00:01:50.470> right<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.500> put<00:01:52.040> his<00:01:52.190> right<00:01:52.340> on<00:01:52.460> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
fall right I put his right on the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
fall right I put his right on the
outside<00:01:52.910> because<00:01:53.000> he's<00:01:53.210> too<00:01:53.360> tiny<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.810> go<00:01:54.020> in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
outside because he's too tiny to go in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.020 
outside because he's too tiny to go in
here<00:01:54.410> he<00:01:54.680> won't<00:01:54.860> let<00:01:55.310> me<00:01:55.370> anyway

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
here he won't let me anyway

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.800 
here he won't let me anyway
so<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.930> weight<00:01:57.230> of<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:57.850> will<00:01:58.850> hold<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.480> ear

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so the weight of this will hold this ear

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.280 
so the weight of this will hold this ear
down<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.910> I<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.300> tape<00:02:02.570> I<00:02:02.750> have<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:03.050> crease

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
down and I the tape I have it crease

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.260 
down and I the tape I have it crease
exactly<00:02:03.830> where<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.010> want<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.730> can<00:02:05.030> get

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
exactly where I want it so I can get

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.639 
exactly where I want it so I can get
that<00:02:05.390> rosebud<00:02:06.020> look<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.740> can<00:02:06.920> see<00:02:07.960> well<00:02:08.960> come
