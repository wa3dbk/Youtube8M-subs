Oh<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> what<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.660> solution<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:11.179> well

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
Oh so what the solution to this is well

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.200 
Oh so what the solution to this is well
first<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.469> join<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.009> server<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.150> I'm

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
first you have to join a server so I'm

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.840 
first you have to join a server so I'm
going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.420> close<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:16.609> find<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> random

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
going to close up just find a random

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.340 
going to close up just find a random
server<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.570> connect<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.230> this

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
server to connect to because this

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.420 
server to connect to because this
happens<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.830> me<00:00:19.949> too

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

and then you go to options and quickly
switch<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.909> viewing<00:01:45.240> distance<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:46.079> tiny<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
switch the viewing distance to tiny this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.520 
switch the viewing distance to tiny this
will<00:01:47.369> give<00:01:47.670> arm<00:01:48.380> watch<00:01:49.850> like<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> should

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
will give arm watch like so this should

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.100 
will give arm watch like so this should
fix<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.189> connection<00:01:53.670> issue<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> crashing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
fix the connection issue of it crashing

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.830 
fix the connection issue of it crashing
at<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> beginning<00:01:56.000> if<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.210> doesn't<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:57.600> let

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
at the beginning if it doesn't work let

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
at the beginning if it doesn't work let
me<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> progressively

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
me know and then you can progressively

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.319 
me know and then you can progressively
move<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> settings<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> far<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
move the settings back up to far and

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.969 
move the settings back up to far and
everything<00:02:03.329> should<00:02:03.509> work<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
everything should work then this is the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
everything should work then this is the
same<00:02:05.159> server<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> connected<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.240> second

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
same server that I connected to a second

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
same server that I connected to a second
ago<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.350> didn't<00:02:07.770> work<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> working

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
