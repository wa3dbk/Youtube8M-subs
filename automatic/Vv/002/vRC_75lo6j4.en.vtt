of a black roll-on rubber product as
what<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.090> it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> two-part<00:00:20.029> setup<00:00:21.029> you're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
what it is it's a two-part setup you're

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.710 
what it is it's a two-part setup you're
going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> use<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.410> black<00:00:22.970> goop<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.510> you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
going to use the black goop and then you

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.759 
going to use the black goop and then you
also<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.910> mesh<00:00:26.910> fabric<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.619> mesh

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
also have this mesh fabric the mesh

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
also have this mesh fabric the mesh
fabric<00:00:28.970> again<00:00:29.970> only<00:00:30.300> needs<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
fabric again only needs to go in the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740 
fabric again only needs to go in the
corners<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> seams<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.360> you'll<00:00:33.570> roll

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
corners and on the seams so you'll roll

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.380 
corners and on the seams so you'll roll
on<00:00:33.960> some<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> goop<00:00:34.620> lay<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> fabric<00:00:35.969> in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
on some of the goop lay the fabric in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
on some of the goop lay the fabric in
and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.930> roll<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> goop<00:00:37.530> over<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and then roll the goop over it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.110 
and then roll the goop over it
on<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:39.920> expanses<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> cement<00:00:41.579> board<00:00:41.730> here

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on the expanses of the cement board here

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
on the expanses of the cement board here
you're<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> roll<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.920> layer<00:00:44.670> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
you're just going to roll on a layer of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.830 
you're just going to roll on a layer of
the<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:46.260> black<00:00:46.850> it's<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> liquid

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
the the black it's really a liquid

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.529 
the the black it's really a liquid
plastic<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> ends<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.000> being<00:00:51.270> or

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
plastic is what it ends up being or

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.779 
plastic is what it ends up being or
liquid<00:00:51.989> rubber<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> that

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
liquid rubber and that really is that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.560 
liquid rubber and that really is that
the<00:00:54.329> full<00:00:55.370> waterproofing<00:00:56.370> layer<00:00:57.270> that's

of it I'm just going to show you my
method<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:30.210> stuff<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.750> pretty

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
method here this stuff can be pretty

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.920 
method here this stuff can be pretty
challenging<00:01:31.939> what<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> dip<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.900> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
challenging what you do is dip in your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.560 
challenging what you do is dip in your
roller<00:01:34.579> clean<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> off<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
roller clean it off so you don't have a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.109 
roller clean it off so you don't have a
lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> dripping<00:01:37.619> goop<00:01:37.909> you're<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
lot of dripping goop you're going to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.600 
lot of dripping goop you're going to
need<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> layer<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:40.040> on<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.310> seen

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
need to get a layer down on your seen

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.480 
need to get a layer down on your seen
before<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> fabric<00:01:42.920> nice<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> thick<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
before this fabric nice and thick and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.050 
before this fabric nice and thick and
gooey

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
gooey

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.819 
gooey
the<00:01:46.070> porous<00:01:48.020> cement<00:01:49.020> board<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.560> just

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the porous cement board here just

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.639 
the porous cement board here just
absorbs<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.579> stuff<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.210> quickly<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
absorbs this stuff so quickly and it

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.539 
absorbs this stuff so quickly and it
really<00:01:53.130> does<00:01:53.930> start<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.170> dry<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.860> an<00:01:55.979> instant

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
really does start to dry in an instant

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
really does start to dry in an instant
so<00:01:57.270> you've<00:01:57.360> got<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.600> move<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> quick<00:01:58.320> on

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so you've got to move kind of quick on

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.179 
so you've got to move kind of quick on
