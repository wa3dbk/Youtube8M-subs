 life and we comment and good in this 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.699
 video that I bring you today is a very video 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.830
 but very different from those who were 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.779
 internally in this channel I upload everything 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.519
 a bit of everything because I like to be 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.919
 I do not like to concentrate on a 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.349
 only subject and good in this video that 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.839
 I bring today is a video that I'm going to give you 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.820
 some tips some tips so that 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.260
 they can remove the spots on the face and 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.680
 I want to tell you that a long time ago 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.660
 I had acne this fact I published a 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.030
 video where I show more or less what 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.530
 I use to eliminate acne and good if 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.969
 He would not have served the walter of joaquÃ­n 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.219
 information analyst below so that 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.960
 you go by and see it and I said that after 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.489
 that I still have a little bit in which 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.559
 what you have to eliminate then well there you 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.570
 I leave the video and good also a subject 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.460
 I want to tell you that the 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.769
 spots are very very difficult to remove 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.600
 and especially when you have acne already 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:07.340
 when you took off the volcano if everything 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.979
 the hail there are no third then good 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.290
 this one already knows I take you off is when 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.020
 it really looks like the speck 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.409
 and then if you're more in the sun or you're 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.790
 exposed to the sun and you have the speck on 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.700
 some sunscreen, plus the one 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.130
 dark not then then I was a 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.810
 manchitas time for at same 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 I had acne I think everyone 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.399
 we went through this stage and they leave us 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.840
 sequels no longer many times they tell you that 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.600
 they are not that they are not little spots that are 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.640
 freckles but in reality it is not that this one does not 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.789
 they are freckles but they are little spots that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.490
 over time they are making you and 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.729
 well me after I had acne and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.350
 the little spots I had a lot of time with 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.289
 the little spots like me around three 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.020
 about months and I felt bad 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.240
 because he said there are little spots no no no 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 because not because I'm left because I do not 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 they go and well I was looking for 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.530
 I was looking for some alternatives 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.840
 and good is what they least imagine in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.600
 this life the solution of truth that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.150
 let's say cure what is that 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.420
 really to say is hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.640
 the oxygenated side has that great power 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.950
 what we need to eliminate all kinds 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.170
 of little spots he told us they have seen that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.180
 when you put it on some wound something 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.910
 come out I'm like being put on 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.700
 blanquita good that's what you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.700
 really helps to whiten the then the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.950
 little spot not very very cheap and very very 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.830
 easy to really find that this is 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.960
 a glory because it really works 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.340
 I can see them, I assure you 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.590
 one hundred percent that they do and they are 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.980
 constant in less than two weeks that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.190
 manchita and it is already already not good 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.390
 say that you have baby pomp skin and 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.520
 if it's going to really help you, 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.960
 I assure and it's very easy that 's why 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.640
 I brought you this video because actually 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.380
 it's very easy to get and I think not 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.540
 I'm the only person where he has 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.220
 little spots got and well I think this 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.380
 video can also serve you and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.120
 well I want here I want to tell you 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 before they go to do this test 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.950
 It should clear the skin that if it's you 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.780
 sensitive is very sensitive of the skin you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.210
 I recommend that you do a test of 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.930
 sensitivity that you take a little bit of 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.239
 oxygenated water 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.010
 what is behind in the ears to see 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.500
 what reaction do you have because remember that 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.030
 the face is more sensitive is the most 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.680
 sensitive of the whole body I invite you to 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.450
 you do a sensitivity test and if 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.120
 everything works well if you do not have redness 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.340
 swelling or maybe a granite forward 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.299
 You can use it I used it and the truth 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.370
 is that it has not happened to me 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.469
 absolutely nothing in fact water 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.450
 oxygenate is used as to both clarify 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.549
 the skin make you a little more clear 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.150
 the spots, as I repeat, are also 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.129
 use as if to clear up the clothes this 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.629
 spots that can not be removed for 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.930
 this often uses water 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.569
 oxygenated but good without more without more 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.569
 roll let's see the video to see how 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.849
 I do this to use love and nothing to 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.500
 rinse the spots and well let's 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.419
 start with this video and in this case 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 I am using component I am 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.469
 using my children are a little small 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.090
 but the same or in cotton if not 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.939
 you have cotonete is also let's 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.680
 need a container does not have to be 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:14.359
 I'm occupying this glass 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.099
 but put a plastic one in 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.060
 something where they can invest the water 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.880
 oxygenated 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.190
 and well let's start walking around 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.419
 little of the product in the container with 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.419
 a lot but very careful 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.630
 and I am occupying in this amount that 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.630
 I think it's a necessary 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.860
 then they began to wash us in the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.540
 hands we do not want dirty hands and 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.480
 let's start to wash our hands 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.370
 to have one normally they 300 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.430
 this old gel they want that is a bit 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.950
 green and actually eliminate the 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.080
 bacteria that we can have are going to 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.940
 wash them very very very well and then 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.410
 Let's pick some water with you 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.870
 like how it smells you feel from the 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.700
 circular and we wanted from here let's put 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.040
 a little bit with water, let's dry the 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.050
 hands and now we're going to start with 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.540
 these beginnings I'm going to wet the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.100
 component in oxygenated water and let's 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.930
 to start cleaning our face we are going to 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.880
 weaken the marchers and we go to the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.350
 circular movements this 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.910
 procedure you can do from two to 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.340
 three times a week I recommend you 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.160
 do it before you sleep and well now 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.870
 let's let it dry a bit, you put it 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.290
 the day I recommend you wash well 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.290
 the gray hair 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.750
 to take effect 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.990
