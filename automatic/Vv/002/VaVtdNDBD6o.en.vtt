00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 if you are running parallel on your mac system 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 have installed and in there 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.830
 operating system such as windows 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.929
 7 could indeed switch to a mode of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.590
 it allows you to do just about anything 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.660
 Applications in windows 7 look like 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 they would have started natively in mac os dix 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.369
 as well is up there the achievement in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.880
 you see the parallel symbol here 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.200
 her network symbolize volume 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 and all the other stories and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.570
 you can see symbol here, for example 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.460
 the update gives for my windows 7 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 that is just like when you are 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 windows 7 would just run on it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.140
 in coexistence with magix around the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.289
 I also like to install updates 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.309
 again, you have clicked on updates 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.710
 to install 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 the whole thing clicks on ready 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 and now he starts with them 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 download all updates 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.479
 that means you see the symbol here 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 are updates probably installed the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.619
 like to know what's being installed 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.900
 Just click it up again 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 the window opens again and then 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.100
 you can follow exactly what 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 is downloaded and installed 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.080
 will depend on yours 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 Internet connection and also from the MC because 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.420
 you can use that already moment 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 I'm currently installing 21 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.180
 updates that can not be a moment 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.009
 between say I say at 1 and 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 Although the updates have him the migros are 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.100
 between 5 and 15 minutes would be so 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 quite realistic if you see 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.930
 want update again history looks like 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 click on its View update running 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.189

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.520
 then close another update from

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.420
 and important and when that was done 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.910
 and there is still pending because the 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.970

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.600

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 start 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
 he drives down parallel speaks in 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.650

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.519
 downloaded the remaining updates 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.860
 you can not install if he is in 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.440
 A runtime environment is spoken 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.110
 certain drivers cetera or patches the 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.299
 can patch only when this data is not 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.630

 after that windows stood new in windows 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.340
 7 parallels desktop again like that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.320
 you already knew that windows 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.330
 and just started and after the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.170
 It may be that he can do it again 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.420
 a two things 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.590
 after installing that would have the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.599
 but get displayed 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.919
 then you have welcome screen again 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.970
 where he finished his windows 7 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.260

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.010
 depending on what he installs on updates 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.530
 that was the start, obama me 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 by the way, did not have it before 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.720
 strange way I am now in this 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.419
 tutorial the first time that this 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.910
 form of government is one from having her know 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.790
