 where are we going to tell him 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.050
 we can change revolutions per minute odell voltage that we are 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.250
 studying 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.250

 because outside the temperature 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.679
 the revolution goes down 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.679
