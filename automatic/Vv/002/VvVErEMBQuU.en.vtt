chaos so don't forget that the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.499 
chaos so don't forget that the
environment<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.160> your<00:01:56.399> friend<00:01:56.759> there's<00:01:57.330> this

all too often I see guys just standing
next<00:02:06.569> to<00:02:07.020> stuff<00:02:07.349> that<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.649> could<00:02:07.830> be

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
next to stuff that they could be

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.770 
next to stuff that they could be
crouched<00:02:08.280> behind<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.970> even<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.209> standing

there don't be the guy that camps out

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.660 
there don't be the guy that camps out
and<00:02:31.290> sits<00:02:31.470> there<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> whole<00:02:31.860> match<00:02:32.069> you've

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and sits there the whole match you've

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.339 
and sits there the whole match you've
got<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.970> move<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.599> only<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.110> enemy

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
got to move on not only will the enemy

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.199

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
but it's also lame just to sit in one

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.400 
but it's also lame just to sit in one
spot<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.340> think<00:02:38.520> you're<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:38.819> well

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
the same stuff I'm seeing but they'll

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.530 
the same stuff I'm seeing but they'll
run<00:03:30.710> directly<00:03:31.040> past<00:03:31.490> bad<00:03:31.700> guys<00:03:31.940> or<00:03:32.240> they<00:03:32.420> won't

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
behind them the mini-map is huge you can

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.740 
behind them the mini-map is huge you can
have<00:03:36.710> phenomenal<00:03:37.160> results<00:03:37.610> if<00:03:38.180> you<00:03:38.480> pay

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
have phenomenal results if you pay

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.780

attention<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:39.410> these<00:03:39.530> core<00:03:39.980> principles<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
attention to these core principles and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.400 
attention to these core principles and

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
yes their fundamentals they seem basic

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.860 
yes their fundamentals they seem basic
but<00:03:43.280> they're<00:03:43.490> huge<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.360> core

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
but they're huge that it's the core

but they're huge that it's the core
building<00:03:45.410> blocks<00:03:45.710> of<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.370> really<00:03:46.610> good<00:03:46.760> player

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
building blocks of a really good player

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.240

is<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.510> guy<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.900> practices<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.800> stuff<00:03:49.070> until

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
is a guy that practices this stuff until

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.250 
is a guy that practices this stuff until
its<00:03:49.550> second<00:03:49.880> nature<00:03:49.910> if<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.780> forget<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.170> do

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
some of these things or if it really

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.460 
some of these things or if it really
takes<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.420> lot<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.570> effort<00:03:53.960> for<00:03:53.990> you<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.260> focus
