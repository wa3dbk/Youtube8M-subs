fan cover here's one we prepared earlier
and<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.049> basically<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.589> vision<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.220> what<00:00:08.460> you

and is basically a vision of what you

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.259 
and is basically a vision of what you
were<00:00:08.730> after<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.980> should<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.280> measured<00:00:11.610> how

frame to when you need to cut so you

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.330 
frame to when you need to cut so you
want<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> market<00:00:17.660> you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.810> use<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> texture<00:00:19.470> we

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
want to market you can use a texture we

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.050 
want to market you can use a texture we
ended<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:20.640> using<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:23.070> screwdriver<00:00:23.970> or

to<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.779> fairly<00:00:31.019> straight<00:00:31.349> you've<00:00:31.740> lost<00:00:31.949> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
to be fairly straight you've lost this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
to be fairly straight you've lost this
don't<00:00:32.489> worry<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.750> easiest<00:00:33.809> weight<00:00:34.140> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
don't worry so the easiest weight is

don't worry so the easiest weight is
coming<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> jigsaw<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
coming with the jigsaw up to where you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.299 
coming with the jigsaw up to where you
marked<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.680> drill<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> hole<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.250> get

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
marked it drill a hole so you can get

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
marked it drill a hole so you can get
the<00:00:38.399> jigsaw<00:00:38.670> back<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> again<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:39.690> cut<00:00:39.840> it

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the jigsaw back in again and then cut it

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
the jigsaw back in again and then cut it
across<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:41.280> can<00:00:41.399> also<00:00:41.520> use<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.850> angle<00:00:42.090> grinder

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
across you can also use an angle grinder

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.590 
across you can also use an angle grinder
with<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> cutting<00:00:42.870> wheel<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:43.800> good

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
with a cutting wheel that's just as good

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.369 
with a cutting wheel that's just as good
but<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:45.840> you're<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> master

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but if you think you're a master

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
but if you think you're a master
craftsman<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> crack

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
craftsman and can get to it have a crack

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.470 
craftsman and can get to it have a crack
at<00:00:48.690> doing<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.489> keeping<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> bottom

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
at doing this and keeping the bottom

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.889 
at doing this and keeping the bottom
section<00:00:51.960> wallet<00:00:52.370> cover<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.780> you're

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
section wallet cover so that's if you're

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.650 
section wallet cover so that's if you're
crushing<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> forwards<00:00:56.149> it<00:00:57.149> shouldn't<00:00:57.570> need

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
crushing it forwards it shouldn't need

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.779 
crushing it forwards it shouldn't need
to<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.090> best<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.629> keep<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
to have it but it is best if we keep it

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.530 
to have it but it is best if we keep it
stop<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.500> my<00:01:05.400> objective<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
stop it and we going my objective was to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130 
stop it and we going my objective was to
be<00:01:07.080> minimalist<00:01:08.150> minimalist<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.450> remove<00:01:09.810> as

little material as possible and having
marked<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> used<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.950> an<00:01:17.310> angle

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
marked up then what I used was an angle

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.760 
marked up then what I used was an angle
grinder<00:01:17.759> blade<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:19.580> carefully<00:01:20.580> cut<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
grinder blade and carefully cut in and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
grinder blade and carefully cut in and
along<00:01:23.240> from<00:01:24.240> both<00:01:24.450> sides<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> purpose

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
along from both sides and the purpose

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
along from both sides and the purpose
inside<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> remove<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.579> bit<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
inside was also to remove a bit of the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.440 
inside was also to remove a bit of the
material<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.170> angle<00:01:31.979> grinder<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> use<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
material here angle grinder so I use a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.410 
material here angle grinder so I use a
cutting<00:01:33.810> blade<00:01:34.680> initially<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:36.030> used

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
cutting blade initially and then I used

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.249 
cutting blade initially and then I used
a<00:01:36.720> grinding<00:01:37.500> blade<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.540> take<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:40.020> more

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
a grinding blade to take back a bit more

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.480 
a grinding blade to take back a bit more
this<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.100> material<00:01:42.320> such<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.619> only<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this of the material such that only the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.460 
this of the material such that only the
bare<00:01:44.790> amount<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.540> what<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> need<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.229> remove

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
bare amount of what you need to remove

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.330 
bare amount of what you need to remove
is<00:01:47.130> removed<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.659> an<00:01:48.840> angle<00:01:49.170> grinder<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:50.159> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is removed but an angle grinder is the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
is removed but an angle grinder is the
quickest<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> easiest<00:01:50.880> way<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.290> careful

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
quickest and easiest way just be careful

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.870 
quickest and easiest way just be careful
