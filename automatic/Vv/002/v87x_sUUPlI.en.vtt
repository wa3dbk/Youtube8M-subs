00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.100
 so hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.400
 tutorial for borderlands 2 how to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.639
 you get infinite ammunition 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.170
 to no word no money is no 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 nothing happens 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 only thing he needs is one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.720
 rocket launcher the ammo consumed 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 I do not know how it consumes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 Boni in German means in any case 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 That means in English that is if 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.090
 you shoot someday he will for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.890
 a shot does not consume ammunition 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.829
 and first we want to look after 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.710
 which shot he ammunition 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
 So once consumer verschieÃŸt 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.910
 one consumes him again 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.910
 now he does not need to okay the lama 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 Now we know after the first shot 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 he does not need to shoot ministers 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.390
 once we change the weapon it is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 important that your inventory case is 27 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 27 then you change the one for 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.789
 weapon lying on the floor is flinging 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.629
 away and actually you have to go now 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.629
 to have infinite ammunition 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.570
 It stays that way until I know 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.479
 not exactly when you pick it up again 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.729
 and as a selected weapon among the four 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.050
 then I have to do that I think so 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.970
 away and stop when stored and out 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.090
 go out of the game you can do it 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.440
 with the lightning still somewhere else 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 travel and so that's also online 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.890
 can then place here first 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.330
 make for as make up space can I 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.110
 it will show you that too 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.909
 you rip somewhere else because 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.390
 I today as they shield me 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 farm nexus one heart for those who love it 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.869
 do not know how is the best sign 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.050
 what gives to this game and for that 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.750
 do you need to come so far spoiler 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.880
 that we come to the mission I 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.380
 I just know I do not know how 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
 she in German means as I said one 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.110
 can I have to go here for this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.610
 cottages go throats in these guy's throats 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.130
 that is actually quite easy 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.130
 especially if you are killed with the jihad 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 so 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.599
 warsaw of the doctors freshly printed 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.819
 but that does not really matter because 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.220
 Now you just have to do the mission 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.000
 Make and always would have to 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.799
 exit game 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.330
 Actually, I can do that to you right now 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:12.040
 show are 21 video you see we stop 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.099
 Something I do not need on everyone 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.920
 case proven it is orange 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.409
 It does not drip that often, but it does 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 Shut up really well and I am 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.209
 now 30 if only two times 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 play through with level 50 then that becomes 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.739
 already pretty neat I say 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.500
 you know already at 30 then what 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.120
 so bonis has not been without 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.379
 so they'll have to do it 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.379
 had to give first time in 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.379
 mordechai 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:00.260
 turkey definition from then you have to 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.010
 save and go out you go again 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.299
 purely 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.090
 this will just reload the map 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.229
 and the opponents so new sport everything if 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.329
 now just go back in 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.430
 still does and he just would 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.840
 I will not bring you anything now he sees 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.120
 to make ammunition in every place 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.120
 away so it does not matter 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.889
 they should still do so 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.770
 bad it has just always the way and 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.580
 To kill one is a bit 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.650
 annoying or sometimes it takes halt ne 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.760
 but time if you have the shield then 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.380
 It's really worth it 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.380
 this shield simply breaks everything 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.430
 Well ok, it does not matter to everyone now 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.050
 case it works again and again 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.060
 and yes someday it gets dropped 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.620
 I can shield you then at the end 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.590
 Show a short clip like it 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.750
 looks when I believed 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.030
 and then only to look questionable 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.680
 the business managed to play you please 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.150
 the game first of all through 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.800
 before that uses it because otherwise it will 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.220
 just boring and until the next one 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.350
 and look there I am now again 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.920
 after my ninth time I have a child 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.650
 I love it did not really work 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.400
 a big one big sign but one 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:59.090
 looks npd with plus 3500 is quite 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:04.820
 Neat if the shield is full then 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:06.110
 damage your weapon plus 3500 and 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.840
 that is pretty neat and the 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.500
 Charge raid is even when it starts 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.570
 is the same way, however, is already cool 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.390
 Shield later if we look again 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:22.220
 I think I have to breathe 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:24.860
 something with 27,000 shield and 48,000 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.620
 rp the one shot also pro shot 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.020
 no amg off so if you normally 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.300
 pull that off in connection 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:37.100
 sign and that's just not the case 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:40.010
 that it looks good now when I am 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.030
 times meet then I can first without 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.030
 without doing bi 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.040
 signs simply times the Rhine 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.349
 3100 harm now we'll do with bi 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.860
 also 3100 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:17.040
 8100 ok sign was probably not quite 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.940
 charged so you can see already from 3000 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:24.150
 at 8,000 is a decent one 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.430
 difference and there you will also like 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:29.400
 think the smaller sign in buy 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.900
 I thank you so much 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.700
 look 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:38.810
 I hope it has helped you and will 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.810
 I'm glad if it did
