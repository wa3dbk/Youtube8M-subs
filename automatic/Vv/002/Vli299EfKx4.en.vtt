make sure you charge it and head down
and<00:03:49.700> jump<00:03:50.209> through<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.450> portal<00:03:50.810> it<00:03:51.650> will

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and jump through this portal it will

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.860 
and jump through this portal it will
propel<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.280> right<00:03:52.579> up<00:03:52.760> here<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.209> grab<00:03:53.600> your

propel you right up here and grab your
artifact

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:09.449 

now<00:04:00.450> head<00:04:00.660> back<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.110> center<00:04:01.290> platform

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.539 

and<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:11.349> what<00:04:11.439> you<00:04:11.500> get<00:04:11.650> put<00:04:12.010> one<00:04:12.189> portal

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
and this is what you get put one portal

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.439 
and this is what you get put one portal
there<00:04:12.760> one<00:04:13.599> portal<00:04:14.019> there<00:04:17.759> run<00:04:18.759> across<00:04:19.090> here

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
there one portal there run across here

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.260 
there one portal there run across here
and<00:04:19.959> we'll<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:21.250> time<00:04:21.609> activating

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
and we'll have a time activating

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.100 
and we'll have a time activating
mechanism<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.990> slow<00:04:23.259> down<00:04:23.380> time<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:25.660> slow<00:04:26.080> that

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
mechanism to slow down time so slow that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.439 
mechanism to slow down time so slow that
beast<00:04:26.590> down<00:04:26.820> run<00:04:27.820> back<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.240> center

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
beast down run back to the center

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:30.120 
beast down run back to the center
platform<00:04:28.630> as<00:04:28.960> fast<00:04:29.320> as<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:29.680> can

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
platform as fast as you can

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.379 
platform as fast as you can
grab<00:04:30.789> your<00:04:30.940> cross<00:04:31.150> Wade<00:04:31.419> hit<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.440> one<00:04:32.680> and

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
grab your cross Wade hit that one and

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.170 
grab your cross Wade hit that one and
then<00:04:34.389> hit<00:04:34.720> these<00:04:35.350> two

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.200 

and<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:39.680> door<00:04:39.890> will<00:04:40.010> raise<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.730> beam<00:04:40.940> will<00:04:41.120> go

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
and the door will raise the beam will go

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.629 
and the door will raise the beam will go
through<00:04:41.390> the<00:04:41.480> door<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:41.960> we'll<00:04:42.350> all<00:04:42.470> be<00:04:42.620> happy

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.950 

you<00:04:47.639> might<00:04:47.819> get<00:04:47.969> locked<00:04:48.210> out<00:04:48.360> after<00:04:48.749> you

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
you might get locked out after you

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.899 
you might get locked out after you
redirect<00:04:49.619> the<00:04:49.830> beam<00:04:50.009> but<00:04:50.399> it's<00:04:50.759> no<00:04:50.879> problem

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
redirect the beam but it's no problem

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.629 
redirect the beam but it's no problem
you<00:04:51.719> don't<00:04:51.809> get<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.990> slowdown<00:04:52.289> time<00:04:52.529> again<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
you don't get a slowdown time again the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.299 
you don't get a slowdown time again the
reason<00:04:53.999> you<00:04:54.119> slow<00:04:54.330> down<00:04:54.479> time<00:04:54.779> is<00:04:55.080> because<00:04:55.649> if

00:04:56.299 --> 00:04:56.309 
reason you slow down time is because if

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.129 
reason you slow down time is because if
the<00:04:56.939> beam<00:04:57.180> touches<00:04:57.629> either<00:04:57.869> one<00:04:57.990> of<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
the beam touches either one of the

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.659 
the beam touches either one of the
crystals<00:04:58.529> that<00:04:58.649> activate<00:04:59.069> it<00:04:59.189> it<00:04:59.339> kind<00:04:59.610> of

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
crystals that activate it it kind of

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.549 
crystals that activate it it kind of
hardens<00:05:00.119> them<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.449> makes<00:05:00.839> them<00:05:00.930> useless<00:05:01.409> and

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:01.559 
hardens them and makes them useless and

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.369 
hardens them and makes them useless and
you<00:05:01.589> can't<00:05:01.830> hit<00:05:02.009> them<00:05:02.099> and<00:05:03.029> if<00:05:03.839> you<00:05:03.930> just<00:05:04.139> try

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
you can't hit them and if you just try

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.659 
you can't hit them and if you just try
to<00:05:04.439> do<00:05:04.619> it<00:05:04.649> real<00:05:04.889> quick<00:05:04.919> you<00:05:05.399> won't<00:05:05.550> have

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
to do it real quick you won't have

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.029 
to do it real quick you won't have
enough<00:05:05.909> time<00:05:06.119> I've<00:05:06.389> had<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.379> friend<00:05:07.619> that<00:05:07.889> did

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
enough time I've had a friend that did

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.850 
enough time I've had a friend that did
it<00:05:08.189> one<00:05:08.369> time<00:05:08.399> my<00:05:08.819> friend<00:05:08.939> brazeau<00:05:09.419> did<00:05:09.629> it

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
it one time my friend brazeau did it

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.260 
it one time my friend brazeau did it
because<00:05:10.860> he<00:05:11.189> was<00:05:11.309> yelling<00:05:11.639> at<00:05:11.729> me<00:05:11.849> when<00:05:11.999> I<00:05:12.029> told

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
because he was yelling at me when I told

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.939 
because he was yelling at me when I told
him<00:05:12.419> to<00:05:12.539> slow<00:05:12.659> down<00:05:12.719> time<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.379> said<00:05:13.529> there<00:05:13.649> was

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
him to slow down time and said there was

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.519 
him to slow down time and said there was
no<00:05:14.099> time<00:05:14.339> slowing<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.990> proved<00:05:16.259> him<00:05:16.379> wrong

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:16.529 
no time slowing and I proved him wrong

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:21.409 
no time slowing and I proved him wrong
but<00:05:16.819> he's<00:05:17.819> still<00:05:18.029> a<00:05:18.059> beast<00:05:18.270> for<00:05:18.449> doing<00:05:18.689> it<00:05:20.389> so<00:05:21.389> I

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
but he's still a beast for doing it so I
