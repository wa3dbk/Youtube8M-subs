00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
nice fancy box from Nike and I I think

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.280 
nice fancy box from Nike and I I think
one<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.700> the<00:00:45.850> coolest<00:00:46.090> parts<00:00:46.510> about<00:00:46.570> this<00:00:46.750> box

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
one of the coolest parts about this box

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.020 
one of the coolest parts about this box
is<00:00:47.740> the<00:00:48.340> fact<00:00:48.550> that<00:00:48.640> it's<00:00:49.540> two<00:00:49.840> images<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.770> red

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is the fact that it's two images the red

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.130 
is the fact that it's two images the red
and<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.350> blue<00:00:53.350> right<00:00:54.130> there<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.670> east<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
and the blue right there the east and

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.840 
and the blue right there the east and
you<00:00:56.770> could<00:00:56.950> just<00:00:56.980> go<00:00:57.190> back<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:57.550> forth<00:00:57.640> using

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
you could just go back and forth using

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.000 
you could just go back and forth using
this<00:00:58.200> transparent<00:00:59.200> I<00:01:01.890> guess<00:01:02.890> this

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
this transparent I guess this

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.420 
this transparent I guess this
transparent<00:01:03.659> shell<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.350> box<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.310> of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
transparent shell of the box and of

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.110 
transparent shell of the box and of
course<00:01:06.640> on<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.790> under<00:01:07.630> side<00:01:07.659> it<00:01:08.140> says<00:01:08.320> la<00:01:09.120> 2011

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
course on the under side it says la 2011

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.040 
course on the under side it says la 2011
so<00:01:10.870> let's<00:01:11.200> break<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.500> thing<00:01:11.590> out<00:01:12.840> very<00:01:13.840> nice

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
so let's break this thing out very nice

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.290 
so let's break this thing out very nice

were<00:01:57.790> cool<00:01:58.000> they're<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.479> little<00:01:58.689> kind<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.140> hard

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
were cool they're a little kind of hard

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.830 
were cool they're a little kind of hard
on<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.920> outside<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.400> stuff<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:01.210> diesels<00:02:01.780> are

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the outside and stuff but diesels are

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.120 
on the outside and stuff but diesels are
really<00:02:02.170> comfortable<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.650> little<00:02:02.890> bit<00:02:03.009> more

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
really comfortable a little bit more

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.770 
really comfortable a little bit more
heavier<00:02:03.490> than<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:04.500> kobe<00:02:05.500> line<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:06.790> i<00:02:07.060> really

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
heavier than a kobe line but i really

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.229 
heavier than a kobe line but i really
like<00:02:07.930> them<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.799> has<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.239> different

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
like them this one has a different

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.399 
like them this one has a different
texture<00:02:10.899> right<00:02:11.560> here<00:02:11.799> i<00:02:12.040> want<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.370> say

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
texture right here i want to say

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.710 
texture right here i want to say
pylon<00:02:15.409> I<00:02:15.439> think<00:02:15.739> from<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.129> it<00:02:16.250> said<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.720> on

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
pylon I think from what it said and on

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.380 
pylon I think from what it said and on
the<00:02:17.870> new<00:02:18.170> all-star<00:02:18.409> ones<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.340> like<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.360> uh

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
the new all-star ones it's like that uh

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.259 
the new all-star ones it's like that uh
I<00:02:21.459> don't<00:02:22.459> know<00:02:22.549> what<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.790> want<00:02:22.879> to<00:02:23.000> call<00:02:23.150> this

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
I don't know what you want to call this

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.050 
I don't know what you want to call this
material<00:02:23.780> but<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.079> it<00:02:24.890> changes<00:02:25.220> color<00:02:25.430> how

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
material but it's it changes color how

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.309 
material but it's it changes color how
kind<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.540> holographic<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:28.340> really<00:02:28.519> nice<00:02:29.319> and

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
kind of holographic it's really nice and

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.309 
kind of holographic it's really nice and
also<00:02:30.920> another<00:02:31.069> difference<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:32.720> course<00:02:32.900> tongue

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
also another difference of course tongue

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.679 
also another difference of course tongue
the<00:02:33.650> tongue<00:02:33.829> pool<00:02:34.040> there<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:36.319> also<00:02:36.829> it<00:02:37.159> has

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
the tongue pool there and also it has

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.910 
the tongue pool there and also it has
another<00:02:38.689> tongue<00:02:38.959> pool<00:02:39.170> but<00:02:39.349> this<00:02:39.560> one<00:02:39.739> has

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
another tongue pool but this one has

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.119 
another tongue pool but this one has
this<00:02:40.670> material<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.540> changes<00:02:42.409> images<00:02:42.890> also

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
this material and it changes images also

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.300 
this material and it changes images also
it<00:02:43.939> says<00:02:44.120> west<00:02:44.329> up<00:02:44.569> here<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.980> course<00:02:46.159> the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
it says west up here and of course the
