00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
what he looks like

00:00:34.019 --> 00:01:04.330 
what he looks like
all<00:00:35.539> built<00:00:36.539> put<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.460> speed<00:00:38.729> build

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:04.340 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.640 

okay<00:01:05.340> and<00:01:05.550> here<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> slum<00:01:06.450> bow<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.960> first<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
okay and here is slum bow and first of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
okay and here is slum bow and first of
all<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.160> take<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> look<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.060> Nick

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
all we would take a look at the Nick

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.560 
all we would take a look at the Nick
soul<00:01:09.750> he<00:01:09.990> comes<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.270> same

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
soul he comes with and this is the same

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.170 
soul he comes with and this is the same
as<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.100> mixer<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> came<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.730> infinites

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
as the mixer that came in the infinites

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
as the mixer that came in the infinites
obviously<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.050> reusing<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.590> nicks

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
obviously they're just reusing the nicks

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.580 
obviously they're just reusing the nicks
or<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.190> you<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.490> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.760> build<00:01:17.910> an<00:01:18.120> army

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
or so you can kind of build an army

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.540 
or so you can kind of build an army
obviously<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.770> we've<00:01:19.950> seen<00:01:20.160> this<00:01:20.340> guy<00:01:20.520> before

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
obviously so we've seen this guy before

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.200 
obviously so we've seen this guy before

it<00:01:53.310> was<00:01:53.430> probably<00:01:53.880> used<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.330> power<00:01:54.540> miners<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it was probably used in power miners a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
it was probably used in power miners a
long<00:01:55.410> time<00:01:55.680> ago<00:01:55.950> but<00:01:56.630> can't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.690> remember

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
long time ago but can't really remember

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.420 
long time ago but can't really remember
because<00:01:58.259> I've<00:01:58.380> never<00:01:58.500> actually<00:01:58.649> seen<00:01:59.280> it

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
because I've never actually seen it

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.110 
because I've never actually seen it
before<00:01:59.690> even<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.710> power<00:02:01.950> -<00:02:02.160> as<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
before even if it was in power - as you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.420

kind of his hands the other one is just
the<00:04:24.580> same<00:04:24.610> just<00:04:25.210> built<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.660> opposite<00:04:25.990> way

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
the same just built the opposite way

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.370 
the same just built the opposite way
around<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.370> they<00:04:27.729> can<00:04:27.970> be<00:04:28.539> used<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:29.050> the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
around so that they can be used as the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.029 
around so that they can be used as the
opposite<00:04:29.860> arms<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.550> course<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:32.410> yeah<00:04:32.830> that's

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039

obviously<00:04:36.099> these<00:04:36.520> mixels<00:04:37.060> are<00:04:37.210> small<00:04:37.570> look

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
obviously these mixels are small look

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.909 
obviously these mixels are small look
cool<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.870> before<00:04:40.870> we<00:04:40.990> end<00:04:41.169> let's<00:04:41.500> just<00:04:41.710> take<00:04:41.889> a

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
right in the back you see of game code

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.730 
right in the back you see of game code
which<00:04:52.539> I<00:04:52.690> don't<00:04:52.930> want<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.169> show<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
which I don't want to show you that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.950 
which I don't want to show you that
because<00:04:53.979> I'm<00:04:54.849> not<00:04:55.060> sure<00:04:55.300> if<00:04:55.450> they<00:04:55.630> are<00:04:55.660> all

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
because I'm not sure if they are all

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.909 
because I'm not sure if they are all
different<00:04:56.229> for<00:04:56.680> the<00:04:56.830> different<00:04:56.919> sets<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.919> so

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
different for the different sets and so

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.710 
different for the different sets and so
I'm<00:05:00.160> not<00:05:00.280> sure<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.669> they're<00:05:00.849> like<00:05:00.970> exclusive

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
I'm not sure if they're like exclusive

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570 
I'm not sure if they're like exclusive
to<00:05:01.810> each<00:05:01.930> one<00:05:02.260> so<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:02.770> every<00:05:03.190> instruction

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
to each one so like every instruction

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.650 
to each one so like every instruction
has<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.910> difference<00:05:04.740> different<00:05:05.740> code<00:05:06.460> by<00:05:07.030> every

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
has a difference different code by every

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.420 
has a difference different code by every
swim<00:05:07.990> boats<00:05:08.199> that<00:05:08.380> hazard<00:05:08.530> apparently

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
swim boats that hazard apparently

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.490 
swim boats that hazard apparently
there's<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.270> lot<00:05:10.330> of<00:05:10.510> Series<00:05:10.840> three<00:05:10.870> which<00:05:11.380> are
