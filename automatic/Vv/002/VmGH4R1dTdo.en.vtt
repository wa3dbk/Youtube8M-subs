what<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> bad<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.450> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.660> thought<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
what is bad is what I thought that I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.950 
what is bad is what I thought that I

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
he had gotten to a wreck which which he

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.770 
he had gotten to a wreck which which he
says<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.590> what<00:01:26.770> his<00:01:27.009> fault

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
says that what his fault

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.680 
says that what his fault
look<00:01:29.290> like<00:01:29.500> a<00:01:29.619> pretty<00:01:30.100> mean<00:01:30.340> one<00:01:30.549> because<00:01:30.940> he

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
look like a pretty mean one because he

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.180 
look like a pretty mean one because he
got<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.140> wreck<00:01:32.290> with<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:33.869> motorcycle

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
got in a wreck with a motorcycle

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.510 
got in a wreck with a motorcycle
and<00:01:36.310> tore<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.810> bumper<00:01:38.710> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.680 

other<00:01:41.789> things<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
other things so

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.040 
other things so
that's<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.900> reason<00:01:45.260> why<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.980> had<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.840> get<00:01:47.840> his

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
that's the reason why I had to get his

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.340 
that's the reason why I had to get his
truck<00:01:48.410> because<00:01:48.800> they<00:01:48.950> say<00:01:49.220> him<00:01:49.460> home

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
truck because they say him home

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.330 
truck because they say him home
unfortunately<00:01:51.350> that's<00:01:51.530> why<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.830> trucking

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
unfortunately that's why the trucking

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.270 
unfortunately that's why the trucking
industry<00:01:52.430> works<00:01:53.120> even<00:01:53.600> even<00:01:54.590> though<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.860> may

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
industry works even even though you may

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.860 
industry works even even though you may
have

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
have

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.230 
have
someone<00:01:57.710> else<00:01:57.920> run<00:01:58.190> into<00:01:58.460> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
someone else run into you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.690 
someone else run into you
the<00:02:00.630> insurance<00:02:01.079> companies<00:02:01.590> don't

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the insurance companies don't

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.029 
the insurance companies don't
and<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.850> won't<00:02:03.060> insure<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> even<00:02:04.350> though<00:02:04.469> work

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
and I won't insure you even though work

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.920 
and I won't insure you even though work
is<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.820> fault<00:02:06.149> so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
is not your fault so

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.620 
is not your fault so
