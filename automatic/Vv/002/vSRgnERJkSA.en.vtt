army for 3 99 and then it was half off
so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.500> thought<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.009> great<00:02:05.159> deal<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so I thought that was a great deal I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.310 
so I thought that was a great deal I
actually<00:02:06.299> wanted<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.229> at

actually wanted this when it was at

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.050 
actually wanted this when it was at
target<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.129> never<00:02:08.250> picked<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
target but I just never picked it up and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.150 
target but I just never picked it up and
then<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> decided<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:10.619> ahead<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.009> it

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
then I decided to go ahead and get it

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.340 
then I decided to go ahead and get it
when

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
when

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.630 
when
thought<00:02:11.530> at<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.800> Salvation<00:02:12.160> Army<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.430> really

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
thought at the Salvation Army you really

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.370 
thought at the Salvation Army you really
can't<00:02:12.820> beat<00:02:12.940> two<00:02:13.150> bucks<00:02:13.390> for<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:13.840> so
