everything we can get some info this is
telling<00:02:49.630> us<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> firmware<00:02:50.080> how<00:02:50.560> cool<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.920> that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
telling us the firmware how cool is that

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.309 
telling us the firmware how cool is that
speakers<00:02:51.430> with<00:02:51.580> firmware<00:02:51.790> right<00:02:52.319> that's

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
speakers with firmware right that's

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.850 
speakers with firmware right that's
awesome

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
awesome

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.770

and<00:02:54.010> we<00:02:54.100> can<00:02:54.250> exit<00:02:54.580> more<00:02:54.790> often<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.660> had

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and we can exit more often and if we had

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.960 
and we can exit more often and if we had
an<00:02:55.870> input<00:02:56.140> signal<00:02:56.319> we<00:02:56.920> would<00:02:57.040> see<00:02:57.220> those<00:02:57.400> bars

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
an input signal we would see those bars

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.780 
an input signal we would see those bars
back<00:02:58.269> here<00:02:58.510> now<00:02:58.870> this<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.140> what's<00:02:59.290> really<00:02:59.500> cool

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
back here now this is what's really cool

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
like an i/o port do we can do some kind

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.210 
like an i/o port do we can do some kind
of<00:03:03.850> a<00:03:03.940> shock<00:03:04.209> collar<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.590> this<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.010> next

indicate limit it'll it can be set to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.590 
indicate limit it'll it can be set to
indicate<00:03:12.670> limit<00:03:12.970> let's<00:03:13.150> go<00:03:13.239> back<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.540> I'll

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
indicate limit let's go back and I'll

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.520 
indicate limit let's go back and I'll
show<00:03:13.720> you

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
