shield<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:28.080> know<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.740> made<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.369> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
shield as you know they made into a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.950 
shield as you know they made into a
primary<00:01:29.880> weapon<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
primary weapon so you don't have a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.260 
primary weapon so you don't have a
primary<00:01:31.229> gun<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.850> ticks<00:01:33.030> me<00:01:33.150> off

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
primary gun and what really ticks me off

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
primary gun and what really ticks me off
about<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.549> your<00:01:35.549> character

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
about it is that it's your character

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.319 
about it is that it's your character
feels<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.479> he's<00:01:36.689> caring<00:01:37.229> maybe<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.770> 50<00:01:38.700> 60

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
feels like he's caring maybe like 50 60

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
feels like he's caring maybe like 50 60
pounds<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.840> him<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.259> makes<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.650> move<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
pounds on him which makes you move so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.120 
pounds on him which makes you move so
sluggishly<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.720> slowly<00:01:43.079> even<00:01:43.920> with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sluggishly and slowly even with

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
sluggishly and slowly even with
lightweight<00:01:44.369> pro<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.720> makes<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
lightweight pro so it just makes it that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340 
lightweight pro so it just makes it that
much<00:01:46.470> harder<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.460> who<00:01:47.930> for<00:01:48.930> someone<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
much harder for me who for someone that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.580

especially<00:02:39.440> long<00:02:39.620> range<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.819> that's<00:02:41.659> why<00:02:41.870> I'm

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
boosters in this game which is why I'm

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.839 
boosters in this game which is why I'm
losing<00:02:58.040> by<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.340> 400<00:02:58.970> points<00:02:59.209> already<00:02:59.510> now<00:03:00.500> so

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
losing by like 400 points already now so

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.240 
losing by like 400 points already now so
I've<00:03:01.849> noticed<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.750> in<00:03:03.109> free-for-all<00:03:04.069> there

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
I've noticed that in free-for-all there

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.789 
I've noticed that in free-for-all there
are<00:03:04.370> more<00:03:04.639> boosters<00:03:05.269> than<00:03:05.659> before<00:03:05.900> which<00:03:06.560> i

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
are more boosters than before which i

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.390 
are more boosters than before which i
think<00:03:06.859> is<00:03:07.310> directly<00:03:08.170> related<00:03:09.170> to<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.220> fact

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
think is directly related to the fact

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160 
think is directly related to the fact
that<00:03:10.549> they<00:03:10.760> took<00:03:11.000> out<00:03:11.209> third<00:03:11.480> person<00:03:11.900> cage

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
that they took out third person cage

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.430 
that they took out third person cage
match<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.769> order<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.400> throw<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:14.169> first<00:03:15.169> person

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
match in order to throw in first person

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.309 
match in order to throw in first person
team<00:03:16.010> tactical<00:03:16.609> team<00:03:17.239> tactical<00:03:17.660> which<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.049> play

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
team tactical team tactical which I play

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.430 
team tactical team tactical which I play
a<00:03:18.349> lot<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:19.400> because<00:03:19.549> I<00:03:19.760> like<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.260> what

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
a lot just because I like it and so what

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.009 
a lot just because I like it and so what
those<00:03:21.620> boosters<00:03:22.099> have<00:03:22.250> resorted<00:03:22.669> to<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.180> going

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
those boosters have resorted to is going

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.990 
those boosters have resorted to is going
back<00:03:24.290> into<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.829> free-for-all<00:03:25.400> where<00:03:25.699> there<00:03:25.849> are

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
back into a free-for-all where there are

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.509 
back into a free-for-all where there are
nine<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> total<00:03:28.040> of<00:03:28.220> nine<00:03:28.280> people

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
nine there is a total of nine people

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.390 
nine there is a total of nine people
there<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.419> what<00:03:29.840> happens<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:30.829> when<00:03:31.069> those

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
there so what happens is that when those

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.089 
there so what happens is that when those
two<00:03:31.730> people<00:03:32.000> start<00:03:32.389> boosting<00:03:32.629> it<00:03:33.470> not<00:03:33.889> only

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
two people start boosting it not only

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.339 
two people start boosting it not only
affects<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.940> them<00:03:35.209> but<00:03:35.449> it<00:03:35.569> is<00:03:35.690> back<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
affects just them but it is back the

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.780 
affects just them but it is back the
what<00:03:37.340> seven<00:03:37.970> other<00:03:38.180> people<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.079> game<00:03:39.790> six

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
what seven other people in the game six

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.839 
what seven other people in the game six
or<00:03:40.940> seven<00:03:41.180> other<00:03:41.299> people<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.260> I<00:03:42.590> guess<00:03:43.129> third

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
or seven other people so I guess third

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.390 
or seven other people so I guess third
person<00:03:44.269> cage<00:03:45.139> match<00:03:45.440> was<00:03:45.829> good<00:03:46.129> for<00:03:46.340> the

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
person cage match was good for the

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.849 
person cage match was good for the
purpose<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:47.090> boosting<00:03:47.900> not<00:03:48.410> that<00:03:48.530> i<00:03:48.590> boosted

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
purpose of boosting not that i boosted

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.640 
purpose of boosting not that i boosted
or<00:03:49.160> anything<00:03:49.519> but<00:03:49.760> i<00:03:50.000> mean<00:03:50.510> at<00:03:50.810> least<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.410> only

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
or anything but i mean at least it only

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.960 
or anything but i mean at least it only
affected<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.220> two<00:03:52.430> people<00:03:52.790> who<00:03:52.940> were

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970

correctly so what happens is is that
they<00:04:01.849> start<00:04:02.150> boosting<00:04:02.359> they<00:04:03.319> get<00:04:03.560> their<00:04:03.739> kill

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
they start boosting they get their kill

because<00:04:06.949> I<00:04:07.359> you<00:04:08.359> saw<00:04:08.569> back<00:04:08.870> there<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:09.139> went

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
because I you saw back there I went

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.770 
because I you saw back there I went
behind<00:04:09.680> them<00:04:10.069> using<00:04:10.549> sitrep<00:04:10.879> pro<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.299> saw

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
behind them using sitrep pro and saw

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.900 
behind them using sitrep pro and saw
tactical<00:04:12.290> insertions<00:04:12.770> and<00:04:12.950> kill<00:04:13.580> them<00:04:13.760> all

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
tactical insertions and kill them all

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.349 
tactical insertions and kill them all
and<00:04:14.290> gave<00:04:15.290> them<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.770> ceremonial<00:04:16.489> tea<00:04:16.880> bagging

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
and gave them the ceremonial tea bagging

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.270 
and gave them the ceremonial tea bagging
because<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.930> how<00:04:18.049> much<00:04:18.260> of<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.470> douche<00:04:18.739> bag<00:04:19.070> they

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
because of how much of a douche bag they

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.830 
because of how much of a douche bag they
both<00:04:20.090> are<00:04:20.359> both<00:04:20.810> of<00:04:21.049> them<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.880> what

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
both are both of them and so what

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.870 
both are both of them and so what
happens<00:04:24.230> is<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:24.800> they<00:04:25.100> start<00:04:25.490> boosting

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
happens is is that they start boosting

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.720 
happens is is that they start boosting
get<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.990> killstreaks<00:04:27.530> might<00:04:28.010> get<00:04:28.220> a<00:04:28.250> nuke<00:04:28.520> or

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
get the killstreaks might get a nuke or

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.940 
get the killstreaks might get a nuke or
just<00:04:28.940> get<00:04:29.180> they<00:04:29.780> end<00:04:29.990> up<00:04:30.200> winning<00:04:30.560> just

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
just get they end up winning just

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.760 
just get they end up winning just
because<00:04:31.360> they<00:04:32.360> can't<00:04:32.690> get<00:04:32.990> kills<00:04:33.320> on<00:04:33.590> their

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
because they can't get kills on their

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.670 
because they can't get kills on their
own<00:04:33.919> they<00:04:34.130> can't<00:04:34.400> kill<00:04:34.730> six<00:04:35.480> other<00:04:35.660> people<00:04:36.139> so

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
own they can't kill six other people so

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.710 
own they can't kill six other people so

like recorded this I encountered so many
boosters<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.910> was<00:04:56.090> ridiculous<00:04:56.810> like<00:04:57.230> game

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010

after game after game they would find
this<00:05:00.470> corner<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.400> map<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.880> boost<00:05:02.690> even

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
this corner of the map and boost even

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.570 
this corner of the map and boost even
somehow<00:05:04.540> somehow<00:05:05.540> they<00:05:05.840> tried<00:05:06.650> boosting<00:05:07.340> on<00:05:07.520> a

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
somehow somehow they tried boosting on a

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.890 
somehow somehow they tried boosting on a
small<00:05:08.330> map<00:05:08.600> like<00:05:09.580> scrap<00:05:10.580> yard<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.120> mean<00:05:11.479> the

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
small map like scrap yard I mean the

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.310 
small map like scrap yard I mean the
fact<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.200> they're<00:05:12.590> resorting<00:05:13.190> to<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.580> low

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
to that like such of a low thing that

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.150

they're<00:05:17.960> trying<00:05:18.500> they're<00:05:18.620> trying<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.890> boost

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
they're trying they're trying to boost

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.340 
they're trying they're trying to boost
on<00:05:19.490> one<00:05:19.700> of<00:05:19.790> these<00:05:19.880> smallest<00:05:20.360> maps<00:05:20.660> that<00:05:21.229> you

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
on one of these smallest maps that you

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
they're killed death goes down their

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
win-loss goes down it just gets that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.380 
win-loss goes down it just gets that
that's<00:06:14.000> pretty<00:06:14.390> much<00:06:14.510> it<00:06:14.630> now<00:06:15.560> I've<00:06:16.250> I<00:06:16.880> figured

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
that's pretty much it now I've I figured

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.140 
that's pretty much it now I've I figured
out<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.810> this<00:06:18.560> building<00:06:19.130> here<00:06:19.580> where<00:06:19.880> I<00:06:19.909> am

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
out that this building here where I am

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.730 
out that this building here where I am
if<00:06:20.450> I<00:06:20.630> patrol<00:06:21.110> down<00:06:21.770> here<00:06:22.130> and<00:06:22.340> up

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
if I patrol down here and up

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.550 
if I patrol down here and up
and<00:06:23.099> outside<00:06:23.699> its<00:06:24.270> this<00:06:24.690> is<00:06:24.870> one<00:06:25.020> of<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.319> most

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
and outside its this is one of the most

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.640 
and outside its this is one of the most
high<00:06:25.889> traffic<00:06:26.190> areas<00:06:26.849> in<00:06:27.120> this<00:06:27.449> on<00:06:27.990> this<00:06:28.349> map

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
high traffic areas in this on this map

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.950 
high traffic areas in this on this map
as<00:06:29.430> you<00:06:29.699> can<00:06:29.849> see<00:06:30.000> they<00:06:30.180> they<00:06:30.539> just<00:06:30.780> keep

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
as you can see they they just keep

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.050 
as you can see they they just keep
trickling<00:06:31.289> in<00:06:31.650> here<00:06:32.030> circling<00:06:33.030> so<00:06:34.880> that<00:06:35.880> guy

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
trickling in here circling so that guy

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.150 
trickling in here circling so that guy
tried<00:06:36.479> jump<00:06:37.139> shooting<00:06:37.349> me<00:06:37.590> but<00:06:37.800> he<00:06:37.919> failed

is<00:06:41.069> actually<00:06:41.370> pretty<00:06:42.270> close<00:06:42.720> to<00:06:42.930> wrapping<00:06:43.080> up

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
is actually pretty close to wrapping up

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.790 
is actually pretty close to wrapping up
I<00:06:44.630> didn't<00:06:45.630> have<00:06:45.720> any<00:06:45.870> kill<00:06:46.110> streaks<00:06:46.410> on<00:06:46.590> this

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
like 500 point deficit just because of

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.480 
like 500 point deficit just because of
those<00:06:51.449> boosters<00:06:51.960> really<00:06:52.830> shouldn't<00:06:53.160> goes<00:06:53.310> to
