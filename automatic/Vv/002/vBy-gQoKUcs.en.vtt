00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.520
 out there in front of a screen welcome to the issue 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.270
 6 and 20 Attention my goodness 26 hears from wave TV again today 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.889
 a very exciting adventure radio drama tip Dr, however, is still immersed 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.699
 Among other things, his foster child also contains elements in the sea 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.699
 Liferay noted my favorite medium 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.659
 those in one or the other may already know but the handicaps 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.569
 do not do 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.159
 you heard today 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.159
 of the advertisement 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850
 wa 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.910
 together when I come his next edition today it's about 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.200
 Frank Schätzing 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 the hit one epic on five CDs per five CDs in five parts on 18 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.670
 CDs 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.670
 twice as big now alone I have her 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.090
 on the first two CDs and has a running time of only 60 minutes alone 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 the thing is exciting even if it is not a pure radio play it is a bit 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.060
 a Brit for book and radio play because it is very well spoken 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.840
 and the old entertaining Zieler passages 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.760
 by Frank Zappa KGaA is really very well done percent the whole is 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.470
 There is also a very nice, very reserved Zoundi of his 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.150
 actually always the scene meets quite well, if that is certainly true 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.250
 paint great Hollywood movie releases and Hollywood already the rights to it 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.820
 Has 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.180
 is the radio play really an absolute hint value 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.990
 and the love Frank Schätzing has because he's son percent everything could be too 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.270
 really almost everything tuned so there great music worked with he has the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.220
 Directed 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 and he has two roles to speak with 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 otherwise we hear Frank Zappa KGaA Frauke Pohlmann powers Großmann 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.990
 Joachim Kerzel Stefan Gaebel Hoff Ulrich Ilg C # Java and of course 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.420
 Philipp Thiele more 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.809
 the whole thing is absolutely recommended as a CD and as a download from RV Lorch 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.879
 can only say at this point even though it may be another one already 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.039
 knows 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.459
 clean again or Burt in 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.459
 who does not know it and percent me 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.849
 say the thing is it is when it comes to singing ice at a bit of time 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.549
 an investment needs 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.809
 at this point 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 do well LEED long and peace 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.939
 freefall
