00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:05.720 
hey everybody today's battle the geeks
we're<00:00:03.389> gonna<00:00:03.570> do<00:00:03.870> let's<00:00:04.710> spin<00:00:05.160> reverse

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
we're gonna do let's spin reverse

we're gonna do let's spin reverse
spinning<00:00:06.210> only<00:00:06.649> okay<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:07.710> right<00:00:08.010> now<00:00:08.130> we're

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
spinning only okay so right now we're

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.330 
spinning only okay so right now we're
gonna<00:00:08.400> try<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> find<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> best<00:00:09.679> recoil<00:00:10.679> left

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
gonna try to find the best recoil left

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.060

game<00:00:52.500> today<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.100> reverse<00:00:54.090> spinning

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
game today with our reverse spinning

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.910 
game today with our reverse spinning
we're<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.510> spin<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.410> spin<00:00:55.649> beyblade

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we're gonna spin right spin beyblade

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220 
we're gonna spin right spin beyblade
with<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> left<00:00:56.309> spin<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.600> much<00:00:57.840> recoil

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
with a left spin to get as much recoil

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.639 
with a left spin to get as much recoil
on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> metal<00:00:58.890> wheel<00:00:59.010> as<00:00:59.250> possible<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.719> let's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
on the metal wheel as possible so let's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.670 
on the metal wheel as possible so let's
battle

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680
