00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.240
 hi all guys, it's always me and 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.810
 andrea and welcome to this brand new 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.690
 video today I will treat a top five gods 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.690
 five need for speed world players 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.119
 and what to say we begin immediately at the fifth 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.650
 place we have the show poses said of a 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.619
 player who bled for 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.210
 possess huge amounts of boost 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.190
 represent about 34 percent of the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.170
 show players have one 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.940
 myriad of cars but they only use the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 best all compact up 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 beyond doubt a further analysis 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.090
 shows 56 percent of these 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 players are of Russian origin is that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 at least eighty percent and a little 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.930
 total are often mocked by others 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.390
 players at the end of the race in fourth place is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 present the branch nor the branch nor exchange 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.649
 any car that is passing it by 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 a police car and therefore being 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 a convulsive duty to spread it against 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 the nearest wall arousing anger 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 of the opponent the ramons represent 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.820
 about 60 percent of the player 's 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.890
 wall and very often belong to 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.869
 other categories come here the seeds 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.760
 results from all others 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.920
 in third place is spam 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.420
 the one chump an individual who does not 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 manages to live without at least pulling 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.310
 seven nof4 sling shots of the 3000 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 juggernaut in every race while 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.479
 indispensable and to do so it must be used 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580
 avalanche t t power up if this philosophy 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.830
 door often the foam to turn into 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 copper 78 percent of Spaniards 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.850
 belong to the same time 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.290
 category of the supposed and often the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.780
 the player they were behind laughs at 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.729
 taste at the end of the race in second place is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 present the fat man the summit of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.479
 most player ask everyone they are 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.430
 about 15 percent of the players 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.530
 total are recognizable for the driver 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.909
 once normally scarce but that 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.430
 thanks to cheating programs 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 acquire a fearful acceleration e 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.250
 they succeed in advancing undeterred 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.110
 through traffic to others 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.390
 players as if they were panzers 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.890
 not to mention that very often there is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.680
 sees bouncing right and left on the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.430
 Escape walls are not able to drive 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.869
 they also come presently 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.629
 other players results 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.990
 and finally boys in the number position 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.690
 1 is present 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.750
 pro player the pro player does not use props 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.080
 not ramma not spa but not city and not 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.080
 spends a fucking penny on envelopes 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.760
 unfortunately there are 100,000 per cent 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.200
 of the players belongs to this one 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.420
 category 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.430
