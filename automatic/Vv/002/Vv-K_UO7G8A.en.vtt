00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.680 
but but looking at that announcers as
you<00:05:17.410> pointed<00:05:17.770> out<00:05:17.919> Tom<00:05:18.310> and<00:05:19.030> we<00:05:19.150> can<00:05:19.270> see<00:05:19.450> again

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
you pointed out Tom and we can see again

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.810 
you pointed out Tom and we can see again
I<00:05:19.930> think<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.260> referee<00:05:20.620> saw<00:05:20.950> a<00:05:21.190> car<00:05:21.490> cover<00:05:21.700> in

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
I think the referee saw a car cover in

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.100 
I think the referee saw a car cover in
the<00:05:21.910> fender<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.360> don't<00:05:22.510> think<00:05:22.630> it's<00:05:22.750> that<00:05:22.810> bad<00:05:23.050> I

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
the fender I don't think it's that bad I

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.540 
the fender I don't think it's that bad I
think<00:05:23.230> he's<00:05:23.470> just<00:05:23.560> very<00:05:23.770> committed<00:05:24.250> he's

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
think he's just very committed he's

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.980 
think he's just very committed he's
committed<00:05:24.910> to<00:05:24.940> get<00:05:25.180> to<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.390> ball<00:05:25.540> he's<00:05:25.900> not

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
committed to get to the ball he's not

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.120 
committed to get to the ball he's not
committed<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.320> take<00:05:26.500> out<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.740> player<00:05:26.950> he

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
committed to take out the player he

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.650 
committed to take out the player he
wants<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.400> get<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.610> the<00:05:27.700> ball<00:05:27.880> he's<00:05:28.390> trailing

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
wants to get to the ball he's trailing

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.050 
wants to get to the ball he's trailing
leg<00:05:28.960> which<00:05:29.200> takes<00:05:29.500> out<00:05:29.680> which<00:05:30.340> actually

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
leg which takes out which actually

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.850 
leg which takes out which actually
caused<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.510> he<00:05:31.750> takes<00:05:31.930> out<00:05:32.080> curb<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:32.740> he's

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
caused in it he takes out curb and he's

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.990 
caused in it he takes out curb and he's
the<00:05:32.980> fact<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.190> called<00:05:33.460> flips<00:05:33.730> in<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:33.910> air

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
the fact that called flips in the air

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.580 
the fact that called flips in the air
which<00:05:34.180> makes<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.510> look<00:05:34.570> ten<00:05:34.780> times<00:05:34.990> worse<00:05:35.200> and

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
which makes it look ten times worse and

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.020 
which makes it look ten times worse and
there<00:05:35.980> is<00:05:36.070> a<00:05:36.100> defender<00:05:36.520> covering<00:05:36.820> around<00:05:36.970> the

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
there is a defender covering around the

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.880
