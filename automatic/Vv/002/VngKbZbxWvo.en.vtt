00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.680
 to the previous episode 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.289
 we have seen the importance of the choice of 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.179
 the place to make this picture that this 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.060
 either at home at geneviève who is 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:26.419
 with us or in the studio like here 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.099
 what is the ideal today 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.579
 what are we going to see if the choice of 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.919
 optics 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.050
 which objectives chosen to have the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.519
 best results if some one can 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.370
 portraiture with all 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.190
 objectives from the super wide angle to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.960
 telephoto long so be 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.719
 very close to our subject or on the contrary 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 really far away so I come to you 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.140
 do some experimentation and 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 I hope you miss us 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.570
 with the first results we are going 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.249
 see 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.480
 firstly we will work with a 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.120
 great time we will see what 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.499
 it's a wide-angle it's often like 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.039
 what comes that a goal with a 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.880
 basic camera or like here I had 16 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.730
 35 so 16 35 on a full format that's 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.300
 still a lot of size 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.250
 that it would give 16 mm we'll see 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.700
 here is to take a pretty portrait 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 close to the face of geneviève is the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.350
 I did not think it was great 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.550
 reaction 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.650
 I think I'll show you the 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:32.030
 results were sent from morning to 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.770
 even a little bit more telli not yet 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 given really wide-angle and if I'm going 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 to take a facial is still too close 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.170
 that's one of the problems with 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.910
 wide angle is that often we are 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.800
 too close to our subject we can also 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.980
 to be in our light source and the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.930
 difficult wide angle topic at less than 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.070
 want to take a plan a little bit 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.210
 bigger and make sure not bad 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.210
 of levels with our subject 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.820
 I will now change to a 24 76 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.560
 which is a goal 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.090
 medium wide-angle and you have the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.850
 normal stifle wound in that have even 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.560
 fifty-one course telly the side too 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.510
 interesting this objective there is that 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.670
 it's a two point opening is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.140
 so a big opening 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.990
 what does it do that allows us 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.030
 to have maximum optical quality is 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.400
 also subject to working at full 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.790
 opening the background will end up 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.410
 enough out of focus so at 70 mm we will see 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.930
 what does it give to do yet 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.480
 there a medium- sized portrait of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.459
 geneviève yeah there it becomes 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.500
 interesting because you see I have 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.930
 a reasonable distance from my subject 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.390
 about a month was night what makes 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.760
 that people are going to be comfortable 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.120
 it will photograph I will not be in 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.410
 my soul to the number of lights and I'm going 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.970
 still have good game if I want 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.580
 to make my subject grow I know a little 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.780
 little I can put in the lowest term 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.430
 to make sure that the person she 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.460
 photography especially in good 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.580
 proportions 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.010
 now we will try the 85 mm 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.060
 it's really my goal will tell you 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.540
 fetish to do portrait 85 1.4 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.030
 especially at case we we 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.440
 could find a 1.2 at sony or 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 other brands or also others 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.700
 great souls but for me it's 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.950
 really one of the most goals 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.510
 interesting to do the portrait that 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.910
 gives us an absolutely perspective 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.520
 fabulous and if I had the opportunity he has 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.050
 worked at full openness so at 1.4 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.100
 the background is absolutely 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.160
 fantastic 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.660
 only small flat magnifying glass only thing to 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.130
 probably be careful about 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.290
 to that is if you work at full 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.670
 opening at 1.4 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.470
 pay attention to your focus 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.080
 because the depth of field is 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.080
 minimal it does not fall from the sky 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.650
 which becomes interesting also the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.170
 work front with fixed focus 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.460
 often it's the minimum distance from 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.860
 focus that is a little bit more 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.640
 closer than with a zoom 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.200
 the other thing is that if you 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.360
 work regularly with the same 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.460
 optical what will happen if you 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.500
 will know its particularity of the 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.870
 caunette the feeling the understanding that 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.530
 it will give what often with a zoom 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.530
 we leave 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.030
 an end 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.919
 5 what does it do facal a little bit more 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.460
 long as the 85 so for a 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.620
 perspective in a full format often 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.780
 a little more pleasant at canon on 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.919
 also found the 135 m2 that is 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.080
 really beautiful 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.360
 I like long and focal length 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.000
 fixed to do my words to make the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.750
 portrait you will see my distance and 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.750
 a little longer 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.780
 the choice of a 110 200 for me is 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.900
 probably the ideal goal to make 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.650
 of the portrait because mainly I 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.970
 am in good shape 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.490
 because it's optical quality at 2.8 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.170
 to have an easy brightness for the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.680
 focus and also for 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:26.000
 absolutely fabulous results between 70 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.250
 and 200 what does that make it 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.250
 allows to make tight portraits of the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.370
 face of geneviève or take 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.470
 the scrap plants really flexible 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.810
 if you find it too lot still 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.360
 the possibility of having goals 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.650
 at some brands f4 or if 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.990
 you do not work in full format 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.210
 sigma make a magnificent 50 cent 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.110
 fifty 2.8 also much smaller 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.600
 lighter 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.550
 one of the things that I like of course 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.690
 goal there is the ring that allows me 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.210
 to install my lens on a tripod 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.740
 while keeping it accept what makes 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.960
 that if I have a beautiful composition 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.580
 horizontal and that I want quickly 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.710
 went in vertical I only have to 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.310
 turn my lens let's see what 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.310
 it gives us as a result 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.430
 you see very flexible quality 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.620
 optics of this optics club is 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.470
 really perfect to support 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.570
 the nature of the sport a little bit of everything as well 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.970
 why sometimes we have to use a 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:36.170
 diffusion filter just to soften 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.170
 a little bit our image 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.550
 a broadcast film in place ahead 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.140
 our perspective there is like this one 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.120
 of which hugo in value but sometimes 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.940
 also as rogues who are of shape 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.620
 square and are plastic the purpose of the 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.610
 diffusion son precisely it is dadou 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.170
 it's our image of maybe sometimes 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.030
 to remove some wrinkles obviously not 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.370
 on geneviève but if I had to do 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.860
 self-portraits at the same time what he 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:05.370
 must also be noted is that the filter 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.180
 softening also removes a little 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.520
 of contrast 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.830
 that's why either the excuse is 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.010
 in marriage in charming photography of 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.010
 bare 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.350
 in the next episode 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.630
 we will talk about light so 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.690
 mainly the difference between the 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:30.110
 fight continues and the flash to go see 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.640
 a lot to learn and 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.750
 explore and care for roses 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.500
 for wolf calls 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.500
 thank you
