00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.999
 or that this week on the re-run yes different advantages and disadvantages elimination 

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.380
 in the Europa League and showed the defeat to Ajax 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.380
 comparable week before that 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.089
 no i think it was not to stay earlier 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.880
 because geert no might go light from certain outcome twente determines it 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.220
 a rhythm 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.320
 what many cattle play for time in this work statements yes not used 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.669
 are 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.899
 well i don't think so 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.560
 I notice that there are seventeen murders 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.560
 how formerly affected that certainly look on the spot 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.210
 that they are further to be there 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.390
 come to the surface 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 what we are 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.910
 m that's not a shame that's just 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.910
 wales you get that you still have to take steps 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.280
 and when I watch the ajax competition 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.330
 yes despite being there 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.990
 3 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.990
 I can be very satisfied with the game as we played it 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 Of course it is important that we then 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.650
 the recipes give a cord a good response to get a good result 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 after a defeat at home that's obvious though 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.370
 Cetin speak that we are correct 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.400
 water flea because I think we played against Ajax and seventy 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.380
 yes their car design award is fully processed now we don't have enough space 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 got 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.979
 Yes of course I think we are Ajax's game 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.160
 to have the players did suffer from that again myself 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.340
 the win the way you 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.870
 until a defeat comes 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.870
 disappointment extra large 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.460
 the two days then the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.790
 must get up and leave a digger after the match of van sat 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.260
 then work 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.030
 why is the situation of wanting to get rid of niger Monday still allende the pressure 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.290
 to survive 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.000
 essence of the story about 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.410
 pff good players 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.780
 but he enters the company lies the discord between the tyrr 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.340
 that's the farm-less chasing less goes 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490
 we have something for you from a column 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.430
 I have read more 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.670
 I have to say 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.309
 in the great man we want to live with 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.469
 it's his opinion 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.989
 fine i can't do anything with it i have nothing with it 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.509
 I think we are a good team, we have often shown depth 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.689
 this season 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.689
 and I also showed that to Ajax 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.119
 80 minutes after the equalizer fell 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.519
 we are staying gas 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.799
 like being a plow 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.799
 and that it actually becomes an animal because there 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.979
 taking the last few minutes full of risk looking the other way 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.019
 that can happen they risk that intention 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.019
 find that it has been an example that he is not ten years old 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.729
 if he has those opinions then he has 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.479
 powers that also give brazil he has learned a lot from some players 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.490
 for two works and the young offender there are more 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.539
 and even write an entire book about it 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.260
 what people think about our team on our players 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.109
 yes I don't care 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.149
 and of course nothing will become of political scientist the people behind them 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:07.470
 going to deepen market rates 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.900
 and picking it up and that it is in this phase of the competition and maybe even for a while 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.630
 good thing that there is also not the Netherlands rumbeke I do not need anything 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.589
 childcare in the dressing room 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.209
 that is no longer good 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.209
 we know very well with them all what we have to do 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.279
 a defeat to ajax that does not change anything 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:30.049
 after a hesitant sit in the top clubs and then it is busy the next game 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.079
 slightly larger 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.099
 but then I do not have to run away you just have to follow Nijmegen a good one 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.709
 response 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.489
 in german centric they judge that as the whole group or we are focused on 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.479
 not one or not everyone 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.749
 everyone has a pink cake, everyone has these qualities 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.230
 you know your character 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.539
 that is our abundance all season 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.479
 we are not going to complain 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:55.639
 become nervous or do other things when we get to the end of the competition 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.189
 to go 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.749
 The city in the world still doubts about this yet on a fact that he is his son 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.930
 the private opinion hereby becomes a true hero he and his not that he 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.129
 Nov 5, 2011 he feels it 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.129
 that we do not have a child so I could not read 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.979
 I tend to disagree 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:14.769
 with strong thunder or one 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.819
 might just be okay and nothing more on the load 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.659
 because he follows to hit the road 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.620
 yes i think that every match is that 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.640
 Now it is very important to also give lessons by dingos 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.969
 and indeed the next home game 0 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.009
 we must do everything we can to ensure that we win on Saturday 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.099
 what weird of the meats 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.009
 why what what many elements of doherty often pvv the most 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.639
 prepared with feyenoord needed I think we were able to do it last season 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.639
 experienced without being pretty fast with 2 0 behind 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.319
 when the match against Ajax was seen for the lions 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.849
 temporarily 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.110
 not ajax yet 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.860
 that is all very close together 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.499
 so we have already seen a lot of competitions 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.629
 we are not an easy match is a simple opponents 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:05.599
 if we 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.669
 zelderloo 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.839
 m and have the appearance 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.129
 and being able to pay in the field as against ajax 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.939
 yes then we have the quality to win that contest when they got one 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:18.370
 requested and the passion 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.319
 van rooy 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.229
 the class and the quality difference give the car a great one too 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.219
 atmosphere always in the stadium 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.589
 the people too close to the field 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.310
 the turnover that plow the man is much the advice 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.669
 in china team 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.479
 physically strong guys 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.889
 we will vote 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:38.870
 to play against 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.290
 to the church but then the fehervari trainer taken away 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.090
 what does that say about the life of tomorrow 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:48.529
 that says one 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.299
 to state that there are three of those that will not be there yet 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.009
 only narsingh 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.860
 He just trained Dusty Springfield 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.430
 for all this not fit enough 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.050
 to look better 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.539
 what has 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.770
 he has a strain on you 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.770
 want to learn about the transition from them 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.710
 so that in the first round too early 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.710
 I am curious about the head of the wild round 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.320
 i don't look that hard i try myself 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.450
 that is not to say that I could write very well 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.349
 just once 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.159
 the I try not to be guided much by what everyone writes
