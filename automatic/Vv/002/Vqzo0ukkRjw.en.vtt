little<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> year<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:23.490> never<00:00:23.640> had

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
little over a year now and I never had

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.790 
little over a year now and I never had
any<00:00:23.910> problems<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.689> being<00:00:24.930> unhealthy<00:00:25.410> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
any problems with it being unhealthy I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.960 
any problems with it being unhealthy I
mean<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.369> drier<00:00:26.789> than<00:00:27.480> usual<00:00:28.189> but<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
mean it was drier than usual but the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.220 
mean it was drier than usual but the
last<00:00:30.090> time<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.359> bleached<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:30.929> went<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
last time I bleached it I went to

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.040 
last time I bleached it I went to
somewhat<00:00:31.590> different<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.690> basically<00:00:33.690> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
somewhat different and basically it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229 
somewhat different and basically it
fried<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.800> ends<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.610> started<00:00:35.969> breaking

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
fried my ends and they started breaking

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.990 
fried my ends and they started breaking
off<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:37.050> hair<00:00:37.320> was<00:00:38.329> down<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:41.000> it

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
off my hair was down to here and it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.549 
off my hair was down to here and it
broke<00:00:42.270> off<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.140> here

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
broke off up to here

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.709 
broke off up to here
oh<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.610> needed<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.570> about

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
oh I really needed to do something about

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.090 
oh I really needed to do something about
that<00:00:45.870> because<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> wasn't<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.860> let<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
that because I wasn't gonna let it

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
that because I wasn't gonna let it
continue<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> break<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.480> dyed<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.170> back<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
continue to break off I dyed it back to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.049 
continue to break off I dyed it back to
my<00:00:49.620> natural<00:00:49.829> color<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:52.350> cut<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:52.800> my<00:00:53.550> ends

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
my natural color and I cut off my ends

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.160 
my natural color and I cut off my ends
um<00:00:55.039> it's<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.430> long<00:00:56.809> when<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.960> not

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
um it's about this long when it's not

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.250 
um it's about this long when it's not
curled<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.699> guess<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.359> only<00:01:00.660> broke<00:01:00.899> off<00:01:01.109> too

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
curled so I guess I only broke off too

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
curled so I guess I only broke off too
like<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
like here here is the back of it it's a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
like here here is the back of it it's a
lot<00:01:06.360> shorter<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.680> darker<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lot shorter and a lot darker and it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
lot shorter and a lot darker and it's
really<00:01:09.270> hard<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> get<00:01:09.630> used<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> every<00:01:10.530> time<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
really hard to get used to every time I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
really hard to get used to every time I
look<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> mirror<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.549> just<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.939> who<00:01:12.540> the

it<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> another<00:01:16.590> video<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.460> crowed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
it in another video when it's not crowed

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.300 
it in another video when it's not crowed
but<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.200> just<00:01:19.470> wanted<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> looks

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
but I just wanted to see what it looks

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
but I just wanted to see what it looks
like<00:01:20.430> curled<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.000> how<00:01:21.150> short<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> would<00:01:21.659> get

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
like curled like how short it would get

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.770 
like curled like how short it would get
so<00:01:22.430> that's<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:23.610> happened<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
you probably aren't gonna like it

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
you probably aren't gonna like it
because<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.820> different<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:28.409> of

I'm<00:01:34.650> gonna<00:01:34.860> dye<00:01:35.220> them<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.820> match<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:37.250> whatever

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I'm gonna dye them to match and whatever

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.910
