order to release the caliper just taking

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.330 
order to release the caliper just taking
the<00:01:29.430> bolts<00:01:29.700> off<00:01:30.350> doesn't<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.500> release

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then pull the caliper out at the same

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.800 
then pull the caliper out at the same
time<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.119> bottom<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.689> the

going to have to do the same thing if
you<00:01:43.770> try<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> put<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> caliper<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> without

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you try to put the caliper on without

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
you try to put the caliper on without
pulling<00:01:45.720> those<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.890> won't<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
pulling those out it won't go all the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.990 
pulling those out it won't go all the
way<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.110> okay<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.170> there's<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.820> caliper<00:01:50.820> I've

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
way on okay so there's the caliper I've

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.210 
way on okay so there's the caliper I've
taking<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> off<00:01:51.600> it's<00:01:52.259> still<00:01:52.409> attached<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
taking it off it's still attached to the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.679 
taking it off it's still attached to the
car<00:01:53.430> by<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> brake<00:01:54.000> hose<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.390> don't<00:01:54.540> need<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
car by the brake hose you don't need to

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.459 
car by the brake hose you don't need to
take<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> brake<00:01:55.140> hose<00:01:55.320> off<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.700> pads

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
take the brake hose off and those pads

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
take the brake hose off and those pads
one<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.979> popped<00:01:59.820> into<00:02:00.119> place<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> one

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
one is is popped into place the one

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.230 
one is is popped into place the one
that's<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> hydraulic<00:02:02.070> piston<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that's on the hydraulic piston and the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
that's on the hydraulic piston and the
other<00:02:03.329> ones<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.930> glued<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> blue

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
other ones actually glued with a blue

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.940 
other ones actually glued with a blue
strip<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.299> pry<00:02:07.290> them<00:02:07.350> both<00:02:07.680> off

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
strip so you have to pry them both off

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.990 
strip so you have to pry them both off
with<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> flathead<00:02:08.550> screwdriver

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
with a flathead screwdriver

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.830 
with a flathead screwdriver
okay<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.890> before<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.580> put<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> pads<00:02:13.360> back<00:02:13.600> on

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
okay so before you put the pads back on

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.120 
okay so before you put the pads back on
you<00:02:14.020> need<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> put<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> c-clamp

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
you need to put a c-clamp

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.240 
you need to put a c-clamp
on<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:16.120> piston<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:17.610> open<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:20.010> put<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.070> all

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
on the piston to open it up put it all

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.690 
on the piston to open it up put it all
back<00:02:21.430> together<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.330> notice<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.720> got<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
back together you notice I got the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.750 
back together you notice I got the
little<00:02:24.700> spring<00:02:25.180> clamp<00:02:26.050> back<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.860> I'm

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
little spring clamp back on there I'm

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
little spring clamp back on there I'm
not<00:02:27.850> sure<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.600> maybe<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:29.650> keeps<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
not sure what that is maybe it keeps the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.980 
not sure what that is maybe it keeps the
calipers<00:02:30.880> from<00:02:31.150> rattling<00:02:31.570> when<00:02:31.870> you're

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
calipers from rattling when you're

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.840 
calipers from rattling when you're
driving<00:02:32.350> down<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.530> road<00:02:32.680> looks<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.610> kind

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
driving down the road looks like it kind

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.710 
driving down the road looks like it kind
of<00:02:33.910> kind<00:02:34.720> of<00:02:34.780> keeps<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.110> tight<00:02:35.920> or<00:02:36.190> something

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of kind of keeps it tight or something

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.440 
of kind of keeps it tight or something
but<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:39.040> pretty<00:02:39.250> hard<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.850> on<00:02:40.030> it's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
but it's it's pretty hard to get on it's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.900 
but it's it's pretty hard to get on it's
actually<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.310> hardest<00:02:42.310> thing<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.670> get<00:02:42.760> on

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
actually the hardest thing to get on

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.580 
actually the hardest thing to get on
that's<00:02:43.120> why<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.360> didn't<00:02:43.660> video<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.140> because<00:02:44.470> I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's why I didn't video it because I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.220 
that's why I didn't video it because I
can't<00:02:44.860> hold<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.310> iPad<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.330> do<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.959> at<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
can't hold the iPad and do that at the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.890 
can't hold the iPad and do that at the
same<00:02:47.290> time<00:02:47.740> but<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.310> basically<00:02:49.090> laid<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.690> at

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
same time but I basically laid it in at

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.290 
same time but I basically laid it in at
the<00:02:49.990> top<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:51.520> then<00:02:51.670> laid<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.090> in<00:02:52.240> the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
the top and then laid it in in the

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.500 
the top and then laid it in in the
middle<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.770> push<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.490> part<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
middle and then push this part of the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.040 
middle and then push this part of the
spring<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:56.140> onto<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.760> bolt<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.750> once<00:02:58.959> I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
spring up onto this bolt and then once I

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.690 
spring up onto this bolt and then once I
got<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.350> kind<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.560> wedged<00:02:59.770> into<00:03:00.010> place<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.490> put<00:03:00.640> a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
got it kind of wedged into place I put a

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.990 
got it kind of wedged into place I put a
screwdriver<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.480> pop<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.580> first<00:03:06.820> one

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
screwdriver and pop and the first one

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.440 
screwdriver and pop and the first one
was<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.390> hard<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.790> did<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.240> little

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
was really hard this one I did a little

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.920 
was really hard this one I did a little
better

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
better

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.070 
better
so<00:03:11.190> I'd<00:03:12.190> say<00:03:12.490> after<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.090> after<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.900> third

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
so I'd say after this after the third

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.009 
so I'd say after this after the third
tried<00:03:14.410> probably<00:03:14.890> be<00:03:15.040> pretty<00:03:15.970> easy<00:03:16.269> just<00:03:16.720> kind

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
tried probably be pretty easy just kind

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.680 
tried probably be pretty easy just kind
of<00:03:17.050> hard<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> first<00:03:17.530> time
