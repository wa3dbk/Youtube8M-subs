access to the microphone and the speaker

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.380 
access to the microphone and the speaker
at<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.550> bottom<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.910> there's<00:02:28.910> also<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.150> little

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
flap at the back for the camera so we

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.000 
flap at the back for the camera so we
can<00:02:31.670> keep<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.390> camera<00:02:32.660> length<00:02:32.810> protected<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
can keep the camera length protected and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.150 
can keep the camera length protected and
then<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.700> also<00:02:34.850> got<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.739> whole<00:02:36.739> piece<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
then you also got this whole piece that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.479 
then you also got this whole piece that
goes<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.709> back<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:39.920> clips<00:02:40.220> sort

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
goes on the back that clips sort

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.320 
goes on the back that clips sort
together<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.450> we've<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:42.819> three<00:02:43.819> parts<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
together so we've now got three parts of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.690 
together so we've now got three parts of
the<00:02:44.420> case<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.019> then<00:02:45.500> finally<00:02:46.069> if<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.459> want<00:02:46.640> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
the case and then finally if you want to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.030 
the case and then finally if you want to
actually<00:02:46.819> use<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:48.200> conjunction<00:02:48.319> with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
actually use this in conjunction with

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.949 
actually use this in conjunction with
the<00:02:49.780> with<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.140> holster<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:53.269> slide

the with the the holster and that slide

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.650 
the with the the holster and that slide
in<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:54.350> just<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.100> that<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.580> hope<00:02:56.569> that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
in there just like that I hope that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.340 
in there just like that I hope that
