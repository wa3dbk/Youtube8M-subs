00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
entire match another tip would be once

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.500 
entire match another tip would be once
you<00:00:53.640> hit<00:00:53.820> him<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> uppercut<00:00:54.539> try<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
you hit him with that uppercut try to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.450 
you hit him with that uppercut try to
jump<00:00:57.510> backwards<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.320> give<00:00:58.829> yourself<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.370> little

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
jump backwards to give yourself a little

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
jump backwards to give yourself a little
bit<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.850> space<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.320> times<00:01:01.680> where

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
bit more space there will be times where

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.200 
bit more space there will be times where
