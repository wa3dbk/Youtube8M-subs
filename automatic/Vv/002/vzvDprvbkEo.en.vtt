00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.220
 solve the problem of drivers in the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 operating system xp since many of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.400
 the users of this channel the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.860
 channel followers have in the

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.510
 follow that I have a blog of noticed here 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.240
 then first have integral of 38 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.130
 desktop lime what we have right 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.869
 a right click is this completed this 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.110
 box in which he expressed to do 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.720
 this 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.520
 the second step is to give it in properties 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.770
 down here says properties to you 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.710
 they will give here 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.950
 the third step is the configuration is 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.810
 offer this box and up here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.390
 up configuration in the last 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.290
 employed name 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.879
 here is going to offer you this box and 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.970
 they are going to give you go find the amount of 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 songs so advanced 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.480
 is down here that is given there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.730
 finger for this other box you will 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.800
 they will give in problem solver 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.490
 appears here 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.080
 and solving problems and finally what 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.000
 what are we going to configure I am saying 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.430
 this box and says here the father 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.820
 No. 6 to which appears with a slash 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.420
 well from none to complete the retrocedes 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.940
 three places back ok 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.000
 here one two three appears 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.119
 4 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 56 ok and go back 3 for 13 towards 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.880
 back would be 123 and I would put it in the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.310
 fourth that here has put an image 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.259
 123 minutes 10 on the fourth ok 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 well once done that you are not going to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.270
 accept that says accept or accept and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.860
 well we finished the tutorial today 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.579
 it's almost everything we had 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.429
 what to do but this and if you do not 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.729
 this works and someone has not 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.439
 operated windows 7 is because its 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.439
 computer does not meet the requirements 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.420
 minimum to play this game 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.550
 called minecraft ok 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.980
 a minecraft the medium heavy fire like this 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.540
 entrepreneurs more more for the pixels and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.989
 all the boxes you have to go 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 generating as it goes in exchange it does not have 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.970
 so what makes a very heavy game 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.230
 so if you did not work this 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.140
 it is very likely that those fish do not 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.150
 meet our requirements ok good 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 that would be the tutorial of today and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.000
