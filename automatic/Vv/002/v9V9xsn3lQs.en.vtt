so<00:00:01.410> maybe<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:01.920> could<00:00:02.070> find<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.520> new<00:00:02.700> vernacular

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
so maybe we could find a new vernacular

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.780 
so maybe we could find a new vernacular
for<00:00:03.419> this<00:00:03.689> up<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.020> buy<00:00:04.200> condition<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:05.730> you

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
for this up to buy condition so when you

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.550 
for this up to buy condition so when you
do<00:00:05.940> 200<00:00:06.330> thousand<00:00:06.600> square<00:00:06.779> meters<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.990> hotel

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
do 200 thousand square meters of hotel

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400 
do 200 thousand square meters of hotel
and<00:00:07.770> retail<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.580> desert<00:00:09.200> maybe<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.320> can

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
and retail in the desert maybe you can

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.650 
and retail in the desert maybe you can
decide<00:00:10.679> by<00:00:10.950> removing<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> facades<00:00:12.030> from<00:00:12.540> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
decide by removing the facades from the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780 
decide by removing the facades from the
Desert<00:00:12.990> Sun<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.920> they<00:00:14.040> can<00:00:14.160> actually<00:00:14.280> be<00:00:14.580> in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
Desert Sun so they can actually be in

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.029 
Desert Sun so they can actually be in
their<00:00:14.969> own<00:00:15.000> channel<00:00:15.529> create<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.590> cooling

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
their own channel create this cooling

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.120 
their own channel create this cooling
pool<00:00:17.369> area<00:00:17.699> beneath<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:19.890> sort<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
pool area beneath it and so we sort of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.679 
pool area beneath it and so we sort of
realized<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.580> our<00:00:20.699> idea<00:00:21.330> from<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
realized that our idea from the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.769 
realized that our idea from the
stockholm<00:00:23.029> recently<00:00:24.029> become<00:00:24.300> reality<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
stockholm recently become reality and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.679 
stockholm recently become reality and
dubai<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> could<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.480> lobby

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
dubai that we could put all the lobby

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
dubai that we could put all the lobby
and<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> restaurants<00:00:28.920> etc<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> top

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
on these columns of hotel rooms and i

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
on these columns of hotel rooms and i
created<00:00:33.090> sub<00:00:33.210> shaded<00:00:33.600> market<00:00:33.989> beneath<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.579> the

created sub shaded market beneath it the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
created sub shaded market beneath it the
agent<00:00:36.030> would<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.390> excited<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.350> could<00:00:37.500> have

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
agent would be so excited you could have

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.240 
agent would be so excited you could have
like<00:00:37.710> orchards<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.910> Gardens<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> top<00:00:40.250> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
like orchards and Gardens on the top so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
like orchards and Gardens on the top so
i<00:00:41.280> became<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> secure<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.570> vision<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.200> Parvati

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
i became to secure the vision of Parvati

upside down and traces of inverted the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.319 
upside down and traces of inverted the
skyline<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.129> first<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> remove<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> facades

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
skyline so first we remove the facades

skyline so first we remove the facades
from<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> block<00:00:51.899> there's<00:00:52.590> no<00:00:52.800> existing

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
from the block there's no existing

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
from the block there's no existing
building<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.699> there's<00:00:53.850> only<00:00:54.000> streets<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
building so there's only streets it's a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830 
building so there's only streets it's a
completely<00:00:55.230> new<00:00:55.410> area<00:00:56.329> or<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
completely new area or we can do is

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.479 
completely new area or we can do is
relate<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> streets<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> square<00:00:59.250> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
relate to the streets and the square so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.970 
relate to the streets and the square so
we<00:00:59.579> try<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> create<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.270> many<00:01:00.449> connections

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
we try to create as many connections

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
we try to create as many connections
across<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.250> possible<00:01:02.730> coming<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.629> these<00:01:03.809> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
across as possible coming out these of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
across as possible coming out these of
ashley's<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> result<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> or

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
a trick that you look down into and when

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.710 
a trick that you look down into and when
you<00:02:06.039> sort<00:02:06.189> of<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.399> through<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.670> planks<00:02:07.149> it's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
you sort of go through the planks it's

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.240 
you sort of go through the planks it's
the<00:02:07.810> substrate<00:02:08.380> high<00:02:08.649> quality<00:02:09.039> where

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the substrate high quality where

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.220 
the substrate high quality where
actually<00:02:09.549> the<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:10.299> floor<00:02:10.539> plan<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.049> get

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
actually the the floor plan I get

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.780 
actually the the floor plan I get
smaller<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.769> smaller<00:02:11.860> until<00:02:12.310> you<00:02:12.610> reach

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
smaller and smaller until you reach

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.190 
smaller and smaller until you reach
reach<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.209> ground<00:02:13.390> where<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:13.870> only

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
reach the ground where it's only

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.190 
reach the ground where it's only
structure<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.810> circulation<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.780> if<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.019> saw

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
structure and circulation so if you saw

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.710 
structure and circulation so if you saw
move<00:02:20.440> back<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.920> through<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:22.120> party

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
move back up through the the party

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.910 
move back up through the the party
through<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.709> cortex<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:26.349> one<00:02:26.530> place<00:02:26.709> where

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
through the cortex this one place where

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.160 
through the cortex this one place where
we<00:02:26.980> slice<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.519> a<00:02:27.700> piece<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.180> roof<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
we slice out a piece of the roof to

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.130 
we slice out a piece of the roof to
create<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:29.709> big<00:02:29.920> skylight<00:02:30.370> above<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.840> mosque

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
create a big skylight above the mosque

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.740 
create a big skylight above the mosque
which<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.250> integrated<00:02:33.670> at<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.299> base<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
which is integrated at the base of the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.460 
which is integrated at the base of the
building<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.150> anyway<00:02:37.480> we<00:02:37.660> ended<00:02:37.690> up<00:02:38.019> coming<00:02:38.319> up

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
building so anyway we ended up coming up

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.220 
building so anyway we ended up coming up
with<00:02:38.680> shapes<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.370> forms<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.359> remind<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.019> of

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
with shapes and forms that remind you of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.830 
with shapes and forms that remind you of
Hispanic<00:02:42.190> accusation<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.120> it's<00:02:43.299> generated

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
Hispanic accusation but it's generated

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.379 
Hispanic accusation but it's generated
from<00:02:44.680> another<00:02:45.639> server<00:02:45.819> set<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.209> conditions

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
from another server set of conditions

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.170 
from another server set of conditions
and<00:02:46.810> even<00:02:47.470> structurally<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.430> know<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
and even structurally you know the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.699 
and even structurally you know the
normal<00:02:49.690> way<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.810> building<00:02:50.079> is<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.590> have

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
normal way of building is that you have

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.310 
normal way of building is that you have
beams<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.280> columns
