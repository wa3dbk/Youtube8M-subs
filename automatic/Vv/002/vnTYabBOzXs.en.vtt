our video series you know that we've

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.160 
our video series you know that we've
been<00:00:08.429> looking<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.599> lightweight<00:00:09.929> rain

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
been looking at all the lightweight rain

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.830 
been looking at all the lightweight rain
jackets<00:00:10.710> recently<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> new

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
jackets recently and this is a new

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.049 
jackets recently and this is a new
release<00:00:13.259> from<00:00:13.500> outdoor<00:00:13.920> research<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.880> since

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
release from outdoor research and since

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.900 
release from outdoor research and since
we<00:00:15.179> covered<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.780> helium<00:00:16.260> two<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:17.490> only<00:00:17.670> makes

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
we covered the helium two it only makes

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.490 
we covered the helium two it only makes
sense<00:00:18.090> for<00:00:18.240> us<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> also<00:00:18.810> talk<00:00:18.990> about<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
sense for us to also talk about the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.099 
sense for us to also talk about the
helium<00:00:19.980> HD<00:00:20.490> The<00:00:21.359> Healing<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:21.840> has<00:00:21.960> been<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
helium HD The Healing show has been a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.990 
helium HD The Healing show has been a
very<00:00:22.439> successful<00:00:22.680> jacket<00:00:23.550> for<00:00:23.670> outdoor

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
very successful jacket for outdoor

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.880 
very successful jacket for outdoor
research<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.529> start<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:25.859> by

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
research and so let's start off by

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.920 
research and so let's start off by
talking<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.060> jacket<00:00:27.539> compares

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
talking about how this jacket compares

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
talking about how this jacket compares
to<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.099> let's<00:00:29.250> also<00:00:29.490> talk<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to it but let's also talk about how it

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.200 
to it but let's also talk about how it
compares<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.520> Montville<00:00:32.520> versus<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> light

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
compares to the Montville versus a light

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.680 
compares to the Montville versus a light
jacket<00:00:33.480> since<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.290> more<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.070> match<00:00:36.000> terms<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
jacket since it's more a match terms and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.430 
jacket since it's more a match terms and
features<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> helium<00:00:38.820> HD<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
features to what the helium HD is so the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.990 
features to what the helium HD is so the
Outdoor<00:00:40.770> Research<00:00:41.059> helium<00:00:42.059> 2<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.760> six<00:00:44.760> point

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
Outdoor Research helium 2 is a six point

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060 
Outdoor Research helium 2 is a six point
four<00:00:45.270> ounce<00:00:45.480> jacket<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.170> size<00:00:46.379> large<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
four ounce jacket in size large the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.660 
four ounce jacket in size large the
helium<00:00:47.640> HD<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.469> just<00:00:49.469> under<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> sweet<00:00:50.399> spot

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
helium HD is just under that sweet spot

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
helium HD is just under that sweet spot
10<00:00:51.000> ounces<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.629> nine<00:00:51.870> point<00:00:52.260> nine<00:00:52.469> ounces<00:00:52.949> for

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
10 ounces so nine point nine ounces for

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
10 ounces so nine point nine ounces for
size<00:00:53.430> large<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.210> what<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:54.629> wearing<00:00:54.860> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
size large which is what I'm wearing the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
size large which is what I'm wearing the
increase<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> weight<00:00:56.670> comes<00:00:57.360> from<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> fact

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
increase in weight comes from the fact

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.470 
increase in weight comes from the fact
that<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.559> many<00:00:59.430> features<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.120> were

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that this has many features that were

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.139 
that this has many features that were
left<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.590> helium<00:01:02.100> 2<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:02.969> you're

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
left off of that helium 2 so if you're

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.109 
left off of that helium 2 so if you're
looking<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> lightest<00:01:05.189> jacket

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
looking for you know the lightest jacket

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
looking for you know the lightest jacket
that<00:01:06.990> we've<00:01:07.110> reviewed<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.619> far<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.010> would

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that we've reviewed so far you would

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.609 
that we've reviewed so far you would
look<00:01:08.250> at<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> helium<00:01:09.240> 2<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:10.080> you're<00:01:10.320> looking

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
look at that helium 2 if you're looking

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
look at that helium 2 if you're looking
for<00:01:10.860> still<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> lightweight<00:01:11.880> rain<00:01:12.150> jacket
