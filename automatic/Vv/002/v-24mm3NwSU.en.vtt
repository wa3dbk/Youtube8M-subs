00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
how often they spawn so right now it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
how often they spawn so right now it's
set<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.409> percent<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.180> recommended

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
set to one percent which is recommended

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660

um<00:01:27.799> because<00:01:28.799> if<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.189> anything<00:01:29.369> higher

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
um because if you have anything higher

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.350 
um because if you have anything higher
they<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.450> start<00:01:30.630> spawning<00:01:30.840> non-stop<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.400> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
they just start spawning non-stop so it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.640 
they just start spawning non-stop so it
gives<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> same<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.470> what
