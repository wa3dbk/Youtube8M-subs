00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.330
 a small modification towards sumatra 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.750
 that at the moment that like for example 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.520
 from eating to the animals realizing 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.500
 that always the animals obviously 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.100
 always when you feed them because the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.720
 animals someone or like the little pig 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 for a little one then they are a little pig 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.500
 but in small mode but then if we are 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.600
 adds the modification that when 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.640
 give a piglet look like for example 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.890
 There are you give your pig and it will come out 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.740
 this little friend look well that 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.230
 little thing that is a piglet but a 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 baby and well that's how it is 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.090
 is very thanks to this mod but it is 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.800
 a modification that is worth it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.680
 have in toma and krafft alone then it 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.270
 install comfort this mod and everything is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.560
 install in case you put it in your folder 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 mont remember that if you do not have the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.490
 motors folder created as the can 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.020
 create and thus well tape in this way and 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.930
 Because they are added also 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.340
 add let kill these these 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.320
 little things also modifies them 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 the other animals the good thing is that I'm 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 in category but then it does not matter 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.620
 from that to see we remove this and go to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.740
 put now for example a vaquita that 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.430
 the vaquitas eat these little things 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.310
 we put a backpack with a cow and 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.869
 we also put the sheep and I think 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 he can also be the wolf the wolf 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.220
 here is the wolf not if you can with the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.990
 ocelots I do not know if they can be done 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.789
 see what is happening with these two 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.950
 but good here they have their vaquitas and 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.039
 as you see they are given and they will see that they will come out 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.369
 Of course your mini vaquita there are two 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.690
 Well, this is like a horse or I do not know 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.489
 if you can with the cables as well 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.019
 then the vaquita comes out as it is from this 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.660
 way it will not be a cow 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.450
 simply chiquitita now will be a 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.580
 cow because this is with his face the 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.799
 go well cute mind it is a 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.530
 vaquita very funny the lambs we go 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.280
 to see how the sheep look does not get out 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.100
 the sheep of different color like this came out his 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.830
 head all and had then if indeed 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.069
 if they have good ones it is a good way 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 because there are 2000 are no longer good because this 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.569
 add this small modification that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.000
 oysters of those who said that either 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:50.319
 because the animals were like that 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.209
 little ones, they already have their little 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.920
 modification these colors domesticate 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.250
 with bones I do not know where the bones are 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.890
 until we give them the bones there would be 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.480
 domesticated we give you the bones and not 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.420
 I know actually I think they mate with 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.720
 food but let's say and we give it and I think 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.590
 that if you stop with this and we'll see this 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.560
 because you're watching lobito lobito 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.620
 nice and me to see this pastura beach 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.400
 inflatable 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.990
 also so that also the wolf and duck 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.480
 as they are they did not listen very well very 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.820
 I do not know if I think it also comes out 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.460
 Cow think I champiÃ±Ã³n this does go 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.830
 to cost some time and tame what 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.960
 I'm going to take out the mushroom cow that 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.660
 it would be this and obviously they were also 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.940
 feed these things we are going to 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.900
 see I do not know if the mushroom cow has done 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.080
 It is a chicken 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.850
 let's see let's see the cow's chicken 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.790
 mushrooms is that you say that I common 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.300
 from there we give the chicken and we would see how 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.050
 would this modification of the chick 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.340
 it's a chicken and super cute 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.340
 look at this little thing 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.670
 ugly chicken is not out just to kill 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.640
 we're not going to see the mushroom cow that 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.970
 It would be this we see we give and we give 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.989
 would have this we see and if there is also a 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.250
 small and has that super hot is me then 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.080
 Well this is what adds them this 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.970
 mode is a small modification to your 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.770
 world really yes it is fun this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.010
 modification because because you do not 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.560
 they will never have thought or wished 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.210
 this in your world because then I also 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.450
 I wanted to know I stayed with him 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.790
 delivery because the mods were not like that 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.320
 see leave he am these with crestor me 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.110
 I tell them to stay like this and they must 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.540
 come towards me there is like venice that 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.070
 medium and said I deserved it is 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.140
 seeing I think that he estimated me to bring 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.930
 little by little when they are watching me and 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.620
 we give it to him and we must delay this 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.610
 go here I 'm going to take something 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.360
 we have to wait for them to come 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360
 towards us 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.500
 Well, as I already have just finished 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.600
 domesticate I think I owed that 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.040
 stay still and I do not know if I stay 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.080
 still and comes towards me because it 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.360
 tame more easily I will kill 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.720
 this one that was taking him out and well 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.120
 to see if this really does have 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.930
 Anything good if a kitten comes out 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.940
 and I think the kitten is not the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.730
 kitten does not come out we're going to see also 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.010
 the horse I do not know if the horse is healthy 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.110
 but I do not think the horse either 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.270
 can are the maps that are either they are 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.370
 those who occupy least I think that people 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.110
 the wolves as most people like and 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.750
 by the hair are the Sinai so that 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.160
 so take them and well, this is what 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.110
 they assaulted the map as you tell them 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.240
 installed comfort just put in your folder 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.500
 move and your map is inhabited so no 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.760

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.620
