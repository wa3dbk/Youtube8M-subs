00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 hello everyone came again package wrapped 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.539
 pretty little worth 5 dollars 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.119
 rated it at 4 dollars written years 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.740
 exactly at the bathory shorter flashlight without 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.010
 batteries drove somewhere roughly speaking 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.640
 30 for 46 days to 46 days checked 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.859
 the seller 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.270
 decided to check and order from him in 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:39.180
 principle, everything quickly organized let's 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.510
 come off so nice legs forgot forgot 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.590
 legs ordered why this flashlight to me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.730
 there is already such a flashlight 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.300
 but ordered for comparison and verification and 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 can see something somewhere 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.399
 wrong with my flashlight like 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.210
 Remember I had unpacking 3 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.360
 lanterns there was one forehead big and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.789
 little 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.450
 here he is this little let's keep not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.170
 wants to get here and the lantern and chick 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 edge or cry 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.610
 ultrafire 1600 lum here already of course 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 all very different but a little 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.320
 old lantern compare this one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.049
 which came to see the edge of the difference 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.299
 there are small minor 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.290
 even in the same figure if 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.750
 take a closer look on the back side also 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.390
 there are differences on the new already indicated 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.350
 how much lum and nothing on the old 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 indicated by 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.340
 the diode can be seen that there is no copper 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.210
 boards are not special seen on this old 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.979
 very well there are visible problems in this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 lanterns what he started 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.049
 one day devoted normally after the test 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.990
 when he left for the night he began to burn 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.360
 dimly I didnâ€™t do that I rewired everything 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 tried new batteries and no 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 the result as the lights dim and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.970
 shines likely cocoa or so 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.140
 microcircuits there this or the diode itself 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.250
 so ordered from another seller 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.870
 decided to check even if this 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.640
 take on such a dull distance 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.269
 let's check the difference right away 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.170
 but he lights another button here more 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:35.420
 with deep and here is fluted in the old 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.870
 New here is not much that is 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:44.670
 Pak point holes on it so there is no 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.850
 that all these lanterns are different are all made 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.610
 different so ok let's check them out 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.780
 not 1600 years old but naturally these 1600 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.410
 I have no tape and did not smell a maximum of 200 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.989
 at 300 can anyone will issue a pity 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.420
 no device so I would notice this 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.570
 another thing is now compare the battery 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.489
 fully charged battery darker themes 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:15.120
 more I already included it showed how we 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:20.400
 burned there you see that this what 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 luminaries this where different things so don't 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.130
 We know that after all with this flashlight 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:33.620
 old well shorter will only spare 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:36.150
 diode more precisely idiot body so diodes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.760
 identical when compared but there 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.030
 a little slow and visible plate 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:47.890
 there is a better build 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:50.890
 Well, here are the tricks so great 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.660
 shines so here are such pies 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.190
 ssylochku seller certainly throw off under 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.959
 video, you can buy there four 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.700
 odd dollars and he does n't even make it 5 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.739
 so if you liked the video 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.850
 write comments be sure to put 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.959
 likes share this video with friends and 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.959
 thank you all for watching
