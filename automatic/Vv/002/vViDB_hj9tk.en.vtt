00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500 
um when I was in my econ class a while
back<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.680> were<00:02:16.830> talking<00:02:17.190> about<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.849> story

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
back we were talking about a story

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.140 
back we were talking about a story
called<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.080> red<00:02:19.530> paperclip<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.459> which<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.060> guy

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
called the red paperclip and which a guy

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.140 
called the red paperclip and which a guy
took<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.360> red<00:02:21.540> paperclip<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.140> bartered<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.860> and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
took a red paperclip and bartered it and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.820 
took a red paperclip and bartered it and
he<00:02:24.150> went<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.780> he<00:02:24.989> just<00:02:25.140> traded<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.560> item

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
he went like he just traded like item

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.100 
he went like he just traded like item
for<00:02:26.010> item<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.790> he<00:02:26.880> traded<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.450> paper<00:02:27.840> clip

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
for item and so he traded the paper clip

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.040 
for item and so he traded the paper clip
for<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.319> pen<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.830> pen<00:02:29.010> for<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.370> doorknob<00:02:29.989> etc<00:02:30.989> etc

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
for a pen the pen for a doorknob etc etc

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.740 
for a pen the pen for a doorknob etc etc
etc<00:02:31.380> until<00:02:31.860> he<00:02:32.160> eventually<00:02:32.250> got<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.940> house<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
etc until he eventually got a house and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.339 
etc until he eventually got a house and
so<00:02:34.739> when<00:02:34.920> basically<00:02:35.730> he<00:02:36.180> traded<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.690> red

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
so when basically he traded a red

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.350 
so when basically he traded a red
paperclip<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.670> normal<00:02:38.849> paper<00:02:39.090> clipped

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
paperclip just a normal paper clipped

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.140 
paperclip just a normal paper clipped
for<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.930> house<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.220> inspired<00:02:41.700> me<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.940> do

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
for a house and that inspired me to do

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.790 
for a house and that inspired me to do
something<00:02:42.360> very<00:02:42.510> very<00:02:42.930> similar<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.380> that<00:02:43.590> on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
something very very similar to that on

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.150 
something very very similar to that on
runescape<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.819> make<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> video<00:02:46.049> it'll<00:02:47.010> take

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
runescape and make it a video it'll take

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.090 
runescape and make it a video it'll take
a<00:02:47.190> long<00:02:47.370> time<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.170> can<00:02:49.319> do<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.440> um

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
a long time but I I think I can do it um

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.140 
a long time but I I think I can do it um
I<00:02:51.049> start<00:02:52.049> with<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.470> simple<00:02:53.069> cabbage<00:02:53.519> I'm
