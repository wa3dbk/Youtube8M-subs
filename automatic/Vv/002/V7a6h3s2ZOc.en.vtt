00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
again it still does the thing where it

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.110 
again it still does the thing where it
hijacks<00:05:35.900> your<00:05:36.050> screen<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.650> everything<00:05:37.120> in

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
fact I think I have to kill up the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.920 
fact I think I have to kill up the
control-alt-delete<00:05:40.510> there<00:05:41.510> you<00:05:41.570> go

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
control-alt-delete there you go

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.020

don't<00:05:42.470> Lee<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.740> an<00:05:42.919> amazing<00:05:43.310> amount<00:05:43.550> of<00:05:43.580> CPU

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
don't Lee is an amazing amount of CPU

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.240 
don't Lee is an amazing amount of CPU
for<00:05:44.240> some<00:05:44.390> reason<00:05:46.510> but<00:05:47.510> whatever<00:05:47.960> at<00:05:48.919> least<00:05:49.070> it

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
for some reason but whatever at least it

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.420 
for some reason but whatever at least it
doesn't<00:05:49.460> create<00:05:50.360> random<00:05:51.229> files<00:05:51.800> even<00:05:52.340> if

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
doesn't create random files even if

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.920 
doesn't create random files even if
you're<00:05:52.520> trying<00:05:52.669> to<00:05:52.790> be<00:05:52.880> spooky<00:05:53.330> that<00:05:53.690> just

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
you're trying to be spooky that just

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.590 
you're trying to be spooky that just
makes<00:05:54.110> people<00:05:54.260> think<00:05:54.410> yourself<00:05:54.950> as<00:05:55.040> a<00:05:55.070> virus

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
makes people think yourself as a virus

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.670 
makes people think yourself as a virus
that's<00:05:56.600> initially<00:05:56.810> what<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.200> thought<00:05:57.440> this

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
that's initially what I thought this

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.040 
that's initially what I thought this
thing<00:05:57.860> was<00:05:58.070> at<00:05:58.520> least<00:05:59.030> that's<00:05:59.270> what<00:05:59.450> you<00:05:59.900> know

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
thing was at least that's what you know

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.460 
thing was at least that's what you know
my<00:06:00.590> first<00:06:01.130> impression<00:06:01.640> of<00:06:01.729> it<00:06:01.880> was<00:06:02.290> so<00:06:03.290> don't

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
my first impression of it was so don't

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.400 
my first impression of it was so don't
do<00:06:03.560> that<00:06:03.590> it's<00:06:03.979> just<00:06:04.190> um
