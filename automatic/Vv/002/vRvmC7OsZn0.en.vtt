00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.250
 in this video we will see how it is possible 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.459
 manage absences through the area 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.830
 teacher of the electronic cloud register 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:16.500
 absences can be managed from 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 recommended class registers precisely 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.690
 for work in the classroom or from the menu 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 absences that can be reached either 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.790
 through the least kept to absences 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.220
 management by date and through the icon 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:40.350
 always absent clicking the icon 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:42.629
 management by date the screen yes 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.050
 presents in the following world at the top a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.640
 left the month in which we are immediately 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.679
 we can have the possibility of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 move on the current week day 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.999
 current or current month to have a 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.359
 different visualization that facilitates us 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:00.059
 the work below we all have 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.409
 months of the school year so as to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.320
 we can move a lot here too 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.750
 Quick keys to go quickly 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.220
 to the previous month to the following month if 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 we are in the visualization for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.050
 month if we find ourselves instead for example 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.110
 in the week view 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.990
 current 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.880
 we will see immediately below the buttons for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.760
 move fast in the weeks 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.830
 previous and next the button for 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.830
 return to the current month directly 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.469
 in the table below we see in the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.240
 column all pupils in the class 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:47.539
 in the horizontal re every day of the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.090
 month you can click the s 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.310
 above a week to enter 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.530
 in that specific week or click 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.819
 the number of the day to enter the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.450
 display for that day 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.189
 specific we see the symbolism that 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.250
 reports the electronic cloud register 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:08.530
 the r clearly stands for such a delay 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.750
 as the or for the exit the for an absence 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.239
 the or we find it if the school uses 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.099
 for another activity it could be 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.360
 a sport activity rather than one 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.849
 justified stage versailles are 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 connoted in green with the addition of a 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:30.799
 jeep how to allow an absence is 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.760
 need to click on the box where 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.760
 we see the blue ball 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.849
 we will see immediately returned to the screen 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.670
 of insertion where we see 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.319
 the author we are the teacher that we insert 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.590
 this absence is the only one we have 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 selected date we can choose 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.880
 the type of essence absence if 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.150
 clearly a guy in the morning 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.790
 school delay if the pupil is entering 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.220
 late exit if the student leaves first 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.620
 of the lesson time delay exits yes 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.120
 start co- presence between a delay and then 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.130
 exit or vice versa 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.700
 other activity we talked about 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 first if the moon is absent for reasons that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 reported as other activities such as 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.430
 could be a sports activity or 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.190
 a training internship maybe we have others 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.109
 fields the entry time was successful e 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.340
 use for the delay is successful 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:31.099
 annotations to write something 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.900
 on the item we are entering e 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.519
 other data such as those of 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.040
 justification and documentation 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:42.769
 which we will see later in this video 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.709
 we save in our table we will see 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.930
 appear one in red on the day 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:53.870
 we put the absence for the boy 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.459
 here it is now we assume two cases there 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.739
 we are wrong we put it 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.760
 information on the wrong day or if 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.910
 the wrong pupil we can click e 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.920
 to say is not an absence because you are a boy 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.660
 actually present therefore this 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.620
 voice presence only serves to eliminate 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:23.270
 the wrong information we have 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:26.389
 inserted we save indeed we do not see 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:30.440
 plus the absence of the essences put into it 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:34.340
 screen all the teachers are shared 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.650
 for which the work must be done only by 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.270
 teachers of the first hour the teachers 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.949
 customer have subsequently yes 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.740
 they already find the situation ready 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:48.380
 intervene if only if there are gods 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:52.660
 changes for example the boy is 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.660
 absent the first hour is late 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.220
 let's change the absence late 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:03.080
 entry time in hours and minutes 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.560
 because we will need it for the calculation of 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.560
 hours of absence 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.890
 we have transformed absence into a 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.710
 delay beyond that can also 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:28.410
 justify or document absences 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.170
 to do this you can proceed in two 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.560
 ways or click on the item then 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.830
 on absence and enter information 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.780
 therefore justifies the date on which it leads 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.790
 the justification if you want are not 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:49.470
 mandatory fields would be sufficient to check 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:52.530
 su justified wanting the type then 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.290
 the reason for the justification reasons 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.360
 of family as well as for the 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.370
 documentation and documentation is needed 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:05.610
 in order not to include that absence in the 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:07.740
 calculation of the final hours can be put 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.230
 so always check it if you want the date 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.480
 in which the documentation is the 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.960
 for example medical certificate 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:21.450
 so what kind of document does it bring for 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:24.320
 that justification we save we have 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.320
 justified 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.170
 the absence will also appear an asterisk 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.400
 because besides justifying it, we have it 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:38.310
 also documented as well as from this 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.720
 screen you can justify absences 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.640
 or document from the symbols present at 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.700
 alongside the name of the pupil they report 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.490
 the absences to justify for example 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.860
 we see that the black student federico a si 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.660
 is to justify both delays to 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.660
 justify if justified rita of 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.480
 otherwise you will not see this symbol 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:03.360
 and there are absences to be documented 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.970
 of the delays to be documented 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.590
 while for the gray pupil Zenabo is not there 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.480
 absolutely no delay in 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.440
 an absence neither to be documented nor to be 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.630
 justify then to justify is 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.270
 need to click on absence 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:22.980
 to justify we will enter into the 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.590
 special function for the 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.050
 justifications that we recommend in 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.420
 how much faster it can be 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.300
 tick off always enter 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:36.960
 the date and which bears justifies the 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:39.210
 reason if you want if there are more e 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.440
 without justifying using this 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.669
 check next to the heading 

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.580
 select everything allows us to 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:49.350
 justify multiple essences the same 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.860
 settings apply to the 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.860
 documentation 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:01.820
 as you see also this essence is 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:04.090
 become green with the addition of 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.090
 cim
