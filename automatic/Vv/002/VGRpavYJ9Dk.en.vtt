 with them a lot and bad 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.920
 if you analyze we have our shopping carts we would see that we filled with 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.420
 foods rich in carbohydrates proteins and lipids that our 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.249
 organism does not spend 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.230
 It is a great energy contribution for our body and sedentary life 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.250
 that we carry the most makes us not all that energy 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.369
 for the first time in history in the western world there are more people with 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 overweight problems that people in your case 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.980
 America is already a classic of obesity 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.150
 60 percent are overweight and 31 are obese 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.580
 They eat a lot badly and have little exercise 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.370
 that is the american way of the five and globalization has made it spread 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.370
 all over the planet 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.020
 in Spain obesity is a problem according to public authorities 15% 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.580
 of Spaniards are obese 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.810
 if we also add the people who are overweight it turns out that more than half 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.810
 of the Spaniards eat others 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.130
 and the worst of all is that we are incubating obese 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.700
 Spain is the European country with the most obese children with 16% 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.380
 in your diet and too many fats few vegetables and fruits and especially eat 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.420
 a lot between meals 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340
 the bugs and poultry are his downfall and instead of veraguas take 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.370
 sugary refreshing drinks 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.510
 an example let's review the life of a 10-year-old child 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 need a day about 2 thousand 200 kilocalories imagine that take 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.510
 a can of soda that are 130 kilos calories 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.560
 a croissant with a contribution of 300 kilocalories a judge appetizer 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.880
 small with 200 kilocalories and a handful of sweets with 120 kilos 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.940
 calories 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.160
 In total it will have taken 750 kilos calories a third of what 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
 you need a day and you still have to add the remains of food 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.370
 if every day he takes this for sure he will have plenty of kilocalories 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.310
 surely they do not get to burn because today children are 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.780
 increasingly quiet 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.979
 they spend so hours in front of the TV and the computer without moving 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.199
 and you can say that the TV fattening 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.319
 We are also exporting this lifestyle to countries in the process of 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.509
 developing 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:20.489
 it's an irony 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.810
 but as they struggle to end hunger at the same time they face 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.810
 obesity opposite problem 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.169
 more and more people live in cities because the countryside can not earn the 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.269
 lifetime 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.560
 komen the same fatty food as the exacting of the same drinks 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.629
 sweetened because it is also fashionable 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.629
 they have also become as sedentary as we are 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.560
 It is estimated that in less developed countries there could be neither more nor 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.559
 less than about 115 million obese 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.079
 and the worst is that obesity is another model of malnutrition 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.779
 although some poor people are overweight that does not mean that 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.379
 are better fed obesity often covers consumption deficiencies 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.379
 of vitamins and minerals 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:15.619
 taking stock the statistics say that in the world there are so many people that 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:17.959
 they go hungry like overweight people 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.190
 a billion people go hungry 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.720
 another billion are overweight and 300 million are obese 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.879
 they are figures to reflect
