flatland<00:00:09.500> BMX<00:00:09.889> came<00:00:10.219> from<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:11.030> US<00:00:11.349> so<00:00:12.349> there's

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
flatland BMX came from the US so there's

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.129 
flatland BMX came from the US so there's
a<00:00:12.530> group<00:00:12.740> of<00:00:12.940> break-dances<00:00:13.969> who<00:00:14.660> decided<00:00:15.019> to

a group of break-dances who decided to

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.980 
a group of break-dances who decided to
take<00:00:15.230> up<00:00:15.500> BMX<00:00:15.860> riding<00:00:16.210> and<00:00:17.210> then<00:00:17.330> since<00:00:17.779> then

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
take up BMX riding and then since then

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.109 
take up BMX riding and then since then
it's<00:00:18.169> just<00:00:18.380> grown<00:00:18.619> even<00:00:18.770> bigger<00:00:18.919> there's<00:00:19.790> it's

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
it's just grown even bigger there's it's

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.269 
it's just grown even bigger there's it's
flatland<00:00:20.599> still<00:00:20.930> probably<00:00:21.200> kind<00:00:21.560> of<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.009> rare

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
flatland still probably kind of the rare

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.490 
flatland still probably kind of the rare
discipline<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.300> BMX<00:00:23.599> because<00:00:23.930> it's<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:24.230> hard

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
discipline and BMX because it's so hard

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.710 
discipline and BMX because it's so hard
to<00:00:24.590> do<00:00:25.090> you<00:00:26.090> have<00:00:26.180> to<00:00:26.300> kind<00:00:26.509> of<00:00:26.570> keep

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
to do you have to kind of keep

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.900 
to do you have to kind of keep
practicing<00:00:27.259> all<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.470> time<00:00:27.710> you<00:00:28.520> can't<00:00:28.759> really

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
practicing all the time you can't really

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.790 
practicing all the time you can't really
kind<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.300> be<00:00:29.630> off<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.899> bike<00:00:30.079> for<00:00:30.349> like<00:00:30.470> a<00:00:30.500> long

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
kind of be off the bike for like a long

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.830 
kind of be off the bike for like a long
period<00:00:31.309> of<00:00:31.369> time<00:00:31.579> otherwise<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.390> lose<00:00:32.660> your

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
period of time otherwise you lose your

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:45.580 
period of time otherwise you lose your
tricks<00:00:43.240> so<00:00:44.240> this<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.510> flatland<00:00:44.990> BMX<00:00:45.350> bike

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
tricks so this is a flatland BMX bike

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.890 
tricks so this is a flatland BMX bike
I've<00:00:46.490> done<00:00:46.700> a<00:00:46.730> few<00:00:46.910> little<00:00:47.090> twists<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.750> it

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
I've done a few little twists to it

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.830 
I've done a few little twists to it
myself<00:00:48.490> so<00:00:49.490> for<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:49.730> own<00:00:49.760> style<00:00:50.180> my<00:00:50.510> own<00:00:50.540> riding

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
myself so for my own style my own riding

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.900 
myself so for my own style my own riding
I've<00:00:51.680> cut<00:00:51.890> down<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.190> seat<00:00:52.400> so<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.670> just<00:00:52.820> allows

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
I've cut down the seat so it just allows

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.729 
I've cut down the seat so it just allows
me<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:53.510> move<00:00:53.660> around<00:00:53.810> the<00:00:54.020> bike<00:00:54.230> a<00:00:54.260> little<00:00:54.620> bit

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
me to move around the bike a little bit

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.380 
me to move around the bike a little bit
easier<00:00:55.239> I'm<00:00:56.239> also<00:00:56.480> running<00:00:57.290> no<00:00:58.130> breaks<00:00:58.430> just

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
easier I'm also running no breaks just

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.970 
easier I'm also running no breaks just
because<00:00:59.690> I<00:00:59.960> wanted<00:01:00.260> to<00:01:00.320> be<00:01:00.560> a<00:01:00.590> little<00:01:00.710> bit<00:01:00.890> more

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
because I wanted to be a little bit more

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.560 
because I wanted to be a little bit more
challenging<00:01:01.520> for<00:01:01.550> myself<00:01:02.000> whilst<00:01:02.239> learning

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
challenging for myself whilst learning

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.999 
challenging for myself whilst learning
tricks<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:04.100> tires<00:01:04.339> I've<00:01:05.299> got<00:01:05.509> 120<00:01:06.320> psi<00:01:06.860> and

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
tricks the tires I've got 120 psi and

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:08.380 
tricks the tires I've got 120 psi and
the<00:01:07.100> tires<00:01:07.340> there's<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.700> lot<00:01:07.909> of<00:01:08.000> pressure<00:01:08.240> in

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
the tires there's a lot of pressure in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.120 
the tires there's a lot of pressure in
there<00:01:08.600> but<00:01:08.750> it<00:01:08.810> makes<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.110> easier<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.500> walk<00:01:09.799> you

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
there but it makes it easier to walk you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.080 
there but it makes it easier to walk you
in<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.549> 19<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.869> 9<00:01:12.079> on<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.320> back

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
in is a 19 and it's a 9 on the back

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.270 
in is a 19 and it's a 9 on the back
don't<00:01:14.090> really<00:01:14.270> need<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.479> much<00:01:14.780> speed<00:01:15.280> the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
don't really need that much speed the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.800 
don't really need that much speed the
sprockets<00:01:16.729> small<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.359> doesn't<00:01:17.600> get<00:01:17.689> in<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
sprockets small so it doesn't get in the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.300 
sprockets small so it doesn't get in the
way<00:01:17.899> whilst<00:01:18.289> I'm<00:01:18.469> doing<00:01:18.499> tricks<00:01:18.979> it's<00:01:19.189> got

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
way whilst I'm doing tricks it's got

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.039 
way whilst I'm doing tricks it's got
some<00:01:19.490> pegs<00:01:19.819> as<00:01:20.060> well<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.569> pegs<00:01:20.810> are

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
some pegs as well so the pegs are

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.749 
some pegs as well so the pegs are
basically<00:01:21.439> they're<00:01:22.009> metal<00:01:22.340> but<00:01:22.490> they've<00:01:22.579> got

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
basically they're metal but they've got

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.340 
basically they're metal but they've got
plastic<00:01:23.149> caps<00:01:23.479> at<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.689> end<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.109> allows<00:01:24.319> me

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
plastic caps at the end so it allows me

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.639 
plastic caps at the end so it allows me
to<00:01:24.619> pivot<00:01:24.829> just<00:01:25.459> running<00:01:25.759> tape<00:01:26.329> grip<00:01:26.630> just<00:01:27.590> so

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
to pivot just running tape grip just so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:28.959 
to pivot just running tape grip just so
I<00:01:27.679> can<00:01:27.889> feel<00:01:28.039> the<00:01:28.130> handlebars<00:01:28.549> a<00:01:28.670> little<00:01:28.880> bit

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
I can feel the handlebars a little bit

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.940 
I can feel the handlebars a little bit
better<00:01:29.259> flatland<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:30.289> all<00:01:30.439> about<00:01:30.649> basically

better flatland is all about basically

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.149 
better flatland is all about basically
make<00:01:31.189> it<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.670> bike<00:01:31.909> as<00:01:32.179> light<00:01:32.479> as<00:01:32.600> possible<00:01:33.159> so

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
make it the bike as light as possible so

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.920 
make it the bike as light as possible so
it's<00:01:34.310> easier<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.789> move<00:01:35.030> around
