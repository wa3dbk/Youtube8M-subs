00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
hi everyone this is Shannon with

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.419 
hi everyone this is Shannon with
thermaltake<00:00:07.200> and<00:00:07.379> today<00:00:07.890> we're<00:00:08.069> taking<00:00:08.189> a

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
thermaltake and today we're taking a

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.000 
thermaltake and today we're taking a
look<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.820> newest<00:00:09.300> core<00:00:09.840> V<00:00:10.290> Series<00:00:10.530> chassis

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
look at the newest core V Series chassis

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.240 
look at the newest core V Series chassis
the<00:00:11.429> V<00:00:11.790> 21<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.259> another<00:00:13.590> cubical<00:00:14.040> chassis

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the V 21 this is another cubical chassis

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.970 
the V 21 this is another cubical chassis
like<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:14.580> saw<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> v1<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:16.379> instead<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
like we saw with the v1 but instead this

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.500 
like we saw with the v1 but instead this
one<00:00:17.160> supports<00:00:17.490> micro<00:00:17.850> ATX<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.420> other

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
one supports micro ATX with the other

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.019 
one supports micro ATX with the other
one<00:00:18.630> supported<00:00:19.050> mini<00:00:19.410> ITX<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.670> let's<00:00:20.820> go<00:00:20.910> ahead

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
one supported mini ITX so let's go ahead

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.340 
one supported mini ITX so let's go ahead
and<00:00:21.119> dig<00:00:21.270> into<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> specs<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> see<00:00:22.080> exactly

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and dig into the specs and see exactly

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.630 
and dig into the specs and see exactly
what<00:00:22.500> makes<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:22.890> thing<00:00:23.039> awesome<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.580> your

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
what makes this thing awesome for your

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
what makes this thing awesome for your
next<00:00:23.820> micro<00:00:24.150> ATX<00:00:24.210> build<00:00:24.740> okay<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.220> have

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
next micro ATX build okay now do we have

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.099 
next micro ATX build okay now do we have
it<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.640> box<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.960> we're

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it out of the box the first thing we're

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
it out of the box the first thing we're
gonna<00:00:28.170> look<00:00:28.289> at<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> core<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> e21<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:30.090> have

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
gonna look at is the core of e21 we have

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
gonna look at is the core of e21 we have
some<00:00:30.359> special<00:00:30.720> features<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.320> built<00:00:31.560> into<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
some special features we built into the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
some special features we built into the
front<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.579> chassis<00:00:33.030> first<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:34.079> you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
front of this chassis first of all you

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.959 
front of this chassis first of all you
can<00:00:34.680> see<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> logo<00:00:35.340> looks<00:00:35.520> quite<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> bit

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
can see that the logo looks quite a bit

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
can see that the logo looks quite a bit
different<00:00:36.200> because<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.380> magnetic<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
different because it's magnetic so it

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
different because it's magnetic so it
can<00:00:38.610> actually<00:00:38.760> switch<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.170> decide<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.500> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
can actually switch if you decide on a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
can actually switch if you decide on a
horizontal<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.550> vertical<00:00:41.579> motherboard

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
horizontal or a vertical motherboard

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
horizontal or a vertical motherboard
installation<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:44.370> allows<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.879> fully

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
installation that allows it to fully

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
installation that allows it to fully
flip<00:00:45.510> another<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.160> side<00:00:47.579> panel

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
flip another thing is the side panel

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.029 
flip another thing is the side panel
connections<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> front<00:00:49.410> panel<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:49.860> you'd

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
connections or the front panel as you'd

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.510 
connections or the front panel as you'd
call<00:00:50.219> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
call it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
call it
it's<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> side<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> chassis<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
it's right on the side of the chassis it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.310 
it's right on the side of the chassis it
has<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:52.770> hard<00:00:53.039> drive<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> power<00:00:54.090> LEDs<00:00:54.539> your

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
has your hard drive and power LEDs your

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.430 
has your hard drive and power LEDs your
power<00:00:55.530> button<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.699> dual<00:00:56.969> USB<00:00:57.270> 3.0<00:00:58.020> ports

then<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.440> your<00:01:01.649> reset<00:01:01.770> button<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.370> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
then you have your reset button and this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.969 
then you have your reset button and this
can<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.390> change<00:01:03.690> location<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.799> better

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
can actually change location to better

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.859 
can actually change location to better
match<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> flip<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.939> chassis<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.780> be

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
match as you flip the chassis will be

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.030 
match as you flip the chassis will be
showing<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.320> once<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.650> pull<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> front

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
showing you that once we pull the front

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.260 
showing you that once we pull the front
panel<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.670> let's<00:01:08.820> go<00:01:08.909> ahead<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.240> a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
panel off so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.359 
panel off so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:09.479> with<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.780> front<00:01:09.960> panel<00:01:10.140> removed<00:01:10.590> okay

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
look with that front panel removed okay

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.440 
look with that front panel removed okay
and<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> front<00:01:12.030> panel<00:01:12.360> off

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and now that we have the front panel off

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.910 
and now that we have the front panel off
first<00:01:12.750> thing<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> show<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.530> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
first thing I want to show you is we

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
first thing I want to show you is we
have<00:01:14.040> some<00:01:14.189> foam<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.729> that's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
have some foam here that's just like you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
have some foam here that's just like you
saw<00:01:15.720> before<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:16.470> basically<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:16.890> uses<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
saw before it basically just uses as a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.179 
saw before it basically just uses as a
ventilation<00:01:18.360> medium<00:01:19.080> basically<00:01:19.619> filters

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
ventilation medium basically filters

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.280 
ventilation medium basically filters
over<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.820> ventilation<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> keeps<00:01:22.020> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
over out your ventilation and keeps the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
over out your ventilation and keeps the
dust<00:01:22.470> mostly<00:01:23.009> out<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.340> system<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.090> just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
dust mostly out of your system and just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.429 
dust mostly out of your system and just
makes<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> much<00:01:24.659> easier<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:24.960> maintenance

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
makes it much easier for maintenance

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.070 
makes it much easier for maintenance
then<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:27.240> gives<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then we have what gives you a lot of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.210 
then we have what gives you a lot of
your<00:01:28.259> ventilation<00:01:28.530> which<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> 200

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
your ventilation which is a 200

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.039 
your ventilation which is a 200
millimeter<00:01:29.549> front<00:01:29.820> mounted<00:01:30.060> fan<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
millimeter front mounted fan this can of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
millimeter front mounted fan this can of
course<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.439> pulled<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.430> did<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
course be pulled just like we did on the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.429 
course be pulled just like we did on the
other<00:01:32.820> chassis<00:01:33.299> where<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> fit

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
other chassis where you can fit

the<00:03:09.280> chassis<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:09.760> can<00:03:10.270> see<00:03:10.420> there's<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> lot<00:03:10.870> of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
the chassis you can see there's a lot of

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.110 
the chassis you can see there's a lot of
open<00:03:11.140> area<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.650> work<00:03:11.800> now<00:03:12.430> comes<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.790> really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
open area to work now comes a really

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.400 
open area to work now comes a really
cool<00:03:13.480> part<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.750> want<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> show<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.080> which<00:03:14.260> is

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
cool part I want to show you which is

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.080 
cool part I want to show you which is
how<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:14.890> came<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.250> with<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.490> solution<00:03:15.670> for

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
how we came up with a solution for

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.910 
how we came up with a solution for
mounting<00:03:16.300> fans<00:03:16.600> or<00:03:16.810> radiators<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:17.500> let's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
mounting fans or radiators so let's

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.280 
mounting fans or radiators so let's
check<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.250> out<00:03:18.310> right<00:03:18.430> now

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
check that out right now

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.870 
check that out right now
okay<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:20.440> for<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.650> V<00:03:20.860> 21<00:03:21.400> like<00:03:21.550> we<00:03:21.670> said

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
okay now for the V 21 like we said

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.400 
okay now for the V 21 like we said
before<00:03:21.910> we've<00:03:22.390> wanted<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.840> make<00:03:23.080> sure<00:03:23.110> this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
before we've wanted to make sure this

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.990 
before we've wanted to make sure this
was<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.650> truly<00:03:23.920> versatile<00:03:24.490> option<00:03:24.850> whether

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
was a truly versatile option whether

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.220 
was a truly versatile option whether
you're<00:03:25.210> talking<00:03:25.420> vertical<00:03:26.080> or<00:03:26.200> horizontal

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
you're talking vertical or horizontal

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.230 
you're talking vertical or horizontal

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
radiator mounting so what we did here

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.080 
radiator mounting so what we did here
was<00:03:32.620> we<00:03:32.650> actually<00:03:33.100> gave<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.370> modular<00:03:33.820> rails

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
was we actually gave you modular rails

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.140 
was we actually gave you modular rails
for<00:03:34.720> the<00:03:34.750> radiator<00:03:35.110> fan<00:03:35.380> mounting<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:37.030> that

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
for the radiator fan mounting so that

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.510 
for the radiator fan mounting so that
you<00:03:37.240> can<00:03:37.390> pull<00:03:37.570> them<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:38.280> mount<00:03:39.280> them

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
you can pull them out mount them

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
you can pull them out mount them
wherever<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.970> need<00:03:41.970> snap<00:03:42.970> them<00:03:43.150> into<00:03:43.270> place

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
wherever you need snap them into place

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.740 
wherever you need snap them into place
and<00:03:44.610> this<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.790> actually<00:03:45.820> be<00:03:46.120> adjusted<00:03:46.720> so

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
and this can actually be adjusted so

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.590 
and this can actually be adjusted so
multiple<00:03:47.410> cutouts<00:03:47.800> that<00:03:48.100> will<00:03:48.730> give<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.150> the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
multiple cutouts that will give you the

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.200 
multiple cutouts that will give you the
distance<00:03:49.960> whether<00:03:50.260> you're<00:03:50.470> doing<00:03:50.650> 120<00:03:51.250> 140<00:03:52.000> or

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.800 
and you can see there's multiple holes
along<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.520> way<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.240> can<00:04:47.270> position<00:04:47.570> them

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
along the way so you can position them

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.800 
along the way so you can position them
however<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.200> like<00:04:51.100> place<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.280> screw<00:04:52.810> and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
however you like place the screw and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.720 
however you like place the screw and
it's<00:04:53.960> pretty<00:04:54.140> solid<00:04:54.380> in<00:04:54.620> place<00:04:54.950> now<00:04:55.550> there's

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
it's pretty solid in place now there's

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.980 
it's pretty solid in place now there's
another<00:04:56.000> thing<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.300> note<00:04:56.420> when<00:04:56.540> we're<00:04:56.720> looking

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
another thing to note when we're looking

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.460 
another thing to note when we're looking
in<00:04:57.110> here<00:04:57.290> you<00:04:57.770> have<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.920> huge<00:04:58.720> CPU<00:04:59.720> cutout<00:05:00.110> so

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
in here you have a huge CPU cutout so

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.560 
in here you have a huge CPU cutout so
that<00:05:00.620> before<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:00.980> install<00:05:01.130> your<00:05:01.460> PSU<00:05:01.880> you<00:05:02.390> can

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
that before you install your PSU you can

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.670 
that before you install your PSU you can
actually<00:05:02.720> install<00:05:03.020> your<00:05:03.290> cooling<00:05:03.590> your

a pastor for cabling or water cooling
and<00:05:19.640> also<00:05:19.970> another<00:05:20.360> really<00:05:20.750> cool<00:05:20.900> feature

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
and also another really cool feature

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.770 
and also another really cool feature
we're<00:05:21.320> gonna<00:05:21.410> take<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.680> look<00:05:21.950> at<00:05:22.070> right<00:05:22.310> now<00:05:22.780> and

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
we're gonna take a look at right now and

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.210 
we're gonna take a look at right now and
I<00:05:23.870> think<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.169> final<00:05:24.530> feature<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.980> kind<00:05:25.160> of

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
I think the final feature to kind of

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.280 
I think the final feature to kind of
round<00:05:25.520> out<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:25.790> v21<00:05:26.240> would<00:05:26.930> be<00:05:27.050> something

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
round out the v21 would be something

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.290 
round out the v21 would be something
really<00:05:27.710> special<00:05:28.040> we<00:05:28.430> wanted<00:05:28.730> to<00:05:28.850> do<00:05:29.000> with<00:05:29.120> this

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
really special we wanted to do with this

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.300 
really special we wanted to do with this
chassis<00:05:29.750> and<00:05:29.930> that's<00:05:30.380> these<00:05:30.770> holes<00:05:31.040> you<00:05:31.190> can

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
chassis and that's these holes you can

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.220 
chassis and that's these holes you can
see<00:05:31.460> along<00:05:31.669> here<00:05:31.730> where<00:05:32.419> basically<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:33.050> allows

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
see along here where basically it allows

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.880 
see along here where basically it allows
us<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.590> stack<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.850> v21<00:05:35.600> chassis<00:05:36.020> together<00:05:36.230> so

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
us to stack the v21 chassis together so

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.470 
us to stack the v21 chassis together so
that<00:05:37.010> you<00:05:37.100> can<00:05:37.250> have<00:05:37.430> let's<00:05:37.790> say<00:05:37.940> water

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
that you can have let's say water

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.450 
that you can have let's say water
cooling<00:05:38.780> loop<00:05:38.930> built<00:05:39.169> into<00:05:39.470> one<00:05:39.740> basically

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
cooling loop built into one basically

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.340 
cooling loop built into one basically
like<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.669> water<00:05:40.880> box<00:05:41.150> sitting<00:05:41.390> right<00:05:41.690> above<00:05:42.020> or

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
like a water box sitting right above or

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.320 
like a water box sitting right above or
below<00:05:42.560> your<00:05:42.650> system<00:05:43.160> just<00:05:43.340> feeding<00:05:44.090> your

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
below your system just feeding your

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.600 
below your system just feeding your
liquid<00:05:44.600> cooling<00:05:44.930> so<00:05:45.350> you<00:05:45.410> can<00:05:45.620> have<00:05:45.800> a<00:05:46.010> massive

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
liquid cooling so you can have a massive

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.909 
liquid cooling so you can have a massive
cool<00:05:46.880> system<00:05:47.240> here<00:05:47.540> while<00:05:48.080> not<00:05:48.260> trying<00:05:48.830> to

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
cool system here while not trying to

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.350 
cool system here while not trying to
shove<00:05:49.370> all<00:05:49.669> of<00:05:49.790> your<00:05:49.910> liquid<00:05:50.030> cooling

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
shove all of your liquid cooling

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.030 
shove all of your liquid cooling
components<00:05:50.450> into<00:05:50.870> one<00:05:50.990> key<00:05:51.169> area<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.890> can

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
components into one key area you can

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.710 
components into one key area you can
actually<00:05:52.160> have<00:05:52.430> an<00:05:52.520> area<00:05:52.729> above<00:05:53.000> it<00:05:53.180> you<00:05:53.570> can

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
actually have an area above it you can

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.510 
actually have an area above it you can
have<00:05:53.810> an<00:05:53.900> area<00:05:54.080> with<00:05:54.229> extra<00:05:54.500> hard<00:05:54.710> drives<00:05:54.979> even

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
have an area with extra hard drives even

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.400 
have an area with extra hard drives even
two<00:05:55.700> systems<00:05:56.120> stock<00:05:56.390> together<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:56.990> they<00:05:57.260> can

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
two systems stock together and they can

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.630 
two systems stock together and they can
be<00:05:57.500> attached<00:05:57.860> so<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:58.130> when<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:58.310> lift<00:05:58.520> them

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
be attached so that when you lift them

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.630 
be attached so that when you lift them
they're<00:05:59.120> all<00:05:59.360> basically<00:06:00.229> one<00:06:00.740> modular<00:06:01.280> unit

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
they're all basically one modular unit
