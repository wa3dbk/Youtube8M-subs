00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.060
 welcome back 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.710
 now is going through with Spanish Italian and gravel failure three 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.160
 high hopes continue to go lonely bit on the daughter and 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.239
 look what else could it do 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.710
 a relatively large complex of sensors is expected is still four jumpers 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.749
 game 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.259
 Doctors her bedding that both sides are out their jumpers all four 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.259
 Springer game Patrick Springer c3 Sprenger as 6 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.229
 and here there are very different depending on the fourth white addiction 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 approaches 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 In this chapter we are dealing with the so-called Scottish 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.400
 Four-in-hand game 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.140
 based on that the white hereby continues the four 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
 what is the 4 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 because I'm not so happy for runner b4 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.230
 Nigrelli is the 4th 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.360
 the raid that Springer simply the 4 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.870
 March, SEMA show wet weather even from gravel city 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.370
 can then arise, the four plays 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.730
 the four jumpers simply beat the four-in-hand 6 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.000
 March not Sprenger plain c6 but Sprenger c2 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 and because the same position 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.990
 In the classic four-in-hand step-by-step the Spenger joins three Springer 6s 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 the theory is steady 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.150
 Although not really forced again increasing may also be the train Spenger 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.690
 Phone try 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.410
 I've thought about what I think Danny Granger Gambit calls himself that's me 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.310
 not quite sure 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.260
 Room difficult to believe the names of all this al-ko stretched gambit smog 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.860
 that is the Belgrade 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
 "Four jumpers simply g4s too risky for my notions after-runner has c4 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.100
 white big development advantage for the farmers 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.750
 and that can be dangerous 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.820
 I think the best is the simple runner after the 7er just the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.200
 Continue development Rochade 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.460
 and then have a look and what questions 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.600
 Gummersbach's been with a jumper one instead SID me here too 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.260
 develop or the bond should also 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.360
 the raid tore four runners after the 4th 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910
 the 6th 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.200
 and now Springer simply the 4 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 Blackrock becomes 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.549
 Sprenger is her seven children always lady is the seven or black 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.669
 Rescue lead becomes too big 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.849
 the twitched which equally plays with me once with black 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.199
 the wheel has it just so Sprenger to b 5 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:18.309
 and at 10 7 percent 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:22.379
 but now simply Springer the 50 of the stands by Springer e5 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:25.359
 and Schwarz but himself no position Cologne 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.989
 Depending on your mood, open the c6 continuation retirement center 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.379
 or with Springer g6 and Rector of Flo inherited Sachs 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.939
 unfortunately he should play on style 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.709
 and Steinach you do not have to know about this variant, the game goes 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.419
 Los Schwabstedt already have to be pleasant it really does not make anything what you want 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.609
 should fear 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.629
 City run RF we also just want to spoil we tried 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:50.869
 castling 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.809
 if now Springer simply the four Kemer can black-green already good 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.040
 that of flames the knight simply hits the 4 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.129
 TAM simply the 4 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.469
 and now sleep f6 to touch then the r8 creates a sexy position 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.439
 open 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.439
 white already has problems keeping its balance 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.629
 and the Belgrade paintings are not particularly scary we are there 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.409
 very formats bought from Fischer are useful i7 software and wrong 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:20.109
 Well 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.109
 so whether Sprenger simply the fire to take it more seriously 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:28.459
 Here he is the most played Zoche still my recommendation of Zupfer Verbeek 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:29.699
 4 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.029
 which looks very logical, Springer c3 intervenes in the four 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.919
 other way gives some added 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:39.749
 Prof rc5 instead is also repeatedly trying report before the train 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.749
 not quite honest because expires because on the b 6 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.519
 Siezen up to the passive house for my concepts but probably as well 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.519
 Example Euro pension 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.559
 Comazo train b4 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:56.849
 the downside only drag drawn ever jumpers is simply c6 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.959
 Belorussians take care of the problem with the bonuses four 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.959
 Sprenger plain to 6 the top 6 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.069
 and runs the 3 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.449
 Rainer Schnettker animal Dion recently did not go any different but played the four 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.819
 then just with the 7 I think that saves already a very good position Abs 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.899
 so that the four soldiers do not prepare sleepless nights
