for any reason is possible to open the

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.069 
for any reason is possible to open the
connector<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.799> manage<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.660> adventure

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
connector the manage of the adventure

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.940 
connector the manage of the adventure
park<00:03:30.380> has<00:03:30.620> this<00:03:31.160> kind<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.940> key<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.950> inserting

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
park has this kind of key so inserting

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.240 
park has this kind of key so inserting
this<00:03:34.280> one<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.840> possible<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.799> open<00:03:36.920> the

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
this one is possible to open the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.330 
this one is possible to open the
connector<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.540> comes<00:03:38.900> out<00:03:39.200> from<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.160> line

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
connector and to comes out from the line

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.789 
connector and to comes out from the line
so<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.180> case<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.630> possible<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:42.350> make<00:03:42.530> the

so in this case is possible to make the

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.120 
so in this case is possible to make the
evacuation<00:03:43.489> there<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.630> also<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.500> accessory

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
evacuation there is also this accessory

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.080 
evacuation there is also this accessory
that<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:47.269> a<00:03:47.920> possibility<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.160> change<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.850> way

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
that is a possibility to change the way

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.420 
that is a possibility to change the way
