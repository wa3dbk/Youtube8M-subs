major<00:02:36.810> 7<00:02:37.230> chord<00:02:37.409> now<00:02:38.370> we<00:02:39.000> learned<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.599> an

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:39.719 
major 7 chord now we learned this as an

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.229 
major 7 chord now we learned this as an
octave<00:02:40.170> right<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> whole<00:02:41.639> step<00:02:41.879> before<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
octave right so a whole step before the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.899 
octave right so a whole step before the
octave<00:02:42.689> would<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.500> seven<00:02:43.889> before<00:02:44.730> that
