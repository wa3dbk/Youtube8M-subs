00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300 
like that Matt site for contouring and
then<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.019> usually<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.500> swirl<00:03:50.920> my<00:03:51.100> brush<00:03:51.280> in

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.509 
the whole thing when i go to take it on
my<00:03:52.810> forehead<00:03:53.079> i<00:03:53.470> also<00:03:53.860> i've<00:03:54.070> been<00:03:54.190> taking<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.759 
my forehead i also i've been taking a
little<00:03:54.700> bit<00:03:54.820> down<00:03:54.910> my<00:03:55.060> nose<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:55.510> my<00:03:55.540> chin<00:03:55.900> it's

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
little bit down my nose on my chin it's

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.350 
little bit down my nose on my chin it's
just<00:03:56.920> been<00:03:57.070> good<00:03:57.250> especially<00:03:57.790> today<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.090> could

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
just been good especially today I could

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.240 
just been good especially today I could
probably<00:03:58.600> need<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.140> when<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.440> looks<00:03:59.650> so<00:03:59.950> pale

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
probably need it when it looks so pale

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.430 
probably need it when it looks so pale
um<00:04:00.549> but<00:04:01.269> I<00:04:01.329> think<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:01.630> don't<00:04:01.810> leave<00:04:01.959> my<00:04:02.049> face<00:04:02.230> as

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
um but I think I don't leave my face as

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.539 
um but I think I don't leave my face as
it<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.680> because<00:04:02.890> it's<00:04:03.040> kind<00:04:03.220> of<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.519> know

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
it is because it's kind of you know

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.580 
it is because it's kind of you know
white<00:04:03.970> wintry<00:04:04.420> day<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.900> think<00:04:05.110> being<00:04:05.350> pale

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
white wintry day and I think being pale

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.250 
white wintry day and I think being pale
is<00:04:05.890> suitable<00:04:06.280> for<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.579> day<00:04:06.700> like<00:04:06.850> today<00:04:06.910> um<00:04:07.420> but

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
is suitable for a day like today um but

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.810 
is suitable for a day like today um but
this<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:08.680> a<00:04:08.890> good<00:04:08.980> bronzer<00:04:09.190> again<00:04:09.730> it

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.220 
this is just a good bronzer again it
doesn't<00:04:10.000> seem<00:04:10.209> to<00:04:10.299> make<00:04:10.420> my<00:04:10.570> face<00:04:10.750> look<00:04:10.780> dryer

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
doesn't seem to make my face look dryer

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.990 
doesn't seem to make my face look dryer
I<00:04:11.530> like<00:04:11.769> that<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.040> has<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.250> lot<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.489> those<00:04:12.640> anti

I like that it has a lot of those anti
Asian<00:04:13.299> ingredients<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.350> really<00:04:14.560> looks

also like that it comes in just a little

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.530 
also like that it comes in just a little
spray<00:05:34.070> thing<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:34.520> it's<00:05:34.670> super<00:05:34.970> easy<00:05:35.000> it's<00:05:35.450> a

lot<00:05:35.810> more<00:05:35.960> easy<00:05:36.200> than<00:05:36.350> like<00:05:36.620> those

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
lot more easy than like those

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.350 
lot more easy than like those
texturising<00:05:37.310> powders<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:37.850> you<00:05:38.060> have<00:05:38.240> to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
texturising powders that you have to

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.330 
texturising powders that you have to
dust<00:05:38.570> on<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.410> think<00:05:39.620> it<00:05:39.740> feels<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.190> lot

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
dust on and I think it feels a lot

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.890 
dust on and I think it feels a lot
cleaner<00:05:40.670> than<00:05:40.790> those<00:05:41.120> but<00:05:41.360> at<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.540> same<00:05:41.720> time
