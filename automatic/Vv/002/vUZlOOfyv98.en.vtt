00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.450
 I risk this new lesson today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.379
 with an original technique and for sure 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.559
 effect 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.910
 the indication of the run and ancient engraved 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.769
 we chose a resin object 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 smooth and certainly anonymous that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
 could easily recover at home 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.420
 our intent will be to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.279
 turn it into something special 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 we begin to treat the supposed with a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.800
 pair of hands ja'far cynical as of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.800
 usual 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.930
 even inside we spend the fund with 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.930
 a brush plants a very soft 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.570
 we start more than the relief work 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.829
 let 's get some spray glue 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.980
 repositionable and a mask for 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.640
 you think we are some glue on the back 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.650
 of the mask to sell it visually 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.129
 we position the single gesture and get it 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.129
 of lire 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.630
 we work separately from the stucco but 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.850
 mystical and therefore very soft elastic 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.890
 with a spatula we begin to apply 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.330
 the pasta on the mask 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.510
 let's put a quantity 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.220
 adequate and alisha mo as much as possible 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.100
 and an operation that will have to be done carefully 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.050
 and beware we leave five in place 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.570
 minutes to make him niger horrified 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:35.450
 mexico we can now split the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.700
 mask as you can see the decorations e 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.190
 will remain in relief and will create gods 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.340
 very delicate patterns around everything 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.930
 subject let the plaster dry 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.710
 until it is completely there 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.710
 hardened 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.679
 let's relive lightly with sandpaper 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.410
 we now live with the mission 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.009
 to water over the entire surface 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.960
 including surveys 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.960
 let it dry for a quarter of an hour 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.349
 we now use the copper leaf yes 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.630
 easily finds on the market and has a 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.520
 quite low cost so there 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 it will allow you to cover even large ones 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.010
 surfaces meaning slightly stiff 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.010
 let's make it stick well on all the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.380
 parts of the object including the decorations la 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.650
 Copper shine will highlight 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.410
 the reliefs giving a very frosted effect 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.930
 similar to the original once covered 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.209
 the entire surface with the brush 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.760
 we eliminate all the parts sits in 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.840
 will end up putting on the next ones 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.840
 investment processes 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.510
 we prepare an acrylic color that you live 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.120
 slightly to and place a land of 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.100
 burned siena will go great with the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.950
 brush we pull a few strips of 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.830
 color now we will open more with a sponge 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.840
 natural dabbing for a long time 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.340
 we will succeed in obtaining only one revelation 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.320
 and transparent 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.630
 let's rotate the sponge between the fingers 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.450
 to always have a part cleaned by 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 Use as much I love them leave 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 to dry 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.750
 we prepare for it or in the second color 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.540
 which will be more gray we add to 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.400
 the previous one a bit of black and 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.740
 we owe the same passage with the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.220
 slice and open the color with the 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.690
 sponge with this second step 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.050
 we will get more browning than 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.050
 give 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.879
 3 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.510
 a little 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.209
 we get a third color which will be the 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.209
 natural shadow land therefore each 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.859
 we continue with the same passage 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.470
 we exist with movements to remove 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.450
 object expand gloss 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.450
 copper will be visible again 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.960
 risiko brush columns let's proceed to the 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:54.349
 phase of the exhibition ture will create a 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.669
 black dotting over the entire surface 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.819
 imitating the original aging 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.819
 it will come 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.740
 those the bronze acrylic color 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.840
 we begin to cover the interior 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.419
 definitely to get an effect 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.639
 covering we should give a couple of hands 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.639
 letting it dry between a hellas 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.500
 while with an acrylic color we help 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.200
 the effect of oxidation inside 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.840
 of the pan we separate the color with 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.750
 a sage green and a little ivory 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.790
 mix with the natural sponge 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.430
 we carry the inside of the support e 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.660
 let's start with the effect of the typical copper green 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.010
 of this material 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.010
 this is the result 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.919
 let's look at the final result you can 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:22.289
 create countless numbers with this technique 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:28.250
 furnishing solution giving new life 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:28.250
 had iron cockroach plants pots 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.020
 not
