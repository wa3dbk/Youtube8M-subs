00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.520
 put the film here 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 I use the ordinary sewing thread 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 It's okay here, this wire I pull 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.540
 double amount in half the two tips 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.409
 together I stick on the needle 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 I'm pulling a smaller loose part 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.500
 let go of the other part is a chicken already 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.079
 I taught in the other video that little ball where 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 I get fixed wire 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.979
 the thread in the part then you do not need 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.720
 We 've already done the cheeky point here. 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.079
 I made the video of the buttonhole point you can 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.909
 watch here on my channel and now I'm going 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.170
 to Make a Married Splicing Video Video 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.689
 again 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.450
 so here we have the owl part 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.750
 main I have that it is in the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.469
 middle and united nation that between the parties 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.200
 I'll never sew with the wing by the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.180
 outside you do not have to be here on the side 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.490
 from inside to give a beautiful finish 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.670
 here is how it's here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.890
 Let's make this point. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.890
 this speck is based 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.200
 I'll teach the way I work. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.090
 I call the marrying point of amendment as that 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.489
 I work 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.129
 every craftsman and do it his / her own way 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.329
 I'll teach you how I do then let's go 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.209
 over there 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.819
 the piece is here firm hand 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.730
 Are I always trading from below 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.440
 It's only at the married point of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.900
 amendment that I go from top to bottom 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.090
 to be able to see up here as 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.060
 will stay here the most important part 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.560
 So let's go, I hope you can see. 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.319
 right 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.280
 so I 'm going to put a needle here in the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.250
 line that I speak on the line and the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 felt the staff of the main piece I did not 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.310
 I'll get the felt from the main piece I 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.150
 I'm going to stick the needle in the line. 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.159
 and I'm going to leave on the other side of it. 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.299
 form 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:14.810
 in the same way on the line or 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.260
 I did not get the part filter 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.269
 I just went through the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.209
 part line 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.810
 okay I'll come here รณ I'll take a 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.769
 The little ball is going to stay that right. 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.120
 It was a ball on the other side afterwards. 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.510
 It's getting easier that it's turning 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.560
 Automatic is here on the other side I go 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.540
 come down a little needle is over there 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:49.489
 yes, take the gray felt piece, right? 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.940
 main part of the needle and is secure 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:58.069
 I'll go through the ring 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:03.409
 I pulled the point is again we 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:10.159
 there on the line on the felt line like me 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:14.959
 I said I'll just take the inner part. 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:22.449
 I'm going to leave here on the other side, too. 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.449
 taking the right inner part to see ok 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:41.730
 It went out that time, the problem 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:45.660
 people put on again is part of 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.970
 Argolinha leave ballinha that only to move away 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.780
 What a watermill is left, the ball leaves the ball. 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.790
 here on the side I gave a little 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:02.130
 It's for there, the sun is a little 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:08.850
 See you then, come back and get the 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:12.090
 gray felt will also have to be 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:17.340
 pass through the ring 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:26.400
 Okay, I made the stitch-up stitch I do 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:28.560
 that way you 're back on the line there 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.910
 behind you know you've already left the line 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.310
 Are you going to go down a little bit already? 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:40.530
 needle to catch the two filters the piece 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:44.550
 gray case that I go through 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.750
 inside the hoop and tail has another shape 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.669
 to do 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.229
 Ok you'll decide the way you 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:55.890
 find it better 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:59.010
 I'll go with the needle here. 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:04.110
 already down here, catching you doing a 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:07.100
 Stitch taking the gray felt picking up 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:11.450
 the filter being amended 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.450
 delivering the gray filter behind 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.680
 're just unlike're just swerved me 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.900
 down and in the final a behind the deviation in 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:28.810
 I'm back in line and back here. 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.660

 You will get prissy also new to 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.350
 Who is starting this way maybe 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.250
 It's easier, we 'll go 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.360
 to work like this, I put here the 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.970
 needle 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.700
 already in the distance that I want 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.910
 point at both distances from both 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.210
 edge when away point since 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.630
 I 'll leave there on the other side. 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:07:01.370

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.320
 I go back and puts needle in line at 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.320
 line 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:14.450
 I bring it forward 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.080
 step inside the ring is 

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.080
 again 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.080
 and the distance I passed 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:37.220
 gave me twisted here that is normal right 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.530
 who has never tossed a line to shoot the 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:44.630
 first stone 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:49.990
 Come on, I 'll be right back here and I'll get it. 

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.990

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.759
 OK
