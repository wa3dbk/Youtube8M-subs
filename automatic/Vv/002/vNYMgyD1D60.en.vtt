these smart just a little bit most

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
these smart just a little bit most
adjustments<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:17.009> hurt<00:01:17.220> but<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.520> can't

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
adjustments don't hurt but they can't

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
adjustments don't hurt but they can't
win<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:19.380> we're<00:01:19.500> going

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
win just a little and then we're going

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
win just a little and then we're going
to<00:01:19.650> look<00:01:19.799> again<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> string<00:01:20.549> straight

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
to look again at the string straight

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.080 
to look again at the string straight
away<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.140> hold<00:01:22.610> flex<00:01:24.200> down<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.100> pull<00:01:26.340> good

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

and extend

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.290 
and extend
and<00:01:29.560> there<00:01:30.190> was<00:01:30.340> definitely<00:01:30.790> an<00:01:30.970> obvious

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
and there was definitely an obvious

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.300 
and there was definitely an obvious
difference<00:01:31.510> there<00:01:31.870> and<00:01:32.080> then<00:01:32.470> after<00:01:33.160> that

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
difference there and then after that

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.560 
difference there and then after that
we're<00:01:33.580> going<00:01:33.670> to<00:01:33.760> do<00:01:33.910> something<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.390> help<00:01:34.510> with

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
for this one we working around the hand

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.820 
for this one we working around the hand
we<00:01:43.420> want<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.810> stay<00:01:43.960> on<00:01:44.080> as<00:01:44.200> long<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.620> can

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
we want it to stay on as long as it can

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.470 
we want it to stay on as long as it can
so<00:01:45.220> we're<00:01:45.610> going<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.760> bring<00:01:45.910> your<00:01:46.090> fingers<00:01:46.360> out

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
so we're going to bring your fingers out

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:53.630 
so we're going to bring your fingers out
like<00:01:46.720> this<00:01:49.980> we're<00:01:50.980> going<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.190> bring<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.460> across

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
like this we're going to bring it across

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.270 
like this we're going to bring it across
and<00:01:54.640> anchor<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.180> one<00:01:55.390> without<00:01:55.540> any<00:01:55.900> tension

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
and anchor this one without any tension

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.280 
and anchor this one without any tension
then<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> want<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> flex<00:01:58.060> down<00:01:58.330> we're<00:01:59.200> going

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
then I want you to flex down we're going

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.720 
then I want you to flex down we're going
to<00:01:59.350> follow<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.860> course<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.370> muscles

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
to follow the course of the muscles

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.510 
to follow the course of the muscles
right<00:02:00.970> up<00:02:01.180> into<00:02:01.480> where<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.720> irritates<00:02:05.520> okay

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
right up into where it irritates okay

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.710 
right up into where it irritates okay
and<00:02:06.760> then<00:02:06.970> we're<00:02:07.120> going<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.270> come<00:02:07.450> around<00:02:07.540> the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
and then we're going to come around the

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.320 
and then we're going to come around the
other<00:02:07.900> way<00:02:11.790> we're<00:02:12.790> going<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.000> go<00:02:13.090> ahead<00:02:13.150> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
other way we're going to go ahead and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.030 
other way we're going to go ahead and
anchor<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.720> on<00:02:13.780> without<00:02:14.110> any<00:02:14.350> tension<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
anchor it on without any tension in the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.270 
anchor it on without any tension in the
tape<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.430> then<00:02:16.090> extending<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:17.190> we're<00:02:18.190> going

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
tape and then extending back we're going

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.610 
tape and then extending back we're going
to<00:02:18.340> follow<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:20.080> where<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.440> other

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
to follow this up to where the other

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.270 
to follow this up to where the other
muscles<00:02:20.890> attached<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:23.590> we've<00:02:23.740> effectively

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
muscles attached so we've effectively

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.720 
muscles attached so we've effectively
created<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.030> kinesiotape<00:02:25.920> glove<00:02:26.920> here<00:02:27.280> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
created a kinesiotape glove here that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.730 
created a kinesiotape glove here that
will<00:02:27.850> stay<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.210> really<00:02:28.630> well<00:02:28.780> now<00:02:29.080> heat

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
will stay on really well now heat

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.710 
will stay on really well now heat
activates<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.580> adhesive<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.300> kinesio

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
activates the adhesive on the kinesio

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.710 
activates the adhesive on the kinesio
tape<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:33.070> should<00:02:33.310> stay<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.760> anywhere<00:02:34.660> from

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
tape this should stay on anywhere from

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.270 
tape this should stay on anywhere from
five<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.260> seven<00:02:35.410> days<00:02:35.709> with<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.040> type<00:02:36.250> of

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
five to seven days with this type of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.370 
five to seven days with this type of
taping<00:02:36.640> helps<00:02:37.390> reduce<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.870> swelling<00:02:38.110> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
taping helps reduce the swelling and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.590 
taping helps reduce the swelling and
inflammation<00:02:38.530> around<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.160> area<00:02:39.489> so

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
inflammation around the area so

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.670
