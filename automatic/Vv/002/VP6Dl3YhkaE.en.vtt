 help line video and today we are on ps4 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.730
 I hope you pronounce it in twine first 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.460
 as what we are on ps4 this game that 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.379
 it was can be presented at e3 è 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.730
 which was immediately released in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 the same moment indeed the dude will win 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 who spoke of sony who said this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.769
 is the new video game 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.080
 weiner of the can download it from 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.670
 now in fact I went immediately then 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.220
 double sn ie immediately a few minutes later 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 I bought it because I'm gambling alone 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.669
 8 euros and I saw it and I really liked it 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 so much also because type a kind of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.250
 those of the bester minutino games cost 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.350
 I bought 8 euros and finished it 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 half an hour because it's nothing he has 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.590
 in any case we have the story itself 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 let me show you to become history 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.219
 we have nine lives because you don't see 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.840
 first life second life third life 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 fourth life fifth life sixth life 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 seventh vito between vito and non -vita that 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.449
 prefer the game we must not do 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
 nothing more than to increase the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.629
 longevity of gaming expenses we can 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 going to make challenges challenges you don't 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.620
 I can do because I'm fucking 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
 however difficult to explain to me game 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.070
 to make you understand what the fuck 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 we are talking about the de vicari altogether 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.860
 like it because they added a new one 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 option on youtube which is practically 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 click i like every i like that 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.580
 click on giving one euro 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 very good biafra is required 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.689
 history we are not going to make the first life 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.040
 because it is really pale or slow 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.270
 tion but to work in the third life 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 there's a little bit more adrenaline the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.930
 situation I explain you so much that the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.900
 game how to play and what needs to be done 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.310
 so let's wait for the kart 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.100
 heavy loading which is a game 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530
 that whoever occupies a jig size an 8 mi jig 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.340
 I remember this is endless uploads 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.960
 next gen 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.450
 however as you see practically 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.340
 we have two things that we command with 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.750
 respectively with the right stick e 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.040
 left the joypad then that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.540
 orange is controlled with the lever 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.280
 left the blue one with the lever 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 right before I want to pass 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 within these we must 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 also sell these balls these things 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.950
 there are places these things send you to pass 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.380
 inside so kind of bringing him a so 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.909
 what the fuck they are as they animate 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.009
 advancing with levity or with i 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.229
 levels become increasingly difficult 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.929
 to be taken because it is a change of forms 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.030
 and dimensions 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.219
 let them move madly 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.099
 well i dont know fuck anyway yes 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:22.340
 they start to move in a strange and just way 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.500
 if we don't take a portal where it is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.810
 omitted as soon as I did not 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.549
 nothing happens but obviously it goes down 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.469
 the bar that the other one sees in 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.829
 high we have a blue bar is a bar 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.569
 orange however has both of these 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.189
 these are these two bars to arrive 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.420
 at their maximum power because 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.950
 every time I came these balls 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.090
 each in question inside the portals 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.150
 certainly precisely that kind of 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.450
 power that at the top we press l1 and era 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.480
 one is before we can become 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.980
 dragons become a dragon 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 then pork 2 planks was all 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.340
 however it is a game that needs to be played 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.430
 therefore needs concentration for 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.930
 become practically dragons 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.959
 teleport team a kind of world 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.579
 strange live in a place between dinners 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.069
 therefore, every place is new 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.810
 we have to get some balls anyway 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.790
 some birds I should go then to 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.500
 collection of things to make that there 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.000
 fill the other bar with that now 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.790
 I'm really fucking at 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.709
 cannes and so now I'll show you 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.449
 to then go just to unlock life 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.669
 next that is this is the whole game 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.379
 it is a hobby more than anything 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.840
 nice though glass presented 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.760
 so at e3 it's a new thing 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.140
 a fuck if you don't buy your mind 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.850
 really bad 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.080
 so anyway I like it because it is 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.580
 There really is a lot of time 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.680
 looks like bullshit to land in there 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.090
 put some of you to play 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.440
 interested in buying it all the way 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.209
 it's 8 euros 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.670
 if anyone interested in buying it 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.180
 when I started playing it as mentioned 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.220
 as a park 2 fucking done via a world 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220
 I bought it I was on Trieste with the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.180
 others don't, but he bought it, he studies 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.980
 as it takes me to play so much said 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.540
 ten minutes and I close it is not true I am 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.790
 stayed there an hour to finish it in fact I have 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.959
 finished now I'm priced ready to 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.190
 also take all the trophies because 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.420
 obviously there are not even trophies 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.790
 there is platinum 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.830
 there is not even a gold trophy yes maybe ce 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.160
 there is a gold that practically consists of 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:14.550
 take all the other trophies though 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.079
 basolo type 15 trophies nothing is anymore 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.519
 however we are filling in as a network 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.160
 top bars for me whenever 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.500
 I am speaking wrong and it is truly a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
 fucking problem this because there 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.210
 wants to concentrate must be coordinated 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 at most the expensive analog sticks 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.050
 because if we don't coordinate them we do 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.520
 disgust and therefore we can not become 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.690
 dragons and if we can't become 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.160
 dragons we ca n't finish the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.540
 I play but since I haven't finished it 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.210
 I don't give a fuck anyway for 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.250
 you to make you see guys how much it is 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.410
 cool this tatò games we talk moments 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.640
 as well as two pig that one tries to 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.750
 become a dragon let's try kimi 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.820
 of the conference are in the conference 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.620
 sony sucked 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.590
 that is, the only interesting announce is 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.410
 been that of gta 5 there really is it 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.260
 made perhaps of uncharted that is really 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.160
 The Sony conference sucked 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.320
 half an hour talking to talk about 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.729
 playstation but there was no fucking place 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.650
 when you are kids, glass up like you 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.420
 now to throw them one and one this 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.010
 we have to take these things again 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.390
 because we rest practically do 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.430
 join the balls ie those things in 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.250
 up those those fucking obstacles 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.409
 fight with met for 246 you are 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.300
 eight 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.949
 we must bring together and then we will become 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.379
 of the dragons we will become a little dragon 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.959
 green and is really more loaded than 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:29.139
 godego to see if you plant it with a lot 

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:30.550
 cool very colorful and very funny 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.899
 ok we have become the destination pond that 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.319
 now they are doing the fusion like a 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:35.249
 little bit 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.249
 tokyo 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.610
 look how I respect these wings beautifully 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.629
 text we have to go around this 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.629
 world as king where to go to get 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.949
 this so- so this world so 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.449
 girl now we have to flutter here 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.629
 there is no kind of difficulty in 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.429
 this game if you don't take those well 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.439
 so that I had to take myself but anyway 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:55.179
 now we are here in this world 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:56.889
 look, it's nice if I tell you to 

00:05:55.179 --> 00:06:01.869
 rest on the water that has the effect 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.829
 watery type my mother this technology 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.749
 this next gen 

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:06.550
 what he can do anyway we take 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:08.139
 these balls 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.489
 therefore to take all the balls steep 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:13.659
 and that other bar that was what 

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:15.639
 I told you before we can draw you 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.229
 what the fuck does boys always have to do with it 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.669
 we can draw the only now I do 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.029
 see published mo.re un and dell 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.860
 1 we can flutter like pigs 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.349
 look how nice I feel very happy 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.479
 when he plays this video game because 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.399
 restores happiness and joy 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.009
 there is a boreal error in the sky 

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:35.199
 look how cool it now hangs and yes 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.119
 opens a kind of portal that mentions le 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:40.300
 transport everything you look at that design 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:42.279
 I made it really epic and so much now 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.659
 we must transport ourselves to go 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:45.519
 to take we must apply 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:47.469
 within that portal it is such 

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:49.689
 take us practically this is the third 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:52.809
 life to the fourth life is over is over 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:54.039
 game for the whole game is like that 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:56.199
 this with regards to 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.029
 campaign it as it would come here now 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:59.709
 they split again they split up 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.729
 in the two balls now we have again 

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:02.729
 in a cell a fish 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.300
 to reinitiate the same story miur 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.250
 again to collect on my must 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.630
 fill the bar all these things for 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.300
 however each level a scenario 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.190
 different anyway we just go out and yes 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.580
 talks about challenges and challenges 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:19.980
 practically as you see, they are unlocked 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.570
 every 180 points ie where I where in 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.470
 theory I should do 180 points in this 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.430
 challenge that does not change at all 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.980
 anything 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.200
 in fact from the main story we must 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.760
 always collect we have to pass 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.410
 always inside those so colored 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.680
 and every time we move into 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:37.050
 there are so many colorful ones 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.060
 more points as we see now here 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.260
 now step so they are always points 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.240
 here we have three lives so we can 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.980
 make mistakes up to three times 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.420
 in any case the boys are essentially playing 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.500
 that is to say I am all important to do 

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.180
 see the game that a new game 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.130
 precisely of the small beams want 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.570
 playing just play can buy it 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.650
 obviously only on playstation as much as me 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.360
 I recommend exclusive playstation 4 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.750
 serve more let you give a nice like e 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.750
 bye Bye
