roast<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.240> perfect<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.670> we're<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:07.020> cut

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
roast is perfect so we're going to cut

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.160 
roast is perfect so we're going to cut
it<00:03:08.170> down<00:03:08.380> now<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.670> grain<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.390> meat<00:03:10.780> goes

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
it down now the grain of the meat goes

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.410 
it down now the grain of the meat goes
this<00:03:11.440> way<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.580> want<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.880> cut<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.090> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
this way so we want to cut it the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.860 
this way so we want to cut it the
opposite<00:03:14.020> way<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:15.040> grain<00:03:15.460> or

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
opposite way of the grain or

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.449 
opposite way of the grain or
perpendicular<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.140> grain<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:18.040> keeps

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
perpendicular to the grain this keeps

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.010 
perpendicular to the grain this keeps
the<00:03:18.640> meat<00:03:18.790> nice<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.030> tender<00:03:19.270> and<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.750> doesn't

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
the meat nice and tender and it doesn't

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.280 
the meat nice and tender and it doesn't
become<00:03:20.260> stringy<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.390> also<00:03:22.660> need<00:03:23.020> to<00:03:23.050> have<00:03:23.260> a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
become stringy you also need to have a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.520 
become stringy you also need to have a
super<00:03:23.980> super<00:03:24.459> sharp<00:03:24.910> knife<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:26.140> can<00:03:26.290> see

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
super super sharp knife as you can see

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.590 
super super sharp knife as you can see
I'm<00:03:26.739> just<00:03:26.770> taking<00:03:27.340> my<00:03:27.459> time<00:03:27.670> slicing<00:03:28.390> through

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
I'm just taking my time slicing through

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.860 
I'm just taking my time slicing through
but<00:03:28.959> I'm<00:03:29.080> not<00:03:29.260> pushing<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:30.280> forcing<00:03:30.880> down<00:03:31.090> then

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
but I'm not pushing or forcing down then

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.380 
but I'm not pushing or forcing down then
I<00:03:32.320> can<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:33.010> very<00:03:33.040> very<00:03:33.430> thin<00:03:33.790> slices<00:03:34.270> and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
I can get very very thin slices and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.900 
I can get very very thin slices and
that's<00:03:34.600> really<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.080> trick<00:03:35.350> to<00:03:36.100> thinly<00:03:36.400> sliced

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
that's really the trick to thinly sliced

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.000 
that's really the trick to thinly sliced
