hitting you would if you you overshoot a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.500 
hitting you would if you you overshoot a
little<00:00:54.409> bit<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:55.339> keeps<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:55.729> handle<00:00:56.089> from

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
little bit that keeps the handle from

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.750 
little bit that keeps the handle from
busting<00:00:57.260> up<00:00:57.409> this<00:00:57.859> will<00:00:58.039> give<00:00:58.159> you<00:00:58.249> years<00:00:58.640> of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
busting up this will give you years of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.180 
busting up this will give you years of
service<00:00:59.329> life<00:00:59.559> before<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.649> have<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.920> replace

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
service life before you have to replace

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.879 
service life before you have to replace
it<00:01:01.569> all<00:01:02.569> right<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:02.989> let's<00:01:03.170> go<00:01:03.319> over<00:01:03.409> some<00:01:03.530> stats

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:03.889 
it all right so let's go over some stats

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:06.730 
it all right so let's go over some stats
so<00:01:04.729> approximately<00:01:05.000> 20<00:01:05.780> inches<00:01:05.810> long<00:01:06.050> give<00:01:06.680> you

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
so approximately 20 inches long give you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.230 
so approximately 20 inches long give you
a<00:01:06.800> perspective<00:01:07.040> by<00:01:07.400> standing<00:01:07.759> back<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.149> can

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
a perspective by standing back you can

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.209 
a perspective by standing back you can
see<00:01:08.420> like<00:01:10.149> according<00:01:11.259> with<00:01:12.259> my<00:01:12.469> shoulders<00:01:12.860> how

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
see like according with my shoulders how

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.940 
see like according with my shoulders how
long<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.820> I<00:01:14.140> almost<00:01:15.140> consider<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.829> a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
long this is I almost consider it a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.709 
long this is I almost consider it a
little<00:01:16.130> bit<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.399> hybrid<00:01:16.610> because<00:01:17.090> most<00:01:17.540> your

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
little bit of a hybrid because most your

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.719 
little bit of a hybrid because most your
hedges<00:01:18.020> are<00:01:18.200> not<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.500> long<00:01:18.770> this<00:01:19.520> could

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
hedges are not this long this could

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.510 
hedges are not this long this could
actually<00:01:19.850> be<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.869> handle<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:22.210> small<00:01:23.210> axe<00:01:24.520> but

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
actually be a to handle a small axe but

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.649 
actually be a to handle a small axe but
we're<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:25.820> test<00:01:25.969> this<00:01:26.090> out<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.329> have<00:01:26.390> not

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
we're going to test this out I have not

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.389 
we're going to test this out I have not
even<00:01:26.750> used<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.140> yet<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.560> further<00:01:28.189> in<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
even used this yet so further in the

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.889 
even used this yet so further in the
video<00:01:28.610> stay<00:01:29.180> tuned<00:01:29.360> we'll<00:01:29.570> see<00:01:29.689> how<00:01:29.780> this

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
video stay tuned we'll see how this

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.929 
video stay tuned we'll see how this
works<00:01:30.079> with<00:01:30.259> one<00:01:30.500> hand<00:01:30.770> or<00:01:30.920> two<00:01:30.950> hands<00:01:31.280> so

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
learn how to swing it depends on your

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.950 
learn how to swing it depends on your
wood<00:05:50.590> sometimes<00:05:51.090> you<00:05:52.090> go<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.300> light<00:05:52.720> and<00:05:52.900> it

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
wood sometimes you go to light and it

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.439 
wood sometimes you go to light and it
sticks<00:05:53.229> in<00:05:53.379> it<00:05:53.500> you<00:05:53.979> go<00:05:54.129> too<00:05:54.190> hard<00:05:54.879> and<00:05:55.300> it

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
sticks in it you go too hard and it

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.300 
sticks in it you go too hard and it
flies<00:05:55.780> right<00:05:55.990> through<00:05:56.259> so<00:05:56.889> it's<00:05:57.069> always<00:05:57.220> a

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
flies right through so it's always a

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.210 
flies right through so it's always a
balance<00:05:57.729> depending<00:05:58.449> what<00:05:58.539> you're<00:05:58.690> splitting

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220
