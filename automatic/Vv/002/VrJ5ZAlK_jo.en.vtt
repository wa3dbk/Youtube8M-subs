about<00:01:23.709> a<00:01:24.390> mile<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:26.819> I<00:01:27.819> recall<00:01:28.390> shooting<00:01:28.810> about

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
about a mile and I recall shooting about

war and the things behind that wall I'm

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.320 
war and the things behind that wall I'm
looking<00:01:36.280> around<00:01:36.369> people<00:01:36.819> looked<00:01:36.970> at<00:01:37.090> me<00:01:37.179> like

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
looking around people looked at me like

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.020 
looking around people looked at me like
I<00:01:37.479> was<00:01:37.979> completely<00:01:38.979> foreign<00:01:39.459> I<00:01:39.640> even<00:01:39.880> though

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
I was completely foreign I even though

I was completely foreign I even though
even<00:01:40.720> though<00:01:40.899> I<00:01:40.929> am<00:01:41.319> vaguely<00:01:41.590> Chinese<00:01:42.160> I<00:01:44.459> think

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
even though I am vaguely Chinese I think

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.499 
even though I am vaguely Chinese I think
when<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.319> look<00:01:47.410> at<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.649> photograph<00:01:47.940> and<00:01:48.940> doesn't

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
when I look at a photograph and doesn't

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.660 
when I look at a photograph and doesn't
matter<00:01:49.630> what<00:01:49.840> kind<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.110> photograph<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.800> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.309 
matter what kind of photograph it is it
has<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:51.940> be<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.599> has<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:53.020> about<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
has to be it has to be about the

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.589 
has to be it has to be about the
aesthetics<00:01:53.770> first<00:01:54.039> so<00:01:55.030> when<00:01:55.330> I<00:01:55.390> got<00:01:55.539> my

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
aesthetics first so when I got my

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.089 
aesthetics first so when I got my
photograph<00:01:55.989> I'm<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:56.410> drawn<00:01:56.649> to<00:01:56.679> all<00:01:56.950> the

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
photograph I'm just drawn to all the

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.010 
photograph I'm just drawn to all the
various<00:01:57.690> compositional<00:01:58.690> elements<00:02:01.020> obviously

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
various compositional elements obviously

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.580 
various compositional elements obviously
the<00:02:02.310> pilots<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.459> background<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:05.259> wall<00:02:05.500> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
the pilots the background the wall the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.350 
the pilots the background the wall the
shrubbery<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:08.800> front<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.759> guess<00:02:09.970> most

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
shrubbery in front but I guess most

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.869 
shrubbery in front but I guess most
importantly<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.170> for<00:02:11.650> me<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:12.099> prime<00:02:12.400> key<00:02:12.700> is

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
importantly and for me the prime key is

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.950 
importantly and for me the prime key is
that<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.840> curled<00:02:14.230> piece<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:14.709> wire

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.570 

there<00:02:19.410> are<00:02:19.500> still<00:02:19.680> interesting<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
there are still interesting and

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
there are still interesting and
beautiful<00:02:20.700> things<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.420> there<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:22.440> least<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
beautiful things out there at least to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.410 
beautiful things out there at least to
me<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.900> all<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.960> want<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.470> do<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
me and all I want to do really is to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.690 
me and all I want to do really is to
capture<00:02:27.660> them<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.430> how<00:02:29.550> they

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
capture them and and to see how they

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:38.809 
capture them and and to see how they
look<00:02:29.960> in<00:02:30.960> an<00:02:31.290> image
