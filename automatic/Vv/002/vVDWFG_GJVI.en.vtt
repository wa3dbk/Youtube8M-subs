Jiraiya<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.349> think<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.769> would<00:03:00.890> be<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.310> freakin

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
Jiraiya I think that would be so freakin

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.120 
Jiraiya I think that would be so freakin
awesome<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.660> didn't<00:03:02.900> get<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.290> on<00:03:03.709> in

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
awesome we didn't get that on in

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.430 
awesome we didn't get that on in
revolution<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.030> even<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.049> were<00:03:06.200> to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
revolution and even if it were to

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.070 
revolution and even if it were to
involve<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.549> current<00:03:08.000> pain<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.569> would<00:03:08.870> not

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
involve the current pain I would not

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.720 
involve the current pain I would not
mind<00:03:09.350> obviously<00:03:09.950> would<00:03:10.340> make<00:03:10.489> more<00:03:10.670> sense

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
mind obviously would make more sense

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.729 
mind obviously would make more sense
with<00:03:11.090> yahiko<00:03:11.569> being<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> character<00:03:12.350> but<00:03:12.709> I

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
with yahiko being a character but I

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.440 
with yahiko being a character but I
doubt<00:03:12.860> cc2<00:03:13.400> would<00:03:13.610> put<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> effort<00:03:14.150> into

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
doubt cc2 would put the effort into

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.240 
doubt cc2 would put the effort into
making<00:03:14.599> yahiko<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> character<00:03:15.680> we<00:03:16.099> obviously

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
making yahiko a character we obviously

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.640 
making yahiko a character we obviously
got<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.610> message<00:03:16.819> DLC<00:03:17.269> costume<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.110> unless

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
got a message DLC costume and unless

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.400 
got a message DLC costume and unless
that<00:03:18.890> transfers<00:03:19.400> over<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:20.510> UM<00:03:22.209> Nordstrom<00:03:23.209> for

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
that transfers over to UM Nordstrom for

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.440 
that transfers over to UM Nordstrom for
probably<00:03:24.410> won't<00:03:24.620> get<00:03:24.830> him<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.670> what<00:03:26.330> do<00:03:26.390> you

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
probably won't get him so what do you

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.809 
probably won't get him so what do you
guys<00:03:26.540> think<00:03:26.599> about<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.230> at<00:03:27.980> number<00:03:28.489> 4<00:03:28.790> we

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
guys think about that at number 4 we

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.420 
guys think about that at number 4 we
have<00:03:29.260> Haku<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.500> Zabuza<00:03:31.630> now<00:03:32.630> in<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.950> cutscene

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
have Haku and Zabuza now in the cutscene

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.660 
have Haku and Zabuza now in the cutscene
for<00:03:34.730> gnar<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.090> storm<00:03:35.359> 3<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:35.989> see<00:03:36.230> Haku<00:03:37.160> jump<00:03:37.519> in

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
for gnar to storm 3 we see Haku jump in

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.150 
for gnar to storm 3 we see Haku jump in
the<00:03:37.790> way<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.660> try<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:38.989> protect<00:03:39.109> za<00:03:39.620> bazaar<00:03:40.010> and

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the way to try and protect za bazaar and

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.099 
the way to try and protect za bazaar and
I<00:03:40.250> think<00:03:40.519> an<00:03:40.640> alternate<00:03:41.090> jutsu<00:03:41.390> would<00:03:41.570> look<00:03:41.750> so

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
I think an alternate jutsu would look so

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.860 
I think an alternate jutsu would look so
good<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.470> team<00:03:42.890> one<00:03:43.359> where<00:03:44.359> obviously<00:03:44.780> you

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
good a team one where obviously you

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.900 
good a team one where obviously you
don't<00:03:45.049> lose<00:03:45.200> health<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:46.310> balanced<00:03:46.790> in

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
don't lose health it's it's balanced in

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.030 
don't lose health it's it's balanced in
that<00:03:47.090> sense<00:03:47.390> but<00:03:48.109> I<00:03:48.290> think<00:03:48.590> they<00:03:48.680> would<00:03:48.829> work

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
that sense but I think they would work

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.890 
that sense but I think they would work
so<00:03:49.400> well<00:03:49.640> together<00:03:49.850> I<00:03:50.150> put<00:03:50.299> at<00:03:50.420> number<00:03:50.690> four

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
so well together I put at number four

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.809 
so well together I put at number four
cause<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:51.230> savage<00:03:51.739> by<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.220> same<00:03:52.459> time<00:03:52.640> I

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
cause it's savage by the same time I

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.610 
cause it's savage by the same time I
don't<00:03:53.000> care<00:03:53.239> for<00:03:53.510> those<00:03:53.630> characters<00:03:54.230> too<00:03:54.380> much

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
don't care for those characters too much

don't care for those characters too much
I<00:03:54.859> just<00:03:55.100> think<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.609> would<00:03:55.700> look<00:03:55.819> cool<00:03:56.060> what<00:03:56.600> do

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690

then kid Naruto and killaby from the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.310 
then kid Naruto and killaby from the

be<00:06:42.020> epic<00:06:42.560> to<00:06:42.770> see<00:06:42.920> that<00:06:43.100> being<00:06:43.280> used<00:06:43.490> against

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 
be epic to see that being used against

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.340 
be epic to see that being used against
an<00:06:43.910> opponent<00:06:44.180> just<00:06:44.750> like<00:06:44.900> killing<00:06:45.110> bees<00:06:45.230> not

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
an opponent just like killing bees not
