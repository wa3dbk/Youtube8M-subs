thought-provoking as any of the main six

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.860 
thought-provoking as any of the main six
episodes<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.859> think<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.849> writers<00:02:48.209> would<00:02:48.480> first

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
episodes I think the writers would first

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.809 
episodes I think the writers would first
have<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.170> introduce<00:02:49.650> some<00:02:49.769> sort<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.400> weakness

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
have to introduce some sort of weakness

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.789 
have to introduce some sort of weakness
to<00:02:51.060> their<00:02:51.329> characters<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.260> make<00:02:52.440> them<00:02:52.680> a

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
to their characters to make them a

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.250 
to their characters to make them a
little<00:02:52.950> more<00:02:53.220> relatable<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.569> next<00:02:54.930> couple
