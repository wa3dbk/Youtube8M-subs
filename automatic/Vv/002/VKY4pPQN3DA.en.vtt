00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
hand side this is going to be your

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.620 
hand side this is going to be your
cruise<00:00:46.340> control<00:00:46.370> you're<00:00:47.300> going<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.480> hit<00:00:47.570> it

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
cruise control you're going to hit it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.180 
cruise control you're going to hit it
for<00:00:47.900> a<00:00:47.930> turn<00:00:48.140> signal<00:00:48.320> that's<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.800> next<00:00:48.950> one

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
for a turn signal that's the next one

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.070 
for a turn signal that's the next one
down<00:00:49.310> is<00:00:49.370> your<00:00:49.610> turn<00:00:49.820> signal<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:50.900> it's<00:00:51.020> a

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
down is your turn signal so it's a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.080 
down is your turn signal so it's a
little<00:00:51.110> bit<00:00:51.350> flip<00:00:51.710> their<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.250> long<00:00:52.460> stock<00:00:52.850> the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
little bit flip their the long stock the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.790 
little bit flip their the long stock the
bigger<00:00:53.270> thicker<00:00:53.540> stock<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:54.050> that<00:00:54.200> turn<00:00:54.410> signal

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
bigger thicker stock is that turn signal

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:06.789 
bigger thicker stock is that turn signal
I<00:01:04.960> think<00:01:05.960> yeah<00:01:06.110> I'll<00:01:06.170> probably<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:06.500> do<00:01:06.680> the

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
I think yeah I'll probably just do the

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.370 
I think yeah I'll probably just do the
three-point<00:01:07.189> turn<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.460> make<00:01:07.579> it<00:01:07.700> easy<00:01:07.869> and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.940

energy usage graph you can have a trip

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.830 
energy usage graph you can have a trip
meter<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:51.490> can<00:01:51.550> have<00:01:51.820> your<00:01:52.060> out<00:01:52.270> part<00:01:52.600> for

very simple reason they can't play
videos<00:02:23.680> while<00:02:23.830> driving<00:02:24.660> how<00:02:25.660> are<00:02:25.840> not<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.170> do

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
videos while driving how are not to do

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.949 
videos while driving how are not to do
that<00:02:26.590> why<00:02:26.950> won't<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.250> stop<00:02:27.490> will<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.850> play<00:02:28.030> it

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that why won't you stop will it play it

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.830 
that why won't you stop will it play it
won't<00:02:29.140> bite<00:02:29.350> unless<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.610> mean<00:02:30.760> all<00:02:31.330> speeds

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840
