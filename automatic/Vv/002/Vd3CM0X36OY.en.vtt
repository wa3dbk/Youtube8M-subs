00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:20.310
 and now let's consider 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.130
 types of towers towers 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.779
 divided into four subtypes differing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.810
 height ascending by this 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.810
 microtower miditower 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.810
 midi-tower 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.579
 and full full tower for most 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.969
 enclosures classifier is the number 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.100
 large external compartments 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.949
 according to the table although there 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.399
 and exceptions to the table should 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.280
 That the full tower has 4 or more external 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.370
 compartments 5-25 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.670
 tower has three minitower compartments 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.140
 two compartments and microtower just one compartment 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.140
 5 25 inches 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.030
 full tower server has 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.170
 3 external compartments 5 25 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.290
 Mash it vkk not used recall that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 the body has a number of big 5 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.310
 25 and small 3.5 inches outer compartments 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.560
 or from English hit coming to 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.259
 their front side is inserted 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.350
 internal device which is required 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.210
 workflow access this drive 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 floppy disks fdd 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.909
 floppy disk drive and cd 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 sit dividy blu-ray with the traditional 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.020
 design 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.649
 compartment located on top and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.440
 big 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.440
 above small but there is an exception 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.080
 consider the most important factors 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.870
 which need to be analyzed 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.250
 before you decide which body is better 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.780
 best for your future sc 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 we determine the tasks that will be solved 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.240
 computer that is essentially what you are from 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.220
 you want to get it first 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.230
 gaming pc to run games second 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.100
 multimedia is watching video music 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.580
 Internet third office to work with 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.870
 documents and internet access 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.880
 4 work with graphics and video digitization 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.060
 in detail this issue will be raised 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.820
 the ninth of this course which is so 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.140
 and is called define tasks which 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.590
 will solve the computer 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.010
 further in the objects that are in the complex 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.319
 will meet your needs 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.030
 starting from the motherboard and ending 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.630
 internal drives and block 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.720
 power supply 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.290
 here it is worth noting one fact usually 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.420
 shells 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.000
 come complete with power supply and 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.910
 so do not rush to buy it 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.920
 Separately and to begin to find out what 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.350
 exactly the power supply you need by 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.840
 power if you're new to the field 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.180
 computers then let these questions you not 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.690
 confuse all this we will detail 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.630
 consider in this course after 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.010
 how do you have the desired configuration 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.820
 It remains to choose the style and color of the case 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 under your interior and preferences as well 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.769
 you will have to decide exactly where it will be 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.280
 install the system unit 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.260
 but the table or below became the side of it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.370
 will depend on 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.630
 horizontal or vertical body 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.670
 you need to pick up if you choose 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.980
 horizontal shell desktop you 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.260
 again have to match the election 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.360
 configuration with those enclosures 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.360
 which you will be available for sale 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.340
 inside each 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.680
 chassis system unit has 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.379
 designation of motherboard form factor 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.299
 which is permissible to use in this 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.819
 housing 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.269
 some users prefer 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.700
 vertical body 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.609
 sets on the table explaining it 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.099
 next he is well overshadowed by the monitor 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.669
 side light and always on hand everything 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.910
 drives 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.710
 but at the same time the noise increases significantly 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.830
 cooling system fans 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.830
 so everyone must draw conclusions himself 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.100
 optimality midi tower full tower 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.650
 designed for servers and cumbersome 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.870
 in height the excess road for 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.080
 home computer 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.840
 full towers usually have a door 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.690
 buttons closing the compartment note that 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.910
 if you have a place under the table then full 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.300
 the tower is a more interesting choice 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.070
 than micro tower but still install 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.710
 the tower is best on some 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.770
 distance from the floor so how on the floor 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.430
 going to a lot of dust that gets into 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.430
 system unit 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.550
 micro tower has not enough 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.240
 besides compartments besides micro enclosures 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.190
 bad is the case with heat 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.840
 excess heat is extremely unfavorable 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.990
 acts on all without exception 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.000
 internal components 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.510
 so the most popular mini and midi 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.900
 midi tower tower with its large number 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:37.150
 compartments are more preferential 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.150
 the device needs a large compartment 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.919
 First of all, sit 99 and also were paradise 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.199
 drives 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:48.620
 It should be noted that sit divide drive 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.569
 is a required component 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.449
 sit divide drive is convenient for the purposes 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.870
 archiving and transfer of large volumes 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.409
 data in the second is a frame for hard 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.300
 the disk is user friendly 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:06.569
 involved in video editing and photography 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.129
 It puts 2 capacious disk which 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.219
 includes a foreign key 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.509
 only when the disk is needed 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:15.779
 fits in cassette 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.180
 which can be easily removed so 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:20.580
 midi towers are good 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.360
 the trade-off between extensibility you and 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.360
 compactness 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.400
 on this we finish 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:33.740
 overview of the system case for 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.740
 continue the third part
