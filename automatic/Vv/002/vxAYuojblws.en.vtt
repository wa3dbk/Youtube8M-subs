00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
pieces I've been their work and much we

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
pieces I've been their work and much we
lost<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.020> completely<00:02:07.110> work<00:02:07.439> out<00:02:07.710> which

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
lost so it's completely work out which

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.430 
lost so it's completely work out which

not<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> much<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.440> that's<00:02:13.500> right

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
not that much and that's right

meant this to the forklift the plate on

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.030 
meant this to the forklift the plate on
was<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.900> not<00:02:39.900> quite<00:02:40.200> sure<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:40.650> duty<00:02:40.830> as

a sitter an l-shaped plate on the bill
ayers<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.880> which<00:02:45.060> i've<00:02:45.209> now<00:02:45.390> got<00:02:45.450> i<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.870> only

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
ayers in which i've now got i can only

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.720 
ayers in which i've now got i can only
go<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.319> two<00:02:46.709> inches<00:02:47.069> that's<00:02:47.430> funny<00:02:47.610> about

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
go about two inches that's funny about

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.470 
go about two inches that's funny about
the<00:02:48.000> gap<00:02:48.209> you'll<00:02:49.019> see<00:02:49.290> between<00:02:49.590> my<00:02:50.120> motor<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the gap you'll see between my motor and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.030 
the gap you'll see between my motor and
bears<00:02:51.750> will<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:52.019> about<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.350> distance<00:02:52.530> there

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
bears will be about that distance there

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.840 
bears will be about that distance there
so<00:02:53.220> let<00:02:53.370> two<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> half<00:02:53.880> inches<00:02:55.850> we've

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
so let two and a half inches we've

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
so let two and a half inches we've
obviously<00:02:57.060> as<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.540> circle<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.200> stabilizer

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
obviously as a circle of a stabilizer

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.320 
obviously as a circle of a stabilizer
sort<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.250> coming<00:02:59.459> down<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.850> here<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.239> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
sort of coming down up here to the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.180 
sort of coming down up here to the
bailout<00:03:00.630> which<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.080> be<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.709> sort<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.040> angle

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
bailout which will be that sort of angle

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.960 
bailout which will be that sort of angle
I<00:03:02.780> like<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.250> what<00:03:05.250> I'm<00:03:05.310> going<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.519> try<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.700> do

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
I like that what I'm going to try and do

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
I like that what I'm going to try and do
is<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.540> leave<00:03:06.690> myself<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:07.049> bit<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.230> adjustment

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
is to leave myself a bit of adjustment

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.900 
is to leave myself a bit of adjustment
because<00:03:07.830> though<00:03:07.980> i'll<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.280> able<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> work<00:03:08.640> out

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
because though i'll be able to work out

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.059 
because though i'll be able to work out
the<00:03:09.600> height<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.110> shaft<00:03:10.410> with<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.890> higher

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
the height of this shaft with the higher

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.680 
the height of this shaft with the higher
the<00:03:12.709> gearbox<00:03:13.709> shaft<00:03:14.040> obviously<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> two<00:03:15.299> info

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the gearbox shaft obviously the two info

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.750 
the gearbox shaft obviously the two info
bit<00:03:15.959> will<00:03:16.110> be<00:03:16.230> quite<00:03:16.560> doable<00:03:16.739> to<00:03:17.010> line<00:03:17.190> up<00:03:17.400> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
bit will be quite doable to line up and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.699 
bit will be quite doable to line up and
so<00:03:18.480> I'm<00:03:18.570> just<00:03:18.780> trying<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.049> get<00:03:19.140> an<00:03:19.230> idea<00:03:19.290> around

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
so I'm just trying to get an idea around

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.229 
so I'm just trying to get an idea around
and<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.190> at<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.310> moment<00:03:20.430> i'll<00:03:20.730> make<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
and do that at the moment i'll make a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.650 
and do that at the moment i'll make a
plate<00:03:22.130> basically<00:03:23.130> make<00:03:23.280> adjustment<00:03:24.120> if<00:03:24.299> i<00:03:24.390> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
plate basically make adjustment if i can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.270 
plate basically make adjustment if i can
between<00:03:24.870> disc<00:03:25.200> plate<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.920> plate<00:03:25.950> it

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
between disc plate and the plate it

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.550 
between disc plate and the plate it
mounts<00:03:26.640> onto<00:03:27.079> obviously<00:03:28.079> this<00:03:28.170> place<00:03:28.410> isn't

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
mounts onto obviously this place isn't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.740 
mounts onto obviously this place isn't

is<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.190> we've<00:03:41.519> got<00:03:41.670> I<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.690> running

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
is just we've got I and then running

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.440 
is just we've got I and then running
this<00:03:43.109> module<00:03:43.500> slow<00:03:43.739> speed<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:45.120> I'll<00:03:45.180> see<00:03:45.359> how

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
this module slow speed so I'll see how

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.910 
this module slow speed so I'll see how
it<00:03:45.570> sounds<00:03:45.870> with<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> gearbox<00:03:46.380> coming<00:03:46.680> up<00:03:46.769> to

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
it sounds with the gearbox coming up to

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.340 
it sounds with the gearbox coming up to
it<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.450> little<00:03:48.450> bit<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.690> play<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:51.350> what's

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
it a little bit of play in this what's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.780 
it a little bit of play in this what's
already<00:03:52.590> somebody's<00:03:53.310> about<00:03:53.519> whether<00:03:53.670> these

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
already somebody's about whether these

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.460 
already somebody's about whether these
need<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.180> have<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.359> bearing<00:03:54.630> any<00:03:54.810> manatsu<00:03:55.200> for

need to have a bearing any manatsu for

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.160 
need to have a bearing any manatsu for
support<00:03:55.859> some<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.190> weight<00:03:56.840> now<00:03:57.840> obviously

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
support some of the weight now obviously

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.720 
support some of the weight now obviously
the<00:03:58.350> short<00:03:58.590> it'll<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> best<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.430> suppose

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the short it'll be the best I suppose

this in at the moment it'll be a quite
good<00:04:06.269> that's<00:04:06.569> obviously<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:06.989> end<00:04:07.230> with<00:04:07.380> a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
good that's obviously the end with a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.559 
good that's obviously the end with a

haven't<00:04:14.459> got<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> layering<00:04:15.389> like<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.019> just

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
haven't got a layering like that so just

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.140 
haven't got a layering like that so just
can<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.070> what<00:04:17.220> can<00:04:17.340> do<00:04:17.459> myself<00:04:17.609> really<00:04:17.970> i

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
can see what can do myself really i

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.300 
can see what can do myself really i
might<00:04:18.359> getting<00:04:18.630> at<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.870> these<00:04:18.959> made<00:04:19.229> up<00:04:19.310> as

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
might getting at one of these made up as

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.820 
might getting at one of these made up as
well<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:21.539> end<00:04:21.660> result<00:04:21.989> obviously<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.650> bit

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
well the end result obviously that bit

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.850 
well the end result obviously that bit
machine<00:04:23.190> on<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> end<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.990> obviously<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.770> on

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
machine on the end and obviously get on

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.440 
machine on the end and obviously get on
another<00:04:26.010> clutch<00:04:26.340> plate<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.789> get<00:04:26.909> center

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
another clutch plate to get center

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.620 
another clutch plate to get center
it<00:04:28.520> yeah<00:04:29.520> so<00:04:29.700> what<00:04:29.850> i<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:30.030> now<00:04:30.180> though<00:04:30.240> i<00:04:30.570> think

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
it yeah so what i do now though i think

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.760 
it yeah so what i do now though i think
i'll<00:04:30.930> learn<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.580> bit<00:04:32.580> tied<00:04:32.760> up<00:04:32.790> over<00:04:33.000> here<00:04:33.770> for

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
i'll learn a bit tied up over here for

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.110 
i'll learn a bit tied up over here for

things I was considering looking at it

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.940 
things I was considering looking at it
when<00:05:21.780> i<00:05:21.840> had<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.020> gearbox<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.620> is<00:05:22.740> where<00:05:22.860> we

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
when i had the gearbox in is where we

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.720 
when i had the gearbox in is where we
are<00:05:23.130> can<00:05:24.320> mount<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.500> alternator<00:05:25.890> or<00:05:26.340> any

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
are can mount the alternator or any

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.940 
are can mount the alternator or any
other<00:05:26.940> thing<00:05:27.120> that<00:05:27.150> I've<00:05:27.390> got<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:28.200> what<00:05:28.680> effect

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
other thing that I've got to what effect

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.770 
other thing that I've got to what effect
would<00:05:29.130> be<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.640> front<00:05:29.910> of<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.090> gearbox<00:05:30.510> and

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
would be in front of the gearbox and

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.870 
would be in front of the gearbox and
that<00:05:31.470> shaft<00:05:31.800> I<00:05:32.010> want<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.250> get<00:05:32.370> made<00:05:32.550> up<00:05:32.580> is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
that shaft I want to get made up is

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.650 
that shaft I want to get made up is
actually<00:05:33.150> try<00:05:33.390> and<00:05:33.420> put<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:35.570> basically<00:05:36.570> a

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
actually try and put a basically a

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.540 
actually try and put a basically a
pulley<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.050> their<00:05:37.290> dark<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.920> run<00:05:38.130> the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
pulley on their dark and run the

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.940 
pulley on their dark and run the
alternator<00:05:39.540> officer<00:05:40.080> Matthew<00:05:40.560> look<00:05:40.650> at<00:05:40.890> the

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
alternator officer Matthew look at the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.420 
alternator officer Matthew look at the
front<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.280> gearbox<00:05:41.700> free<00:05:42.600> inch<00:05:42.750> gap<00:05:42.960> between

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
front the gearbox free inch gap between

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.570 
front the gearbox free inch gap between
motor<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:45.050> valerian<00:05:46.050> we're<00:05:47.010> obviously<00:05:47.100> put<00:05:47.550> a

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
motor and valerian we're obviously put a

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.960 
motor and valerian we're obviously put a
belt<00:05:48.530> he<00:05:49.530> would<00:05:49.710> be<00:05:49.860> emergency<00:05:50.520> bill<00:05:50.700> that<00:05:50.880> you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
belt he would be emergency bill that you

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.810 
belt he would be emergency bill that you
can<00:05:51.150> put<00:05:51.540> together<00:05:51.660> can't<00:05:52.470> put<00:05:52.650> together<00:05:52.820> or

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
can put together can't put together or

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.180 
can put together can't put together or
Burma<00:05:54.270> build<00:05:54.480> that<00:05:54.600> you<00:05:54.720> can<00:05:54.870> actually<00:05:55.020> a<00:05:55.200> limb

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
Burma build that you can actually a limb

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.740 
Burma build that you can actually a limb
from<00:05:56.340> the<00:05:56.430> shorter<00:05:56.820> with<00:05:57.180> obviously<00:05:57.510> run<00:05:57.660> the

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
from the shorter with obviously run the

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.930 
from the shorter with obviously run the
alternator<00:05:58.110> off<00:05:58.320> of<00:05:58.470> here<00:05:58.710> thereby<00:05:59.460> saving

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
alternator off of here thereby saving

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.750 
alternator off of here thereby saving
obviously<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.540> amount<00:06:01.230> of<00:06:01.320> boner<00:06:01.760> dc-dc

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
obviously the amount of boner dc-dc

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.910 
obviously the amount of boner dc-dc
converter<00:06:03.600> then<00:06:04.140> my<00:06:04.350> mind<00:06:04.500> started<00:06:04.650> racing

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
converter then my mind started racing

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.230 
converter then my mind started racing
the<00:06:05.310> back<00:06:05.460> we've<00:06:05.610> also<00:06:05.760> actually<00:06:05.940> run<00:06:06.210> the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
the back we've also actually run the

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.020 
the back we've also actually run the
power<00:06:06.780> steering<00:06:07.170> pump<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.470> same<00:06:07.680> way<00:06:07.970> but<00:06:08.970> I

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
power steering pump the same way but I

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.910 
power steering pump the same way but I
down<00:06:09.210> jacket<00:06:09.930> obviously<00:06:10.200> too<00:06:10.350> much<00:06:10.470> power<00:06:10.740> out

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
down jacket obviously too much power out

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.310 
down jacket obviously too much power out
of<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.070> batteries<00:06:11.460> and<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:12.990> have<00:06:13.200> already

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
of the batteries and so I have already

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.840 
of the batteries and so I have already
got<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:15.080> electric<00:06:16.100> power<00:06:17.100> steering<00:06:17.190> pump<00:06:17.580> math

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
got a electric power steering pump math

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.370 
got a electric power steering pump math
sort<00:06:18.240> out<00:06:18.360> already<00:06:18.510> so<00:06:18.840> that<00:06:18.960> probably<00:06:19.230> the

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
sort out already so that probably the

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.400 
sort out already so that probably the
initial<00:06:19.890> idea<00:06:20.670> for<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:21.900> still<00:06:22.200> what<00:06:22.320> the

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
initial idea for that we still what the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.260 
initial idea for that we still what the
original<00:06:22.470> reservoir<00:06:23.190> for<00:06:23.400> over<00:06:23.730> there<00:06:23.940> and

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
original reservoir for over there and

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.840 
original reservoir for over there and
the<00:06:25.200> pipes<00:06:25.440> that<00:06:25.620> just<00:06:25.830> been<00:06:25.980> blocked<00:06:26.220> up<00:06:26.430> so

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
the pipes that just been blocked up so

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.520 
the pipes that just been blocked up so
yeah<00:06:27.000> I'll<00:06:27.150> give<00:06:27.600> up<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:27.720> bit<00:06:27.900> more<00:06:28.020> working

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
yeah I'll give up a bit more working

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.520 
yeah I'll give up a bit more working
hopefully<00:06:28.800> sometimes<00:06:29.640> in<00:06:29.790> a<00:06:29.850> week<00:06:29.970> I'll<00:06:30.290> be<00:06:31.290> a

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
hopefully sometimes in a week I'll be a

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.590 
hopefully sometimes in a week I'll be a
metal<00:06:31.800> plate<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:33.030> now<00:06:33.240> I've<00:06:33.300> got<00:06:33.420> some

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
metal plate and now I've got some

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.660 
metal plate and now I've got some
measurements<00:06:33.990> are<00:06:34.080> obviously<00:06:34.440> got<00:06:34.590> my<00:06:34.770> other

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
measurements are obviously got my other

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.250 
measurements are obviously got my other
the<00:06:35.850> example<00:06:36.300> just<00:06:36.480> take<00:06:36.570> along<00:06:36.780> with<00:06:36.870> me<00:06:37.020> and

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
the example just take along with me and

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.100 
the example just take along with me and
see<00:06:38.190> what's<00:06:38.340> going<00:06:38.430> to<00:06:38.520> our<00:06:38.610> next<00:06:38.850> few<00:06:38.970> days

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
see what's going to our next few days

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.500 
see what's going to our next few days
off<00:06:40.260> now
