00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
nicely and I realize that but not bad at

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630 
nicely and I realize that but not bad at
all<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:29.350> believe<00:02:29.410> these<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:29.950> pretty<00:02:30.460> damn

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
all and I believe these are pretty damn

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.430 
all and I believe these are pretty damn
cheap<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:31.060> well<00:02:31.210> come<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.690> exact<00:02:31.930> price<00:02:32.140> point

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
cheap as well come the exact price point

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.350 
cheap as well come the exact price point
but<00:02:32.500> if<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.800> run<00:02:33.130> about<00:02:33.250> 40<00:02:33.490> 50<00:02:33.760> quid<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.180> it's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
but if we run about 40 50 quid so it's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.840 
but if we run about 40 50 quid so it's
not<00:02:34.480> too<00:02:34.690> shabby<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.740> that's<00:02:36.460> pretty<00:02:36.610> much<00:02:36.730> it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
not too shabby and that's pretty much it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.460 
not too shabby and that's pretty much it
