00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hey guys this is emerald fire and today

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.830 
hey guys this is emerald fire and today
I'm<00:00:02.700> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.030> show<00:00:03.240> you<00:00:03.300> how<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.629> do

I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.630 
I'm going to show you how to do
something<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.410> lot<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.680> people<00:00:04.830> have<00:00:05.279> wanted<00:00:05.460> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
something a lot of people have wanted to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.870 
something a lot of people have wanted to
do<00:00:05.879> for<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.180> very<00:00:06.509> long<00:00:06.779> time<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:08.250> give

do for a very long time and that is give

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.509 
do for a very long time and that is give
dyed<00:00:09.240> armor<00:00:09.750> with<00:00:09.960> command<00:00:10.380> blocks<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
dyed armor with command blocks this is

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.390 
dyed armor with command blocks this is
in<00:00:12.090> snapshot<00:00:12.690> 13-week<00:00:13.530> 36b<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.719> 1.7<00:00:16.710> jeff

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
in snapshot 13-week 36b and in 1.7 jeff

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880 
in snapshot 13-week 36b and in 1.7 jeff
has<00:00:17.640> implemented<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.510> new<00:00:18.750> data<00:00:19.109> tag<00:00:19.410> system

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
has implemented a new data tag system

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300 
has implemented a new data tag system
that<00:00:20.400> allows<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:21.060> editing<00:00:21.900> NBT<00:00:22.500> tags<00:00:22.769> with

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that allows for editing NBT tags with

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.759 
that allows for editing NBT tags with
command<00:00:23.670> blocks<00:00:24.199> previously<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.410> had<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> use

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
command blocks previously you had to use

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.099 
command blocks previously you had to use
mcedit<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.750> no<00:00:27.930> way

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
mcedit to do this and there was no way

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
mcedit to do this and there was no way
to<00:00:28.140> use<00:00:28.349> command<00:00:28.859> blocks<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.310> give<00:00:29.460> died<00:00:29.670> on

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
to use command blocks to give died on

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.440 
to use command blocks to give died on
but<00:00:30.570> now<00:00:30.750> there<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.130> have<00:00:32.579> set<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:32.969> some

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
but now there is so I have set up some

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
but now there is so I have set up some
examples<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:35.000> set<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.030> red<00:00:36.980> white

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
examples right here I set up red white

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.090 
examples right here I set up red white
yellow<00:00:38.219> green<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:38.879> blue<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.440> purple<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
yellow green and blue and the purple I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.400 
yellow green and blue and the purple I
will<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> camera<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.960> show<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.170> how

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
will do on camera so I can show you how

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.690 
will do on camera so I can show you how
to<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.430> basically<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.930> is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
to do it but basically what this is is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.170 
to do it but basically what this is is
give<00:00:47.840> @p<00:00:49.250> 299<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> change<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
give @p 299 and you can change this to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
give @p 299 and you can change this to
anything<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.930> 299<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.190> data<00:00:53.399> value<00:00:53.760> for

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
anything and 299 is the data value for

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.610 
anything and 299 is the data value for
the<00:00:54.030> tunic<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.340> zero<00:00:56.340> data<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the tunic one and zero data and this is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.029 
the tunic one and zero data and this is
the<00:00:59.280> tag<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.329> changes<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> color<00:01:01.199> display

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
the tag that changes the color display

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.060 
the tag that changes the color display
color<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> number<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.890> if

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
color and then this number here now if

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.700 
color and then this number here now if
you<00:01:05.100> go<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.670> scroll<00:01:06.119> over<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.930> tunic<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> will

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
you go and scroll over the tunic it will

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
you go and scroll over the tunic it will
say<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> color<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.640> hexadecimal<00:01:09.260> but<00:01:10.260> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
say the color in hexadecimal but this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
say the color in hexadecimal but this
only<00:01:11.040> accepts<00:01:11.610> color<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.150> decimal<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.470> you'll

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
only accepts color in decimal so you'll

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.249 
only accepts color in decimal so you'll
have<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:14.790> online<00:01:14.970> converter<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.110> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
have to use an online converter for that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.580 
have to use an online converter for that
just<00:01:16.920> Google<00:01:17.509> hexadecimal<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.540> numeric<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
just Google hexadecimal to numeric and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.920 
just Google hexadecimal to numeric and
click<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.400> feeling<00:01:20.880> lucky<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.780> will

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
click I'm feeling lucky and that will

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
click I'm feeling lucky and that will
take<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> website<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.189> allows<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
take you to a website that allows you to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.990 
take you to a website that allows you to
convert<00:01:24.450> hexadecimal<00:01:25.409> values<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:26.310> decimal

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
convert hexadecimal values to decimal

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.830 
convert hexadecimal values to decimal
values<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.229> let's<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> purple<00:01:29.640> one<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.970> have

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
values so let's do the purple one I have

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.920 
values so let's do the purple one I have
here<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.500> leather<00:01:31.979> tunic<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.700> some<00:01:33.450> purple<00:01:33.780> dye

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
here a leather tunic and some purple dye

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.929 
here a leather tunic and some purple dye
and<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.619> course<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.070> can<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.520> many<00:01:35.640> dyes

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and of course you can use as many dyes

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
and of course you can use as many dyes
as<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.990> whatever<00:01:37.200> color

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
as you want to make it whatever color

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
as you want to make it whatever color
you<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.729> always<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you want it will always have a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.149 
you want it will always have a
hexadecimal<00:01:39.570> value<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.770> converted

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
hexadecimal value that can be converted

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.380 
hexadecimal value that can be converted
so<00:01:42.000> I'll<00:01:42.479> take<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:44.250> I'll<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.640> go

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
so I'll take this and now I'll just go

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.010 
so I'll take this and now I'll just go
to<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.110> website<00:01:47.000> where<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.270> converts<00:01:48.659> them

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
to that website where it converts them

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.410 
to that website where it converts them
now<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.130> can<00:01:50.159> use<00:01:50.399> any<00:01:50.610> website<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> course

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
now you can use any website of course

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.109 
now you can use any website of course
it's<00:01:51.630> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> same<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.820> hexadecimal

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it's all the same and the hexadecimal

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:05.389 
it's all the same and the hexadecimal
number<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.790> 7<00:01:56.790> f3<00:01:57.780> f<00:01:58.140> b2<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.939> 7<00:02:00.950> f3<00:02:01.950> f<00:02:02.360> b2<00:02:04.399> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
number is 7 f3 f b2 so 7 f3 f b2 and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.160 
number is 7 f3 f b2 so 7 f3 f b2 and
then<00:02:06.329> we'll<00:02:06.600> convert<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.799> decimal<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
then we'll convert that to decimal and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
then we'll convert that to decimal and
we<00:02:10.170> get

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
we get

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.580 
we get
eight<00:02:11.980> three<00:02:12.489> three<00:02:12.640> nine<00:02:13.269> three<00:02:13.629> seven<00:02:14.290> eight

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
eight three three nine three seven eight
