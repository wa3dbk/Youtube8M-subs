a quick update for you an overview of
the<00:00:10.590> winter<00:00:11.040> models<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.639> how<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.880> output

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the winter models and how the output

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.419 
the winter models and how the output
from<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.750> models<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.410> looking<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.160> at<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
from the models is looking just at the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.189 
from the models is looking just at the
moment<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.059> we've<00:00:15.330> got<00:00:15.450> some<00:00:15.599> fresh<00:00:15.780> output

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
moment and we've got some fresh output

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.500 
moment and we've got some fresh output
now<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> models<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.210> course<00:00:18.390> we're

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
now from the models and of course we're

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.550 
now from the models and of course we're
getting<00:00:18.720> pretty<00:00:18.810> close<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> winter

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560

approaching winter from a climate model
point<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.070> view<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.340> i<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.579> wanted<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.880> run

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
point of view and i just wanted to run

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
point of view and i just wanted to run
through<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.559> latest<00:00:34.770> thoughts<00:00:35.190> are

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
through what the latest thoughts are

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.020 
through what the latest thoughts are
with<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.870> output<00:00:37.469> from<00:00:37.500> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
with you this is the output from the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
with you this is the output from the
japanese<00:00:39.030> model<00:00:39.420> i'm<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.690> gonna<00:00:39.780> zoom<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> on

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
japanese model i'm just gonna zoom in on

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.209 
japanese model i'm just gonna zoom in on
to<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.230> there<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to that one for you there we go so this

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
to that one for you there we go so this
is<00:00:44.340> predicted<00:00:44.789> temperature<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:46.170> december

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
is predicted temperature for december

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
is predicted temperature for december
january<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.300> February's<00:00:48.300> temperature

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
january and February's temperature

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.299 
january and February's temperature
anomaly<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.610> i<00:00:51.379> think<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.980> stands

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
anomaly and i think really what stands

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
anomaly and i think really what stands
out<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.840> depth<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.320> cold<00:00:55.649> look

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
out there is the depth of cold look

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
out there is the depth of cold look
across<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.399> new<00:00:56.520> colors<00:00:56.820> come<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.210> little

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
across the new colors come out a little

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.869 
across the new colors come out a little
bit<00:00:57.629> more<00:00:57.809> there<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:59.070> depth<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.550> cold

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
bit more there we go the depth of cold

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
bit more there we go the depth of cold
look<00:01:00.090> across<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> british<00:01:00.809> isles<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> much

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
look across the british isles and much

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
look across the british isles and much
of<00:01:01.500> Europe<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.399> gone<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.000> temperatures

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
of Europe this has gone for temperatures

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.670 
of Europe this has gone for temperatures
of<00:01:03.979> if<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.070> bring<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> temperature<00:01:05.549> scale<00:01:06.150> up

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
of if we bring the temperature scale up

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
of if we bring the temperature scale up
we're<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.950> getting<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.340> into<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
we're kind of getting down into one and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
we're kind of getting down into one and
a<00:01:09.360> half<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:09.900> world<00:01:10.350> 1.2<00:01:10.950> degrees<00:01:11.250> Celsius

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
a half two world 1.2 degrees Celsius

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.030 
a half two world 1.2 degrees Celsius
below<00:01:12.030> normal<00:01:12.600> temperatures<00:01:13.080> throughout<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
below normal temperatures throughout the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.440 
below normal temperatures throughout the
winter<00:01:14.159> season<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.850> course<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> doesn't

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
winter season of course that doesn't

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
winter season of course that doesn't
mean<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.930> cold<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> way

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
mean that it's cold right the way

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.700 
mean that it's cold right the way
through<00:01:16.830> by<00:01:17.250> any<00:01:17.490> means<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.530> does

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
through by any means but and it does

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
through by any means but and it does
mean<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> certainly<00:01:20.520> when<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.880> take<00:01:21.060> 20

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
mean that certainly when you take 20

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
mean that certainly when you take 20
season<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> whole<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.830> we're<00:01:23.369> looking<00:01:23.640> at

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
season as a whole that we're looking at

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
season as a whole that we're looking at
some<00:01:23.909> cold<00:01:24.210> temperatures<00:01:24.659> according<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
some cold temperatures according to the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
some cold temperatures according to the
to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> Japanese<00:01:27.000> model<00:01:27.450> quite<00:01:27.630> interesting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
to the Japanese model quite interesting

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
to the Japanese model quite interesting
to<00:01:28.500> see<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> warm<00:01:29.070> weather<00:01:29.220> across<00:01:29.520> central

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to see this warm weather across central

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.390 
to see this warm weather across central
parts<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.299> Asia<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.619> look<00:01:31.799> how<00:01:31.950> cold<00:01:32.250> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
parts of Asia but just look how cold it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
parts of Asia but just look how cold it
is<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> eastern<00:01:33.689> parts<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.110> Russia<00:01:34.409> and

temperatures<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.549> its<00:04:18.940> probability<00:04:19.390> of

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
temperatures and its probability of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.960

above<00:04:20.590> nor<00:04:20.860> near<00:04:21.190> normal<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.640> below<00:04:21.820> normal

above nor near normal and below normal

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.940 
above nor near normal and below normal
temperatures<00:04:22.390> so<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:23.230> is<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.620> probability

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
temperatures so this is the probability

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.920 
temperatures so this is the probability
of<00:04:24.220> above<00:04:24.490> normal<00:04:24.520> temperatures<00:04:25.000> you<00:04:25.240> sit<00:04:25.420> 220

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
of above normal temperatures you sit 220

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.480 
of above normal temperatures you sit 220
and<00:04:26.050> below<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.040> quite<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> low

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
still white still in this color so it's

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.610 
still white still in this color so it's
equal<00:04:33.760> weighting<00:04:34.330> given<00:04:34.630> to<00:04:35.110> where<00:04:35.380> near

it's<00:06:02.350> been<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> tricky<00:06:02.860> one<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.040> try<00:06:03.280> and<00:06:03.400> pin

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
bit over the winter forecast but I'm

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.480 
bit over the winter forecast but I'm

we run down the middle of the winter in
terms<00:06:12.070> of<00:06:12.220> temperature<00:06:12.700> but<00:06:13.300> what<00:06:13.510> we<00:06:13.630> do<00:06:13.840> see

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
terms of temperature but what we do see

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.010 
terms of temperature but what we do see
is<00:06:14.350> some<00:06:15.130> spikes<00:06:15.610> of<00:06:15.940> sort<00:06:16.120> of<00:06:16.210> four<00:06:16.450> five<00:06:16.720> six

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020

spikes<00:06:19.450> that<00:06:19.990> become<00:06:20.290> very<00:06:20.770> cold<00:06:21.160> and<00:06:21.820> so<00:06:22.180> it

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
spikes that become very cold and so it

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.610 
spikes that become very cold and so it
could<00:06:22.419> be<00:06:22.450> seen<00:06:22.750> in<00:06:23.080> a<00:06:23.169> nighttime

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620

freezing<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.390> will<00:06:27.480> go<00:06:27.600> on<00:06:27.630> for<00:06:27.750> runs<00:06:28.050> are

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
freezing and it will go on for runs are

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.630 
freezing and it will go on for runs are
perhaps<00:06:28.350> four<00:06:28.680> or<00:06:28.890> five<00:06:29.130> days<00:06:29.340> but

perhaps four or five days but

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.820 
perhaps four or five days but
interspersed<00:06:30.540> with<00:06:30.810> those<00:06:30.960> will<00:06:31.440> be<00:06:31.470> near

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
interspersed with those will be near

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.350 
interspersed with those will be near
normal<00:06:32.220> or<00:06:32.400> perhaps<00:06:32.580> even<00:06:32.790> warmer<00:06:33.210> than

normal or perhaps even warmer than
normal<00:06:33.420> temperatures<00:06:33.930> so<00:06:34.470> we'll<00:06:34.620> come<00:06:34.770> out<00:06:34.920> at

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
normal temperatures so we'll come out at

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.880 
normal temperatures so we'll come out at
the<00:06:35.040> end<00:06:35.130> of<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.460> winter<00:06:36.350> with<00:06:37.350> mean

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
the end of the winter with mean

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.650 
the end of the winter with mean
temperatures<00:06:38.310> probably<00:06:38.460> a<00:06:38.730> degree<00:06:39.210> well<00:06:39.450> half

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030 
a degree to a degree below normal for

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.060 
a degree to a degree below normal for
the<00:06:42.570> winter<00:06:42.870> period<00:06:43.080> although<00:06:43.650> that<00:06:43.860> won't

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
the winter period although that won't

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.010 
the winter period although that won't
tell<00:06:44.550> the<00:06:44.640> whole<00:06:44.850> story<00:06:45.060> because<00:06:45.420> I<00:06:45.660> think<00:06:45.720> it

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
tell the whole story because I think it

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.420 
tell the whole story because I think it
will<00:06:46.350> be<00:06:46.530> a<00:06:46.560> winter<00:06:46.920> where<00:06:47.100> we'll<00:06:47.250> see

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
will be a winter where we'll see

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.460 
will be a winter where we'll see
run-of-the-mill<00:06:48.180> temperatures<00:06:48.840> but<00:06:48.990> dipped

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
run-of-the-mill temperatures but dipped

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.070 
run-of-the-mill temperatures but dipped
into<00:06:49.740> very<00:06:50.370> cold<00:06:50.790> conditions<00:06:50.850> and<00:06:51.480> I<00:06:51.660> do<00:06:51.720> by

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
into very cold conditions and I do by

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.040 
into very cold conditions and I do by
this<00:06:52.260> idea<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:53.730> Japanese<00:06:54.150> model<00:06:54.480> of<00:06:54.570> it<00:06:54.900> being

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
this idea the Japanese model of it being

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.570 
this idea the Japanese model of it being
generally<00:06:55.440> dry<00:06:55.710> as<00:06:55.770> well<00:06:56.040> with<00:06:56.220> high<00:06:56.370> pressure

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
generally dry as well with high pressure

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.070 
generally dry as well with high pressure
to<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:56.820> north<00:06:56.940> low<00:06:57.330> pressure<00:06:57.630> down<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:57.990> the

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 
to the north low pressure down to the

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.320 
to the north low pressure down to the
south<00:06:58.260> side<00:06:58.500> I<00:06:58.710> think<00:06:59.190> we'll<00:06:59.370> see<00:06:59.580> drier<00:07:00.150> than

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.330 
south side I think we'll see drier than

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.640 
south side I think we'll see drier than
normal<00:07:00.390> conditions<00:07:00.720> but<00:07:01.170> certainly<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.590> think

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
normal conditions but certainly I think

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.260 
normal conditions but certainly I think
we<00:07:01.920> are<00:07:02.040> going<00:07:02.220> to<00:07:02.280> be<00:07:02.340> going<00:07:02.490> into<00:07:02.730> some

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
we are going to be going into some

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.570 
we are going to be going into some
pretty<00:07:03.720> cold<00:07:04.020> spells<00:07:04.500> through<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:05.250> coming

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
pretty cold spells through the coming

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.550 
pretty cold spells through the coming
winter<00:07:05.820> although<00:07:06.300> not<00:07:06.330> a<00:07:06.810> run-of-the-mill

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
winter although not a run-of-the-mill

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.860 
winter although not a run-of-the-mill
cold<00:07:08.040> winter<00:07:08.340> right<00:07:08.520> through<00:07:08.910> all<00:07:09.570> right<00:07:09.720> and

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
cold winter right through all right and

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.900 
cold winter right through all right and
certainly<00:07:10.410> more<00:07:10.770> than<00:07:10.830> the<00:07:11.280> one<00:07:11.550> that<00:07:11.700> cold

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
certainly more than the one that cold

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.030
