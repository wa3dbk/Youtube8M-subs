00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
defense but Brady look them up and I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.210 
defense but Brady look them up and I
don't<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.750> he's<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
don't think he's going to

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.280
