00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everyone my name is zadrot and this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.830
 video on the channel mess since release 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 new generation consoles have passed 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 quite a lot of time but still far 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 not everyone managed to get a new one 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.400
 playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.960
 I will help you to make a choice 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 breed holivar about what kind of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 console better whether I faster sexier 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.369
 I will not but better tell you about kim 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.260
 the waters of x-box one and ps4 because with these 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.630
 devices in your hands you have to spend 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.949
 not one year of his life, therefore we will not 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.320
 rely on chance 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.360
 Let's start with the appearance of this item 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.750
 exceptional civic but without him 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.790
 no way 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.219
 and sony and microsoft did not invent 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.379
 nothing radically new here everything is like 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.969
 formerly more powerful at the Xbox 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.760
 gamepad with a symmetrical arrangement 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.950
 sony sticks are dual from childhood 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 shock with two mushrooms on the bottom 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.329
 the box controller is entirely made of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.370
 practical matte plastic which is not 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.989
 collects dirt but precisely because of this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.270
 gamepad does not cause practicality 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.309
 holiday feeling at dior shock more 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
 chic glossy inserts under the blocks 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 buttons rough textured plastic 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.659
 on the case and generally somehow fashionable led shock 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.330
 has more compact dimensions than 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.760
 xbox one gamepad but despite this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.189
 difference they are both equally comfortable lie in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.140
 The hands of the Xbox are very comfortable 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.299
 absolutely disgusting shift and they 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 very large and more likely to interfere with the game 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.189
 what microsoft started to repair what is not 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.020
 it was incomprehensibly broken everything else was like 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.119
 and in the previous version unless 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 crossbar brought into proper form and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.500
 gamepad sony in terms of buttons and convenience 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 use almost nothing has changed 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.909
 the Japanese continue to hone working 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.189
 scheme and do not mold excess cross 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.799
 divided into four button segments 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.320
 big soft sticks finally concave 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.079
 inside they are convex as before butts and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.630
 looked like they trace the triggers that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.640
 from the previous version it is more convenient for someone 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.649
 asymmetrical arrangement of sticks on 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.630
 manners Xbox and someone burns away 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.100
 classics and recognizes only sleep Nevsky 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.439
 felt boots 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.360
 in fact, this is all taste and every 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.720
 of the options you get used to read 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.210
 clock 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.500
 but next jen would not be himself if 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.200
 engineers have not decided to experiment 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 and do not shove gamepads any 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.350
 microsoft 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 limited to the fact that he or the hammers 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.220
 built-in vibration motor me at first 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.350
 pores it's cool but no 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 has no application value in sony 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.030
 went ahead and stuffed into a new pot 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.680
 In general, all that is found in stock 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.300
 Now in the gamepad from the speaker through 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.430
 which sounds additional sounds 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.680
 touch panel on which you can have fun 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.860
 carry a finger and a button cher which 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.840
 allows you to start streaming in two clicks and 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.000
 a huge glowing lamp among us 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 there are strange and mysterious people who 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.530
 connect a 3cott gamepad on its own 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.569
 I will talk to them a little now 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.090
 and while you can be away peak 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.530
 matters unequivocally wins xbox 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.780
 controller because it does not require 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.060
 no dancing with a tambourine hooked up 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.130
 cord and enjoy all the work 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.360
 but to make the pot completely 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.790
 works with your computer 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.100
 have to suffer a little download 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.590
 driver reassign buttons and zapnut 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.450
 for faithfulness microsoft hard 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 refuses to achieve modern 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.470
 technology does not equip gamepad 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.329
 the battery will therefore have what 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.190
 youth stock up on batteries and 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.350
 convulsively change them right in the middle 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.390
 sony's important battle is easier 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.609
 built-in battery which means 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.709
 no problems forces gamepad connect 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.440
 him on the cord and keep playing and he 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.510
 the ps4 gamepad is slowly charging 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.730
 headphones connect through normal 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.739
 microjack microsoft has traditionally its 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.840
 special way the headset connects by 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.120
 dumb proprietor us at the connector 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.989
 the main thing I told you and you yourself decide 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.440
 what is closer to you 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.769
 and then you sit like an owl with your perk 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.769
 even ashamed
