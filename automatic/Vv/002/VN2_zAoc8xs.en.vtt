00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 me 

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.200
 Yes we will introduce time that is it is here 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.800
 Cree t 6 led 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.180
 e 7 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.440
 It is equipped with seven benefits 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.539
 The body is an ultrafire handy light 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.300
 is not it 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.320
 Notation here 9000 lumens 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.620
 It is a very high number very bright 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.870
 Now De' It is light 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.960
 is a state that does not listen to x stations, of course, even here. 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 I can buy 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.590
 It's a tube extension tube It's this exercise station. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 A long state ah 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.070
 It is extended and one more battery 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 Since it entered many 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.190
 Many people think that it will be used in the state attached here in this state 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.190
 I will 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.329
 Put this on 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.369
 It's amazing condition 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.580
 Again 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:20.060
 I would like to compare a little, so it is this common flashlight to compare 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.060
 I would like a little compared to here you have a huge study 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.719
 First of all this is general 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.719
 It is a flashlight 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:41.880
 It's outdoors but it's a normal flashlight like this 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.880
 I think it has been open to this extent 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 Cree's there 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 I will go through 9000 lumens 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.899
 It is this brightness 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.670
 It is awful red 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:05.330
 Of course there is brightness more than car headlights 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.330
 It can be illuminated very brightly in a fairly wide range 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.210
 Here's how it compares to this 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.820
 It is a common plump 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.820
 This difference in brightness is totally different 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.060
 But it is the explanation of the mode 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.960
 This now 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.270
 It is high mode 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:28.050
 When you press it halfway 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.490
 It is a mode that takes water , but even middle ones are very bright. 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.190
 Old prison mode when you make another edition 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.670
 Contact with it once more half press 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.670
 strobe 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.740
 But this is sos mode in one and a half press 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.819
 Also containing also it was from sos mode I think trouble and Tsu ticking 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.750
 It has become a form hey hey 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.930
 If you press it deeply and it disappears 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.430
 Yes back 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 It is a form 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.610
 It has become a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.360
 It is very easy to use because it has foliage and functions 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.360
 It is point 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 Because it is a very bright light 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.430
 Don't look straight ahead 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.060
 Please be careful 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.560
 Normal and explained 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.950
 To the end 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.950
 Because umbrella
