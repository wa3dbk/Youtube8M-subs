00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello dear readers 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.190
 site visitors guessing liquid and not 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.350
 forget that super dresser and today we 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.640
 Get acquainted with the share of the phone Nokia c6 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 I will immediately tell you what percentage we have 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.980
 preliminary PR games preliminary 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 some review percentage 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.359
 the phone is in our hands 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.130
 prototype 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 he is not yet Cyrillic 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 keyboard and he still has a vacuum 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.800
 absolutely sarah firmware external 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.650
 Russian language support 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.630
 and in principle our reviews this will be 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.040
 worker touching anb his appearance 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.900
 mean what can be said about it 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.840
 machine 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.020
 I most of all but this phone reminds 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.900
 model up to 3 thousand 8 November 2 first unit 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.329
 but Kia Spectrum and system 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.760
 this is 65 editions 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.630
 and fundamentally 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.800
 it looks like it is under these three hardware 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 buttons and has not been added here so 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.929
 here 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.370
 quartet keyboard 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.600
 and most resembling a quartet 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 keyboard lonely 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.010
 m 97 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.110
 but for comparison 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.299
 put the truth from Wed 6 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.700
 but those did work on the bugs and 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 but a political analyst of four has established 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.659
 row 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.130
 instead of three years 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.090
 but about very similar it is though my 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.080
 look here loggie 26 more comfortable 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.670
 Thanks to this was such a button 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.250
 which means 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.030
 what would like to say about it 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.060
 machine 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.860
 and he has very nice plastic 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.250
 matt body 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 it is equipped with five megapixel 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.020
 camera 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.050
 LED backlight scene 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.210
 he has 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.550
 headphone jack 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.660
 it has a port of micro devices bin 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.340
 but apparently they can not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.810
 used to charge 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.160
 because there is such a 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.460
 connector 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.960
 which will be used 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.570
 standards 1 but those that will 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.420
 used as an option 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.850
 In-line device, LLC should say that 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.439
 he percent button 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.340
 lock screen 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.470
 moved them 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.990
 on the right side 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.669
 that is, if earlier about 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.129
 n97 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.039
 interest 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.689
 it was possible to use 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.989
 radd 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.839
 on the sides of the models 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 the percentage is done on the right side 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.479
 that is actually holders under the right 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.119
 arm 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.449
 we she quote capacious round not middle finger 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.449
 more percentage 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.649
 left panels posted holiday 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:45.649
 for memory cards 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.369
 so here 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.069
 percent 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.469
 this solution allows you to change 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.559
 I do not understand the communicator cards 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.709
 turn off the phone 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.890
 Is there a camera button justified? 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.709
 with a very soft move worth saying 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.249
 I have not visited such a soft move 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.439
 I met in one phone now 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.559
 key them 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:08.999
 percent 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.739
 for volume control 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.139
 percent what else is he worth saying 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.109
 I would also note 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:17.889
 n 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.059
 that's for sure a loud speaker 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.919
 he used to music im 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.989
 and it is not typical for Nokia 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.219
 here is such 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.289
 soak for cover 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:32.609
 which 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.039
 would be more suitable for phones say 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.599
 all emotions 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.969
 usually nokia 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.459
 use either shifting 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.309
 cover either detachable without 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.849
 no locking devices 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.069
 means that we have 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.159
 here 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.819
 battery 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.350
 capacity yu 1200 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.529
 less than 5 hours 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.429
 and so here 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.429
 made up with a heart attack 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.789
 everything is simple enough 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.619
 no surprises 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 there is no 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.979
 as i said oao program 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.669
 in this apparatus of the capital 6 percent 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.459
 in this will protest the operating 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.639
 s60 system 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.330
 this is edited 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.389
 and in principle, nothing new what we have not yet 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.919
 seen this unit does not give 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.990
 but in fact this is probably all 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.140
 read on our review, see 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.629
 m photos 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.719
 remind black something 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:42.719
 nor final sample is a prototype 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.990
 but woo there is reason to believe that he 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.610
 by hardware 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.990
 everything will be exactly the same as the program 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.090
 profession 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.100
 we may talk separately thanks for 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.840
 Attention 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.010
 stay with us
