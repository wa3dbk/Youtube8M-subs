00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello how about youtube friends talk about your 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.240
 friend is light up and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.030
 today I want to make this a box 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920
 Sing a new ipad 2 I just 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 to buy 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.279
 At the time I know it's not a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 Novelty I know it's been a while since it came out 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.860
 but I just want to show off the day 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.980
 from today nothing but there is a small 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.220
 detail that I did not like much about this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 ipad is one of to have two of two 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.000
 gigas forgiveness of 16 gigas that buy in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.240
 Sam's Club 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.580
 But when they gave it to me, 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.810
 came with a and with the plastic or the 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.710
 nylon that comes with the sealed 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.719
 so 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 I asked the girl yes because 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.190
 it was not totally sealed and I 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 he says that because they have to open 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.580
 the boxes to check that the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.450
 good product 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.550
 but then well I said no way no if I 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.320
 they have to be like this but you lose a 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.890
 little bit what is the emotion of opening 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 this package of your new 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.530
 the device and then I think that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.700
 those of apple do their biggest effort 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.970
 to make a very nice box so that 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.940
 let's have a good experience when opening 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.420
 our device but good they give it to me 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 no money nylon that brings the plastic and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.850
 apart from everything when I open it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.210
 there in front of them is also like that 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.840
 can you believe that comes covered with 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 nylon 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.009
 I do not remember what that name is called 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.880
 plastic but it's like to wrap 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.860
 food then really if it is for 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.200
 they broke their heads to make a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.120
 wrap that we users 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.610
 we could enjoy then 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.770
 imagine having to uncover is a 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.740
 new device and that comes like this 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.250
 can you imagine what I was saying 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.950
 steve jobs the day of eye and seeing one of 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.950
 their devices involved that way 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.740
 and ok 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:42.150
 I do not know where the ticket was but good 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.220
 ipad is bought at Sams and Sam's Club 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.739
 and then I tell them if I wanted to make a 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.390
 boxing here more perron we wanted the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.870
 that make the galaxy 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.760
 but if I get away with that then 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 but still I tell you where I say 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.990
 because it is wrapped with that thing and I 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.990
 says this just take it off now 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.040
 so 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.920
 for me no no 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.560
 you can have 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.340
 and ethics or I do not know what to call him 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340
 why 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.470
 Well, I repeat the apple ones 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.830
 he breaks his head to make his 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.830
 packaging 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.530
 why 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.970
 Well, those of Sam's Club come up with 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.970
 wrap it in this crap 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.470
 no more dose 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.980
 well and I told the person that yes 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.660
 they did not have one completely sealed and I 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.170
 they say do not look from all the opened 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.420
 to check them and I get what I got 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:01.230
 I take out another box and the other box comes 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.520
 wrapped the same in this way 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.690
 and I said that tranza 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.890
 the detail is that there is no other store 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:16.530
 here in lazaro good i live lazaro 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.530
 cÃ¡rdenas is the city of mexico 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.170
 Well, there is no other store where I could 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.900
 get 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.720
 although right now seeing it well I thought 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 that did not bring what was this case 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.100
 our plastic joints 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.870
 if it attracts 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.560
 but in the same way see it wrapped all 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.560
 that cochinero 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.889
 It does not give a good feeling but good and 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.510
 here I have the ipad 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.370
 there are injured 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.370
 of 16 gigas is golden 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.620
 and well 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.380
 this like this is exciting to have your 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.320
 device tell them I know it's not a 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:13.360
 Novelty but it is the first time 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:17.440
 I have it with a good sacrifice has 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.680
 cost a bit to get it 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.370
 and it is a satisfaction to obtain it 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.210
 but good this 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.639
 I'm going to cut the video here 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.220
 I hope that those of sam's do not return 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.280
 to happen to do this and I hope it is 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.870
 for some day you can watch this video and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.240
