00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.849 
and bring back in our sled we can then
cut<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.710> front<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.039> back<00:00:30.710> exactly<00:00:31.710> two

cut our front and back exactly two

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.880 
cut our front and back exactly two
lengths<00:00:32.099> I'm<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> put<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> square

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
lengths I'm going to put the square

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.790 
lengths I'm going to put the square
reference<00:00:34.890> edge<00:00:35.130> against<00:00:36.000> my<00:00:36.180> fence<00:00:36.800> square

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
reference edge against my fence square

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.840 
reference edge against my fence square
one<00:00:38.010> end<00:00:39.170> market<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> length<00:00:40.559> set<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> stop

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
one end market the length set a stop

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.959 
one end market the length set a stop
block<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.809> end<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.579> exactly<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
block so that I end up with exactly the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.380 
block so that I end up with exactly the
same<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.629> front<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> back

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.060 

now<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:55.570> I've<00:00:55.660> got<00:00:55.840> that<00:00:56.020> one<00:00:56.170> end<00:00:56.350> squared<00:00:56.800> I

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
now that I've got that one end squared I

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
now that I've got that one end squared I
can<00:00:57.970> take<00:00:58.240> it<00:00:58.270> right<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.770> my<00:00:59.950> layout<00:01:00.820> stick

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
can take it right to my layout stick

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.580 
can take it right to my layout stick
make<00:01:01.300> sure<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.540> turn<00:01:01.720> off<00:01:01.780> your<00:01:01.930> saw<00:01:02.230> first

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
make sure you turn off your saw first

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.510 
make sure you turn off your saw first
and<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.840> can<00:01:05.290> line<00:01:05.560> it<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.860> right<00:01:06.280> with<00:01:06.430> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
and I can line it up right with the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.870 
and I can line it up right with the
outside<00:01:06.910> edge<00:01:07.090> there<00:01:09.900> transfer<00:01:10.900> my<00:01:11.140> mark<00:01:11.880> for

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
outside edge there transfer my mark for

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.680 
outside edge there transfer my mark for
the<00:01:13.170> length<00:01:14.170> of<00:01:14.320> my<00:01:14.970> front<00:01:15.970> piece<00:01:16.180> here<00:01:16.450> and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
the length of my front piece here and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.840 
the length of my front piece here and
now<00:01:16.990> i<00:01:17.020> can<00:01:17.260> set<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> stop<00:01:17.800> block<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.430> cut<00:01:18.730> all

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
now i can set a stop block and cut all

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:53.679 
now i can set a stop block and cut all
my<00:01:18.880> parts<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.480> length

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.940 

now<00:01:54.689> we're<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:54.990> set<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> head<00:01:55.380> into<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> bench

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
now we're all set to head into the bench

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.630 
now we're all set to head into the bench
room<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.430> do<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.790> bit<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.970> dovetailing

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.689 

we've<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.820> all<00:02:02.939> those<00:02:03.060> parts<00:02:03.360> cut<00:02:03.570> up
