00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
change the steering a little bit after

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.920 
change the steering a little bit after
five<00:00:16.250> laps<00:00:16.460> he<00:00:16.760> was<00:00:16.880> already<00:00:17.210> he<00:00:17.510> said<00:00:17.689> it<00:00:17.810> was

five laps he was already he said it was
really<00:00:18.410> heavy<00:00:18.619> did<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:19.220> have<00:00:19.400> any<00:00:19.609> of<00:00:19.850> the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
really heavy did you have any of the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.679 
really heavy did you have any of the
same<00:00:20.150> problems<00:00:21.130> not<00:00:22.130> yet<00:00:22.369> we've<00:00:23.300> got<00:00:23.480> quite<00:00:23.599> a

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
same problems not yet we've got quite a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.269 
same problems not yet we've got quite a
bit<00:00:23.839> understeer<00:00:24.259> in<00:00:24.320> our<00:00:24.439> car<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:24.890> far<00:00:25.070> which

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
bit understeer in our car so far which

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.919 
bit understeer in our car so far which
which<00:00:25.640> is<00:00:25.820> like<00:00:25.999> my<00:00:26.150> worst<00:00:26.300> nightmare<00:00:26.449> but

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
which is like my worst nightmare but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.470 
which is like my worst nightmare but
yeah<00:00:27.769> it's<00:00:28.220> definitely<00:00:28.489> more<00:00:28.789> demanding<00:00:29.300> for

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
yeah it's definitely more demanding for

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.609 
yeah it's definitely more demanding for
sure<00:00:29.659> especially<00:00:29.779> in<00:00:30.109> these<00:00:30.169> high<00:00:30.380> speed

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
sure especially in these high speed

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.290 
sure especially in these high speed
corners<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.789> know<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.999> amount<00:00:32.180> of

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
corners and you know the amount of

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.240 
corners and you know the amount of
downforce<00:00:32.810> even<00:00:33.170> that<00:00:33.350> we've<00:00:33.500> put<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:33.890> from

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
downforce even that we've put on from

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.889 
downforce even that we've put on from
the<00:00:34.399> New<00:00:34.520> Orleans<00:00:34.550> test<00:00:35.149> to<00:00:35.270> coming<00:00:35.540> here<00:00:35.720> you

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
the New Orleans test to coming here you

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.060 
the New Orleans test to coming here you
definitely<00:00:36.290> feel<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:36.500> in<00:00:36.710> some<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:36.980> these

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
definitely feel it in some of these

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.220 
definitely feel it in some of these
corners<00:00:37.490> where<00:00:38.240> you<00:00:38.360> went<00:00:38.570> flat<00:00:38.810> or<00:00:39.080> weren't

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
corners where you went flat or weren't

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.990 
corners where you went flat or weren't
even<00:00:39.410> close<00:00:39.530> to<00:00:39.620> flat<00:00:39.980> you're<00:00:40.190> almost<00:00:40.610> flat

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
even close to flat you're almost flat

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.240 
even close to flat you're almost flat
and<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:41.360> it's<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.230> speed<00:00:42.530> has<00:00:42.740> definitely

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
and so it's the speed has definitely

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.920 
and so it's the speed has definitely
come<00:00:43.400> up<00:00:43.580> I<00:00:43.820> think<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:44.420> morning<00:00:44.810> would

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
come up I think this morning would

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.570 
come up I think this morning would
probably<00:00:45.320> ideal<00:00:45.680> conditions<00:00:46.250> when<00:00:46.400> it<00:00:46.490> was

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
probably ideal conditions when it was

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.950 
probably ideal conditions when it was
really<00:00:46.820> cool<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:47.060> you<00:00:47.300> saw<00:00:47.450> some<00:00:47.630> pretty<00:00:47.720> big

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
really cool and you saw some pretty big

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.040 
really cool and you saw some pretty big
time<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.260> go<00:00:48.350> down<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:48.770> I<00:00:49.640> think<00:00:50.210> some<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.750> lot<00:00:50.960> of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
time to go down so I think some a lot of

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.450 
time to go down so I think some a lot of
track<00:00:51.200> records<00:00:51.560> this<00:00:51.620> year<00:00:51.680> we've<00:00:52.010> broken<00:00:52.250> the

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
track records this year we've broken the

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.270 
track records this year we've broken the
official<00:00:52.820> passion<00:00:53.750> of<00:00:53.840> said<00:00:54.050> he<00:00:54.800> said<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.160> was

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
official passion of said he said it was

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.980 
official passion of said he said it was
tough<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:55.730> was<00:00:55.820> fun<00:00:56.120> he<00:00:56.480> said<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.690> was<00:00:56.780> it's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.110 
tough but it was fun he said it was it's
so<00:00:57.290> fast<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:58.040> so<00:00:58.190> it's<00:00:58.340> noticeably<00:00:58.850> faster

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
so fast it so it's noticeably faster

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.170 
so fast it so it's noticeably faster
yeah<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:00.350> kind<00:01:00.560> of<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.520> know<00:01:01.670> similar

yeah it is this kind of you know similar
to<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.540> transition<00:01:02.900> that<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.200> went<00:01:03.410> through

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
to the transition that I went through

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200 
to the transition that I went through
and<00:01:03.770> when<00:01:04.009> you<00:01:04.280> know<00:01:04.369> started<00:01:04.729> testing<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
and when you know started testing the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.569 
and when you know started testing the
the<00:01:05.570> MC<00:01:05.990> cars<00:01:06.200> going<00:01:06.619> you<00:01:07.009> know<00:01:07.130> from<00:01:07.369> no

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:07.579 
the MC cars going you know from no

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:09.070 
the MC cars going you know from no
tunnels<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.270> big<00:01:08.420> you<00:01:08.570> know<00:01:08.630> things<00:01:08.930> they

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
tunnels to the big you know things they

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.590 
tunnels to the big you know things they
put<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.710> put<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.190> those<00:01:10.340> cards<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:10.790> it's<00:01:11.210> a

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
put in and put on those cards so it's a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.020 
put in and put on those cards so it's a
it's<00:01:12.350> definitely<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:12.980> lot<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.490> fun<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.700> think<00:01:13.820> the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's definitely a lot of fun I think the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.790 
it's definitely a lot of fun I think the
cars<00:01:14.240> look<00:01:14.450> cool<00:01:14.690> oh<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.350> know<00:01:15.440> people<00:01:15.710> get

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
cars look cool oh you know people get

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.980 
cars look cool oh you know people get
interested<00:01:16.250> by<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.730> see<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:17.510> differences

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
interested by it and see the differences

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.500 
interested by it and see the differences
between<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.500> two<00:01:18.970> but<00:01:19.970> yeah<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:20.360> know<00:01:20.479> I

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
between the two but yeah you know I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.180 
between the two but yeah you know I
guess<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.350> biggest<00:01:21.650> thing<00:01:21.830> for<00:01:21.920> us<00:01:22.130> is

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
guess the biggest thing for us is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.880 
guess the biggest thing for us is
obviously<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.000> maintain<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.380> speed<00:01:24.680> and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
obviously to maintain the speed and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.410 
obviously to maintain the speed and
hopefully<00:01:25.250> we're<00:01:25.460> we're<00:01:25.729> quick<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.210> know<00:01:26.300> we

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
hopefully we're we're quick you know we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.060 
hopefully we're we're quick you know we
still<00:01:26.630> got<00:01:26.690> very<00:01:27.050> competitive<00:01:27.620> teams<00:01:27.860> to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
still got very competitive teams to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.730 
still got very competitive teams to
compete<00:01:28.490> against<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.720> hasn't<00:01:30.080> changed<00:01:30.110> and

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
compete against that hasn't changed and

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.230
