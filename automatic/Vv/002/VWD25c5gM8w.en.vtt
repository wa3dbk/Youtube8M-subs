a grasshopper hill script in Rhino in
the<00:00:09.210> previous<00:00:10.250> tutorial<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.540> have<00:00:12.540> showed<00:00:12.840> you

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
the previous tutorial I have showed you

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.950 
the previous tutorial I have showed you
how<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.400> can<00:00:14.700> use<00:00:14.940> remote<00:00:15.240> control

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
how you can use remote control

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.490 
how you can use remote control
grasshopper<00:00:16.740> parameters<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.930> adjust<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
grasshopper parameters to adjust the

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.779 
grasshopper parameters to adjust the
size<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> shape<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.570> ship<00:00:22.789> quite

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
size and the shape of the ship quite

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
size and the shape of the ship quite
fast<00:00:25.730> in<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:26.880> tutorial<00:00:27.480> I'm<00:00:27.810> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.260> show

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
fast in this tutorial I'm going to show

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.880 
fast in this tutorial I'm going to show
you<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.890> script<00:00:29.130> itself<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> grasshopper

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you the script itself the grasshopper

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.729 
you the script itself the grasshopper
script<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.550> therefore<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.360> open<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
script and therefore I open the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
script and therefore I open the
grasshopper<00:00:35.899> interface<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:40.190> over<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.640> you

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
grasshopper interface and over here you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.779 
grasshopper interface and over here you
see<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.160> script<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.210> defines<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.789> size

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
see the script which defines the size

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.299 
see the script which defines the size
and<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> shape<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.890> Ville<00:00:50.070> shape

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
and the shape of the Ville shape

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.439 
and the shape of the Ville shape
furthermore<00:00:53.809> there<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.840> components<00:00:56.449> where

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
furthermore there are components where

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.810 
furthermore there are components where
the<00:00:57.629> real<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.859> lines<00:00:59.699> plan<00:00:59.969> display<00:01:00.449> is

the real time this lines plan display is

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.959 
the real time this lines plan display is

them<00:04:52.880> active<00:04:53.860> press<00:04:54.860> on<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.160> big<00:04:56.110> button

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.610 

you<00:05:00.250> create<00:05:00.970> its<00:05:01.270> dish<00:05:01.780> hill

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620
