pieces<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:07.610> doily<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.299> we're<00:01:09.420> gonna

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
pieces of my doily so now we're gonna

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.719 
pieces of my doily so now we're gonna
measure<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> ribbon<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.619> always<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
measure out the ribbon I always like to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
measure out the ribbon I always like to
steer<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> side<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> having<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:13.380> ribbon

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
steer on the side of having more ribbon

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.870 
steer on the side of having more ribbon
and<00:01:13.890> less<00:01:14.010> ribbon<00:01:14.310> because<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.729> always

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and less ribbon because you can always

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.020 
and less ribbon because you can always
trim<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> end<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.900> want<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.250> about

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
trim it in the end I want it to be about

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630 
trim it in the end I want it to be about
six<00:01:18.390> inches<00:01:18.720> longer<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.290> each<00:01:19.409> side<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.580> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
six inches longer on each side this is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
six inches longer on each side this is
my<00:01:20.820> really<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.229> professional<00:01:22.229> way<00:01:22.320> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
my really a professional way of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
my really a professional way of
measuring<00:01:22.700> then<00:01:23.700> before<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.270> weaving

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
measuring then before we start weaving

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.270 
measuring then before we start weaving
it<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.320> suggest<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> cut

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
it in and out I suggest that you cut

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.179 
it in and out I suggest that you cut
each<00:01:26.549> side<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> ribbon<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.960> diagonal<00:01:28.530> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
each side of the ribbon on a diagonal so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.590 
each side of the ribbon on a diagonal so
it's<00:01:29.310> easier<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.850> through<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.210> doily

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
it's easier to get through those doily

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870 
it's easier to get through those doily
holes<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> weaving<00:01:32.100> begin

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
holes so if the weaving begin

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.370 
holes so if the weaving begin
you<00:01:33.240> know<00:01:33.329> hungergames<00:01:33.630> our<00:01:33.960> friend<00:01:34.170> snow

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you know hungergames our friend snow

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
you know hungergames our friend snow
okay<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.119> time<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> start<00:01:36.509> weaving

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
okay so now it's time to start weaving

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
okay so now it's time to start weaving
our<00:01:36.960> ribbon<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.799> through<00:01:38.130> our<00:01:38.159> doily

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
our ribbon in and out through our doily

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.539
