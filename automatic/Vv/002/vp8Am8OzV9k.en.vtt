challenging<00:02:09.140> I'm<00:02:10.039> just<00:02:10.280> trying<00:02:10.459> not<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.759> stop

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.600 

Derek's<00:02:14.480> progress<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.440> date<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.920> his

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
Derek's progress to date and his

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.370 
Derek's progress to date and his
excellent<00:02:17.060> progress<00:02:17.269> has<00:02:17.660> been<00:02:17.690> driven<00:02:18.079> by

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
excellent progress has been driven by

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.030 
excellent progress has been driven by
his<00:02:18.799> focus<00:02:19.280> on<00:02:19.670> trying<00:02:20.570> to<00:02:20.750> get<00:02:20.900> back<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.950> know

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
his focus on trying to get back you know

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.979 
his focus on trying to get back you know
it's<00:02:22.519> not<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:22.820> much<00:02:22.880> necessarily<00:02:23.660> his<00:02:23.750> body

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
it's not so much necessarily his body

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.110 
it's not so much necessarily his body
chemistry<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.709> driving<00:02:25.190> what's<00:02:25.670> going<00:02:25.970> on

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
chemistry that's driving what's going on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.500 
chemistry that's driving what's going on
I<00:02:26.329> think<00:02:26.630> it's<00:02:27.170> his<00:02:27.320> mind<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.860> his<00:02:28.010> passion<00:02:28.549> to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
I think it's his mind and his passion to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.130 
I think it's his mind and his passion to
get<00:02:29.660> better

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.200 

you
