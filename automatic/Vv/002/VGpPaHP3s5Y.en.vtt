in<00:00:00.390> this<00:00:01.319> tutorial<00:00:01.530> we'll<00:00:02.250> take<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.460> look<00:00:02.610> at<00:00:02.730> a

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.760 
in this tutorial we'll take a look at a
few<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.149> details<00:00:03.300> from<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.140> ghost<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
few of the details from a ghost from the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.010 
few of the details from a ghost from the
graveyard<00:00:05.210> animation<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.540> posted

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
graveyard animation that I have posted

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020 
graveyard animation that I have posted
and<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:08.069> should<00:00:08.250> be<00:00:08.280> familiar<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:08.670> all<00:00:08.849> my

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and you should be familiar with all my

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.930 
and you should be familiar with all my
2.63<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.929> tutorials<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.889> quick<00:00:11.130> tip<00:00:11.340> tutorials

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
2.63 a tutorials and quick tip tutorials

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.310 
2.63 a tutorials and quick tip tutorials
so<00:00:12.120> basically<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.660> should<00:00:12.780> be<00:00:12.870> fairly<00:00:13.019> well

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
so basically you should be fairly well

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.690 
so basically you should be fairly well
grounded<00:00:13.469> in<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.799> basics<00:00:14.219> because<00:00:14.400> i'm<00:00:14.549> going

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
grounded in the basics because i'm going

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.180 
grounded in the basics because i'm going
to<00:00:14.759> start<00:00:14.940> kind<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.780> passing<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.830> all<00:00:17.039> those

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
to start kind of passing up all those

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
to start kind of passing up all those
details<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.060> go<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.330> here<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.380> what<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.740> have

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
details as we go in here so what we have

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.490 
details as we go in here so what we have
here<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.820> simple<00:00:21.449> ghost<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> scene

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
here is just a simple ghost in the scene

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.750 
here is just a simple ghost in the scene
let's<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.800> run<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.400> comes<00:00:29.670> back

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
let's just run it and it just comes back

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.640 
let's just run it and it just comes back
out<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> grave<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> few

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
out of the grave and there's just a few

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
out of the grave and there's just a few
things<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.820> followed<00:00:33.120> my

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
things most of it if you followed my

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
things most of it if you followed my
tutorials<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:34.230> might<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.649> obvious<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
tutorials this might be obvious to you

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690 
tutorials this might be obvious to you
already<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:37.170> right<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
already all right but for those of you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.510 
already all right but for those of you
haven't<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.649> few<00:00:40.829> pointers<00:00:41.250> i<00:00:41.370> want

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
haven't then just a few pointers i want

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.920 
haven't then just a few pointers i want
to<00:00:42.260> point<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:43.770> here<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:45.480> ghost<00:00:45.719> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to point out right here in the ghost of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.850 
to point out right here in the ghost of
course<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:47.059> cloth<00:00:48.059> object<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> let's<00:00:49.680> just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
course is a cloth object and let's just

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.950 
course is a cloth object and let's just
look<00:00:50.010> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.219> physics<00:00:50.520> effects<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
look at the physics effects on here and

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.880 
look at the physics effects on here and
it<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.469> got<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> cloth<00:00:55.890> setting<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
it is it's got a cloth setting here and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.090 
it is it's got a cloth setting here and
let's<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.820> got<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.140> ghost<00:01:01.140> group<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.680> guess

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
let's see it's got a ghost group I guess

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
let's see it's got a ghost group I guess
misspelled<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.899> ghost<00:01:04.110> group<00:01:04.350> let

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
misspelled that is the ghost group let

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
misspelled that is the ghost group let
me<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> actually

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
me go back here these you can actually

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.990 
me go back here these you can actually
see<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.320> whether<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.820> looks

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
see it like this whether it is it looks

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.330 
see it like this whether it is it looks
on<00:01:09.330> highlight<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.290> strange<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
on highlight that's very strange it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.830 
on highlight that's very strange it
looks<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:11.970> active<00:01:12.450> but<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.720> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
looks like it's not active but it is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.130 
looks like it's not active but it is
right<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.619> reason<00:01:14.900> alright<00:01:15.900> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
right here for some reason alright so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.070 
right here for some reason alright so
it's<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:16.979> we'll<00:01:17.220> look<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
it's got that and then we'll look in the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
it's got that and then we'll look in the
vertex<00:01:19.080> groups<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.189> see<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.369> this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
vertex groups and you can see just this

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.530 
vertex groups and you can see just this
one<00:01:21.299> group<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.159> go<00:01:23.159> into<00:01:23.310> edit<00:01:23.490> mode<00:01:23.640> they're

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
one group and go into edit mode they're

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
one group and go into edit mode they're
all<00:01:24.659> waited<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.170> point<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> so

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
all waited at point one like that and so

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
all waited at point one like that and so
it's<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.540> basic<00:01:27.720> cloth<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.409> let<00:01:28.860> me

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it's just a basic cloth like this let me

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.609 
it's just a basic cloth like this let me
press<00:01:29.189> delete<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> get<00:01:30.210> her<00:01:30.390> dl<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> i

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
press delete so i can get her dl and i

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
press delete so i can get her dl and i
have<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> tailored<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.909> little<00:01:33.299> bit<00:01:33.420> so

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
have kind of tailored a little bit so

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600 
have kind of tailored a little bit so
it's<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.869> completely<00:01:34.229> square<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.369> way

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it's not completely square so that way

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
it's not completely square so that way
it<00:01:35.790> lays<00:01:36.450> down<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:36.960> bit<00:01:37.079> i<00:01:37.140> did<00:01:37.350> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
it lays down a little bit i did that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.940 
it lays down a little bit i did that
with<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:39.200> proportional<00:01:40.200> editing<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> course

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
with the proportional editing of course

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
with the proportional editing of course
as<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.939> may<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.090> seen<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.600> other

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
as you may have seen in my other

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.300 
as you may have seen in my other
tutorials<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.329> then<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.100> admission<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
tutorials and then the admission of the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
tutorials and then the admission of the
light<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> what's<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.299> important<00:01:48.840> let's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
light is what's really important let's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
light is what's really important let's
go<00:01:49.079> take<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.290> look<00:01:49.380> at<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> thing<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.640> notice

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
go take a look at the thing here notice

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.999 
go take a look at the thing here notice
here<00:01:51.420> there's<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> lot<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> scene

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
here there's not a lot in the scene

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.440 
here there's not a lot in the scene
because<00:01:53.220> i<00:01:53.280> wanted<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.610> fairly<00:01:53.909> dark<00:01:54.149> scene

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
because i wanted a fairly dark scene

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
because i wanted a fairly dark scene
basically<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.619> nighttime<00:01:55.860> scene<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.520> i

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
basically for a nighttime scene and i

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
basically for a nighttime scene and i
wanted<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> go<00:01:57.060> stand<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> light<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
wanted to go stand the light in the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.920 
wanted to go stand the light in the
scene<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.560> really<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.640> active<00:01:59.930> interest

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
scene to really be the active interest

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
scene to really be the active interest
so<00:02:01.110> let's<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> had<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.009> Cena<00:02:02.310> have

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
so let's see what I had in the Cena have

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.810 
so let's see what I had in the Cena have
this<00:02:02.909> light<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:04.040> it's<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> hemisphere

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this light here it's just a hemisphere

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.779 
this light here it's just a hemisphere
light<00:02:06.119> quite<00:02:06.479> low<00:02:06.659> energy<00:02:07.049> point<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.759> yeah<00:02:08.759> I

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
light quite low energy point one yeah I

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.969 
light quite low energy point one yeah I
think<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> city<00:02:10.140> scene<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
think that was it in the city scene I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.559 
think that was it in the city scene I
had<00:02:11.220> four<00:02:11.459> light

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
had four light

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.300 
had four light
they<00:02:12.689> have<00:02:12.930> one<00:02:13.140> other<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:13.499> oh<00:02:13.650> no<00:02:13.829> and<00:02:14.069> there

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
they have one other like oh no and there

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.130 
they have one other like oh no and there
is<00:02:14.400> another<00:02:14.519> Lucy<00:02:15.060> another<00:02:15.510> light<00:02:15.749> but<00:02:15.989> that's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
is another Lucy another light but that's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.520 
is another Lucy another light but that's
associated<00:02:16.439> with<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.889> ghost<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:18.290> let's<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
associated with the ghost so let's just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.830 
associated with the ghost so let's just
take<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> look<00:02:20.099> at<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.969> let's<00:02:21.359> go<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:21.689> into

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
take a look at the let's go back into

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.509 
take a look at the let's go back into
edit<00:02:21.900> mode<00:02:22.139> with<00:02:22.409> the<00:02:22.469> ghost<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.189> can<00:02:23.340> see

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
edit mode with the ghost that we can see

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.940 
edit mode with the ghost that we can see
where<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> light<00:02:23.939> is<00:02:23.969> so<00:02:24.329> parented<00:02:25.109> to<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
where the light is so parented to the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.440 
where the light is so parented to the
ghost<00:02:26.989> right<00:02:27.989> here<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:30.889> another<00:02:31.889> light

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
ghost right here I have another light

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.940 
ghost right here I have another light
right<00:02:33.450> there<00:02:33.480> there's<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.079> light<00:02:34.260> that's<00:02:34.769> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
right there there's a light that's a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
right there there's a light that's a
point<00:02:35.159> light<00:02:35.400> all<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.150> let's<00:02:36.329> parented<00:02:36.810> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
point light all right let's parented to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:45.610 
point light all right let's parented to
that<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.959> then<00:02:43.019> where<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
that and then and then where is the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.530 
that and then and then where is the
sphere<00:02:46.620> there's<00:02:47.189> a<00:02:47.250> sphere<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.939> there's<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
sphere there's a sphere and there's the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.479 
sphere there's a sphere and there's the
sphere<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.139> well<00:02:49.409> let's<00:02:49.859> see<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.069> we<00:02:50.129> can<00:02:50.280> see

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
sphere as well let's see if we can see

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.580 
sphere as well let's see if we can see
the<00:02:50.669> sphere<00:02:51.209> let's<00:02:51.719> go<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.019> wireframe

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the sphere let's go in the wireframe

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.649 
the sphere let's go in the wireframe
mode<00:02:52.769> real<00:02:53.040> quick<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.669> there's<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.939> sphere<00:02:54.419> and

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
mode real quick so there's a sphere and

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.909 
mode real quick so there's a sphere and
I<00:02:55.199> use<00:02:55.469> that<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:56.419> drape<00:02:57.419> the<00:02:57.719> ghost<00:02:57.989> over<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
I use that to drape the ghost over the

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.220 
I use that to drape the ghost over the
cloth<00:02:59.219> over<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.669> top<00:02:59.879> of<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.239> like<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
cloth over the top of it like that and

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890 
cloth over the top of it like that and
that's<00:03:01.680> why<00:03:01.859> in<00:03:02.219> this<00:03:02.340> particular<00:03:02.549> case<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.449> had

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
that's why in this particular case I had

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.250 
that's why in this particular case I had
started<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.560> scene<00:03:04.859> with<00:03:05.219> the<00:03:05.870> ghost<00:03:06.870> below

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
started the scene with the ghost below

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.140 
started the scene with the ghost below
the<00:03:07.409> surface<00:03:07.620> so<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.040> had<00:03:08.250> time<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.669> drape<00:03:08.969> over

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the surface so it had time to drape over

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.539 
the surface so it had time to drape over
the<00:03:09.329> sphere<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.049> fall<00:03:10.650> down<00:03:10.680> though<00:03:11.519> you

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
the sphere and fall down though you

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.379 
the sphere and fall down though you
could<00:03:11.909> just<00:03:12.030> model<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:12.780> way<00:03:12.930> as<00:03:13.109> well<00:03:13.169> and

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
could just model it that way as well and

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.259 
could just model it that way as well and
then<00:03:16.129> one<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.400> point<00:03:17.699> oh<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.090> then

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
then one of the other point oh and then

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.569 
then one of the other point oh and then
the<00:03:18.419> lighting<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.500> lighting<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.949> this<00:03:20.189> notice

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
the lighting the lighting on this notice

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.390 
the lighting the lighting on this notice
it's<00:03:20.759> this<00:03:21.509> kind<00:03:22.229> of<00:03:22.409> color<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.129> it<00:03:23.280> was<00:03:23.370> a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
it's this kind of color here so it was a

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.699 
it's this kind of color here so it was a
dark<00:03:23.669> scene<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.750> much<00:03:24.959> illumination<00:03:25.439> at

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
dark scene so not much illumination at

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.780 
dark scene so not much illumination at
the<00:03:25.799> scene<00:03:26.040> when<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:26.819> come<00:03:27.000> down<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.209> i<00:03:27.780> have

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
the scene when you come down here i have

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
the scene when you come down here i have
a<00:03:29.989> specular<00:03:30.989> way<00:03:31.259> down<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.979> then<00:03:32.329> i<00:03:33.329> have

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
a specular way down and then i have

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:42.530 
a specular way down and then i have
where<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.489> guy<00:03:39.620> hmm<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.939> have<00:03:41.939> a<00:03:41.970> mitt<00:03:42.329> at

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
where is this guy hmm I have a mitt at

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.809 
where is this guy hmm I have a mitt at
point<00:03:42.900> two<00:03:43.139> five<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.040> must<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.489> dropped<00:03:44.669> that

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
point two five I must have dropped that

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.689 
point two five I must have dropped that
back<00:03:45.030> down<00:03:45.239> after<00:03:45.479> I<00:03:45.659> change<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.609> added<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
back down after I change the added the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.670 
back down after I change the added the
light<00:03:47.909> underneath<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.780> when<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.259> traveled

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
light underneath so when it traveled

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.199 
light underneath so when it traveled
around<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:51.060> had<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.769> light<00:03:52.769> was<00:03:53.069> helping<00:03:54.000> to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
around it had the light was helping to

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.229 
around it had the light was helping to
illuminate<00:03:54.689> the<00:03:55.129> ghost<00:03:56.129> as<00:03:56.549> well<00:03:56.819> as<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
illuminate the ghost as well as the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.240 
illuminate the ghost as well as the
surface<00:03:57.479> beneath<00:03:57.870> it<00:03:58.199> as<00:03:58.439> you<00:03:58.829> can<00:03:58.949> see<00:03:59.159> if

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
surface beneath it as you can see if

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.030 
surface beneath it as you can see if
little<00:03:59.519> close<00:03:59.699> and<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.900> reflection<00:04:01.829> is

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
little close and the reflection is

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.800 
little close and the reflection is
nothing<00:04:02.819> more<00:04:03.030> than<00:04:03.180> just<00:04:03.419> a<00:04:03.540> little

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
nothing more than just a little

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.599 
nothing more than just a little
specularity<00:04:04.259> in<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.769> surface<00:04:05.040> plane<00:04:05.400> like

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
specularity in the surface plane like

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.909 
specularity in the surface plane like
that<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.909> trees<00:04:09.150> were<00:04:09.180> basic<00:04:09.989> let's<00:04:10.469> see<00:04:10.739> what

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
that the trees were basic let's see what

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.839 
that the trees were basic let's see what
else<00:04:10.949> I<00:04:11.189> had<00:04:11.370> in<00:04:11.519> this<00:04:11.669> scene<00:04:12.000> oh<00:04:13.340> yeah<00:04:14.340> the

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
else I had in this scene oh yeah the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.849 
else I had in this scene oh yeah the
most<00:04:15.150> important<00:04:15.870> thing<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.979> wind<00:04:17.219> so<00:04:18.859> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
most important thing the wind so the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.259 
most important thing the wind so the
ghost<00:04:20.070> notice<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> cloth<00:04:20.789> is<00:04:20.969> sitting

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
ghost notice the cloth is sitting

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.180 
ghost notice the cloth is sitting
sideways<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.349> way<00:04:22.409> i<00:04:22.500> did<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.860> was<00:04:22.919> I<00:04:23.039> have

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
sideways so the way i did it was I have

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.210 
sideways so the way i did it was I have
a<00:04:23.219> wind<00:04:23.490> object<00:04:24.000> blowing<00:04:24.750> towards<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.199> cloth

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
a wind object blowing towards the cloth

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.000 
a wind object blowing towards the cloth
but<00:04:26.730> in<00:04:26.910> order<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.240> maintain<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.320> have

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
but in order to maintain that I have

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.840 
but in order to maintain that I have
this<00:04:29.370> parented<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.800> notice<00:04:31.800> the<00:04:32.130> wind<00:04:32.400> is

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
this parented to notice the wind is

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.180 
this parented to notice the wind is
parented<00:04:33.750> either<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.470> cloth<00:04:34.740> or<00:04:35.040> the

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
parented either to the cloth or the

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.780 
parented either to the cloth or the
sphere<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.410> then<00:04:37.410> there's<00:04:38.010> another<00:04:38.130> object

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
sphere and then there's another object

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.990 
sphere and then there's another object
where<00:04:39.270> is<00:04:39.480> that<00:04:39.840> guy<00:04:40.230> let's<00:04:40.650> see<00:04:41.340> let's<00:04:41.820> move

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
where is that guy let's see let's move

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.830 
where is that guy let's see let's move
him<00:04:42.210> up<00:04:42.770> no<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:43.950> not<00:04:44.070> that<00:04:47.270> where<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.600> it

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
him up no it's not that where is it

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.870 
him up no it's not that where is it
maybe<00:04:49.050> i<00:04:49.110> was<00:04:49.260> using<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.650> empty<00:04:49.980> nope<00:04:50.250> he<00:04:50.700> said

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
maybe i was using the empty nope he said

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.970 
maybe i was using the empty nope he said
that<00:04:51.060> there<00:04:51.360> that's<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:52.020> camera<00:04:52.440> no<00:04:52.950> I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
that there that's the camera no I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.490 
that there that's the camera no I
thought<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.370> had<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.610> cube<00:04:54.450> i<00:04:54.660> was<00:04:54.840> using<00:04:55.080> oh

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
thought I had a cube i was using oh

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.320 
thought I had a cube i was using oh
there<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.220> i<00:04:56.280> have<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.610> cube<00:04:56.880> in<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.030> scene

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
there it is i have a cube in the scene

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.740 
there it is i have a cube in the scene
right<00:04:58.050> there<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:59.280> what<00:04:59.400> that<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.880> the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
right there and so what that is the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.230 
right there and so what that is the
ghost<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:02.150> parented<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.180> the<00:05:03.420> cube<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:05.520> wind

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
ghost is parented to the cube the wind

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.620 
ghost is parented to the cube the wind
is<00:05:06.600> parented<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.740> ghost<00:05:08.010> and<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:08.760> way<00:05:08.910> as

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
is parented to the ghost and that way as

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.690 
is parented to the ghost and that way as
it's<00:05:10.080> moving<00:05:10.290> around<00:05:10.680> there's<00:05:11.040> always<00:05:11.400> a<00:05:11.430> wind

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
it's moving around there's always a wind

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.120 
it's moving around there's always a wind
blowing<00:05:12.180> towards<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.660> ghost<00:05:12.960> as<00:05:13.350> this<00:05:13.950> is

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
blowing towards the ghost as this is

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.350 
blowing towards the ghost as this is
rotating<00:05:14.670> through<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:14.940> scene<00:05:15.150> because

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
rotating through the scene because

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.520 
rotating through the scene because
that's<00:05:15.540> all<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.990> is<00:05:16.170> is<00:05:16.410> if<00:05:16.530> i<00:05:16.620> press<00:05:16.890> RZ<00:05:17.460> here

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
that's all that is is if i press RZ here

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.860 
that's all that is is if i press RZ here
you<00:05:19.530> can<00:05:19.650> see<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.180> sphere<00:05:21.180> moves<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.810> the

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
you can see the sphere moves and the

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.580 
you can see the sphere moves and the
ghost<00:05:22.080> would<00:05:22.290> follow<00:05:22.620> in<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.820> sense<00:05:24.590> alright

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
ghost would follow in that sense alright

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.340 
ghost would follow in that sense alright
and<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:25.860> that's<00:05:26.700> what<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:26.910> did<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.350> parented

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
and so that's what I did I parented

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.260 
and so that's what I did I parented
that's<00:05:28.950> Parenthood<00:05:29.460> do<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.970> lights<00:05:30.150> the

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
that's Parenthood do that the lights the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.270 
that's Parenthood do that the lights the
wind<00:05:30.660> is<00:05:30.780> parented<00:05:31.260> that<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.770> way<00:05:31.919> you<00:05:31.980> can

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
wind is parented that that way you can

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
wind is parented that that way you can
always<00:05:32.460> have<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.669> wind<00:05:32.820> effect<00:05:33.030> otherwise

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
always have the wind effect otherwise

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.730 
always have the wind effect otherwise
the<00:05:33.540> cloth<00:05:33.750> is<00:05:33.960> just<00:05:34.080> going<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.260> hang<00:05:34.440> straight

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
the cloth is just going to hang straight

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.620 
the cloth is just going to hang straight
down<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.700> won't<00:05:35.850> get<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.090> effect<00:05:36.330> in<00:05:36.480> it

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
down and you won't get the effect in it

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.590 
down and you won't get the effect in it
flying<00:05:37.070> through<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.190> same<00:05:38.400> alright<00:05:39.360> that's

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
flying through the same alright that's

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.219 
flying through the same alright that's
pretty<00:05:40.080> much<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.320> details<00:05:41.070> of<00:05:41.430> that<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:42.419> did

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
pretty much the details of that I did

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.600 
pretty much the details of that I did
it's<00:05:43.410> pretty<00:05:43.680> straightforward<00:05:44.010> otherwise

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
it's pretty straightforward otherwise

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.969 
it's pretty straightforward otherwise
and<00:05:45.030> I<00:05:45.450> didn't<00:05:45.720> put<00:05:45.840> any<00:05:46.020> collision<00:05:46.500> so<00:05:46.770> the

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
and I didn't put any collision so the

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.310 
and I didn't put any collision so the
cloth<00:05:47.580> can<00:05:47.880> cloth<00:05:48.360> of<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.630> ghost<00:05:48.810> can<00:05:49.020> just<00:05:49.200> go

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
cloth can cloth of the ghost can just go

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.630 
cloth can cloth of the ghost can just go
right<00:05:49.530> through<00:05:49.770> anything<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.310> let's<00:05:50.490> just

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
right through anything so let's just

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.969 
right through anything so let's just
look<00:05:50.729> at<00:05:50.910> it<00:05:50.940> one<00:05:51.840> more<00:05:52.169> time<00:05:52.350> real<00:05:52.620> quick<00:05:52.650> I'll
