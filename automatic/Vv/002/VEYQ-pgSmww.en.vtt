00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.439 
you're comfortable with twisting the top
off<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.500> when<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.680> twist<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.220> top<00:04:35.400> off<00:04:35.639> I<00:04:36.030> mean

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
off so when you twist the top off I mean

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.969 
off so when you twist the top off I mean
once<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.720> twist<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.050> again<00:04:37.139> it's<00:04:37.500> probably

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
once you twist it again it's probably

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.680 
once you twist it again it's probably
gonna<00:04:38.100> be<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.340> one<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.610> put<00:04:38.789> on<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.509> what

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
gonna be the one you just put on so what

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.520 
gonna be the one you just put on so what
I<00:04:39.720> do<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:42.150> is<00:04:42.300> probably<00:04:42.690> if<00:04:42.990> it's<00:04:43.199> closer

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
I do is this is probably if it's closer

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.050 
I do is this is probably if it's closer
if<00:04:43.860> it's<00:04:44.039> um<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:46.050> your<00:04:46.080> ear<00:04:46.800> more<00:04:47.100> if<00:04:47.789> I'm

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
if it's um on your ear more if I'm

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.939 
if it's um on your ear more if I'm
trying<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.360> say<00:04:48.449> like<00:04:48.630> if<00:04:48.900> it's<00:04:49.050> touching<00:04:49.620> your

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
trying to say like if it's touching your

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.430 
trying to say like if it's touching your
ear<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.430> can<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:51.300> could<00:04:51.479> probably<00:04:51.690> hold<00:04:52.199> it

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
ear you can you could probably hold it

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.760 
ear you can you could probably hold it
like<00:04:53.370> that<00:04:53.449> without<00:04:54.449> it<00:04:54.600> hurting<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.710> I

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
like that without it hurting so I

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.170 
like that without it hurting so I
usually<00:04:56.070> hold<00:04:56.220> my<00:04:56.340> like<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.729> without<00:04:56.940> it

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
usually hold my like that without it

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.529 
usually hold my like that without it
hurting<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.590> twist<00:04:59.039> off<00:05:00.650> and

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
hurting and I just twist off and

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.240 
hurting and I just twist off and
actually<00:05:03.539> that's<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:04.080> working<00:05:04.260> so<00:05:04.740> hold<00:05:05.100> on<00:05:05.220> a

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
actually that's not working so hold on a

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.890 
actually that's not working so hold on a
second<00:05:11.150> sometimes<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.449> have<00:05:12.599> to<00:05:12.750> use<00:05:12.870> a

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
second sometimes you have to use a

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.420 
second sometimes you have to use a
tissue<00:05:13.169> or<00:05:13.380> something<00:05:13.860> if<00:05:13.979> your<00:05:14.190> hair<00:05:14.340> is

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
greasy there you go wait that's not

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:19.870 
greasy there you go wait that's not
working

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
working

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.210 
working
um<00:05:21.320> yeah<00:05:22.320> it's<00:05:22.979> not<00:05:23.220> working<00:05:23.610> at<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.820> moment

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220
