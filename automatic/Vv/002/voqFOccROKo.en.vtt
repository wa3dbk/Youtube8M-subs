tight<00:01:12.390> circular<00:01:12.990> motions<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.619> medium

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
tight circular motions about medium

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
tight circular motions about medium
pressure<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:15.000> kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> blend<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.630> up

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and down the circular motions are gonna

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.390 
and down the circular motions are gonna
help<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.750> look<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.740> diffused<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
dark lid and just a general yeah so now

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
dark lid and just a general yeah so now
I'm<00:01:24.630> taking<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.200> heart<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.740> Java

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
I'm taking all heart and Java

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
I'm taking all heart and Java
mixed<00:01:26.580> together<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.900> taking<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
mixed together and I'm taking that on a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
mixed together and I'm taking that on a
I<00:01:28.770> think<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> Mac<00:01:29.579> 239<00:01:30.090> just<00:01:30.630> like<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
I think that's a Mac 239 just like a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
I think that's a Mac 239 just like a
flat<00:01:31.020> shader<00:01:31.259> brush<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.799> smaller<00:01:32.189> will<00:01:32.490> work

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
flat shader brush that smaller will work

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789 
flat shader brush that smaller will work
and<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.600> working<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> pack<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.650> my

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and I'm just working to pack that on my

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550
