00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
not obnoxious it's not bad it's just a

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.980 
not obnoxious it's not bad it's just a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
little bit annoying the other thing that

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.680 
little bit annoying the other thing that
we'd<00:02:35.410> like<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.830> maybe<00:02:36.130> look<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.240> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
we'd like to maybe look at is the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.660 
we'd like to maybe look at is the
padding<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.320> seat<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:39.100> a<00:02:39.250> comfortable

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
padding in the seat it's a comfortable

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.400 
padding in the seat it's a comfortable
seat<00:02:39.940> but<00:02:40.120> after<00:02:40.390> about<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.630> hundred<00:02:40.959> miles<00:02:41.140> or

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
seat but after about a hundred miles or

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.820 
seat but after about a hundred miles or
so

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.350 
so
the<00:02:42.160> padding<00:02:42.670> starts<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.970> break<00:02:43.150> down<00:02:43.300> a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the padding starts to break down a

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
the padding starts to break down a
little<00:02:43.510> bit<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.050> not<00:02:44.170> uncomfortable<00:02:44.800> but

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
little bit it's not uncomfortable but

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.560 
little bit it's not uncomfortable but
you<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.280> begin<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.610> know<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.970> didn't<00:02:46.300> begin

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
you just begin to know you didn't begin

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.420 
you just begin to know you didn't begin
to<00:02:46.690> notice<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.170> little<00:02:47.320> bit<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.280> that's

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
to notice it a little bit and that's

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.180 
to notice it a little bit and that's
easily<00:02:48.610> fixed<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:49.120> an<00:02:49.360> aftermarket<00:02:49.660> seat

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
easily fixed with an aftermarket seat

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
easily fixed with an aftermarket seat
but<00:02:51.190> overall<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:51.670> really<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.450> bike<00:02:52.630> a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
but overall we really like this bike a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.199 
but overall we really like this bike a
lot<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.440> has<00:02:53.650> enough<00:02:54.070> power<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.550> be<00:02:54.670> fun<00:02:54.940> but

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
lot it has enough power to be fun but

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.580 
lot it has enough power to be fun but
not<00:02:55.300> too<00:02:55.540> much<00:02:55.780> where<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.050> don't<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.470> not

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
not too much where you don't just not

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.009 
not too much where you don't just not
using<00:02:57.040> all<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.489> it's<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.570> great<00:02:58.750> for<00:02:58.959> a

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
using all of it it's it's great for a

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.960 
using all of it it's it's great for a
commuter<00:02:59.440> bike<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:00.670> think<00:03:00.820> you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
commuter bike and we really think you

should<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:01.180> out<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.450> test<00:03:01.660> ride<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.050> these

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
should go out and test ride one of these

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.570 
should go out and test ride one of these
things<00:03:02.380> if<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> can<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.220> really<00:03:03.459> be

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
things if you can and you really be

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.050 
things if you can and you really be
surprised<00:03:03.910> how<00:03:04.150> good<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.600> bike<00:03:04.810> is
