our<00:00:05.299> last<00:00:05.540> flatpicking<00:00:06.200> lick<00:00:06.560> is<00:00:06.740> out<00:00:06.890> of<00:00:06.920> the

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.100 
our last flatpicking lick is out of the

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.280 
our last flatpicking lick is out of the
C<00:00:07.279> chord<00:00:07.519> shape<00:00:07.880> and<00:00:08.149> this<00:00:08.719> was<00:00:08.780> great<00:00:09.139> because

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
C chord shape and this was great because

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.959 
C chord shape and this was great because
we<00:00:09.379> have<00:00:09.559> this<00:00:09.709> nice<00:00:09.889> little<00:00:10.040> chromatic<00:00:10.430> run

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
we have this nice little chromatic run

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.910 
we have this nice little chromatic run
that<00:00:11.299> starts<00:00:11.900> off<00:00:12.020> the<00:00:12.170> whole<00:00:12.320> lick<00:00:12.590> and<00:00:12.830> then

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
that starts off the whole lick and then

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.430 
that starts off the whole lick and then
from<00:00:13.459> there<00:00:13.610> on<00:00:13.789> it<00:00:14.000> just<00:00:14.029> kind<00:00:14.330> of<00:00:14.440> outlines

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
from there on it just kind of outlines

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.870 
from there on it just kind of outlines
the<00:00:15.970> C<00:00:16.970> chord<00:00:17.180> chord<00:00:17.779> tones<00:00:18.670> let's<00:00:19.670> take<00:00:19.820> a

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
the C chord chord tones let's take a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.220 
the C chord chord tones let's take a
look<00:00:20.090> at<00:00:20.150> this<00:00:20.300> lick<00:00:20.539> i'm<00:00:20.720> going<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.900> play<00:00:21.050> with

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
look at this lick i'm going to play with

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.950 
look at this lick i'm going to play with
a<00:00:21.260> couple<00:00:21.590> different<00:00:21.680> variations<00:00:22.810> and<00:00:23.810> then

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
a couple different variations and then

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.630 
a couple different variations and then
we'll<00:00:24.080> talk<00:00:24.260> about<00:00:24.320> them<00:00:24.650> all<00:00:24.830> but<00:00:25.460> let's

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
we'll talk about them all but let's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.730 
we'll talk about them all but let's
bring<00:00:25.820> up<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.000> backing<00:00:26.390> track<00:00:26.420> now<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.020> give

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
bring up the backing track now and give

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:39.670 
bring up the backing track now and give
it<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:27.860> go

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:01:11.140 

bye

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:23.240 

Oh

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.120 

alright<00:01:24.510> so<00:01:25.510> let's<00:01:25.840> take<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.020> look<00:01:26.260> at<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.470> lick

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
alright so let's take a look at the lick

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.789 
alright so let's take a look at the lick
as<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.610> no<00:01:27.909> variations<00:01:28.630> I'm<00:01:28.990> starting<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:29.770> on

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
as is no variations I'm starting here on

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.109 
as is no variations I'm starting here on
the<00:01:29.950> 5th<00:01:30.280> and<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:32.500> a<00:01:32.650> very<00:01:32.909> common<00:01:33.909> thing

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
the 5th and that's a very common thing

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.850 
the 5th and that's a very common thing
to<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.450> when<00:01:34.600> you're<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.869> that<00:01:34.930> C<00:01:35.380> chord<00:01:35.649> shape

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
to do when you're in that C chord shape

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.380 
to do when you're in that C chord shape
is<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.040> use<00:01:36.250> your<00:01:36.369> pinkie<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.759> reinforce<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
is a use your pinkie to reinforce the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.660 
is a use your pinkie to reinforce the
fifth<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.500> that's<00:01:38.979> where<00:01:39.159> I'm<00:01:39.250> getting<00:01:39.399> that

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
fifth so that's where I'm getting that

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.180 
fifth so that's where I'm getting that
note<00:01:39.940> from<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:41.140> I'm<00:01:41.229> starting<00:01:41.649> on<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.979> note

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
note from so I'm starting on that note

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.490 
note from so I'm starting on that note
and<00:01:42.369> I'm<00:01:42.610> chromatically<00:01:43.330> walking<00:01:43.899> down

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
and I'm chromatically walking down

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.380 
and I'm chromatically walking down
to<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.100> four<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:46.760> then<00:01:47.120> I'm<00:01:47.240> going<00:01:47.360> to

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
to the four and then I'm going to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.210 
to the four and then I'm going to
approach<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.930> third<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.620> do<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.130> a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
approach the third and I do this in a

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.460 
approach the third and I do this in a
way<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.760> lets<00:01:49.880> me<00:01:50.030> not<00:01:50.330> kind<00:01:51.020> of<00:01:51.110> pull<00:01:51.290> out<00:01:51.440> a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
way that lets me not kind of pull out a

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.170 
way that lets me not kind of pull out a
position<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.460> I'm<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.300> use<00:01:53.360> my<00:01:53.510> pinky<00:01:55.180> to

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
position so I'm going to use my pinky to

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.250 
position so I'm going to use my pinky to
kind<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.390> cross<00:01:56.630> strings<00:01:56.900> there<00:01:58.990> now<00:01:59.990> I'm<00:02:00.110> down

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
kind of cross strings there now I'm down

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:12.090 
kind of cross strings there now I'm down
on<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.560> route<00:02:01.720> 62<00:02:02.720> fifth<00:02:03.729> 72<00:02:04.729> fifth<00:02:05.890> slot<00:02:06.890> 323

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.730 

so<00:02:13.100> that's<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> liq<00:02:13.610> as<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.530> okay<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.709> a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so that's the liq as is okay now a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.430 
so that's the liq as is okay now a
couple<00:02:15.950> things<00:02:16.100> that<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.550> doing<00:02:16.820> was<00:02:17.000> using

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
couple things that was doing was using

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.050 
couple things that was doing was using
octave<00:02:18.440> displacement<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> was<00:02:19.340> taking<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
octave displacement and I was taking the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.790 
octave displacement and I was taking the
beginning<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.750> lick<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.290> dropping<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
beginning of that lick and dropping it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.160 
beginning of that lick and dropping it
down<00:02:21.830> an<00:02:22.190> octave<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:25.660> then<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.690> was<00:02:26.870> jumping

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
down an octave and then I was jumping

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:36.370 
down an octave and then I was jumping
back<00:02:27.470> up<00:02:27.709> for<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> rest<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> lick<00:02:35.230> ok<00:02:36.230> and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
back up for the rest of the lick ok and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.600 
back up for the rest of the lick ok and
I<00:02:36.410> don't<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.709> to<00:02:36.800> do<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:36.950> much<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.430> could

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
I don't have to do that much I could

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.280 
I don't have to do that much I could
take<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:37.910> one<00:02:38.030> note<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.660> change<00:02:39.020> where<00:02:39.200> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
take just one note and change where it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.430 
take just one note and change where it
lives<00:02:43.030> come<00:02:44.030> up<00:02:44.209> for<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.420> for<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.200> route

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
lives come up for the for the route

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.320 
lives come up for the for the route
rather<00:02:45.620> than<00:02:45.890> play<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:46.190> down<00:02:46.340> here<00:02:46.670> so

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
rather than play it down here so

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.940 
rather than play it down here so
sometimes<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.020> littlest<00:02:48.440> change<00:02:48.739> like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
sometimes just the littlest change like

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.520 
sometimes just the littlest change like
that<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.280> enough<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.640> keep<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.970> interesting<00:02:50.530> we

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
that is enough to keep it interesting we

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.070 
that is enough to keep it interesting we
were<00:02:51.620> also<00:02:51.860> using<00:02:52.430> repetition<00:02:53.390> at<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:53.900> point

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
were also using repetition at one point

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.560 
were also using repetition at one point
I<00:02:54.260> think<00:02:54.320> I<00:02:54.530> took<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:55.060> chromatic<00:02:56.060> run<00:02:56.299> and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
I think I took that chromatic run and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.699 
I think I took that chromatic run and
started<00:02:56.840> repeating<00:02:57.140> that<00:03:02.170> ok<00:03:03.170> that's<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.470> great

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
started repeating that ok that's a great

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.170 
started repeating that ok that's a great
way<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.030> create<00:03:05.030> some<00:03:05.330> tension<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:07.700> last

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
way to create some tension and then last

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.090 
way to create some tension and then last
we<00:03:08.480> were<00:03:08.600> doing<00:03:08.930> retrograde<00:03:09.590> which<00:03:09.769> means<00:03:09.980> i

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
we were doing retrograde which means i

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.070 
we were doing retrograde which means i
was<00:03:10.220> taking<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.700> lick<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.299> trying<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.930> play

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
was taking this lick and trying to play

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.690 
was taking this lick and trying to play
it<00:03:12.110> backwards<00:03:12.380> now<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.280> doesn't<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> be

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it backwards now it doesn't have to be

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.150 
it backwards now it doesn't have to be
note<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.239> note<00:03:14.269> backwards<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.829> could<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:16.040> be

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
note for note backwards it could just be

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.830 
note for note backwards it could just be
kind<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:16.489> an<00:03:16.610> approximation<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> lake

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
kind of an approximation of the lake

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.220 
kind of an approximation of the lake
backwards<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.459> was<00:03:20.420> starting<00:03:20.810> here<00:03:20.989> on<00:03:21.019> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
backwards so I was starting here on this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.080 
backwards so I was starting here on this
low<00:03:21.500> root<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.640> was<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:22.880> kind<00:03:23.030> of

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
low root and I was just kind of

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.819 
low root and I was just kind of
ascending<00:03:23.570> my<00:03:23.690> way<00:03:23.900> through<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.530> chord

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
ascending my way through that chord

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:31.630 
ascending my way through that chord
shape

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.770 

okay<00:03:32.569> so<00:03:33.020> those<00:03:33.170> are<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.410> few<00:03:33.470> variations

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
okay so those are a few variations

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.600 
okay so those are a few variations
you're<00:03:35.860> encouraged<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.890> come<00:03:37.160> up<00:03:37.310> with<00:03:37.459> your

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
you're encouraged to come up with your

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.180 
you're encouraged to come up with your
own<00:03:38.470> but<00:03:39.470> those<00:03:39.650> should<00:03:39.860> give<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.100> good

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
own but those should give you a good

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.490 
own but those should give you a good
idea<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.730> how<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.120> kind<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.510> put<00:03:41.750> these<00:03:42.140> licks

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
idea of how to kind of put these licks

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.559 
idea of how to kind of put these licks
through<00:03:42.680> their<00:03:42.830> paces<00:03:43.010> let's<00:03:43.970> move<00:03:44.150> on<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.480> our

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
through their paces let's move on to our

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.040 
through their paces let's move on to our
next<00:03:44.690> lead<00:03:45.319> approach<00:03:45.740> now
