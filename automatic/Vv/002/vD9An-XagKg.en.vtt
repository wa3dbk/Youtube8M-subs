00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:07.360
 hello very good everyone I defend and 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.340
 today we are in a new 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.039
 what can be classified as a videogame 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.249
 shadow although I want to take advantage of it in 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.930
 a day that is not Sunday today is to receive 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.050
 a game of the hand of wall fire 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.610
 programmed in juniti which can be 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.490
 denominate as a kind of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.030
 experiment or quite experimental a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.830
 fps in which has three very mechanical 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.960
 nice the first is that the weapon is 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.630
 handles in a very special way it 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.840
 handle in a complex way see if you are 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.420
 revolver with three weapons a colt 1911 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.460
 a glock 18 I always remember a 22 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.410
 right now I'm in Bogota and the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.690
 revolver that you are seeing here every 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 which each weapon is handled in a way 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 different but it will not be just to make the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.220
 recharge we will not have to according to what weapon 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.050
 perform different things as you can 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.620
 do 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.870
 I have taken to remove the bullets manually 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.159
 recharge the catadores manually if it is 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.340
 that we have to pull to assemble the gun 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.290
 in general we will have to use ourselves 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.860
 the weapon with a series of pretty keys 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.960
 broad 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.600
 I left it up there on the right what 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.530
 you can see here is throwing the bullets and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.899
 then for him I can hammer the gun and 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.700
 I can reopen the drum to 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.649
 reintroduce the spirits or 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.180
 I can enter one I can also 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.369
 swear the russa waist 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.950
 also, but that's already a subject 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.200
 apart in itself this makes the game 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.429
 have a very high dimension since it does not 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.080
 we have to worry about only 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.240
 point and shoot we have to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.950
 worry that if there is a bullet in the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 chamber that if we have loaders 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.720
 free that if we have time to 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.750
 recharge and especially that the ammunition 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.430
 it is extremely scarce 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.530
 Another point is that the scenarios 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.080
 honoring that is every time we start 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.200
 our adventure the map will change with 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.729
 a series of fixed platforms will 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.979
 this all so those rooms will be 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.050
 same but they will be distributed 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.460
 different way besides all the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.820
 inventory that may be out there and the 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.410
 enemies will also be randomly edit and the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.530
 third that you know is one of my 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 favorite death is permanent in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.930
 receive we have to absorb about 11 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.330
 cassette tapes which we 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.270
 will explain the murky story in which 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.040
 we will be a kind of subject asleep in 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.140
 a world and we will be a small 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.050
 percentage in which we can escape from 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.730
 this dimension of oppression to be able 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.170
 get to the real world 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.120
 all this will be done explaining by 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.640
 tapes and although it does not seem it especially 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.080
 If you have a medium level of English or a 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 low level but at least you can 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.650
 understand you are going to make a 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.270
 very fun experience and if you do not have 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
 no idea 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.940
 it does not matter because it receives is a 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.100
 disgustingly immersive experience 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.840
 a very competitive price about 499 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.390
 dollars something less in euros like ya 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.210
 you can know this game can give you 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.400
 hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.730
 hours and hours of fun or at least 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.380
 me as a fan of weapons has 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.150
 surprised a lot and I enjoyed 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.310
 communicating with the subject of good fed up 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.350
 to remove the weapon reload put the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.320
 bullets in the magazine now I have to 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.160
 is the recharge hammer mounts 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.220
 disassemble 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.380
 bam bam there will be two types of enemies that 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.570
 It may seem few but they are 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.730
 disgustingly complicated one will be the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.410
 flying turrets and the static ones all 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.410
 this also has its original point 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.630
 because if we depend on where impact 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.060
 one of two we can spend more ammo 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.820
 of the account or we can try to give 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.470
 a critical impact and continue then if 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.390
 we give them in the viewer will be blind and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.160
 they will not get more or in case of 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.040
 We are flying in the middle of the 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.150
 two rotors plummet with the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.210
 Static turrets is a bit more 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.850
 complicated mainly the most point 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.340
 although the most dangerous is the viewer but 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.930
 Of course, the viewer is only 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.820
 available if we shoot ahead if not 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.160
 we can shoot a couple of times some 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.450
 side 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.680
 until the enemies are deactivated 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.560
 and there are times that five may appear 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.050
 this same room which puts us very very 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.550
 very complicated and even more so taking 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.590
 mind that I repeat death is 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.750
 permanent ammunition is scarce and the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.140
 weapon to worry much about it 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.300
 as they notice as something new quite 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.810
 cool about all of 50 that quotes is 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.540
 FPS and difficult to part as we told you 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.249
 I said funny and maybe at least for me 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.319
 I repeat very addictive 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.889
 the blemishes can be those of always the 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:41.769
 futures and one is the translation that already 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.539
 it did not take much, it's just so 

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:45.159
 the cassette tapes which by 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.229
 undo also do not have subtitles and the 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.599
 menu on the right that can be activated 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.819
 what is it that they explain to you what it's called 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.159
 but good to be safe, start that 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.739
 split with that open and testing every 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.539
 key you can pretty much master the use 

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:59.919
 of the weapon although it will take enough 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.029
 games to be able to use it in a 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.069
 fluid indeed if you look here psb looks 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:08.469
 well moves agile but it has cost me 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.119
 enough hours you lose agility and with 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.800
 methods I keep on making many thanks 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.629
 because of patience 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.440
 the second negative point but good 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:20.090
 this is already in everyone's opinion is the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.860
 graphic level the lack of texture but 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.000
 well that already as I tell you has been a 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.390
 game scheduled in seven days for him 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.120
 with things that there was a GPS in seven days 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.930
 I tell them for all the origin was all 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.240
 mechanics 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.380
 everything that it had implemented 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.370
 it is not something to be disdained and also 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.580
 considering it is priced 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.039
 ridiculous 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.770
 so if in a nutshell you want to 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.270
 something different something fun and something to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.240
 less to spend a good weekend 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.310
 or a couple of days stuck to the chair 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.020
 although I guarantee that you will need 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.449
 more than a couple of days to spend it 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.580
 whole receives from this nice good game 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.520
 cheap good maybe or nice not so much 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.430
 but complicated as few and 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.770
 you will learn a tad of arms not much 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.469
 nothing very realistic for less you will know that 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.020
 the bullets and the loaders in the 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.300
 video game 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.900
 they are not infinite to be attentive to the ground 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.690
 not be ammunition at hand as in the 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.780
 video game you have the ones you can and 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.909
 you have to worry about the camera a 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.180
 bullet that if not ammo you have left and 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.610
 those things that is not something at all 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.599
 realistic but if it is at least as 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.000
 about what I've seen in a 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.470
 videogame if more I hope that I have 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.300
 liked this game as always leave me 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.460
 your impressions in the description 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.650
 of the video says Mr. Snake 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:45.190
 like and favorite if you liked to subscribe 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:45.190
 for more and we see each other thanks 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.210
 do not 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.210
 no no
