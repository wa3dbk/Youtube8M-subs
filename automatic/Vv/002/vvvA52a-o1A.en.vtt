peter<00:05:55.060> has<00:05:55.360> been<00:05:55.690> doing<00:05:55.990> for<00:05:56.320> with<00:05:56.560> lua<00:05:56.770> and

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
peter has been doing for with lua and

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.020 
peter has been doing for with lua and
everything<00:05:57.400> alright<00:05:58.410> that's<00:05:59.410> map<00:05:59.620> three

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
everything alright that's map three

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.310 
everything alright that's map three
here's<00:06:01.030> a<00:06:01.060> map<00:06:01.210> to<00:06:01.240> it's<00:06:01.900> completely

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
here's a map to it's completely

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.390 
here's a map to it's completely
different<00:06:04.050> here<00:06:05.050> we<00:06:05.170> go<00:06:05.290> Peter<00:06:06.040> made<00:06:06.250> this

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
different here we go Peter made this

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.740 
different here we go Peter made this
like<00:06:06.640> a<00:06:06.670> while<00:06:06.970> back<00:06:07.180> from<00:06:07.480> one<00:06:07.570> of<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.690> other

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
like a while back from one of the other

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.270 
like a while back from one of the other
videos<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.470> I<00:06:08.590> don't<00:06:08.740> have<00:06:08.830> you<00:06:08.890> ever<00:06:09.010> got<00:06:09.160> to

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
videos and I don't have you ever got to

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.050 
videos and I don't have you ever got to
use<00:06:09.490> it<00:06:09.520> but<00:06:09.850> also<00:06:10.480> are<00:06:10.960> by<00:06:11.350> lucia<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.250> then

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
use it but also are by lucia and then

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.940 
use it but also are by lucia and then
look<00:06:13.540> yet<00:06:14.140> another<00:06:14.680> mat<00:06:15.010> as<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.960> can<00:06:16.960> see<00:06:17.140> tabs

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
look yet another mat as you can see tabs

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.540 
look yet another mat as you can see tabs
are<00:06:18.370> fully<00:06:19.000> functional<00:06:20.550> mission

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
are fully functional mission

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.159 
are fully functional mission
accomplished<00:06:22.150> p<00:06:22.870> cell

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.380 

you

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.910 

so<00:06:29.380> as<00:06:29.440> you<00:06:29.470> know<00:06:29.770> we've<00:06:29.920> got<00:06:30.100> lua<00:06:30.400> in<00:06:30.700> and<00:06:31.920> I'm

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:32.920 
so as you know we've got lua in and I'm

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.700 
so as you know we've got lua in and I'm
testing<00:06:33.670> some<00:06:33.910> of<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.110> functions<00:06:35.110> Falco's

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
testing some of the functions Falco's

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.310 
testing some of the functions Falco's
added<00:06:36.130> every<00:06:36.880> time<00:06:37.000> I<00:06:37.030> think<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.330> a<00:06:37.420> new<00:06:37.600> one<00:06:37.750> he

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
added every time I think of a new one he

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.210 
added every time I think of a new one he
has<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.620> add<00:06:38.740> it<00:06:39.090> so<00:06:40.090> I<00:06:40.150> can<00:06:40.300> actually<00:06:41.220> use

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.220 
has to add it so I can actually use

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.210 
has to add it so I can actually use
stuff<00:06:42.610> Lua<00:06:42.910> I've<00:06:43.510> got<00:06:43.720> this<00:06:43.900> purple<00:06:44.680> tile<00:06:44.920> here

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
stuff Lua I've got this purple tile here

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.660 
stuff Lua I've got this purple tile here
when<00:06:45.880> I<00:06:45.910> walk<00:06:46.210> on<00:06:46.420> it<00:06:46.660> hurts<00:06:46.870> me<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.430> why<00:06:48.430> my

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
when I walk on it hurts me and why my

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.550 
when I walk on it hurts me and why my
health<00:06:48.910> hit<00:06:49.210> zero<00:06:49.570> transported<00:06:50.320> me<00:06:50.380> to<00:06:50.410> the

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 
health hit zero transported me to the

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.040 
health hit zero transported me to the
hospital<00:06:50.740> and<00:06:51.220> set<00:06:51.400> my<00:06:51.520> hope<00:06:51.670> to<00:06:51.850> one<00:06:52.090> so<00:06:53.020> I

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
hospital and set my hope to one so I

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.040 
hospital and set my hope to one so I
don't<00:06:53.230> continue<00:06:53.590> to<00:06:53.970> transport<00:06:54.970> here<00:06:55.180> there's

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
don't continue to transport here there's

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.970 
don't continue to transport here there's
a<00:06:56.110> warp<00:06:56.470> whoops<00:06:57.460> to<00:06:57.640> the<00:06:58.260> like<00:06:59.260> a<00:06:59.290> hockey<00:06:59.620> place

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
a warp whoops to the like a hockey place

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.270 
a warp whoops to the like a hockey place
now<00:07:00.720> slide<00:07:01.720> across<00:07:01.930> this<00:07:02.170> ice<00:07:02.410> here<00:07:02.740> that's

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
now slide across this ice here that's

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.270 
now slide across this ice here that's
done<00:07:03.730> in<00:07:03.910> Lua<00:07:04.710> still<00:07:05.710> trying<00:07:05.950> to<00:07:06.010> figure<00:07:06.160> out

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
done in Lua still trying to figure out

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.120 
done in Lua still trying to figure out
some<00:07:06.610> of<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:07.410> how<00:07:08.410> I<00:07:08.440> can<00:07:08.650> use<00:07:08.770> some<00:07:09.010> of<00:07:09.040> the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
some of the how I can use some of the

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.160 
some of the how I can use some of the
functions<00:07:09.550> to<00:07:09.730> use<00:07:09.880> to<00:07:10.540> do<00:07:10.660> a<00:07:10.960> couple

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
functions to use to do a couple

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.770 
functions to use to do a couple
different<00:07:11.380> things<00:07:12.300> still<00:07:13.300> figuring<00:07:13.570> out

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
different things still figuring out

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:20.520 
different things still figuring out
which<00:07:14.320> ones<00:07:14.560> we<00:07:14.710> need<00:07:14.830> to<00:07:14.920> add<00:07:15.870> and<00:07:19.080> you<00:07:20.080> find

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.530 
which ones we need to add and you find

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:28.270 
which ones we need to add and you find
the<00:07:20.710> code<00:07:21.250> here<00:07:21.610> that<00:07:21.790> does<00:07:21.970> that

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.710 

here<00:07:29.280> it<00:07:29.340> is<00:07:30.380> is<00:07:31.490> the<00:07:32.490> hospital<00:07:33.180> how<00:07:33.420> it<00:07:33.570> does

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 
here it is is the hospital how it does

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.750 
here it is is the hospital how it does
that<00:07:33.780> the<00:07:35.060> ice<00:07:36.620> ice<00:07:37.620> place<00:07:37.950> there<00:07:38.250> is<00:07:38.400> just<00:07:38.640> the

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
that the ice ice place there is just the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.270 
that the ice ice place there is just the
main<00:07:39.320> function<00:07:40.320> that<00:07:40.490> runs<00:07:41.490> every<00:07:41.850> frame<00:07:43.280> so

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
main function that runs every frame so

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.120 
main function that runs every frame so
yeah<00:07:44.520> it's<00:07:45.390> Loula<00:07:45.750> and<00:07:46.500> uh<00:07:47.780> days<00:07:48.780> get<00:07:49.770> that's

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.130 
yeah it's Loula and uh days get that's

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.840 
yeah it's Loula and uh days get that's
getting<00:07:50.910> stuff<00:07:51.150> from<00:07:51.240> C<00:07:51.600> and<00:07:51.870> then<00:07:51.990> said<00:07:52.560> its

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:52.850 
getting stuff from C and then said its

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.730 
getting stuff from C and then said its
setting<00:07:53.850> variables<00:07:54.360> that<00:07:54.660> the<00:07:55.440> engine

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 
setting variables that the engine

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.030 
setting variables that the engine
actually<00:07:56.070> uses<00:07:56.600> as<00:07:57.620> Lou<00:07:58.620> it's<00:07:58.800> pretty

00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.040 
actually uses as Lou it's pretty
