gonna take a look at a beautiful brassia

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
gonna take a look at a beautiful brassia
hybrid<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> brass<00:00:12.870> yeah

eternal wind what a beautiful display I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
eternal wind what a beautiful display I
have<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.710> year<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> circuit<00:00:18.510> for

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
have this year so I have to circuit for

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.540 
have this year so I have to circuit for
about<00:00:18.720> two<00:00:19.199> years<00:00:19.500> now<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.130> has<00:00:20.340> been<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
about two years now it has been a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.880 
about two years now it has been a
reliable<00:00:20.910> bloomer<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.779> blooms<00:00:22.080> once<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.680> year

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
reliable bloomer it blooms once a year

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
reliable bloomer it blooms once a year
for<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.340> usually<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> warmest<00:00:24.660> months

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
for me usually in the warmest months

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
for me usually in the warmest months
like<00:00:25.289> spring<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> summer<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.460> also<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.570> go

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like spring and summer and also can go

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.870 
like spring and summer and also can go
through<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> fall<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> summer<00:00:29.550> time

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
through the fall but in the summer time

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.580 
through the fall but in the summer time
or<00:00:30.150> right<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> middle<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.869> summer<00:00:31.140> usually

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
or right in the middle of summer usually

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
or right in the middle of summer usually
this<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.489> bloom<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.570> don't<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:34.079> if

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this one is in bloom and I don't know if

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.549 
this one is in bloom and I don't know if
you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.590> actually<00:00:34.980> notice<00:00:35.370> how<00:00:36.180> big<00:00:36.930> these

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you can actually notice how big these

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
you can actually notice how big these
flowers<00:00:38.040> are<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:39.270> cannot<00:00:39.570> compare<00:00:40.320> them

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
flowers are I really cannot compare them

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.069 
flowers are I really cannot compare them
the<00:00:41.040> circuit<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> big<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the circuit is really a big one and it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.520 
the circuit is really a big one and it
produces<00:00:43.649> great<00:00:44.550> great<00:00:44.879> big<00:00:45.390> flowers<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
produces great great big flowers of

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.490 
produces great great big flowers of
course<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.520> spidery<00:00:48.210> shape<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.079> flowers

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
course the spidery shape of the flowers

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.390 
indeed slightly spicy and slightly sweet
at<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.390> same<00:01:30.600> time<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.860> completely

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
at the same time but I can completely

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
blooms are absolutely amazing I don't
think<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> can<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.150> wild<00:01:39.689> look

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
think you can go for a more wild look

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.530 
think you can go for a more wild look
than<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.860> orchid<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.939> here's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> funny

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
than this orchid now here's a funny

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
than this orchid now here's a funny
thing<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.200> brassia<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.340> first<00:01:44.549> few

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
thing about this brassia the first few

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730 
thing about this brassia the first few
flowers<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> little<00:01:45.780> deformity<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
flowers have a little deformity if you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.429 
flowers have a little deformity if you
can<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> lip<00:01:47.549> goes<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:49.049> very

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can see the lip goes into a very very

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.760 
can see the lip goes into a very very
thin<00:01:50.100> strain<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.750> petals<00:01:52.170> but

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
thin strain just like the petals but

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.109 
thin strain just like the petals but
it's<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.220> supposed<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.640> do<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it's not supposed to do that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's not supposed to do that
the<00:01:54.360> flowers<00:01:54.659> usually<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.590> broader<00:01:55.979> lip

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the flowers usually have a broader lip

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.030 
the flowers usually have a broader lip
that<00:01:57.180> has<00:01:57.450> spots<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.439> see<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:58.860> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
that has spots as you can see here this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.980 
that has spots as you can see here this
is<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> circuit<00:01:59.820> should<00:02:00.000> look<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.240> but

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
is how the circuit should look like but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.679 
is how the circuit should look like but
yeah<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> few<00:02:02.219> deformities<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
yeah I have a few deformities on just a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.249 
yeah I have a few deformities on just a
few<00:02:03.869> flowers

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
few flowers

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.929 
few flowers
I<00:02:04.439> cannot<00:02:04.860> say<00:02:05.070> dislike<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.759> interesting

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
I cannot say dislike it it's interesting

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.809 
I cannot say dislike it it's interesting
it<00:02:06.509> adds<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> effect<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.979> spider<00:02:08.340> enos

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it adds to the effect of the spider enos

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.240 
it adds to the effect of the spider enos
now<00:02:09.599> regarding<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.170> orchid<00:02:10.560> itself<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.099> have

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
now regarding the orchid itself I have

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.320 
now regarding the orchid itself I have
to<00:02:11.280> say<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.670> brass<00:02:11.970> yeah

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
to say this brass yeah

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.080 
to say this brass yeah
does<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:13.050> have<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.620> crazy<00:02:14.040> tendency<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
does not have that crazy tendency to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.740 
does not have that crazy tendency to
lean<00:02:15.300> over

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
lean over

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.510 
lean over
of<00:02:15.930> course<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.350> pseudobulbs<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:17.220> lean<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
of course the pseudobulbs can lean to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.490 
of course the pseudobulbs can lean to
one<00:02:17.700> side<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:18.990> rascals<00:02:19.410> who

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
one side but there are some rascals who

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370 
one side but there are some rascals who
simply<00:02:19.800> grow<00:02:20.090> horizontally<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.600> one<00:02:21.810> never

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
simply grow horizontally this one never

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.250 
simply grow horizontally this one never
gave<00:02:22.620> me<00:02:22.770> troubles<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.490> tried<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.150> shape<00:02:25.050> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
gave me troubles I tried to shape it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440 
gave me troubles I tried to shape it
just<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.740> little<00:02:25.920> bit<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.430> wasn't<00:02:26.850> that

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
just a little bit but it wasn't that

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.500 
just a little bit but it wasn't that
much<00:02:27.750> need<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.380> shaping<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.610> also<00:02:30.330> as

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
much need of shaping really and also as

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.630 
much need of shaping really and also as
you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.260> pseudobulbs<00:02:31.800> are<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.280> that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you can see the pseudobulbs are not that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.180 
you can see the pseudobulbs are not that
elongated<00:02:33.240> they're<00:02:33.990> pretty<00:02:34.230> much<00:02:34.440> egg-shaped

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
elongated they're pretty much egg-shaped

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.360 
elongated they're pretty much egg-shaped
compared<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.210> other<00:02:36.390> brass<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.010> only

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
compared to other brass this is the only

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
compared to other brass this is the only
one<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.970> who<00:02:39.330> produces<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
one that I know of who produces this

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
one that I know of who produces this
type<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.440> suitable<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.370> round<00:02:41.760> suitable

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
type of suitable more round suitable

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.270 
type of suitable more round suitable
than<00:02:42.510> other<00:02:42.750> breccias<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.890> from<00:02:44.130> that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
than other breccias so from that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.270 
than other breccias so from that
perspective<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:45.150> give<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.140> 10<00:02:46.530> because

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
perspective I give this one a 10 because

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.430 
perspective I give this one a 10 because
brass<00:02:47.730> has<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.240> they're<00:02:48.360> hybrids<00:02:48.720> really

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
brass has and they're hybrids really

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
brass has and they're hybrids really
really<00:02:50.070> have<00:02:50.250> an<00:02:50.370> issue<00:02:50.520> with<00:02:50.760> leaning<00:02:51.240> over

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
really have an issue with leaning over

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.410 
really have an issue with leaning over
now<00:02:52.170> Carol<00:02:52.620> Weiss<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.430> hybrid<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> joy

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
now Carol Weiss this hybrid is a joy

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720 
now Carol Weiss this hybrid is a joy
really<00:02:54.810> she<00:02:55.080> doesn't<00:02:55.470> even<00:02:55.560> get<00:02:55.830> too<00:02:56.310> strong

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
really she doesn't even get too strong

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
really she doesn't even get too strong
light<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.360> don't<00:02:57.780> think<00:02:58.170> she<00:02:58.380> gets<00:02:58.740> more<00:02:59.160> than<00:02:59.550> 2

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
light I don't think she gets more than 2

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.240 
light I don't think she gets more than 2
months<00:03:00.540> per<00:03:00.720> year<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.140> direct<00:03:01.560> sunshine<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
months per year of direct sunshine and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.370 
months per year of direct sunshine and
only<00:03:02.610> in<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.820> morning<00:03:03.209> other<00:03:03.660> than<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.140> she

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
only in the morning other than that she

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.040 
only in the morning other than that she
really<00:03:04.680> receives<00:03:05.070> bright<00:03:05.790> diffuse<00:03:06.330> let's<00:03:06.810> say

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
really receives bright diffuse let's say

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.260 
really receives bright diffuse let's say
but<00:03:07.410> it's<00:03:07.650> nothing<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.340> cat<00:03:08.730> Leah<00:03:09.000> light

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
but it's nothing like a cat Leah light

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.720 
but it's nothing like a cat Leah light
and<00:03:09.510> still<00:03:10.110> blooms<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.800> goes<00:03:11.010> great<00:03:11.400> I'm

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
and still blooms and it goes great I'm

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.820 
and still blooms and it goes great I'm
not<00:03:12.120> sure<00:03:12.270> if<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.600> trait<00:03:12.870> with<00:03:13.080> all<00:03:13.380> types

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
not sure if it's a trait with all types

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.740 
not sure if it's a trait with all types
of<00:03:13.980> brass<00:03:14.220> yes<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.880> particular<00:03:15.090> one<00:03:15.360> can

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
of brass yes but this particular one can

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.259 
of brass yes but this particular one can
handle<00:03:16.370> intermediate<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.670> bright<00:03:18.030> light

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
handle intermediate to bright light

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.790 
handle intermediate to bright light
conditions<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.989> can<00:03:19.170> still<00:03:19.380> bloom

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
conditions and can still bloom

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.400 
conditions and can still bloom
beautifully<00:03:20.550> her<00:03:21.030> only<00:03:21.450> downside<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.350> that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
beautifully her only downside is that

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.430 
beautifully her only downside is that
she<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.310> thirsty<00:03:23.970> really<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:24.930> thirsty

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
she is thirsty really really thirsty

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.199 
she is thirsty really really thirsty
the<00:03:25.680> bigger<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.130> orchid<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.550> course<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.000> more

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
the bigger the orchid of course the more

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.300 
the bigger the orchid of course the more
the<00:03:27.239> need<00:03:27.510> for<00:03:27.750> water<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.070> particular

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
the need for water but this particular

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.670 
the need for water but this particular
one<00:03:29.610> seems<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> just<00:03:30.600> drink<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.200> lot<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.440> water

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
one seems to just drink a lot of water

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.400 
one seems to just drink a lot of water
and<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.459> have<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.880> water<00:03:33.060> her<00:03:33.269> every<00:03:33.750> three<00:03:34.140> days

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and I have to water her every three days

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.860 
and I have to water her every three days
or<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.800> now<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.489> have<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> cure<00:03:36.269> video<00:03:36.600> for

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
or so now I do have a cure video for

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.320 
or so now I do have a cure video for
brassy<00:03:37.140> as<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.769> find<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.220> link<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.580> the
