 Hi, I apologize in advance sound 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.890
 will talk about the system for games that is 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.670
 the operating system of course is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.160
 there will be windows for those who are not interested in me 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 I recommend this system 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.900
 leave a link to them for 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.080
 computer that we took microsoft 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.470
 windows in general who are not interested just 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.380
 downloading the system will not leave a link to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.000
 Yandex drive leave a link to the mountain 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.120
 uterus for march on with other resources 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 download immediately every torrent no so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 Let's start with why I probably choose 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.940
 64 bits and even for hay for games chooses 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.270
 fifty four bits because 32 bits 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.050
 care of the past take four bits they 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 support more memory ie 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.230
 let's say 32 bits 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 they support no more operational 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.840
 with three and a half gigabyte 64 bits 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 lived supports much more and the most 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.129
 important probably all four bits in games 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.760
 games because 64 bits in games are everywhere 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.390
 At the maximum speeds, but 32 bits are not 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.930
 everywhere right plain text writes to you 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.420
 64 bit windows required 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.080
 so we set fight 4 5 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.840
 we forget in general what is 32 bits further 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 why i choose windows 8 of course for 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.970
 his speed for me he is much 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.950
 faster kennel month 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.380
 windows 7 and that is, many say that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 windows 7 is different for me like 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 tests somewhere faster not that slow for 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 me faster 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.360
 windows 8 and you really faster me 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.000
 It seems why many are mistaken so 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.270
 opinion that he is not ice uncomfortable 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.070
 you see disagreement right away 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 crashes on this screen yes that is not 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 is loaded through it someone does not need 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.729
 does not load at all although it is pretty 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.290
 useful informative screen and on 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.030
 desktop is not hard to go 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.860
 there is also a start menu which also 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.290
 chosen as customizable 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.870
 there is nothing difficult in it even the panel 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.849
 control is the same as with folders 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.709
 design changed i.e. click on 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.840
 computer here at all everyone can immediately 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.989
 do that is open the panel 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 managing basic these settings 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.269
 add also how to find added 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.629
 documents immediately this okapi document 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.190
 not so seven already together like 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.030
 added to the viste the device did not use 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.819
 tynda and 7 added this 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.220
 I decide what something is before the impact or is it 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.650
 I became very comfortable 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.200
 I don't sit for half an hour I've always been 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.440
 downhill you see even there is no panel now 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.519
 control but she was here before 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.870
 but go look here immediately clicked horse 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.150
 folder open bank protoplasm all 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.519
 I discovered I do not think in principle, not really 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.950
 it is easier for u but i still like that 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:14.700
 everything is more convenient and there is no difference 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.760
 it seems to me the design of convenience 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.130
 Convenience only differs in that skype 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.250
 on skype the most important thing on skype 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.620
 swinging only through the store but me 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.109
 skit sizes many will find out this download 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.260
 stupidly with another resource and also installed 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.950
 it will also work the same and not 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.250
 I need no registration to do everything I 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.430
 leave a link to windows on the forum with 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.500
 windows itself on windows site and i will leave 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.359
 link to 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.519
 it is on skype on the software here's a dot com 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.190
 I use Skype atomizer for half a year 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.260
 that's all right forever 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.919
 use this scott software portal 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.480
 downloaded 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:04:00.109
 and no problems were all thanks 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.109
 bye everyone
