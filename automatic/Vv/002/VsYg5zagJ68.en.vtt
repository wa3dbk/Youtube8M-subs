Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.289
Everybody relish eating chikki during winters.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:23.585
Chikki is prepared with numerous styles like peanuts chikki, sesame seeds chikki and dry fruit chikki.

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:30.406
Today we’ll make chana (chickpea) chikki with scrumptious taste.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.648
Let’s start with the procedure of making Chana chikki.

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:41.523
For this melt sugar in a wok firstly.

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:50.593
Add 1 tsp ghee in wok and turn on the flame.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.195
Keep the flame medium.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.438
Now add sugar into it.

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:07.226
We are using 1.25 cup (300 grams) sugar.

00:01:07.703 --> 00:01:18.078
Stir constantly and cook until it dissolves completely

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:21.539
Keep the flame medium-low.

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:25.969
Sugar has started melting.

00:01:26.414 --> 00:01:35.328
But cook it for few more minutes until it dissolves completely.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.062
Keep stirring constantly else it can burn.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.960
Sugar has melted now, don’t overcook it.

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.461
Turn the flame to minimum.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.875
Make sure sugar is not overcooked else there can be change in flavor.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.570
Sugar is melted, now add chanas into it.

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:20.578
We are using 2 cups (300 grams) chana.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.601
These chanas (without skin) can be easily bought from any grocery store.

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:35.195
Mix the ingredients really well.

00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:37.555
Keep the flame minimum.

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:46.438
Now we will set the chikki.

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:51.117
For this we require plates like this.

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:56.336
Grease the back side of plates with some ghee.

00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:08.312
Now use it for setting chikki.

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:14.046
We are using two plates to set the chikki.

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:33.195
Place ½ the amount of mixture on one plate and spread it thinly with silicon spatula.

00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:37.266
Spread it as thin as possible.

00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.633
Now allow it to cool.

00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:57.296
Likewise spread chikki on another plate.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:15.820
Chikki is set, now separate it from plate.

00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:21.273
If chikki gets too frigid then it can get difficult to separate it out from plate.

00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:35.632
In this case we’ll have to place the plate directly over flame and then with help of knife separate it out.

00:04:41.602 --> 00:04:46.484
Chikki is sticking to the plate as it’s still warm.

00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:54.046
We have separated the chikki from plate.

00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:58.398
Place it on a plate and allow cooling.

00:04:58.953 --> 00:05:01.781
Likewise separate the other chikki as well.

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:10.203
You can even make this chikki in small size.

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:18.906
Chikki is now ready.

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:26.625
Mouth watering, delicious and crunchy chana chikki is ready.

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:35.125
We have used sugar for making this chikki but jaggery can also be used.

00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:38.102
But chikki made with sugar is crispier.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.781
Chikki can be prepared very easily but you need to take note of few things.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.453
While melting sugar stir it constantly.

00:05:49.625 --> 00:06:03.703
When sugar melts completely immediately reduce the flame, add chana into it and set the chikki.

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:13.820
We have made chikki in big size but you can even make them in small sizes as it will be easy to handle.

00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.531
Chikki can be easily prepared.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:27.382
When chikki turns frigid, store it in any container and enjoy eating for upto 6 months.
