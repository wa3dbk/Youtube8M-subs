hatcheries is a pretty unique machine
that<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.280> developed<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.600> certainly

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that was developed and it's certainly

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.530 
that was developed and it's certainly
going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> help<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.980> industry<00:00:38.219> move<00:00:39.090> forward

there's help a fast-track our new
farming<00:01:02.430> practice<00:01:02.789> methods<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.570> can

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
farming practice methods so we can
