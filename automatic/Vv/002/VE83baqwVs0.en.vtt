better<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:00.600> think<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.170> stand<00:02:01.770> behind<00:02:01.890> here

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
better I think and stand behind here

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.550 
better I think and stand behind here
peak<00:02:02.610> activity<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.270> cover<00:02:03.570> pretty<00:02:04.290> useful

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
peak activity not a cover pretty useful

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.250 
peak activity not a cover pretty useful
if<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.070> ask<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:05.870> next<00:02:06.870> we're<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
if you ask me but next we're going to

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.770 
if you ask me but next we're going to
have<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.770> different<00:02:08.460> way<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> get<00:02:08.880> up<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
have a different way to get up there so

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.700 
have a different way to get up there so
this<00:02:09.960> is<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.140> probably<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.590> most

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
this is actually probably the most

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.110 
this is actually probably the most
popular<00:02:11.100> spot<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.460> matter<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.910> you've

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
ever played it you jump right here walk

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.150 
ever played it you jump right here walk
across<00:02:14.880> sprint<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.020> jump<00:02:16.320> in<00:02:16.470> spam<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.950> you'll

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
across sprint and jump in spam a you'll

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.250 
across sprint and jump in spam a you'll
be<00:02:17.250> able<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.430> come<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.670> here<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.209> shoot<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
be able to come up here and shoot the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.400 
be able to come up here and shoot the
window<00:02:19.880> jump<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.600> will<00:02:21.750> back<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:22.170> here

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
window jump and you will back up here

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.970 
window jump and you will back up here
once<00:02:22.770> again<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:25.260> basically<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.860> can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
once again so this is basically you can

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.350 
once again so this is basically you can
go<00:02:26.100> both<00:02:26.280> ways<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.760> jump<00:02:26.940> from<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.209> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
go both ways you can jump from there to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.570 
go both ways you can jump from there to
here<00:02:27.540> obviously<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.860> pretty<00:02:28.950> cool<00:02:29.190> so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
here obviously and it's pretty cool so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.490 
here obviously and it's pretty cool so
there's<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> couple<00:02:30.060> ways<00:02:30.240> also<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.080> get<00:02:31.410> up

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
there's a couple ways also to get up

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.440 
there's a couple ways also to get up
into<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.860> area<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.670> what<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> should<00:02:33.270> do<00:02:33.360> is

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
into this area so what you should do is

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.910 
into this area so what you should do is
like<00:02:33.540> throw<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.780> sign<00:02:34.020> up<00:02:34.110> there<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.709> run

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
like throw a sign up there and then run

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.340 
like throw a sign up there and then run
up<00:02:35.040> here<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.570> we<00:02:36.570> can<00:02:36.690> do<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.930> just<00:02:36.959> line

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
up here and we can do is just line

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.920 
up here and we can do is just line
yourself<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.739> with<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> window<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.330> jump<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
yourself up with the window and jump and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.140 
yourself up with the window and jump and
you<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.020> hop<00:02:40.590> on<00:02:40.800> up<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.280> pretty<00:02:41.910> useful

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
you can hop on up here pretty useful

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.420 
you can hop on up here pretty useful
kind<00:02:43.020> of<00:02:43.080> obvious<00:02:43.380> though<00:02:43.590> another<00:02:44.220> one

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
kind of obvious though another one

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.340 
kind of obvious though another one
that's<00:02:44.580> pretty<00:02:44.760> obvious<00:02:45.060> as<00:02:45.510> well<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.989> right

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
that's pretty obvious as well as right

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.290 
that's pretty obvious as well as right
here<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.770> can<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:46.950> hop<00:02:47.190> right<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.459> pretty

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
here you can just hop right up pretty

basically<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.110> entire<00:03:07.290> map<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.070> know<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.250> just

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
basically the entire map I know I just

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.860 
basically the entire map I know I just
did<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> complete<00:03:09.150> circle<00:03:09.600> around<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
did a complete circle around the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.710 
did a complete circle around the
perimeter<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:11.549> said<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.120> good<00:03:12.450> for

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
perimeter and like I said it's good for

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.360 
perimeter and like I said it's good for
all<00:03:12.780> your<00:03:12.959> newcomers<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.440> black<00:03:13.799> ops<00:03:14.040> and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
everything so anyway think that's

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.960
