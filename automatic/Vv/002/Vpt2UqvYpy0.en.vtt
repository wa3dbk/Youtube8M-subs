is going to go in the back of the

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:44.349 
is going to go in the back of the
computer<00:02:37.730> set<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.810> side<00:02:42.519> down<00:02:43.519> here<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.180> will

computer set that side down here we will

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.270 
computer set that side down here we will
got<00:02:44.720> our<00:02:46.030> power<00:02:47.030> brick<00:02:47.570> and<00:02:48.260> charging<00:02:48.859> cable
