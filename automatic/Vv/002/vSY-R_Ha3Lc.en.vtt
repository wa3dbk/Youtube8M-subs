00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.289 
it through the top of the hairpin and
then<00:02:03.009> you're<00:02:03.130> going<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.310> pull<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.549> through<00:02:03.579> the

then you're going to pull it through the

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.740 
then you're going to pull it through the
root<00:02:04.479> see<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.409> it<00:02:06.130> goes<00:02:06.399> through<00:02:06.850> then

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
going to go in different angles if you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.580 
going to go in different angles if you
can<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.509> I'm<00:02:10.569> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.780> go<00:02:10.959> around<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.319> back

now I'm going to push the closed end of

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.460 
now I'm going to push the closed end of
the<00:02:20.709> hairpin<00:02:21.580> through<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.390> root<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.959> my<00:02:23.140> lock

to<00:02:48.160> do<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.640> more<00:02:48.910> time<00:02:49.209> for<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:50.049> lock<00:02:51.600> push

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
to do one more time for this lock push

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.729 
to do one more time for this lock push
it<00:02:52.780> through<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.880> pull<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:59.049> there<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.350> have<00:02:59.410> it

try to pull it up this is how it looks

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.440 
try to pull it up this is how it looks
it's<00:03:55.280> relatively<00:03:56.280> neat<00:03:56.549> I<00:03:56.790> would<00:03:57.030> call<00:03:57.269> it

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
it's relatively neat I would call it

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.699 
it's relatively neat I would call it
meat<00:03:57.709> relatively<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:59.090> have<00:04:00.140> misbehaving<00:04:01.140> here

meat relatively I have misbehaving here

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.630 
meat relatively I have misbehaving here
my<00:04:01.950> hair<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:03.510> loses<00:04:04.319> out<00:04:04.860> very<00:04:05.310> easily

they're very slack or it is very
sluggish<00:04:35.850> see<00:04:36.449> soon<00:04:37.229> I'm<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.180> push<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
sluggish see soon I'm going to push the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.240 
sluggish see soon I'm going to push the
top<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.690> hair<00:04:42.870> pin<00:04:43.050> through<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.530> road<00:04:43.830> and

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
top of the hair pin through the road and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.909 
top of the hair pin through the road and
then<00:04:45.090> bring<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.539> loose<00:04:45.840> end<00:04:46.199> of<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.710> lock

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
then bring the loose end of the lock

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.480 
then bring the loose end of the lock
through<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.880> top<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.330> hair<00:04:48.660> pin<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.979> then

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
through the top of the hair pin and then

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.300 
through the top of the hair pin and then
I'm<00:04:50.610> going<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.820> pull<00:04:51.030> it<00:04:51.120> through<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.600> root<00:04:52.310> so

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
I'm going to pull it through the root so

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.540 
I'm going to pull it through the root so
you<00:04:53.370> do<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.729> in<00:04:54.000> different<00:04:54.210> directions

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
you do that in different directions

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.390 
you do that in different directions
until<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:57.000> have<00:04:57.389> locked<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.620> roots<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.340> your

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
until you have locked the roots of your

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.960 
until you have locked the roots of your
hair

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.140 

it's<00:05:07.970> if<00:05:08.390> this<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:08.780> super<00:05:09.560> easy<00:05:09.800> like<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.760> takes

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
it's if this is super easy like it takes

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.420 
it's if this is super easy like it takes
its<00:05:11.390> time<00:05:11.630> consuming<00:05:11.870> but<00:05:12.560> it's<00:05:12.740> very<00:05:13.070> easy

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
its time consuming but it's very easy

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.180 
its time consuming but it's very easy
and<00:05:13.730> this<00:05:14.420> is<00:05:14.480> time-consuming<00:05:15.440> because<00:05:15.830> of

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
and this is time-consuming because of

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.720 
and this is time-consuming because of
how<00:05:16.340> thin<00:05:16.670> my<00:05:16.880> locks<00:05:17.150> are<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.340> think<00:05:19.370> this

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
how thin my locks are and I think this

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.880 
how thin my locks are and I think this
method<00:05:20.210> would<00:05:20.420> only<00:05:20.600> work<00:05:20.960> for<00:05:21.260> people<00:05:21.440> who

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
method would only work for people who

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:34.450 
method would only work for people who
have<00:05:22.280> really<00:05:22.880> thin<00:05:23.300> locks<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:33.250> probably<00:05:34.250> you

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
have really thin locks and probably you

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430 
have really thin locks and probably you
should<00:05:34.670> do<00:05:34.790> this<00:05:34.910> unclean<00:05:35.600> here<00:05:36.020> you<00:05:36.260> should

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
should do this unclean here you should

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.190 
should do this unclean here you should
get<00:05:36.590> your<00:05:36.710> hair<00:05:36.950> washed<00:05:37.390> before<00:05:38.390> you<00:05:38.720> tighten

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
get your hair washed before you tighten

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.700 
get your hair washed before you tighten
your<00:05:39.230> roots<00:05:39.710> because<00:05:41.080> that's<00:05:42.080> supposed<00:05:42.530> to

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
your roots because that's supposed to

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.520 
your roots because that's supposed to
feel<00:05:42.980> pretty<00:05:43.310> sticky<00:05:44.090> your<00:05:44.570> here<00:05:44.840> is<00:05:45.020> dirty

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
feel pretty sticky your here is dirty

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.440 
feel pretty sticky your here is dirty
and<00:05:45.920> stuff<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.520> then<00:05:46.640> your<00:05:46.790> tightening<00:05:47.240> your

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
and stuff and then your tightening your

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.840 
and stuff and then your tightening your
roots<00:05:47.690> so<00:05:47.960> try<00:05:48.740> to<00:05:48.770> get<00:05:49.010> your<00:05:49.190> hair<00:05:49.550> wash

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
roots so try to get your hair wash

00:05:49.850 --> 00:06:00.600 
roots so try to get your hair wash
before<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:51.160> tighten<00:05:52.160> your<00:05:52.190> roots

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.390 

you<00:06:01.610> see<00:06:02.800> it's<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.850> basic<00:06:06.010> looping<00:06:07.010> method

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
you see it's the basic looping method

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.950 
you see it's the basic looping method
you<00:06:07.520> just<00:06:07.790> loop<00:06:08.300> it<00:06:08.510> in<00:06:09.250> different<00:06:10.250> angles

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
you just loop it in different angles

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.100 
you just loop it in different angles
until<00:06:11.960> you've<00:06:12.230> had<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.920> locked<00:06:13.280> and<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:14.110> started

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
until you've had it locked and I started
