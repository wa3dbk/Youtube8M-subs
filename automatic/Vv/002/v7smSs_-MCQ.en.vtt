00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.810
 hello today we have the second advent 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.940
 an advent wreath is last week 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.200
 finished and I now use the 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.040
 opportunity to another 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.040
 tinker hour 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.930
 I have me 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 chunk salt dough from my last 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.450
 then I can do it well 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 use as the recipe goes already 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.410
 in my other videos again and again 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.320
 I like to say it again in 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.130
 the infobox flour salt and water that is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.680
 the secret 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.869
 As an accessory I need a small one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.690
 knives for small notches or around the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.340
 to manufacture flights and the big knife 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.440
 I actually use the small one 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 then figure from the ground to solve 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.970
 otherwise I have a straw 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 and a skewer for eventual 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.280
 holes or the like and off you go 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.090
 I always roll out of everything first 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.070
 a ball 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.610
 Now we make the body natural 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.200
 from a ball if you have little figures 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.990
 Saturday should always be on 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.080
 Be a little firmer with it so me 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.360
 quickly sinking down so that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.570
 is my ball she is smaller than one 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.820
 Chicken eggs would say in diameter three 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.560
 centimeters and that just becomes 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.979
 pressed a bit flat and already comes 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.660
 head on the balls are with water 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.250
 clamped together I always have one 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.470
 small cup with a bit of water 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.140
 stand by because I think then just 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 a finger and wipe it briefly 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.959
 over the surface glued together 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.330
 shall be 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.270
 I always do the bigger ones first 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.050
 parts and the smaller ones only to 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 conclusion 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.700
 Therefore, now the hat is a 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.240
 little bird is wearing one 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.060
 Christmas hat is also the zipfelmÃ¼tze 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.400
 first a ball where you then one 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.200
 small cone shapes out and down one 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.970
 hole impression so that on the head 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.140
 to adjust 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.140
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.650
 it will be watered up too 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.030
 the head stuck so it looks then 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.090
 the little bird now feels one more 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:59.549
 tail roll to roll again a ball 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.920
 shape it into a triangle press it 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.140
 flat and the upper end is now 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.090
 complained then it still looks feathers 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.090
 this works best with the back of the knife 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.269
 and just live on the back 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.190
 The feet are easily under the body 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.079
 just stuck two triangles again 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.200
 Shapes and only when they are on the body 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:28.670
 they will notify you that it will stick 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.079
 after ten looks like this 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.599
 Next is the beak on the 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.190
 You simply shape it as one 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.409
 bird beak looks like as well 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.260
 small piece of cake on one corner 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.690
 flatten and so with a lot of water into the 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.000
 stick face 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.449
 if the beak goes well then with the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.949
 on the side of the knife something from 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:53.910
 every page and always with your finger 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:57.629
 thus counteract a kind of bipartite 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.419
 beak, that's what it looks like 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.260
 now are still missing the eyes and the 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.090
 wing and the pompom to the cap for it 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.190
 I roll a little bit dough 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.169
 I am cutting a role here 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.430
 evenly spaced two balls off 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:16.590
 so that the eyes become the same size 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.870
 you also get two for the wings 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.180
 the same big drop you flatten 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.740
 push and buy something and then 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.560
 Be the ones at the side 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.240
 glued in the front half around the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.080
 Rear will be slightly outward and after 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 bent up
