00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.520 
thoughts on this yeah I'll tell you it's
this<00:01:48.370> is<00:01:48.640> what<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.450> Troy<00:01:49.780> just<00:01:50.110> talked<00:01:50.410> about

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
this is what the Troy just talked about

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.030 
this is what the Troy just talked about
okay<00:01:51.040> did<00:01:51.940> he<00:01:51.970> maintain<00:01:52.540> control<00:01:53.440> of<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.830> ball

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
okay did he maintain control of the ball

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.550 
okay did he maintain control of the ball
long<00:01:54.400> enough<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.910> perform<00:01:55.330> an<00:01:55.660> act<00:01:56.020> comment<00:01:56.500> of

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
long enough to perform an act comment of

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.970 
long enough to perform an act comment of
the<00:01:56.650> game<00:01:56.860> after<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.690> second<00:01:59.140> foot<00:01:59.440> came<00:01:59.710> down

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
the game after the second foot came down

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.460 
the game after the second foot came down
so<00:02:00.580> if<00:02:00.910> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.210> run<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.480> back<00:02:01.870> that's<00:02:02.200> going

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
so if you do run that back that's going

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.870 
so if you do run that back that's going
to<00:02:02.560> be<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.830> question<00:02:03.010> because<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.670> rule

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
to be the question because the rule

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.700 
to be the question because the rule
clearly<00:02:04.150> states<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.810> got<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.110> have<00:02:05.260> control

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
clearly states you got to have control

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.980 
clearly states you got to have control
which<00:02:06.010> he<00:02:06.160> did<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.880> got<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.240> get<00:02:07.390> both<00:02:07.630> feet

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
which he did you got to get both feet

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.310 
which he did you got to get both feet
