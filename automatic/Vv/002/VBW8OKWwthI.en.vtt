00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.079
 also indicates that it is a very 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.659
 balanced and the camp you go in the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.760
 schools where we do not have this project the 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.280
 children miss a lot while here 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.930
 children are not absent is this 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.169
 because they know here they are going to eat 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.169
 at noon and that's very important 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:16.020
 the nutritional component and a few 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:20.940
 days a very special thing 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:24.390

00:03:30.300 --> 00:04:07.100

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.100
 play here 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.330
 and 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.330
 I thought 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.889
 1 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 we 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:57.130
 among other things because he understood that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.370

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:22.240
 a little difficult she the project is 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.540
 planned for three years and we ask 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.690

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:33.990
 with her to give all the strength 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.990
 to be able to succeed in this project 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.760
 or 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:48.349
 this child could be a hope for 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.949
