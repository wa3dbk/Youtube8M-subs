manual way of doing this would be to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.049 
manual way of doing this would be to
open<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.410> your<00:00:31.529> color<00:00:31.710> picker<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.910> could

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
open up your color picker you could

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.880 
open up your color picker you could
select<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:33.809> colors<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.410> say<00:00:34.530> well<00:00:34.739> there's

kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> tedious<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.399> do<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> way

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
kind of tedious you can do it that way

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.479 
kind of tedious you can do it that way
takes<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> little<00:00:42.899> bit<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.110> time<00:00:43.370> go<00:00:44.370> ahead

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
takes a little bit of time go ahead

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.060 
takes a little bit of time go ahead
cancel<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
cancel out of this now what I do and I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.979 
cancel out of this now what I do and I
found<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.550> helpful<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.719> use

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
found to be very helpful is to use

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.979 
found to be very helpful is to use
filter<00:00:49.879> pixelate<00:00:52.399> mosaic<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> mosaic

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
filter pixelate mosaic and what mosaic

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.650 
filter pixelate mosaic and what mosaic
does<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.039> breaks<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.489> picture<00:00:56.969> down<00:00:57.210> into

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
does is it breaks your picture down into

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170 
does is it breaks your picture down into
simple<00:00:58.140> color<00:00:58.469> squares<00:00:59.129> based<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> size

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
simple color squares based on the size

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.680 
simple color squares based on the size
now<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> size<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:02.219> pixels<00:01:02.940> square

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
now the size here is two pixels square

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.230 
now the size here is two pixels square
so<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.439> may<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.920> may<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> difference

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
so you may or may not see a difference

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.109 
so you may or may not see a difference
here<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.770> start<00:01:08.040> sliding<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
here but if I start sliding this to the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.969 
here but if I start sliding this to the
side<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> squares<00:01:11.880> become<00:01:12.270> more<00:01:12.659> apparent

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
side the squares become more apparent

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
side the squares become more apparent
the<00:01:13.979> colors<00:01:14.280> become<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:14.820> simplified<00:01:15.360> which

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the colors become more simplified which

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
the colors become more simplified which
is<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> great<00:01:16.530> thing<00:01:16.560> about<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.040> tool<00:01:17.460> and
