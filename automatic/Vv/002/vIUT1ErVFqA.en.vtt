we've<00:00:02.310> titled<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:02.939> video<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.810> deep<00:00:04.290> slot<00:00:04.680> to

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
we've titled this video a deep slot to

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.839 
we've titled this video a deep slot to
Rivet<00:00:06.359> conversion<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.589> vinyl<00:00:08.160> straps<00:00:08.519> you'll

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Rivet conversion for vinyl straps you'll

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.180 
Rivet conversion for vinyl straps you'll
see<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.300> have<00:00:09.530> slots<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.889> really

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
see we have slots that are really

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.700 
see we have slots that are really
punched<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.610> pretty<00:00:11.880> deep<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.420> therefore<00:00:13.080> we

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
punched out pretty deep and therefore we

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.099 
punched out pretty deep and therefore we
need<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> use<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> special<00:00:14.639> rivet<00:00:15.210> which<00:00:15.870> in

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
need to use a special rivet which in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
need to use a special rivet which in
this<00:00:16.260> case<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.940> rivet<00:00:18.420> number<00:00:19.400> 305<00:00:20.400> 1/5

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
this case is the rivet number 305 1/5

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.769 
this case is the rivet number 305 1/5
long<00:00:21.960> shank<00:00:22.320> rivet<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> gets

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
long shank rivet this is so that it gets

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
long shank rivet this is so that it gets
a<00:00:24.869> good<00:00:25.019> grip<00:00:25.230> down<00:00:25.439> inside<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> depth<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
a good grip down inside in the depth of

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.250 
a good grip down inside in the depth of
the<00:00:26.880> metal<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.449> it's<00:00:27.630> punched<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.050> there

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the metal as it's punched out there

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.120 
the metal as it's punched out there
along<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.039> vinyl

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130

we're going to drill a hole in the slot
on<00:00:36.470> both<00:00:37.070> sides<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:38.410> use<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.620> 15<00:00:40.040> 64th<00:00:40.790> inch

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
on both sides and use a 15 64th inch

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.900 
on both sides and use a 15 64th inch
drill<00:00:41.600> bit<00:00:41.660> you<00:00:42.500> can<00:00:42.710> use<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:42.980> quarter<00:00:43.340> inch<00:00:43.640> it

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
drill bit you can use a quarter inch it

might<00:00:44.180> not<00:00:45.050> fit<00:00:45.290> quite<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:45.739> snugly<00:00:46.460> if<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:47.110> you

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
might not fit quite as snugly if you you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.479 
might not fit quite as snugly if you you
can<00:00:48.260> try<00:00:48.440> both<00:00:48.620> though<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:48.980> can<00:00:49.160> start<00:00:49.370> with

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
can try both though you can start with

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.840 
can try both though you can start with
15<00:00:49.910> 64th<00:00:50.570> inch<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.290> if<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.950> doesn't<00:00:52.460> seem<00:00:52.670> to

15 64th inch and if it doesn't seem to
go<00:00:52.970> in<00:00:53.120> well<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:53.450> the<00:00:53.510> rivet<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:53.989> can<00:00:54.140> go

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
go in well with the rivet you can go

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.900 
go in well with the rivet you can go
ahead<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.800> quarter<00:00:55.129> inch<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.550> re<00:00:55.640> drill

ahead with the quarter inch and re drill

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.720 
ahead with the quarter inch and re drill
the<00:00:56.180> little<00:00:56.390> bigger<00:00:57.340> once<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:58.430> get<00:00:58.550> both

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
the little bigger once you get both

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.210 
the little bigger once you get both
sides<00:00:59.090> of<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:01.670> slots<00:01:01.970> drilled<00:01:02.960> out<00:01:06.220> we're

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
sides of the slots drilled out we're

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.090 
sides of the slots drilled out we're
going<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.460> go<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.729> take<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.910> cloth<00:01:08.210> tape<00:01:08.660> and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
going to go and take a cloth tape and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.639 
going to go and take a cloth tape and
measure<00:01:10.100> from<00:01:10.610> one<00:01:11.000> point<00:01:11.780> of<00:01:11.990> connection<00:01:12.259> to

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
measure from one point of connection to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.690 
measure from one point of connection to
the<00:01:12.800> other<00:01:12.979> side<00:01:13.630> point<00:01:14.630> connection<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.700> when

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
the other side point connection and when

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.300 
the other side point connection and when
we<00:01:16.850> take<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:17.660> cloth<00:01:17.869> tape<00:01:18.140> from<00:01:18.530> one<00:01:19.009> end<00:01:19.220> to

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
we take the cloth tape from one end to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.580 
we take the cloth tape from one end to
the<00:01:19.369> other<00:01:19.520> where<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.149> connects<00:01:20.479> we<00:01:21.290> have<00:01:21.560> a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the other where it connects we have a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.080 
the other where it connects we have a
measurement<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.660> 24<00:01:23.660> inches<00:01:24.910> we're<00:01:25.910> going<00:01:26.030> to

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
measurement of 24 inches we're going to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.760 
measurement of 24 inches we're going to
take<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.479> 24<00:01:27.440> inches<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:29.660> we're<00:01:30.619> going<00:01:30.740> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
take that 24 inches and we're going to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.620 
take that 24 inches and we're going to
go<00:01:30.950> ahead<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.550> subtract<00:01:32.259> 4<00:01:33.259> inches<00:01:34.630> because

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
go ahead and subtract 4 inches because

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.870 
go ahead and subtract 4 inches because
that's<00:01:36.140> how<00:01:36.649> much<00:01:36.830> we'll<00:01:37.039> subtract<00:01:37.490> for<00:01:37.700> this

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's how much we'll subtract for this

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.550 
that's how much we'll subtract for this
length<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.690> measure<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.259> we'll<00:01:39.350> come

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
length that you measure and we'll come

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.400 
length that you measure and we'll come
up<00:01:39.590> with<00:01:39.679> a<00:01:39.830> 20<00:01:40.250> inch<00:01:40.429> strap<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.750> we'll<00:01:44.990> cut<00:01:45.229> the

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
up with a 20 inch strap so we'll cut the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:52.340 
up with a 20 inch strap so we'll cut the
strap<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:46.209> 20<00:01:47.209> inches

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.160 

here<00:01:53.010> we'll<00:01:53.280> show<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.580> how<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.810> cut

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
here we'll show you how that will cut

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.969
