 fashion the subject of losing weight is 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.610
 Word of mouth in all our meetings 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.490
 and many times we fall into the hands of 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.810
 experts who say they have a new diet 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.520
 or there are diets that they created that are 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 extraordinary that sometimes compromise 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.270
 our health there is no food 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 magic pill that can burn fat or 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.739
 while we watch television or 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.450
 we are sitting on the computer or 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.790
 not some superfood that can 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.360
 alter our genetic codes like 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.470
 an extraordinary way indeed 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 some substances that contain several 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.699
 pills can be inclusive 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.470
 dangerous to our health I'm going to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.720
 give some tips to avoid falling into this type 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.390
 of diets that can harm our 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.750
 health you have to be careful with diets 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 who promise to lose weight quickly the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.650
 gradual and stable weight loss is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 much more durable than the changes 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 dramatic healthy plans seek the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.799
 loss of not more than 250 grams or medium 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.360
 kilo a week if we lose weight 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.750
 quickly 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.090
 that we lose muscle bone and water in addition 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.910
 we are much more likely to increase what 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.210
 lost either you have to trust 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.980
 diets that handle unlimited amounts 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.590
 for example unlimited amounts of 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.320
 food like grapefruit the diet of the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.330
 lettuce or cabbage are very difficult 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 to wear for long periods of time 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.360
 and they are usually pretty boring avoid 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.550
 diets that eliminate or restrict certain 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.430
 food groups such as what 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.830
 common carbohydrate completely 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.700
 more multivitamins is likely not 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.350
 get all the essential nutrients 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.900
 beware of diets that have menus 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.670
 strict because we limit our 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.680
 choice of food to a very menu 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.500
 strict and rigid is a task 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.750
 extremely difficult waters with 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 those diets that tell us there's no 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.250
 essence of exercising 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.360
 Exercise is essential for good 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.640
 health and to maintain our weight 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.880
 try to perform the exercise that most 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.160
 you enjoy approximately between 30 and 60 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.680
 minutes a day most of the time 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.590
 of the good week this is all for today 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.220
 but to recap every time it's 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.290
 start a new diet ask yourself this 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.310
 diet put it and for the rest of my life 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.070
 if the answer is negative then that 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.800
 diet is not right for you very many 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.050
