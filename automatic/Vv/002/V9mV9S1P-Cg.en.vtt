00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.550
 hi all guys today i'm up here 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.170
 capture for the focus infotainment of the 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.730
 air link system 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.129
 the link is the latest infotainment system 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.350
 say not that it is really a system 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.260
 very good easy intuitive develops 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.690
 on this 7-inch resistive 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.320
 we have touchscreen and practical controls 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.760
 turning them off comes out of them 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.000
 when turned off and volume adjustment 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 here we are on the radio we are in a usb cd 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 aux or bluetooth streaming we can 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.700
 change source track through these 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.460
 buttons that we have home button there 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.390
 send in the main screen dr link 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.450
 then we start from the main menu 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.829
 we are on multimedia as you can see 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:02.350
 multimedia radio we have usb sd e 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:05.540
 weeks and bluetooth radio streaming 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.659
 we can go here up and down like 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.860
 see on the graphic radio among other things 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.620
 very beautiful very beautiful f 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.270
 and here we have the stations preset 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:24.510
 memorized that are six frequency 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:28.390
 let's get ahead of 5 in 5 and in practice 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.970
 this more what we can do will change 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.340
 the character add the favorites 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.660
 edit radio text save 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.229
 station as pre set for 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.390
 store the radio settings 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.270
 and here we have 1 fm radio we can 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.610
 select fm2 or am here we have 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.259
 information or update on 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.320
 system that we have recently added 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:55.240
 the sd card below for the maps of the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.770
 navigator status from the vehicle how much 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.570
 outdoor air quality this thing 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.490
 interesting here we have the inclusion 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.410
 bluetooth short connection 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.709
 bluetooth with a phone we can 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.179
 add a 30 degree device 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.580
 outdoor temperature and gives you the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.150
 indications m if connected to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.180
 an internet phone and here now e 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.180
 temperature but we are still on the menu 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.090
 we did telef had already done 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.549
 see vehicle was the vehicle 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.310
 we have the onboard computer are the 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.790
 classic settings and adjustments here 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.400
 remembering that we also have the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.380
 rear view camera services services i 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.440
 which to call for assistance 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.850
 in short, all things connected with the internet 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.560
 that we could activate our own 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 services 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.989
 let's start we pass it by 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.870
 navigation 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:01.209
 view map see that for each 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:07.780
 we are also changing the menu under graphics 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:10.340
 here the menu we can enlarge like this e 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.489
 this is the crazy thing we say 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.709
 here we can do we can do it 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.190
 zoom we can select map in 2d and 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.950
 in 3d 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.660
 as you can see here we have it also in 3d 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.640
 we are and the split screen is capable of this 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.129
 it's a very comfortable thing and we can 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.769
 select us that we can't 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:32.900
 and we don't want to put it on now 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:35.450
 hear the sound system with many media 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.849
 it is a truly intuitive system 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.209
 images that will work will also work 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:46.280
 put via usb cable or phone or 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.130
 sd card also video we can see 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.650
 always via usb sd there really is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:59.660
 many features and all easy to 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:02.569
 I command to hear here for a moment 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:12.160
 we have a radio that does not have one 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:12.160
 song that settles very well indeed 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.680
 we are very good at the bass does not destroy 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:24.920
 a really good sound system 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.020
 car person or even more but 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.670
 this system really very easy 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:35.540
 so I also show the commands to the 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:39.820
 steering wheel we can adjust volume and 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:42.590
 after we can change source or radio 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.870
 I can do good 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.410
 with these keys that are placed below 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.950
 and above which we can also respond 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.910
 on the phone and to attach the 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:12.070
 I also show that we have the 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:12.070
 voice command applications to nothing 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.440
 as you can see the voice is not much 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.699
 robotized as on other voice commands 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.889
 in short, almost a voice that suits you 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.030
 side and the controls are easy and 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.199
 as intuitive as you are, it tells you what you want 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.330
 select here we have the commands for the 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.740
 cus check then we are at 130 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.919
 kilometers per hour we want to activate 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.199
 through this button here with these 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:45.240
 keys we decide whether to raise ours 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:47.520
 holding speed and with or lo 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.840
 deactivate momentarily with r lo 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.250
 therefore we memorize when we of 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.520
 we crush r 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.139
 the cuneese activates the maintaining 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.130
 our speed instead with the key here in 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:00.810
 bass 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.729
 so we deactivate it and therefore in short 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.370
 very rich cruise control do you think maybe 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.300
 this deficiency really is 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.280
 comfortable especially with this 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.100
 noise that was a bit noisy but 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.740
 however , it makes itself felt little then 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.270
 from the infotainment and has a small one 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.729
 focus of the technique of this renault 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.760
 captur is all dar I say a greeting a 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.760
 all
