00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
classics which I had a hard time

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.600 
classics which I had a hard time
defining<00:02:10.349> because<00:02:10.950> some<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.160> them<00:02:11.280> are<00:02:11.430> kind

sci-fi<00:02:12.400> classics<00:02:13.090> maybe<00:02:14.020> not<00:02:14.230> considered

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
sci-fi classics maybe not considered

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.340 
sci-fi classics maybe not considered
classic<00:02:15.130> classics<00:02:15.580> but<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.690> word<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.050> very

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
classic classics but that word is very

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.520 
classic classics but that word is very
hard<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.920> define<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:20.080> kind<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.380> went

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
hard to define so I just kind of went

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.360 
hard to define so I just kind of went
with<00:02:21.540> goodreads<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.080> classic<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.740> probably

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
with goodreads it's a classic I probably

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.660 
with goodreads it's a classic I probably
put<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> in<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.240> classics<00:02:25.750> category<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.830> one

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
put it in the classics category so one

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.010 
put it in the classics category so one
of<00:02:27.700> my<00:02:27.850> goals<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.420> didn't<00:02:28.660> really<00:02:28.750> share

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
of my goals that I didn't really share

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.960 
of my goals that I didn't really share
with<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.290> guys<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:29.860> year<00:02:30.220> was<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.820> read

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
with you guys for this year was to read

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.730 
with you guys for this year was to read
more<00:02:31.150> sci-fi<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.840> i<00:02:32.080> think<00:02:32.290> twenty<00:02:32.470> five

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
more sci-fi and i think twenty five

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
more sci-fi and i think twenty five
percent<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:33.400> what<00:02:33.850> i'm<00:02:34.000> reading<00:02:34.270> being<00:02:34.630> sci-fi

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
percent of what i'm reading being sci-fi

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.690 
percent of what i'm reading being sci-fi
is<00:02:35.110> probably<00:02:35.770> more<00:02:36.070> than<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.400> would<00:02:36.550> be

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
is probably more than it would be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.940 
is probably more than it would be
normally<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.360> me<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:37.870> pretty<00:02:38.740> good

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
normally for me so that's pretty good

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.440 
normally for me so that's pretty good
but<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.220> still<00:02:39.490> feel<00:02:39.670> like<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.970> need<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.150> read

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
but I still feel like I need to read

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.450 
but I still feel like I need to read
more<00:02:40.660> harder<00:02:41.050> sci-fi<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.800> think<00:02:42.130> most

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
more harder sci-fi because I think most

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.370 
more harder sci-fi because I think most
of<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.760> sci-fi<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.450> read<00:02:43.810> was<00:02:43.840> young

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
of the sci-fi that I read was young

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.380 
of the sci-fi that I read was young
adult<00:02:44.710> sci-fi<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:47.040> yeah<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.400> also<00:02:48.940> wanted<00:02:49.270> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
adult sci-fi so yeah I also wanted to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.180 
adult sci-fi so yeah I also wanted to
read<00:02:49.540> more<00:02:49.720> classics<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.410> I'm<00:02:50.800> doing<00:02:50.980> really

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
read more classics and I'm doing really

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.340 
read more classics and I'm doing really
well<00:02:51.400> with<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.670> goal<00:02:51.910> basically<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.840> had<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
well with that goal basically I had the

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.380 
well with that goal basically I had the
idea<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.770> should<00:02:53.860> read<00:02:54.220> at<00:02:54.310> least<00:02:54.340> one<00:02:54.670> per

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
idea that I should read at least one per

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.330 
idea that I should read at least one per
month<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.810> 12<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.530> year<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.070> I've<00:02:57.190> already

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
month so 12 this year and I've already

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.850 
month so 12 this year and I've already
read<00:02:57.550> four<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.330> first<00:02:58.480> three<00:02:58.810> months<00:02:58.960> so<00:02:59.800> I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
read four in the first three months so I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.900 
read four in the first three months so I
think<00:03:00.100> that's<00:03:00.220> pretty<00:03:00.370> good<00:03:00.610> unless<00:03:01.480> my

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
think that's pretty good unless my

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.310 
think that's pretty good unless my
counting<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.060> certain<00:03:04.540> things<00:03:04.660> as<00:03:04.870> classics

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
counting of certain things as classics

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.650 
counting of certain things as classics
is<00:03:05.440> wrong<00:03:05.710> but<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:07.000> debatable<00:03:07.330> I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
is wrong but that's a debatable I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.480 
is wrong but that's a debatable I
suppose<00:03:07.990> those<00:03:08.470> are<00:03:08.500> really<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.890> only<00:03:09.100> goals

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
suppose those are really the only goals

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.140 
suppose those are really the only goals
that<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> had<00:03:10.090> personally<00:03:10.930> for<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.440> year

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
that I had personally for this year

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.820 
that I had personally for this year
basically<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.390> read<00:03:13.840> at<00:03:13.930> least<00:03:13.960> 55<00:03:14.500> books

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
basically just read at least 55 books

with that so I'm doing pretty good with

the goals that I set for myself at the

the goals that I set for myself at the
beginning<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.490> year<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.910> also<00:03:28.840> at<00:03:29.230> the

beginning of the year kind of made a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
beginning of the year kind of made a
conscious<00:03:31.900> decision<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:33.010> more<00:03:33.220> generous

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
conscious decision to be more generous

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.310 
conscious decision to be more generous
with<00:03:33.760> my<00:03:33.820> reviews<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.540> can<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.870> very<00:03:34.900> critical

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
with my reviews I can be very critical

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.620 
with my reviews I can be very critical
and<00:03:35.620> negative<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.340> if<00:03:36.760> you've<00:03:37.000> watched<00:03:37.330> some

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
and negative and if you've watched some

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.210 
and negative and if you've watched some
of<00:03:37.690> my<00:03:37.840> five<00:03:38.080> star<00:03:38.380> reviews<00:03:38.770> you'll<00:03:38.920> notice

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
of my five star reviews you'll notice

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.540 
of my five star reviews you'll notice
that<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.459> still<00:03:40.140> criticize<00:03:41.140> things<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.800> I'm

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
that I still criticize things and I'm

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.949 
that I still criticize things and I'm
like<00:03:42.820> well<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.330> could<00:03:43.540> have<00:03:43.630> been<00:03:43.690> better

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
like well this could have been better

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.860 
like well this could have been better
even<00:03:44.350> if<00:03:44.380> it's<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.620> five-star<00:03:45.130> book<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.870> that's

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
even if it's a five-star book and that's

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.479 
even if it's a five-star book and that's
just<00:03:46.959> because<00:03:47.140> I'm<00:03:47.380> naturally<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:47.980> critical

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
just because I'm naturally very critical

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.270 
just because I'm naturally very critical
and<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.760> pick<00:03:48.940> things<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.690> just<00:03:50.320> very<00:03:50.950> annoying

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
and I pick things and just very annoying

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.580 
and I pick things and just very annoying
like<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.390> as<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.660> writer<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.470> as

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
like that but as a writer and as

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.960 
like that but as a writer and as
somebody<00:03:53.800> who<00:03:54.070> hopes<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.459> be<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> published

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
somebody who hopes to be a published

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.820 
somebody who hopes to be a published
author<00:03:55.150> someday<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.780> kind<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.320> just<00:03:56.500> feel<00:03:56.709> like

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
author someday I kind of just feel like

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.710 
author someday I kind of just feel like
giving<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.640> writer<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.150> benefit<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
giving the writer the benefit of the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.280 
giving the writer the benefit of the
doubt<00:03:59.050> is<00:03:59.410> a<00:04:00.280> nice<00:04:00.610> thing<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:02.110> might

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
doubt is a nice thing to do and it might

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.320 
doubt is a nice thing to do and it might
be<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.830> little<00:04:03.100> less<00:04:03.340> convenient<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:04.180> me

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
be a little less convenient for me

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.530 
be a little less convenient for me
because<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:05.140> used<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.920> have<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.070> very<00:04:06.540> rigid

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
because I used to have a very rigid

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.990 
because I used to have a very rigid
sense<00:04:08.020> of<00:04:08.230> how<00:04:08.590> i<00:04:08.620> would<00:04:08.830> rate<00:04:09.100> things<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.820> it

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
sense of how i would rate things and it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.820 
sense of how i would rate things and it
made<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> lot<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.420> sense<00:04:10.510> to<00:04:10.930> me<00:04:11.050> and<00:04:11.290> now<00:04:11.440> it's<00:04:11.470> a

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
made a lot of sense to me and now it's a

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.060 
made a lot of sense to me and now it's a
lot<00:04:12.250> more<00:04:13.080> confusing<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.350> write<00:04:14.500> things<00:04:14.739> but

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
lot more confusing to write things but

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.500 
lot more confusing to write things but
I've<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.340> been<00:04:15.580> trying<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.359> be<00:04:16.480> more
