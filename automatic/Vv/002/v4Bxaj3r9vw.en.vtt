now<00:00:05.600> going<00:00:05.839> back<00:00:06.109> to<00:00:06.140> our<00:00:06.290> cue<00:00:06.649> we<00:00:07.370> only<00:00:07.640> have

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
now going back to our cue we only have

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.619 
now going back to our cue we only have
one<00:00:08.120> more<00:00:08.269> step<00:00:08.540> to<00:00:08.750> do<00:00:10.059> recall<00:00:11.059> that<00:00:11.269> with<00:00:11.480> the

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:11.629 
one more step to do recall that with the

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.289 
one more step to do recall that with the
main<00:00:11.870> portion<00:00:12.379> the<00:00:12.680> algorithm<00:00:13.309> we<00:00:14.059> had<00:00:14.270> a

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
main portion the algorithm we had a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.800 
main portion the algorithm we had a
single<00:00:14.779> edge<00:00:15.049> up<00:00:15.379> here<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:16.300> we<00:00:17.300> had<00:00:17.480> the<00:00:17.600> other

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
single edge up here and we had the other

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.290 
single edge up here and we had the other
edge<00:00:18.170> affected<00:00:18.800> down<00:00:19.010> here<00:00:19.550> with<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.119> two

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
edge affected down here with the two

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.769 
edge affected down here with the two
centers<00:00:20.779> swapped<00:00:21.789> well<00:00:22.789> we<00:00:22.970> have<00:00:23.119> two<00:00:23.330> centers

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
centers swapped well we have two centers

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.759 
centers swapped well we have two centers
swapped<00:00:24.079> and<00:00:24.410> an<00:00:24.650> edge<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.749> we<00:00:26.749> have<00:00:26.960> an<00:00:27.259> edge

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
swapped and an edge and we have an edge

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.899 
swapped and an edge and we have an edge
here<00:00:27.800> which<00:00:28.519> with<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.509> you<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.589> setup<00:00:31.249> move<00:00:31.550> can

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
here which with a you to setup move can

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.210 
here which with a you to setup move can
be<00:00:32.060> separated<00:00:32.689> completely<00:00:33.170> and<00:00:33.680> put<00:00:33.980> on<00:00:34.100> the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
be separated completely and put on the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.110 
be separated completely and put on the
opposite<00:00:34.700> diagonal<00:00:35.030> side<00:00:36.309> even<00:00:37.309> though<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
opposite diagonal side even though it

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.910 
opposite diagonal side even though it
will<00:00:38.300> not<00:00:38.480> be<00:00:38.660> right<00:00:38.989> here<00:00:39.289> we<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:39.620> do<00:00:39.739> some

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
will not be right here we can do some

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.020 
will not be right here we can do some
changes<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:40.430> make<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.350> hence<00:00:42.350> we<00:00:42.739> do<00:00:43.309> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
changes to make it so hence we do the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.759 
changes to make it so hence we do the
last<00:00:44.239> setup<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.750> u2<00:00:48.309> and<00:00:49.899> then<00:00:50.899> we<00:00:51.199> have<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
last setup of u2 and then we have a

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.290 
last setup of u2 and then we have a
single<00:00:52.340> edge<00:00:52.609> separated<00:00:53.420> from<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.140> rest<00:00:55.300> so

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
single edge separated from the rest so

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.709 
single edge separated from the rest so
I'm<00:00:56.359> going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.539> go<00:00:56.660> ahead<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:57.649> apply<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:57.980> end

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
I'm going to go ahead and apply the end

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.049 
I'm going to go ahead and apply the end
to<00:00:59.719> what<00:00:59.870> we<00:00:59.960> have<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.320> far<00:01:02.890> before<00:01:03.890> we<00:01:04.339> try<00:01:05.030> to

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
to what we have so far before we try to

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.110 
to what we have so far before we try to
match<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.810> perfectly<00:01:06.200> with<00:01:07.160> what<00:01:07.400> we<00:01:07.520> have<00:01:07.760> why

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
match it perfectly with what we have why

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.249 
match it perfectly with what we have why
don't<00:01:08.180> we<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.570> try<00:01:08.720> to<00:01:08.810> finish<00:01:09.020> this

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
don't we just try to finish this

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.340 
don't we just try to finish this
algorithm<00:01:09.770> off<00:01:10.450> from<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.570> point<00:01:11.900> all<00:01:12.229> we

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
algorithm off from this point all we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.300 
algorithm off from this point all we
need<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.619> do<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.009> set<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.250> move<00:01:13.460> our<00:01:13.729> two

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.160 

that<00:01:19.310> will<00:01:19.490> swap<00:01:19.729> these<00:01:19.970> two<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.630> a<00:01:20.810> similar

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
that will swap these two in a similar

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.260 
that will swap these two in a similar
fashion<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:21.890> seen<00:01:22.100> before<00:01:22.270> except

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
fashion to what we seen before except

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.880 
fashion to what we seen before except
for<00:01:23.299> now<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.020> back<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.530> it's<00:01:24.619> on<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
for now it's on the back and it's on the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.859 
for now it's on the back and it's on the
left<00:01:25.159> half<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.970> cube<00:01:26.210> instead<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.659> right

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
left half the cube instead of the right

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.270 
left half the cube instead of the right
half<00:01:27.640> but<00:01:28.640> that's<00:01:28.759> fine<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.220> instead<00:01:31.220> of

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
half but that's fine and instead of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.300 
half but that's fine and instead of
doing<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.700> moose<00:01:31.909> are<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.770> our<00:01:33.979> prime

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
doing the moose are you to our prime

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.490 
doing the moose are you to our prime
since<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:35.210> in<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.420> back<00:01:35.600> like<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.079> we<00:01:36.290> just

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
since it's in the back like this we just

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.730 
since it's in the back like this we just
do<00:01:36.680> our<00:01:36.950> prime<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.880> two<00:01:38.090> are<00:01:38.299> as<00:01:38.630> setup<00:01:39.530> moves

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
do our prime you two are as setup moves

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.850 
do our prime you two are as setup moves
and<00:01:40.299> then<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.570> will<00:01:42.200> fix<00:01:42.530> it<00:01:42.770> completely

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.080 

adding<00:01:47.860> those<00:01:48.040> moves<00:01:48.370> in<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
adding those moves in this is the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.250 
adding those moves in this is the
algorithm<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.690> its<00:01:49.810> entirety<00:01:51.660> as<00:01:52.660> you<00:01:52.870> can<00:01:53.020> see

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
algorithm in its entirety as you can see

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.990 
algorithm in its entirety as you can see
it's<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.470> lot<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.800> moves<00:01:54.010> and<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.490> can<00:01:54.700> start

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
it's a lot of moves and we can start

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.330 
it's a lot of moves and we can start
doing<00:01:55.300> some<00:01:55.420> cancellations<00:01:56.260> that's<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.130> tune

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
doing some cancellations that's you tune

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.160 
doing some cancellations that's you tune
you<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.730> go<00:01:58.230> this<00:01:59.230> R<00:01:59.530> Prime<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.660> this<00:02:01.660> R<00:02:01.960> will

go and this R 2 and R prime will just

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.950 
go and this R 2 and R prime will just
become<00:02:07.210> are<00:02:08.460> leaving<00:02:09.460> us<00:02:09.610> with<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.570> following

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
become are leaving us with the following

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:26.160 
become are leaving us with the following
result<00:02:22.290> rotating<00:02:23.290> about<00:02:23.470> why<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:25.050> taking<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
result rotating about why to taking the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.620 
result rotating about why to taking the
mirror<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.790> finally<00:02:28.180> taking<00:02:28.510> the

mirror and then finally taking the

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.310 
mirror and then finally taking the
inverse<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.160> algorithm<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:32.200> can

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
inverse we have the algorithm as you can

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.080 
inverse we have the algorithm as you can
see<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.709> algorithm<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.490> almost<00:02:33.880> identical

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
see this algorithm is almost identical

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.960 
see this algorithm is almost identical
to<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.020> standard<00:02:35.080> algorithm<00:02:35.800> except<00:02:36.790> for

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
to the standard algorithm except for

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.680 
to the standard algorithm except for
some<00:02:37.150> outer<00:02:37.390> moves<00:02:37.750> are<00:02:37.930> different<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:39.690> one

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
some outer moves are different and one

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.410 
some outer moves are different and one
internal<00:02:41.170> setup<00:02:41.560> move<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.890> different<00:02:42.420> but

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
internal setup move is different but

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.020
