what<00:01:36.030> I've<00:01:36.150> probably<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.930> here<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.710> because

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
what I've probably got here is because

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
what I've probably got here is because
the<00:01:38.790> water<00:01:39.000> line<00:01:39.710> connects<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> bib<00:01:41.280> here

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the water line connects on the bib here

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.039 
the water line connects on the bib here
and<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> couple<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.420> plastic<00:01:42.869> pieces

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and there's a couple of plastic pieces

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.670 
and there's a couple of plastic pieces
below<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.399> probably<00:01:44.939> happened<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.810> when

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
below what is probably happened is when

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
below what is probably happened is when
this<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.100> jammed<00:01:47.490> against<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> wall<00:01:48.329> what

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
this was jammed against the wall what

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.510 
this was jammed against the wall what
I'm<00:01:48.810> expecting<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> find<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> minute

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
I'm expecting to find here in a minute

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.109 
I'm expecting to find here in a minute
get<00:01:51.390> back<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:53.939> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
get back with you is this will be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
get back with you is this will be
probably<00:01:54.990> cracked<00:01:55.619> under<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> little

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
probably cracked under here this little

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.690 
probably cracked under here this little
plastic<00:01:56.850> housing<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.950> hopefully<00:01:58.950> let's<00:01:59.490> see

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
plastic housing and hopefully let's see

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.639 
plastic housing and hopefully let's see
I'm<00:02:00.030> thinking<00:02:00.450> maybe<00:02:00.600> twelve<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.380> twenty

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
I'm thinking maybe twelve to twenty

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.639 
I'm thinking maybe twelve to twenty
dollar<00:02:01.860> part<00:02:02.219> max<00:02:03.170> might<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.500> more

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
dollar part max might be a little more

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
dollar part max might be a little more
with<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:06.030> water<00:02:06.299> babe<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:06.899> you
