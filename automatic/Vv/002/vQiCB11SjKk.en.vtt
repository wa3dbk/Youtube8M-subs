00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.330
 this product by finding 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.539
 vanguart is a store that has everything 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:30.210
 here in Japan is cool even it was 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.210
 against it here and chocolate and tabasco 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.870
 look at the amount I paid 500 yen and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.360
 comes only eight pieces in here 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.489
 just for you to have an idea all written 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.469
 Japanese comes only 50 grams of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 chocolate 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 so let's try chocolate from 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.530
 Tapachula from the coast here right? 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:07.820
 At least packaging is cute, right? 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:07.820
 are you alone 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.710
 This is tabasco chocolate. 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.510
 it's hard to sour coconut chocolate 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.010
 Just so far I 'm not feeling the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.010
 I like nothing about Tabasco. 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.150
 now I just ate the first bar 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.070
 I'm feeling my tongue burned. 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.690
 It's starting to heat up my body. 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050
 here the part of the face's already getting a 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:53.910
 little warmer the language is getting 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.910
 warmer one more clown 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:08.760
 It's heating up the tempted thing. 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.760
 everything is fine here 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.659
 Do not you feel Mexican chocolate bc? 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.340
 knows tabasco or pepper taste 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:24.870
 but let the sensation know that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.819
 feeling that you eat pepper 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.099
 I called that cushioned make 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:35.940
 Warming up and this feeling I'm 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:38.420
 having now thought it was going to be worse 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.420
 here it is 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.990
