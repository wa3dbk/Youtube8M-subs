 Russian 3 91 American is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.330
 kinship 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.980
 the uninitiated can 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.479
 think that these are cars of various affection 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.979
 t 90 much easier for americans 47 tons 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:17.960
 against 64 it is much more compact and yes 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.109
 does not look so impressive 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.359
 however, in the global arms markets these 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.919
 cars are not direct competitors and this 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.220
 explained they will be able to reveal the potential 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.509
 today evaluate the security of the machine 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.370
 a simple comparison of the other can not penetrate 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.720
 need to know what it consists of lies and 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.820
 Abrams used depleted uranium she t 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.420

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.010
 built-in dynamic protection 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.950
 with the approval of the mexicans frontal 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.960
 Debrah's armor massage has proven its 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.750
 reliability during the war in iraq 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.000
 ninety first and 2030 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.040
 she supported the Soviet hit 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.370
 125 caliber armor piercing shells 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.640
 millimeters 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.900
 it does not say that 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.920
 what we are talking about ammunition shot 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.210
 piles 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 and not yet in the 70 third 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.770
 Moreover 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.190
 modern shells any abramson then 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.580
 didn't shoot 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.350
 both chose t 90 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.070
 during the test fired 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 the latest subcaliber 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.200
 clementines with shells 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.210
 equal in effectiveness with the most 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.210
 modern projectile 127 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 200 meters 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280
 our shells 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.729
 after that the car came under its own power 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.560
 to the observation deck 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.780
 then, without repair, selection 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.630
 t 90 framed 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.710
 improved 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.220
 grenade launchers 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.220
 The result is the same 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.070
 armor is not broken 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 and not only airborne 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.140
 by 2030 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.210
 Spartak and Abrams made their way leader 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.700
 progressively grenades and even 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.900
 the very first samples 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.300
 weak points and brahms revealed in iraq

 providing work throughout 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.480
 electronics at the moment 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.080
 when the main engine is muffled 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.240
 its easy holiday of large caliber 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 machine gun 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.780

 main product 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.079
 besides t 90 even in standard 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:12.889
 performance 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.789

 electronic suppression rzh 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.389
 this system goes off enemy missiles 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.239
 the side 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.309
 Abrams bullet of such equipment 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:25.199
 there were situations of american tank 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.219
 unlikely to be able to resist in 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.459
 guided missile t 90 launched through 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.589

 five kilometers 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.349
 accurate firing in this case 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.269
 approaching absolute 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.269
 rockets can be fired from the spot and 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.159
 residents 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.480
 any special skills required 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.049
 patrimony 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.819
 power guns t 90 e Brooks approximately 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.089
 are equivalent 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:53.859
 armor penetration domestic 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.039
 tungsten core shells 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.649
 in no way inferior to its competitor 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.059
 American s along with the core 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.079
 from depleted uranium 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.819
 similar shells have been developed and we 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.029
 but they are extremely harmful for the crew 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.629
 their mass production was 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.629
 postponed for a rainy day 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.309
 be able to destroy not only armored 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.899
 goals 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:17.009
 but as the military says there to 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:18.699
 dangerous manpower 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.279
 Ie screen freeloaders 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.089
 in the calculations 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:23.809
 in this 3 92 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:25.489
 but surpasses m 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.529
 ammunition of our tank includes 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.680
 shrapnel shrapnel no projectile and with 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.579
 remote undermining 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.449
 but you can blow right over your heads 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.929
 enemy soldiers 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:37.269
 helicopter gunship 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.619
 similar shells 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:39.989
 there is no abrams 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.209
 For a long time, not without the help of Western 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.489
 military year 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.209
 it was believed that electronics and 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.999
 our optical devices 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.389
 imperfect 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.329
 in the fire control complex t 90 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.589
 not inferior to NATO counterparts 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.809
 moreover, this bank belongs 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.819
 unofficial power record and 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.879
 rate of fire st 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.609
 on one of the demonstrations 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.419
 foreign delegations of workers from 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.539
 90 degrees 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.069
 all 54 seconds 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.999
 I was struck by real goals 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.589
 located at a distance 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:14.199
 two and a half kilometers 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.379
 firing the outcome at a speed of 25 kilometers 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:18.340
 at one o'clock 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.419
 official record holder German 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.110
 leopard 2 under similar conditions affects 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.569
 one goal less 

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.479
 thanks to guided missiles and 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.469
 t 90 has the longest hand 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.120
 tank world 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.580
 earlier options t 90 inferior departments 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.129
 mobility 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:37.679
 with the advent of a thousand strong engine 

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.689
 our tank is almost on par with Abrams 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.759
 by this most important indicator 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.210
 and on terrain, these two tanks in general 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.499
 cannot be compared 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.289
 at the arms exhibition in abu dhabi 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.999
 in 93 year 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.490
 and I immediately all 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.870
 lost a student on the usual slope 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.860
 Exhibition Tankodrome 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.590
 our tank on competitive 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.689
 almost 3 thousand passed tests 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.879
 kilometers by impassable 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:04.979
 malayan other off roads in which 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.240
 make up all his competitors 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.199
 he showed himself brilliantly and in the course 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.449
 march through the indian desert tass 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.449
 fire over 50 countries 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.770
 an indispensable combat requirement 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.610
 future technology high 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.599
 computerization of machines 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.159
 the near future, NATO 90 will establish 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:24.909
 new satellite equipment 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:25.900
 navigation 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.449
 so m ramsley shitsa his 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.220
 last advantage over 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.020
 our tanks 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.840
 today t 90 surpasses the image 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.680
 by most indicators 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.800
 but also correspondence competition 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.749
 end 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.479
 possibility of their modernization 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.289
 practically from Chekhov 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.080
 on the battlefield soon introduced tanks 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.549
 next generation
