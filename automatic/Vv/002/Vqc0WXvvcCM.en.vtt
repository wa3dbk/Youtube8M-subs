 these situations and we with the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.030
 huge happiness to feel that after 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.400
 so many years of struggle we search 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.010
 immense happiness if it were encounter 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.150
 encounter and if these were the circumstances 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.330
 as as through all these years 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.580
 36 years looking for what I say as how 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.650
 it copes with this good search 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 we are a family that we have 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.360
 meetings on Sundays we got together 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.460
 we have a tradition of eating 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.290
 pasta or making some chickens 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.430
 Grill what ever my dad is 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.530
 and we always talk about guido on the day of 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.610
 encounter of the possibility that the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 day I'm sitting at the table with 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.320
 we and we always dream them too 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.470
 we thought that it could be a process 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.350
 difficult and one gets scared says good 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.940
 what will be the story of his story and 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.510
 what he had to live 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.250
 there are many grandchildren who lived with 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.280
 appropriators who were perpetrators of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.610
 his parents those ideas we always know 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.910
 they crossed us what we found yesterday is 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.930
 the ideal what we imagined as what 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.330
 better he is very respectful he asks us for his 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.640
 times we have to be very 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.400
 respectful of his times but 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.110
 it was what we imagined this 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.970
 possibility of looking at us with tranquility 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.740
 the eyes I told him I'm going to look at you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.540
 because he could not get his eyes on him 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.970
 it was I could not even talk 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.110
 I just wanted to look at it I wanted to 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.630
 consume the accumulated affection of so many 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.300
 years and we end up in hugs and caresses 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.390
 after hours of conversation and 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.340
 get us initially up to date on what 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.930
 it happened with our lives in these 36 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 years 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.859
 a special moment and simÃ³n or in life 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.689
 of all this family the entity of 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.019
 Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo asked that 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.420
 let's all preserve a little bit of respect 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.159
 about the need that has 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.349
 gone to meet his family and do what 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.359
 more normally possible without 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.700
 means we're in there so we're going 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.129
 to respect the time he needs to 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.859
 course and this meeting has generated 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.859
 that hope remains intact
