 in addition, the guests there were able to send it was an unexpected one 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.019
 because it is that different 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.110
 to the whole 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.990
 the bottom we were 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.460
 round do it 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.460
 stop that 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.150
 the verdict 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 the model 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.970
 as usual 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.910
 one of the suspect 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.589
 the command and control 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.840
 the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 or the 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.870
 that that is 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.180
 that's normal that's the eu because she's already met 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.750
 because we have ours 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500
 that does what the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.090
 as we do in the rest of the position on the board we do what we can do 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.400
 our mouth 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.340
 the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.660
 that was a fact 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.340
 the the city that has the president of all times it lets them know what we 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.149
 want the bank 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.980
 that of course did not perform the police 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.190
 the match 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.830
 h 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.990
 the dish 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.020
 obvious 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 the sport 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.290
 a nice talk 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.490

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.020
 the avro 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.260

 the number that is still active 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.670
 it's something that comes out of it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.950
 a year earlier erik breukink 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.090
 were just gudde by eric 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 That strength on the longer it fixed 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.770
