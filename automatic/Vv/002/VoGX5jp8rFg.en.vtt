hey<00:00:00.659> guys<00:00:00.900> so<00:00:01.589> now<00:00:01.709> we'll<00:00:01.829> be<00:00:01.920> showing<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.250> a

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey guys so now we'll be showing you a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.519 
hey guys so now we'll be showing you a
rapid<00:00:02.639> piston<00:00:03.090> pulse<00:00:03.389> generator<00:00:03.899> design<00:00:04.350> that

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
rapid piston pulse generator design that

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.680 
rapid piston pulse generator design that
I<00:00:04.560> came<00:00:04.770> up<00:00:04.830> with<00:00:05.060> now<00:00:06.060> before<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.420> get<00:00:06.540> started

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
I came up with now before we get started

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.690 
I came up with now before we get started
I<00:00:06.990> don't<00:00:07.410> claim<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.740> have<00:00:08.010> come<00:00:08.160> with<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.429> first

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
I don't claim to have come with at first

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.370 
I don't claim to have come with at first
and<00:00:09.000> I'm<00:00:09.090> sure<00:00:09.300> there<00:00:09.510> are<00:00:09.630> similar<00:00:10.050> designs

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and I'm sure there are similar designs

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.709 
and I'm sure there are similar designs
out<00:00:10.559> there<00:00:10.620> before<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.610> get<00:00:11.700> started<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
out there before we get started on the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.959 
out there before we get started on the
pulse<00:00:13.019> generator<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.460> basic

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
pulse generator there's just one basic

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.519 
pulse generator there's just one basic
concept<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.750> understand<00:00:16.410> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
concept you have to do understand and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.269 
concept you have to do understand and
that<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.580> they<00:00:17.789> block<00:00:18.830> can<00:00:19.830> send<00:00:20.039> power

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
that is that they block can send power

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.830 
that is that they block can send power
through<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> other<00:00:20.970> side<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.840> this

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
through to the other side so this

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.140 
through to the other side so this
redstone<00:00:25.260> torch<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.920> powering<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.519> wire<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
redstone torch is powering this wire and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.330 
redstone torch is powering this wire and
this<00:00:27.510> repeater<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.560> being<00:00:28.890> powered<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.310> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
this repeater is being powered by the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.240 
this repeater is being powered by the
whale<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.380> repeater<00:00:31.740> sends<00:00:32.009> power

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
whale so this repeater sends power

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.120 
whale so this repeater sends power
through<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.180> block<00:00:33.680> to<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> other<00:00:34.950> side

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
through this block to the other side

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.170 
through this block to the other side
which<00:00:35.790> activates<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.510> whale<00:00:38.000> now<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.090> i

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
which activates this whale now if i

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.319 
which activates this whale now if i
press<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.420> button<00:00:39.860> as<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.329> this

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
press this button as you can see this

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.569 
press this button as you can see this
whale<00:00:43.050> d<00:00:43.649> powers<00:00:45.770> without<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:47.100> block<00:00:47.340> here

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
whale d powers without this block here

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.439 
whale d powers without this block here
is<00:00:48.390> why<00:00:48.660> i<00:00:48.690> can't<00:00:49.110> receive<00:00:49.530> power<00:00:50.149> this<00:00:51.149> stays

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is why i can't receive power this stays

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.220 
is why i can't receive power this stays
on<00:00:51.829> what<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.129> wire<00:00:53.520> does<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.020> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
on what the wire does not as you can see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
on what the wire does not as you can see
this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.559> how<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.770> works

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.290 

it's<00:01:00.720> sending<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.050> constant<00:01:01.530> signal<00:01:02.090> with<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's sending a constant signal with this

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.000 
it's sending a constant signal with this
way<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.990> way<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> how<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> Billy

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
way and this way so how do you Billy

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.050 
way and this way so how do you Billy
well<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.330> pretty<00:01:12.480> simple<00:01:12.980> first<00:01:13.980> off<00:01:14.190> place

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
well it's pretty simple first off place

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.350 
well it's pretty simple first off place
a<00:01:15.090> redstone<00:01:15.300> torch<00:01:15.780> down<00:01:16.790> those<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> PDA<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a redstone torch down those are a PDA in

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.350 
a redstone torch down those are a PDA in
front<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.160> right<00:01:20.160> a<00:01:20.190> wire<00:01:20.550> alongside<00:01:20.970> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
front of that right a wire alongside of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.150 
front of that right a wire alongside of
that<00:01:21.979> grab<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.190> piston<00:01:24.650> place<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.800> on<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
that grab your piston place it on this

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.730 
that grab your piston place it on this
side<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:27.600> blocks<00:01:27.840> apart<00:01:27.960> place<00:01:28.590> another

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
side and two blocks apart place another

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.090 
side and two blocks apart place another
piston<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.760> opposite<00:01:30.150> side<00:01:32.930> then<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.890> run

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
piston on the opposite side then you run

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.310 
piston on the opposite side then you run
a<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.550> from<00:01:36.210> here<00:01:36.979> place<00:01:37.979> your<00:01:38.070> redstone

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
a way up from here place your redstone

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
a way up from here place your redstone
repeater<00:01:40.320> down<00:01:40.830> there<00:01:41.330> you'll<00:01:42.330> need<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> block

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
repeater down there you'll need a block

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
repeater down there you'll need a block
with<00:01:43.800> this<00:01:43.950> part<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.720> need<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.780> run<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
with this part here I need to run your

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
with this part here I need to run your
wire<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> block<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.820> didn't<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
wire up the block if you didn't have a

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
wire up the block if you didn't have a
block<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.990> piston<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.920> be

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
block there this piston will not be

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.980 
block there this piston will not be
powered<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.369> side<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.479> place<00:01:54.810> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
powered for this side you just place a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.469 
powered for this side you just place a
repeater<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.850> run<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.970> wire<00:01:57.149> along

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
repeater down here run the wire along

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.430 
repeater down here run the wire along
the<00:01:57.660> side<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.440> into<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> piston<00:02:00.440> and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
the side of it and into the piston and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.820 
the side of it and into the piston and
that's<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:02.340> done<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.530> thing<00:02:04.800> to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
that's it you're done now one thing to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.999 
that's it you're done now one thing to
keep<00:02:05.039> in<00:02:05.100> mind<00:02:05.750> there<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.289> increase

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
keep in mind there is a way to increase

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.180 
keep in mind there is a way to increase
the<00:02:08.399> speed<00:02:08.640> someone<00:02:09.200> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.380> place<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> wire

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the speed someone if you place a wire

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.350 
the speed someone if you place a wire
here<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.790> we'll<00:02:11.910> get<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.180> later<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
here but we'll get to that later so I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.130 
here but we'll get to that later so I
think<00:02:16.020> you've<00:02:16.110> often<00:02:16.790> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:17.940> see<00:02:18.240> I've

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
think you've often as you can see I've

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.830 
think you've often as you can see I've
got<00:02:19.170> across<00:02:19.500> some<00:02:19.770> sick

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
got across some sick

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.750 
got across some sick
now<00:02:21.620> one<00:02:21.800> thing<00:02:21.830> you'll<00:02:22.129> need<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.310> do<00:02:22.550> if<00:02:22.670> you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
now one thing you'll need to do if you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.690 
now one thing you'll need to do if you
are<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:23.000> got<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.239> manually<00:02:23.750> control<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:25.430> run

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
are we got to manually control it is run

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.270 
are we got to manually control it is run
a<00:02:25.730> wire<00:02:25.940> from<00:02:26.870> where<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.680> torch<00:02:28.459> was<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:31.250> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
a wire from where the torch was to a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.330 
a wire from where the torch was to a
block<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:32.349> can<00:02:33.349> have<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:33.800> far<00:02:34.160> away<00:02:34.250> as

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
block you can have this as far away as

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.670 
block you can have this as far away as
you<00:02:34.489> like<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.000> long<00:02:35.090> as<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.390> keep<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> signal

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you like as long as you keep the signal

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.670 
you like as long as you keep the signal
up<00:02:36.800> with<00:02:36.980> repeaters<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.489> whatnot<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:39.560> then

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
up with repeaters and whatnot and then

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
up with repeaters and whatnot and then
you<00:02:39.799> can<00:02:39.920> place<00:02:40.099> they<00:02:41.200> leave<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.349> down<00:02:43.330> as<00:02:44.330> you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
you can place they leave it down as you

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.880 
you can place they leave it down as you
can<00:02:44.569> see<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.370> control<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:47.650> I'll<00:02:48.650> give<00:02:48.799> you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
can see you can control it I'll give you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.000 
can see you can control it I'll give you
a<00:02:48.920> quick<00:02:49.099> demonstration<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.910> what<00:02:50.239> i<00:02:50.269> mean<00:02:50.510> by

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
a quick demonstration of what i mean by

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.780 
a quick demonstration of what i mean by
using<00:02:52.010> both<00:02:52.400> signals<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:53.569> send<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:55.370> fast

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
using both signals to send as fast

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.350 
using both signals to send as fast
applause<00:02:56.090> as<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.299> can<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.459> we<00:02:58.610> use<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.819> note

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
applause as you can and we use a note

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.569 
applause as you can and we use a note
block<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.840> show<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:01.569> switch<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:03.400> as<00:03:04.400> you

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
block to show this switch it on as you

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.740 
block to show this switch it on as you
can<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:04.910> pretty<00:03:05.840> quick<00:03:06.079> pulse<00:03:07.540> vibrate<00:03:08.540> just

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
can see pretty quick pulse vibrate just

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:19.480 
can see pretty quick pulse vibrate just
one<00:03:08.930> of<00:03:09.019> these<00:03:09.140> sides<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.400> pulse<00:03:10.670> slows<00:03:10.910> down

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.450 

now<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:22.740> can<00:03:22.950> use<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:24.410> method<00:03:25.410> i<00:03:25.530> mentioned

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
now you can use the method i mentioned

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.250 
now you can use the method i mentioned
earlier<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.940> place<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> redstone<00:03:27.390> why<00:03:28.110> are

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
earlier and place a redstone why are

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.840 
earlier and place a redstone why are
there<00:03:30.080> now<00:03:31.080> you've<00:03:31.290> got<00:03:31.500> one<00:03:31.860> signal<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:35.640> one

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
there now you've got one signal this one

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.150 
there now you've got one signal this one
will<00:03:35.970> be<00:03:36.120> slightly<00:03:36.480> slower<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:39.890> well<00:03:40.890> know

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
will be slightly slower but well know

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.230 
will be slightly slower but well know
the<00:03:41.190> reins<00:03:41.610> over<00:03:43.160> this<00:03:44.160> will<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.520> slightly

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
the reins over this will be slightly

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.620 
the reins over this will be slightly
slower<00:03:45.660> this<00:03:46.650> one<00:03:46.830> will<00:03:46.950> send<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.610> pretty<00:03:48.480> quick

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
slower this one will send a pretty quick

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.990 
slower this one will send a pretty quick
pulse<00:03:48.900> through<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.500> this<00:03:49.920> notebook<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.790> I'll

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
pulse through to this notebook and I'll

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:02.710 
pulse through to this notebook and I'll
demonstrate<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:56.750> think<00:03:57.750> he'll<00:03:57.900> big<00:03:58.830> fault

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.080 

as<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.780> said<00:04:04.140> it's<00:04:04.500> slightly<00:04:04.950> quicker<00:04:05.310> than<00:04:05.910> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
as I said it's slightly quicker than the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:16.250 
as I said it's slightly quicker than the
other<00:04:06.209> side<00:04:14.090> thanks<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:15.209> watching<00:04:15.239> leave<00:04:16.200> a
