inside this inside this captured box

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.929 
inside this inside this captured box
there<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.310> hope

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
there is hope

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
then you take out the catch rate and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.800 
then you take out the catch rate and
clean<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.310> must<00:01:56.610> be<00:01:56.820> careful<00:01:57.180> when<00:01:57.479> you
