six foot one and it does have decent
strength<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.540> well<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.900> we

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
strength as well so we

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.380 
strength as well so we
was<00:02:13.260> pretty<00:02:13.500> robust<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> middle<00:02:14.760> wasn't
