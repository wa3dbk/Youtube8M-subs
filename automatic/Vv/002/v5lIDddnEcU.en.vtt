to<00:00:38.969> other<00:00:39.239> tournaments<00:00:39.719> yes<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> conditions

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
are different than others first of all

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
are different than others first of all
that<00:00:43.920> ball<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.460> flying<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.600> dry<00:00:45.870> here

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that ball is really flying it's dry here

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.459 
that ball is really flying it's dry here
it's<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.950> humid<00:00:47.309> at<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.809> boys<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it's not humid at all so the boys it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's not humid at all so the boys it's
really<00:00:49.789> satisfying<00:00:50.789> everywhere<00:00:51.949> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> think

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
really satisfying everywhere but I think

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.220 
really satisfying everywhere but I think
you<00:00:53.399> know<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.789> conditions<00:00:54.210> are<00:00:54.329> every<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you know the conditions are every are

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
you know the conditions are every are
the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.370> same<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.000> us<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the same and the same for all of us so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.479 
the same and the same for all of us so
we<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> think<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.289> kind<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.590> feels<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
we I think we all kind of feels to it so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
we I think we all kind of feels to it so
you<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.660> swing<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> racket<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.949> bit

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you just have to swing the racket a bit

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
you just have to swing the racket a bit
tighter<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.699> own<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
tighter than your own that's it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.660 
tighter than your own that's it
does<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> suit<00:01:04.589> certain<00:01:05.010> players<00:01:05.250> better<00:01:05.460> than

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
does it suit certain players better than

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
does it suit certain players better than
others<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:06.000> does<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> suit<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.510> own<00:01:06.570> game<00:01:06.810> for

still<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> top<00:01:24.240> 10<00:01:24.450> player<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.840> anything<00:01:25.110> slips

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
still a top 10 player if anything slips

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.350 
still a top 10 player if anything slips
ever<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.650> slightly<00:01:25.979> last<00:01:26.310> year<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
ever so slightly last year I mean is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
ever so slightly last year I mean is
that<00:01:27.530> possibly<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.619> sign<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.369> own<00:01:29.520> form

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that possibly a sign of your own form

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.270 
that possibly a sign of your own form
failing<00:01:30.119> state<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> an<00:01:30.810> example<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
failing state or is it an example of the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.340 
failing state or is it an example of the
more<00:01:32.460> competitiveness<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.990> field<00:01:34.200> in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
more competitiveness of the field in

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
more competitiveness of the field in
general<00:01:34.380> these<00:01:34.799> days<00:01:34.979> well<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:35.700> it's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.180 

and<00:01:42.220> so<00:01:43.220> those<00:01:44.060> young<00:01:44.270> players<00:01:44.750> coming<00:01:45.230> up<00:01:45.470> I'm

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
and so those young players coming up I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.790 
and so those young players coming up I'm
already<00:01:46.460> very<00:01:46.640> good<00:01:46.880> ranking<00:01:47.480> so<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.710> not

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
already very good ranking so it's not

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.040 
already very good ranking so it's not
that<00:01:48.860> easy<00:01:49.160> anymore<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:50.630> from

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
that easy anymore and you can see from

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.020 
that easy anymore and you can see from
the<00:01:51.230> big<00:01:51.650> tournaments<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:52.370> even<00:01:52.700> from<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the big tournaments that even from the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.030 
the big tournaments that even from the
first<00:01:53.240> run<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.600> really<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.140> push

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
first run you really have to push

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.580 
first run you really have to push
yourself<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.910> limit<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.510> 200%<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.410> win

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
yourself to the limit and 200% to win

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.950 
yourself to the limit and 200% to win
matches<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.850> really<00:01:59.390> feel<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.570> difference

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
matches and I really feel a difference

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.410 
matches and I really feel a difference
between<00:02:00.380> now<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:00.890> for<00:02:01.460> example<00:02:01.670> six<00:02:02.150> years

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
between now and for example six years

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.950 
between now and for example six years
ago<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.290> played<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.800> Thurman<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.960> it's

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
ago when I played of Thurman so it's

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.630 
ago when I played of Thurman so it's
just<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.320> know<00:02:06.440> more<00:02:06.800> good<00:02:07.040> players<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.400> the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
just you know more good players in the

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.219 
just you know more good players in the
tour<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.210> really<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.510> to<00:02:08.600> be<00:02:08.690> careful<00:02:08.810> I

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
tour and you really have to be careful I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.290 
tour and you really have to be careful I
mean<00:02:09.770> because<00:02:10.220> it's<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:10.640> tough<00:02:10.910> at<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> top

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
mean because it's so tough at the top

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.390 
mean because it's so tough at the top
now<00:02:11.420> do<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.750> feel<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.440> keep<00:02:12.590> maybe

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
now do you feel you have to keep maybe

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.190 
now do you feel you have to keep maybe
adapting<00:02:13.910> your<00:02:14.060> own<00:02:14.150> playing<00:02:14.450> style<00:02:14.840> or<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.080> it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
adapting your own playing style or is it

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.810 
adapting your own playing style or is it
better<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.530> focus<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.730> own

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
better to just focus on your own

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.610 
better to just focus on your own
strengths<00:02:17.360> or<00:02:17.510> do<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.020> need<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.290> sort<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.470> keep

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
strengths or do you need to sort of keep

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.350 
strengths or do you need to sort of keep
changing<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.490> improving<00:02:19.610> your<00:02:19.970> own<00:02:20.120> playing

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
changing and improving your own playing

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.330 
changing and improving your own playing
style<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.930> course<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.650> think<00:02:21.920> it's<00:02:22.160> always

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
style of course I think it's always

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.010 
style of course I think it's always
something<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.760> improve<00:02:22.850> especially<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
something to improve especially that the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.199 
something to improve especially that the
other<00:02:24.350> player<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.740> also<00:02:25.010> improving<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.940> the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
other player is also improving in the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.130 
other player is also improving in the
game<00:02:26.450> very<00:02:27.320> well<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.860> very<00:02:28.130> fast<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
game very well and very fast so of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.330 
game very well and very fast so of
course<00:02:30.380> we<00:02:30.560> really<00:02:30.680> have<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> focus<00:02:31.070> on

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
course we really have to focus on

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.720 
course we really have to focus on
yourself<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:31.820> well<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.560> course<00:02:33.730> adjust

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
yourself as well and of course adjust

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.150 
yourself as well and of course adjust
the<00:02:35.090> conditions<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:35.959> other<00:02:36.470> players<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:37.070> the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
the conditions and other players on the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.580 
the conditions and other players on the
other<00:02:37.190> side<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> court<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.330> now<00:02:39.260> we<00:02:39.320> can

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
other side of the court and now we can

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.650 
other side of the court and now we can
see<00:02:39.770> also<00:02:39.890> that<00:02:40.340> other<00:02:40.760> things<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.240> always

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
see also that other things is always

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.360 
see also that other things is always
going<00:02:42.070> to<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.190> powerful<00:02:44.020> way<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.709> play<00:02:45.920> tennis

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.949 
going to the powerful way to play tennis
so<00:02:48.880> I'm<00:02:49.880> talking<00:02:50.180> about<00:02:50.209> competitiveness

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
so I'm talking about competitiveness

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.930 
so I'm talking about competitiveness
looking<00:02:51.380> at<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.650> draw<00:02:52.370> here<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> think

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
looking at the draw here I think

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.130 
looking at the draw here I think
everyone<00:02:53.209> at<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> top<00:02:53.540> saying<00:02:53.720> apart<00:02:54.019> from

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
everyone at the top saying apart from

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.750 
everyone at the top saying apart from
pets<00:02:54.380> are<00:02:54.560> competing<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.550> pretty

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
pets are competing it's a pretty

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.580 
pets are competing it's a pretty
daunting<00:02:56.360> lineup<00:02:56.870> isn't<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.140> here<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.410> week

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
daunting lineup isn't it here this week

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.660

yes

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.410 
yes
another<00:02:59.060> really<00:02:59.330> strong<00:03:00.019> tournament<00:03:00.769> and

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
another really strong tournament and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.780 
another really strong tournament and
well<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.450> think<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:03.530> always<00:03:03.739> good<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.550> play

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
well I think it's always good to play

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.630 
well I think it's always good to play
those<00:03:05.000> tournaments<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:06.250> when<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.370> fall

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
those tournaments that when you fall

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.910 
those tournaments that when you fall
anyway<00:03:08.120> when<00:03:08.390> if<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.810> can<00:03:08.959> win<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.440> means

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
anyway when if you can win that means

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.280 
anyway when if you can win that means
you<00:03:10.130> really<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:11.150> everyone<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.780> way<00:03:11.900> and
