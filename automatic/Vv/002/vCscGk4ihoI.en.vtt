laffy taffy but a little less sugary

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.219 
laffy taffy but a little less sugary
like<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:53.150> don't<00:01:53.630> know<00:01:53.690> how<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.870> explain<00:01:54.140> it

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
like I don't know how to explain it

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.400 
like I don't know how to explain it
really<00:01:54.740> chewy<00:01:55.160> like<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> strawberry<00:01:56.110> like<00:01:57.110> even

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
really chewy like a strawberry like even

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.469 
really chewy like a strawberry like even
if<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.620> ever<00:01:57.710> had<00:01:57.920> laffy<00:01:58.340> taffy<00:01:58.760> that's

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
if you ever had laffy taffy that's

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.860 
if you ever had laffy taffy that's
exactly<00:01:59.990> what<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.620> consistency<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:01.870> but

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
exactly what like the consistency is but

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.719 
exactly what like the consistency is but
it's<00:02:03.080> not<00:02:03.229> as<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.530> sweet<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.190> sugary<00:02:04.400> it's

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
it's not as like sweet and sugary it's

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.450 
it's not as like sweet and sugary it's
more<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.620> low<00:02:06.620> side<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:07.370> if

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
more on the low side I don't know if

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.760 
more on the low side I don't know if
that<00:02:07.580> makes<00:02:07.610> sense<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.300> it's<00:02:08.929> really<00:02:09.440> good

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
that makes sense but it's really good

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.350 
that makes sense but it's really good
I've<00:02:10.010> don't<00:02:10.459> like<00:02:10.580> taste<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:11.000> strawberry

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
individual packages I just think that's

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.949

really<00:02:24.320> cute<00:02:26.620> these<00:02:27.620> were<00:02:27.800> pretty<00:02:28.280> good<00:02:28.610> um

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.920 
to them but they're just uh got a little
candy<00:02:37.850> if<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.120> want<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.420> eat<00:02:38.510> something<00:02:38.810> sweet
