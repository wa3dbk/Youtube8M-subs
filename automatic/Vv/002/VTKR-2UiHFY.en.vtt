00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
coaches uh was a key emphasis on when

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.400 
coaches uh was a key emphasis on when
I'm<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.389> making<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.809> rivers<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.199> blue

I'm not making two rivers on the blue
line<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.390> that's<00:00:18.390> probably<00:00:18.690> one<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
line and that's probably one of the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.019 
line and that's probably one of the
bigger<00:00:19.199> emphasis<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.220> had<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.550> season<00:00:20.760> long

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029

and working on that I mean throughout

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.490 
and working on that I mean throughout
the<00:00:23.670> whole<00:00:23.820> overtime<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.390> need<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.660> many

turnovers and the blue lines and that

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
turnovers and the blue lines and that
definitely<00:00:28.550> helped<00:00:29.550> us<00:00:29.609> play<00:00:29.789> defensively<00:00:30.269> in
