 In non-toll road 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:36.920
 I think it was worth going back and forth 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.090
 Let's go to the results are anxious results 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.410
 Well this way 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.600
 The rotation speed to god 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.580
 Display of parity and land is being done 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:55.620
 It is a graph I often see 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.620
 It looks like this 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.780

 99.6 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:31.460
 Apply coefficient correction 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.660
 It became 3209.6 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:41.800
 Effort is a little bit dissatisfied but it has been 6 years 38 years 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:48.010

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:15.610
