different<00:02:02.040> heals<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.969> cleansing

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
different heals you just have cleansing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.630 
different heals you just have cleansing
wave<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.930> every<00:02:04.200> time<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.469> dodge<00:02:04.829> roll<00:02:05.130> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
wave and every time you dodge roll you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.510 
wave and every time you dodge roll you
are<00:02:05.729> going<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.090> cleansing<00:02:06.570> wave<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:08.250> go

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
are going to cleansing wave so if you go

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.820 
are going to cleansing wave so if you go
into<00:02:08.700> water<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.959> pretty<00:02:10.229> much<00:02:10.319> roll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
into water you can pretty much roll

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.740 
into water you can pretty much roll
around<00:02:10.979> in

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
around in

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.990 
around in
can<00:02:12.680> trips<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.370> granting<00:02:13.880> you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
can trips are going to be granting you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.240 
can trips are going to be granting you
bigger<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.720> you'll<00:02:15.560> have<00:02:15.770> plenty<00:02:16.040> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
bigger so you'll have plenty of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.950 
bigger so you'll have plenty of
endurance<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:16.880> roles<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.600> is<00:02:17.750> just

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
endurance for roles and that is just

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.860 
endurance for roles and that is just
going<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.350> keep<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.740> alive<00:02:19.070> for<00:02:19.490> a<00:02:20.000> ridiculous

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
going to keep you alive for a ridiculous

going to keep you alive for a ridiculous
amount<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.410> time<00:02:22.090> definitely<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.510> strongest

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
amount of time definitely the strongest

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.160 
amount of time definitely the strongest
aspect<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.220> build<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:26.170> survival

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
aspect of this build is that survival

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.610 
aspect of this build is that survival
and<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:27.710> very<00:02:27.950> handy<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.840> sacrifice<00:02:30.590> a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and it is very handy you do sacrifice a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.940 
and it is very handy you do sacrifice a
bit<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.040> DPS<00:02:31.520> but<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.470> really<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.680> build

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
bit of DPS but it really this build

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.040 
bit of DPS but it really this build
isn't<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.670> getting<00:02:35.030> kills<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.660> for

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
isn't for getting kills it is for

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.430 
isn't for getting kills it is for
maintaining<00:02:36.860> control<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.640> points<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.440> just

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
maintaining control on points and just

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.199 
maintaining control on points and just
pressuring<00:02:39.950> where<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.280> can<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.820> helping

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
definitely a good start looks like the

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.479 
definitely a good start looks like the

Flame Charge attack into flame breath

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.060 
Flame Charge attack into flame breath
and<00:03:09.770> he<00:03:09.950> does<00:03:10.340> go<00:03:10.640> down<00:03:10.670> easily<00:03:11.709> I'm<00:03:12.709> not<00:03:12.860> going

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
and he does go down easily I'm not going

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.010 
and he does go down easily I'm not going
to<00:03:13.160> be<00:03:13.310> able<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.580> survive<00:03:13.940> as<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.239> ranger<00:03:14.690> there

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
to be able to survive as a ranger there

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.710 
to be able to survive as a ranger there
yeah<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.890> very<00:03:16.220> limited<00:03:16.519> break<00:03:17.360> freeze

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
yeah you have very limited break freeze

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.560 
yeah you have very limited break freeze
as<00:03:18.019> a<00:03:18.049> ranger<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:18.769> he<00:03:19.370> probably<00:03:19.730> didn't<00:03:20.450> have

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
as a ranger and he probably didn't have

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.570 
as a ranger and he probably didn't have
it<00:03:20.720> at<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.840> point<00:03:21.170> he's<00:03:21.500> using<00:03:21.920> D<00:03:22.100> routing

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
it at that point he's using D routing

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.180 
it at that point he's using D routing
ultimate<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.450> means<00:03:23.660> he<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.049> not<00:03:24.380> very

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
ultimate so that means he is not very

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.490 
ultimate so that means he is not very
very<00:03:25.700> unlikely<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.989> he<00:03:27.200> will<00:03:27.290> have

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
very unlikely that he will have

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.590 
very unlikely that he will have
stability<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.190> we're<00:03:28.820> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.120> clean<00:03:29.450> up

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
stability and we're going to clean up

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.100 
stability and we're going to clean up
this<00:03:29.810> point<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:32.000> yeah<00:03:32.810> we<00:03:32.959> got

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
this point right here it yeah we got

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.750 
this point right here it yeah we got
there<00:03:33.320> right<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.650> time<00:03:33.680> little<00:03:34.100> dreams<00:03:34.340> did<00:03:34.580> go

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
there right in time little dreams did go

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.430 
there right in time little dreams did go
down<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.299> get<00:03:35.450> that<00:03:35.600> stop<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.170> get<00:03:36.290> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
down but we get that stop to get the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.680 
down but we get that stop to get the

and he does go down pretty easily he is
definitely<00:04:28.870> not<00:04:29.260> that<00:04:29.920> durable<00:04:30.400> but<00:04:30.490> I<00:04:30.550> do<00:04:30.670> go

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
definitely not that durable but I do go

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.820
