to do this up to level 20 and I'm pretty

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
to do this up to level 20 and I'm pretty
sure<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.470> once<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.830> reach<00:00:17.100> level<00:00:17.130> 20<00:00:17.670> you'll

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.040 
sure that once you reach level 20 you'll
know<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.779> train<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.380> up<00:00:19.560> tillable<00:00:19.890> 99<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
know how to train it up tillable 99 so I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.200 
know how to train it up tillable 99 so I
would<00:00:22.320> say<00:00:22.500> this<00:00:22.740> skill<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> pretty<00:00:23.730> much<00:00:23.970> like

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
would say this skill is pretty much like

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.050 
would say this skill is pretty much like
runespan<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.880> same

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
runespan it really is you do the same

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
runespan it really is you do the same
thing<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.990> may<00:00:28.140> lag<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.500> bit<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
thing is it may lag a little bit in the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.490 
thing is it may lag a little bit in the
video<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.880> sorry<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.660> so

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
place which is between Draenor village

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.030 
place which is between Draenor village
and<00:00:35.520> lumbridge<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.300> you're<00:00:36.899> gonna<00:00:37.110> harvest

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you're gonna do while training the skill

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
you're gonna do while training the skill
now<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.239> bonus<00:00:45.660> things<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.170> you

now there are some bonus things that you
can<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.590> while<00:00:46.890> training<00:00:47.329> like<00:00:48.329> collecting

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
can do while training like collecting

these<00:00:49.230> orange<00:00:49.739> balls<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.879> cannot<00:00:51.120> see

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
these orange balls which I cannot see

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
these orange balls which I cannot see
any<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.809> them<00:00:52.020> right<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.370> will<00:00:53.520> give

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
any of them right now but they will give

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.439 
any of them right now but they will give
bonus<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.710> thing<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.239> can

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
bonus there you go this thing so you can

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.090 
bonus there you go this thing so you can
collect<00:00:57.719> ten<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.050> those<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.590> then<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.800> can

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
collect ten of those and then you can

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.209 
collect ten of those and then you can
claim<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.300> wallet<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.170> guy<00:01:01.530> right

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
claim the wallet from the guy right

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.039 
claim the wallet from the guy right
there<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.030> actually<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.420> woman<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
there I think it's actually a woman and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
there I think it's actually a woman and
it<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.830> quite<00:01:05.189> nice<00:01:05.400> amount<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it can get quite nice amount of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.630 
it can get quite nice amount of
divination<00:01:06.689> experience<00:01:07.590> especially<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
divination experience especially if you

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
divination experience especially if you
are<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.939> level<00:01:09.270> five<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.740> 100

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
are like level five you can get like 100

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
are like level five you can get like 100
which<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.119> most<00:01:12.450> likely<00:01:12.659> level<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.680> least

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
which will most likely level up at least

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
which will most likely level up at least
one<00:01:14.340> level<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.600> once<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.020> full

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
one level so once you have full

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
one level so once you have full
inventory<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.920> pale<00:01:17.159> memory<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.680> convert

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
inventory of pale memory you can convert

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.460 
inventory of pale memory you can convert
the<00:01:19.890> memory<00:01:20.250> into<00:01:20.970> bonus<00:01:21.240> experience<00:01:22.049> now

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the memory into bonus experience now

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.380 
the memory into bonus experience now
there<00:01:22.710> are<00:01:22.799> two<00:01:22.979> types<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.400> bonus<00:01:23.759> experience

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
there are two types of bonus experience

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.469 
there are two types of bonus experience
one<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.080> by<00:01:25.890> converting<00:01:26.460> only<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> pale

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
one is by converting only the pale

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
one is by converting only the pale
memory<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.770> other<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> by

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
memory and the other one is by

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.260 
memory and the other one is by
converting<00:01:30.090> pale<00:01:30.479> memory<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.549> pale<00:01:32.549> energy

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
converting pale memory and pale energy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.530 
converting pale memory and pale energy
now<00:01:33.990> keep<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.770> mind<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.340> will<00:01:35.460> need<00:01:35.540> 100

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
now keep in mind that you will need 100

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
now keep in mind that you will need 100
pale<00:01:36.840> energy<00:01:37.380> before<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> hit<00:01:38.100> level<00:01:38.310> 10<00:01:38.490> this

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
pale energy before you hit level 10 this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.319 
pale energy before you hit level 10 this
is<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.810> would<00:01:40.140> say<00:01:40.320> it's<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.560> mandatory<00:01:40.950> thing

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
is I would say it's a mandatory thing

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.679 
is I would say it's a mandatory thing
because<00:01:42.649> what<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.890> make<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.689> now

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
because what you can make from this now

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.510 
because what you can make from this now
actually<00:01:46.259> does<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.590> exist<00:01:46.649> anymore<00:01:47.280> because

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually does not exist anymore because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
actually does not exist anymore because
I<00:01:47.880> permanently<00:01:48.750> unlocked<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.649> cannot

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I permanently unlocked this so I cannot

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.590 
I permanently unlocked this so I cannot
make<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> second<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.060> I'm<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> show

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
make a second one but I'm going to show

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.750 
into bonus experience now you should be
also<00:02:46.019> looking<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.829> bigger<00:02:47.130> fountains

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
also looking for this bigger fountains

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.270 
also looking for this bigger fountains
that<00:02:47.910> spawn<00:02:48.390> from<00:02:48.599> time<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.140> time<00:02:49.170> they<00:02:50.099> will

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
that spawn from time to time they will

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
that spawn from time to time they will
give<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.760> double<00:02:51.209> experience<00:02:51.810> when<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.380> are

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
give you double experience when you are

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.030 
give you double experience when you are
gonna<00:02:52.769> exchange<00:02:53.610> your<00:02:54.380> memories<00:02:55.380> into<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
gonna exchange your memories into the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.850 
gonna exchange your memories into the
well<00:02:56.480> so<00:02:57.480> that's<00:02:57.810> a<00:02:58.019> little<00:02:58.290> bonus<00:02:58.530> as<00:02:58.829> well

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
well so that's a little bonus as well

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.190 
well so that's a little bonus as well
and<00:02:59.370> I<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.390> at<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.629> place<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:01.140> don't

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and I think at this place I don't

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.199 
and I think at this place I don't
actually<00:03:01.829> collect<00:03:02.190> those<00:03:02.370> orange<00:03:02.819> balls

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
actually collect those orange balls

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.449 
actually collect those orange balls
because<00:03:03.599> there<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.200> no<00:03:04.440> way<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.709> can<00:03:04.980> give

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
because there is no way you can give

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.339 
because there is no way you can give
them<00:03:05.670> in<00:03:05.940> in<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.329> place<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.900> have<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.200> go

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
them in in this place you have to go

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.710 
them in in this place you have to go
back<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.860> lumbridge<00:03:08.790> and<00:03:09.030> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.299> that's<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
back to lumbridge and I think that's a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720 
back to lumbridge and I think that's a
little<00:03:09.810> bit<00:03:10.019> inefficient<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.549> would

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
little bit inefficient and you would

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.819 
little bit inefficient and you would
gain<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.239> experience<00:03:12.870> if<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.349> stay<00:03:13.590> in

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
gain more experience if you just stay in

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:14.619 
gain more experience if you just stay in
this<00:03:14.040> place

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
this place

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.780 
this place
so<00:03:15.629> I<00:03:16.140> think<00:03:16.470> that's<00:03:16.650> all<00:03:16.889> I<00:03:17.160> think<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.579> is

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
so I think that's all I think this is

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.949 
so I think that's all I think this is
all<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.209> introduction<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.139> divination<00:03:19.650> skill

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
all for introduction to divination skill

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.319 
all for introduction to divination skill
my<00:03:21.959> opinion<00:03:22.380> on<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.709> skill<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.459> no<00:03:24.000> idea

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
my opinion on the skill I have no idea

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.990 
my opinion on the skill I have no idea
really<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.049> words<00:03:25.440> look<00:03:25.829> really<00:03:26.250> really<00:03:26.760> nice

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
really the words look really really nice

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.009 
really the words look really really nice
but<00:03:28.010> yeah<00:03:29.010> it's<00:03:29.489> kind<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.970> slow<00:03:30.389> I<00:03:30.420> guess<00:03:30.569> but

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
but yeah it's kind of slow I guess but

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.339 
but yeah it's kind of slow I guess but
probably<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.160> because<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.639> only<00:03:32.880> level<00:03:33.349> 15

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
probably it's because I'm only level 15

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.559 
probably it's because I'm only level 15
at<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> moment<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.250> once<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.359> a<00:03:36.389> higher

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
at the moment and once I get to a higher

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.039 
at the moment and once I get to a higher
level<00:03:36.599> it<00:03:37.139> will<00:03:37.440> be<00:03:37.620> fast<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.250> hopefully<00:03:39.049> so

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
level it will be fast and hopefully so

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.300 
level it will be fast and hopefully so
yeah<00:03:40.200> thank<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.560> watching<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.130> video
