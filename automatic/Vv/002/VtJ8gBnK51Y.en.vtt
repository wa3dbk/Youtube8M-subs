with the names but we're going to start

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.480 
with the names but we're going to start
off<00:00:17.010> here<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> mls<00:00:18.710> all-star<00:00:19.710> cup<00:00:20.189> and

off here in the mls all-star cup and
this<00:00:21.270> one<00:00:21.510> has<00:00:22.140> looked<00:00:22.619> very<00:00:22.980> enticing<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.460> me

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
this one has looked very enticing to me

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.340 
this one has looked very enticing to me
because<00:00:23.670> i<00:00:23.820> did<00:00:24.000> already<00:00:24.240> have<00:00:24.420> an<00:00:24.539> MLS<00:00:24.960> squad

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
because i did already have an MLS squad

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.490 
because i did already have an MLS squad
and<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.760> ready<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.119> go<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.349> see

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and I was ready to go so as you can see

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.080 
and I was ready to go so as you can see
you<00:00:28.590> were<00:00:28.710> coming<00:00:28.949> against<00:00:29.160> leg<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.670> Drogba

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you were coming against leg like Drogba

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.870 
you were coming against leg like Drogba
and<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.289> might<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.040> quickest<00:00:32.669> ragequit

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
and this might be the quickest ragequit

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
and this might be the quickest ragequit
i<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.450> ever<00:00:33.690> seen<00:00:34.969> 00000<00:00:35.969> nil<00:00:36.630> nil<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.640> he<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
i have ever seen 00000 nil nil and he is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150 
i have ever seen 00000 nil nil and he is
out<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.570> i<00:00:39.899> guess<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.010> way

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
out of there so i guess that is one way

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
out of there so i guess that is one way
to<00:00:41.190> start<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.680> episode<00:00:43.680> off<00:00:44.360> not<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.629> sure

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to start the episode off not really sure

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
to start the episode off not really sure
if<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.710> count<00:00:46.950> as<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> win<00:00:47.340> or<00:00:47.460> loss<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.969> don't

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
if that count as a win or loss I don't

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
if that count as a win or loss I don't
think<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.300> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> does<00:00:48.660> anything<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.739> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
think it kind of does anything but we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.090 
think it kind of does anything but we
are<00:00:50.219> moving<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.449> next<00:00:51.809> match<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.530> if

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
are moving on to that next match and if

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.560 
are moving on to that next match and if

talk about it but this is just one of
those<00:03:05.310> games<00:03:05.610> where<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.569> just<00:03:06.750> want<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.050> throw
