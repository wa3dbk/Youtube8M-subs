00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
I suspect the wood is rotted in there

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.780 
I suspect the wood is rotted in there
I've<00:00:31.880> got<00:00:32.020> nails<00:00:33.020> small<00:00:33.860> nails<00:00:34.220> all<00:00:34.520> around

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
here I'm just gonna have to try to

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.770 
here I'm just gonna have to try to
wiggle<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:38.870> loose<00:00:40.059> maybe<00:00:41.059> I<00:00:41.210> can<00:00:41.449> expose

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
wiggle this loose maybe I can expose

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.049 
wiggle this loose maybe I can expose
these<00:00:42.050> nail<00:00:42.320> heads<00:00:42.620> enough<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.359> grab<00:00:44.359> them

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.209 

this<00:00:50.059> joint<00:00:50.449> is<00:00:50.629> such<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> mess<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.710> leg<00:00:51.920> is

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
this joint is such a mess the leg is

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.110 
this joint is such a mess the leg is
broken<00:00:53.090> in<00:00:53.390> all<00:00:53.660> these<00:00:53.840> places<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.940> feel<00:00:55.940> like

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
broken in all these places I feel like

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.259 
broken in all these places I feel like
the<00:00:56.539> best<00:00:56.780> thing<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.019> do<00:00:57.289> is<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.489> use<00:00:58.579> epoxy<00:00:58.969> I

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
the best thing to do is to use epoxy I

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.180 
the best thing to do is to use epoxy I
will<00:00:59.480> epoxy<00:01:00.019> this<00:01:00.199> back<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:00.679> the<00:01:00.739> position

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
will epoxy this back in the position

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.610 
will epoxy this back in the position
where<00:01:01.370> it<00:01:01.429> goes<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.809> then<00:01:03.230> I'm<00:01:03.289> gonna<00:01:03.410> add

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
where it goes and then I'm gonna add

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.170 
where it goes and then I'm gonna add
corner<00:01:04.160> blocks<00:01:04.430> in<00:01:04.840> here<00:01:06.460> along<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.730> inside

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
corner blocks in here along the inside

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.560 
corner blocks in here along the inside
piece<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:10.000> hopefully<00:01:11.000> that<00:01:11.150> will<00:01:11.210> be<00:01:11.329> strong

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
piece and hopefully that will be strong

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.710 
piece and hopefully that will be strong
enough<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.840> hold<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.180> brings<00:01:14.390> up<00:01:14.570> an

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
enough to hold it and that brings up an

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.109 
enough to hold it and that brings up an
important<00:01:15.200> subject<00:01:15.619> when<00:01:16.579> repairing<00:01:16.909> an

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
important subject when repairing an

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.819 
important subject when repairing an
antique<00:01:17.509> like<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.259> you'll<00:01:18.350> see<00:01:18.619> when<00:01:18.799> I

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
antique like this and you'll see when I

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.100 
antique like this and you'll see when I
do<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.159> veneer<00:01:19.400> repairs<00:01:19.759> on<00:01:19.939> the<00:01:20.060> tops<00:01:20.329> I<00:01:20.630> will

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
do the veneer repairs on the tops I will

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.929 
do the veneer repairs on the tops I will
use<00:01:21.229> hide<00:01:21.500> glue<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:22.250> was<00:01:22.369> probably<00:01:22.729> what<00:01:22.909> was

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
use hide glue that was probably what was

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.109 
use hide glue that was probably what was
originally<00:01:23.570> used<00:01:23.810> on<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.140> table<00:01:25.000> but<00:01:26.000> in

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
originally used on this table but in

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.569 
originally used on this table but in
cases<00:01:26.329> like<00:01:26.509> this<00:01:26.840> where<00:01:27.020> you've<00:01:27.140> got<00:01:27.579> hardly

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
cases like this where you've got hardly

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.870 
cases like this where you've got hardly
any<00:01:28.640> good<00:01:29.180> wood<00:01:29.450> wood<00:01:29.689> contact<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:30.979> what

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
any good wood wood contact and what

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.090 
any good wood wood contact and what
really<00:01:32.180> needs<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.450> be<00:01:32.540> done<00:01:32.840> here's<00:01:33.110> basically

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
really needs to be done here's basically

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.580 
really needs to be done here's basically
what<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.579> need<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> whole<00:01:35.119> new<00:01:35.329> leg<00:01:35.630> to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
what you need is a whole new leg to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.730 
what you need is a whole new leg to
rebuild<00:01:37.040> these<00:01:37.250> joints<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:38.899> best<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.439> think

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
rebuild these joints it's best I think

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.139 
rebuild these joints it's best I think
to<00:01:39.890> use<00:01:40.070> epoxy<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:42.340> that<00:01:43.340> way<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.549> can<00:01:43.880> save

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
to use epoxy and that way you can save

00:01:44.149 --> 00:02:16.699 
to use epoxy and that way you can save
all<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.200> original<00:01:45.680> parts<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> leg

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.220 

these<00:02:17.709> legs<00:02:18.040> are<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.459> bowed<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.940> twisted<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
these legs are so bowed and twisted it

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.110 
these legs are so bowed and twisted it
seems<00:02:20.530> funny<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.920> check<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.370> diagonals<00:02:21.940> for

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
seems funny to check the diagonals for

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.660 
seems funny to check the diagonals for
squareness<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.840> actually<00:02:23.280> measures<00:02:24.280> up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
squareness but it actually measures up

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.650 
squareness but it actually measures up
square<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.660> seems<00:02:31.959> really<00:02:32.260> strong<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.450> here

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
square that seems really strong so here

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
square that seems really strong so here
we<00:02:34.750> go

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
we go

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.020 
we go
leg<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.549> good<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.910> strong<00:02:37.180> now<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.530> by<00:02:38.769> using

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
leg is good and strong now so by using

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.699 
leg is good and strong now so by using
epoxy<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.239> was<00:02:40.540> able<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.840> save<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.680> original

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
epoxy I was able to save the original

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.090 
epoxy I was able to save the original
leg<00:02:42.459> of<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.790> table
