00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.050
 hello everyone how about in this video we're going 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.170
 to see a very effective trick to give 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.590
 volume to the eyelashes we already made 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.169
 little and recently a video to do 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.119
 effect of much longer eyelashes without 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.070
 wear false eyelashes that look like 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.480
 I'll let you want to go down here in 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.180
 you have lost pressure but I do not think 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.920
 because it has been a success and up to date 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.440
 next and the following days all 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.510
 you put me pictures by facebook instagram 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.940
 in twitter comments on the web 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.940
 telling me and sant that provides it to you 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.129
 loved it because the truth is that there is just 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.140
 thank you very much for doing it and for 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.000
 commenting I will leave you as I say the video 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.679
 down here and in that video what 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.269
 We tried was to lengthen the lashes 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.910
 Well now let's see a little bit 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.980
 to give them volume because sometimes good 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.199
 we managed to lengthen the skirts 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.180
 we have long but what we need is 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.370
 a little thick and we do not like it 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.470
 walking with false eyelashes or not 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.450
 we manage with them or what is good 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.030
 Then let's see let's truquito 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.320
 need a few loose powders or for 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.700
 translucent 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.820
 what are these politicians that we use 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.660
 to seal the makeup are like that are 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.300
 loose powders that what they do is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.190
 ratify makeup a brush and 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.260
 our mascara that 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.990
 you want to use and what we are going to do 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.869
 is to take the brush with the brush 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 we take powder and we will apply it in 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.950
 the base of the eyelashes 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.510
 just like I did in the other video I'm going to 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.100
 apply it in one eye if in the other not 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.960
 so you can see the difference 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.390
 good and once we have applied 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.500
 You see well from dust I'm going to use the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.010
 eyelash mask I apply a little 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.340
 from above 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.700
 where you have applied the powder and now by 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.700
 down 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.630
 I'm going to apply mask on the other eye without 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.630
 have applied powder 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.290
 once they have dried we can 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.239
 apply another little bit more and we can 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.030
 apply as I applied it above 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.630
 or also below now as you already have 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.570
 a little mascara 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.570
 it remains stuck also down 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.080
 it has dried a little but only what 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.480
 Leave a little time I have not left much with 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.560
 which mask still holds the 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.360
 powder 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.870
 and I go back to the mask of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.870
 tabs 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.940
 and even if he gave me a second layer in the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.180
 Another eye, I do not care 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.160
 they are more marked but they are not so 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.340
 thick if you have a small group that is 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.990
 the pea of ​​this trick because you already know the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 magic comb that had not done 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.050
 I knew in my videos and we separated 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.050
 tabs 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.380
 well this would be the result I think 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.150
 that is appreciated quite I hope yes already 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.170
 You see the difference I go back to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.170
 that looks better 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.290
 there it is so is this distance equal what 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.270
 you see more real good this is the trick 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.980
 to give them a little more thickness it 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.660
 apply the other trick that I leave 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.610
 down here to give you more length and 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.310
 we go with a few tabs that now 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.230
 We have to good but I hope that you 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.750

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.520
