00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.770
 annes explained shortly after the match was over 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.050
 this is a tough match today , relatively 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.950
 that was that was tight i found the have 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.320
 well played that was not such a had 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.800
 matschie in celje there was a lot of running 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.899
 It was a bit quieter today 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.910
 Nevertheless, you have seen more often 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.420
 counter-attack came a counter-attack directly 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 back 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 that was already a good game too many 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 found technical errors on our part 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 That's a bit tight, too 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.170
 but still relatively safe in the end 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 the press conference has the coach 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.220
 de said for a moment he already has 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
 in impression also here in Flensburg 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.739
 how can you win this? 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.660
 seen it was the close game 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 I think the goods were still a piece of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.900
 of winning but still has 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.150
 You noticed that I was tied and stuff 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.129
 long so that they have kept up 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:09.420
 to 45 partially to 50 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.799
 that's a bit extra 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 they have already done well , I think 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.500
 Now let's take a look at the next one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.440
 round 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.240
 Kiel hamburg west sprem barcelona are 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.700
 the probable opponents 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 Who do you wish I would say that 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.830
 are probably the opponents to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 I do not want anything that is 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.540
 four teams i find the four 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.660
 other teams who come along 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.520
 are also great so that's always 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.200
 a pleasure here the quarterfinals and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.100
 such champions league the best 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 team of europe yes a german 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.480
 Team then it will be a short trip 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.180
 We are always happy to receive that 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.140
 the others would be fun because yes 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.430
 what else is so yes I do not know 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.600
 Jim Gottfried and right after the match 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.220
 against celje 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 it was still a hard stick partie 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.770
 or you are hard once too 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 been fouled 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.299
 yes but there you can see that in this game 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.739
 emo has and today was 60 minutes 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:13.200
 very hard and that was an incredible 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.150
 really victory for us after you 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.160
 the spectators may feel 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.099
 also thought some times in the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.750
 first half that is today went tight 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.450
 it is exactly the same for you or what you are sure 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.530
 I was sure so we have one 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.920
 has had hard games and wants to 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 I also know this game is 30 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.900
 minutes of winning or we have 60 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.600
 minutes she has to play quite well and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.850
 I think you have one today 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.920
 voters we think of kiel us 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.510
 think of hamburg but also of barcelona 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850
 and veszprem in the next round as 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.060
 possible opponents 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.349
 I do not care about that now 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 present break and then we look 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.910
 like warriors ok then we are happy now 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.720
 with you on the break and all the best 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 for the final four in hamburg
