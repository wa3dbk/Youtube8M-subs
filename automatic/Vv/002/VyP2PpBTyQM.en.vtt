00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:18.070
 we take our rectangle of 22 18 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.070
 centimeters we fold it in half 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.760
 and 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.650
 each cousin 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.650
 and this corner we will take it to the song 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 ah 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.770
 d 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.770
 They mark the folds very well 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.070
 we will do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 now we will take this peak down 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.969
 the lines must match 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.570
 we turn and then we will take 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.570
 this section to the center 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.439
 we will do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 next we will make a folds of 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 points 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.310
 remember to mark the double 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.840
 and we will double again without doubling the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 triangle 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.970
 the fold that we made we will introduce 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.970
 in this triangle 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 so we should be turned around 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.630
 and we talk about the peak 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.790
 and so we have the envelope now have 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.090
 come to the hilarious part we take 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.220
 a piece of dark lighter brown leaf 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.440
 depending on the color of the base and in what 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.280
 we fold in half we draw the 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.280
 clock antennas 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 we cut 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.640
 and so we will get look for fabrics 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.650
 the eyes can be bought all done 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.130
 If you do not know how to do it, explain to the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.130
 screen 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.370
 and for the nose we will take a piece of 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.000
 red sheet and we will look for a small 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.550
 circle we cut it and hit it because 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.710
 has figures I recommend a heart 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.660
 red color and this we will place it from to 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.210
 reverse and it will also work like the nose 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.610
 making everything aside and all the 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.600
 our over we flipped it over and we started 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.600
 to stick the antennas 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.030
 we hit again and we will hit our eyes 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.030
 and also the nose 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.400
 now enter the letter 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.670
 and we give you that over 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.129
 and so we have this hilarious about 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.160
 this great reminds us that I just 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.690
 but the idea if you the transformation 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.370
 you put on a shared edging having 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.370
 other friends help him upstairs
