00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
cups themselves or the pads I should say

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
cups themselves or the pads I should say
are<00:00:40.829> pleather<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
are pleather and you can see they have a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.819 
are pleather and you can see they have a
good<00:00:42.300> amount<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.600> cushion<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.710> they're

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
good amount of cushion so they're

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.220 
good amount of cushion so they're
comfortable<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> they<00:00:44.579> add<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> good<00:00:45.960> seal

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
comfortable and they add to a good seal

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
comfortable and they add to a good seal
so<00:00:46.710> they're<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.399> bleed<00:00:47.640> too<00:00:47.820> much

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so they're not gonna like bleed too much

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.389 
so they're not gonna like bleed too much
sound<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.050> may<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.680> fiddling<00:00:50.190> with

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
sound you may see as I'm fiddling with

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.330 
sound you may see as I'm fiddling with
them<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.700> they<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.300> ton<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
them here they have a ton of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.770 
them here they have a ton of
articulation<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.059> reason<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
articulation and the reason for that is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.360 
articulation and the reason for that is
as<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.170> DJ<00:00:55.530> headphones<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
be able to switch out if that's your

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.439 
be able to switch out if that's your
thing<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.649> either<00:00:58.890> side<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.280> listen<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.149> your

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
music and then also obviously as normal

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.179 
music and then also obviously as normal
headphones<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.769> may<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.979> also

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
headphones and on that you may have also

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
headphones and on that you may have also
seen<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> couple<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.270> controls<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
seen we got a couple of controls on the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
seen we got a couple of controls on the
cups<00:01:07.260> themselves<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
cups themselves so you do have the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.730 
cups themselves so you do have the
ability<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.150> independently<00:01:09.540> adjust<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> bass

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
ability to independently adjust the bass

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710 
ability to independently adjust the bass
coming<00:01:11.130> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.400> either<00:01:11.580> headphone<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.240> then

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
coming out of either headphone and then

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.760 
coming out of either headphone and then
on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> left<00:01:13.080> side<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
on the left side here we have the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.929 
on the left side here we have the
ability<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> switch<00:01:14.220> between<00:01:14.250> mono<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
ability to switch between mono and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
ability to switch between mono and
stereo<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.600> as<00:01:15.780> their<00:01:15.930> DJ<00:01:16.259> headphones<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.770> can

also without articulation comes

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
also without articulation comes

with a couple differences so one of the
most<00:01:49.259> notable<00:01:49.500> ones<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.920> aesthetics<00:01:50.549> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
most notable ones is aesthetics this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.819 
most notable ones is aesthetics this

you're<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> fan<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.670> might<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.909> not

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
you're a fan of that this might be not

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.600 
you're a fan of that this might be not
great<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.170> second<00:01:55.619> difference<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.460> cable

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
great the second difference is the cable

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.550 
great the second difference is the cable
instead<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.420> straight<00:01:57.659> cable<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
instead of a straight cable that the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
instead of a straight cable that the
original<00:01:58.950> version<00:01:59.009> came<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.759> comes

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
original version came with this comes

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.030 
original version came with this comes
with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> coil<00:02:00.390> cable<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> provides<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
with the coil cable so it provides a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.709 
with the coil cable so it provides a
little<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.399> more<00:02:02.820> freedom<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> movement<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
little bit more freedom of movement and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.630 
little bit more freedom of movement and
flexibility<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.500> think<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> cool

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
flexibility I think one of the cool

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
flexibility I think one of the cool
things<00:02:05.670> about<00:02:05.969> all<00:02:06.299> eight<00:02:06.450> HD<00:02:06.659> detachable

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
things about all eight HD detachable

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
things about all eight HD detachable
cables<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> they're<00:02:08.310> three<00:02:08.520> pin<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.629> if

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
cables is that they're three pin so if

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
cables is that they're three pin so if
you<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.349> another<00:02:10.560> AKG<00:02:10.950> headphones<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.340> the

you have another AKG headphones like the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.920 
you have another AKG headphones like the
