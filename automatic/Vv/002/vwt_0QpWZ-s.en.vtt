00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.620
 and good morning to all this news 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.139
 today I will explain 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.930
 how to design your key grope 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.270
 crazy to have the beta it's really 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.680
 very simple we have here a version 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.750
 official the legal version altogether 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.700
 normal where just go to the site 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.919
 once the point like a star at 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.560
 first hbh and all links will be 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.720
 in the description so the version 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.640
 classic or choose your platform 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.130
 you register after you ask 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.750
 to log in and fill in a few 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.359
 information around are crazy a little 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.789
 and after you will perhaps receive your 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.559
 key but it's not sure you have to know 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.420
 they send keys regularly 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.929
 so did not lose hope 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 the keys will arrive until the 17th if I do not 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.410
 say no nonsense according to whether you have 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.839
 you have a little bit of room for 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.019
 to test the beta what to know 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:01:00.350
 that there is a huge demand for your 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.589
 passion then there is possibility too 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.010
 if you received a beta xbox one 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:09.680
 and that you are on pc is fine to go 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.470
 on this article 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.970
 not to follow the different 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.149
 what to do just 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.899
 write is enough to go on the contact 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.930
 us etc 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.850
 you get where to click on four 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.890
 a crazy obviously and you enough 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.469
 to follow the baths what is written there 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.750
 we stall on pc you act the demo 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.210
 the beta then you have a little mail 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.969
 is logically in a few hours to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.030
 pain or receive in exchange for other 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:40.039
 xbox world codes a pc code and that's it 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.579
 very important why because if 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.680
 we never had received no keys or 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.600
 the pc the ducs the xbox one mails 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.119
 fossard that the ex boxer has a lot 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 who have it and do not want it and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.859
 who suddenly the dolls know her 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.359

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.200

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.820
 twitter there are a lot of people who are 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.420

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.950
