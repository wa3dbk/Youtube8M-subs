 You can create maps and aircraft, and this is a tool that developers used to use 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.020
 That's also how Thunder highest it with the delivery to the tester

 Asset Pure can create all 3d models in the game such as buildings 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:44.000
 Will these three players be in the age of making games? 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 What a great game you can do with free online games 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.030
 If you make quality things to it , it will be part of the benefits that you could officially add as in-game content 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.720
 There are also cases where you can chair a developer 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:01.690
 Is this the next generation game? 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:08.080
 I'm looking forward to the future and this time I will be explaining about Mission Editor 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:13.570
 Tutorial Do's description of the place that are known at the moment because there is still an unknown body 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 There is no information yet because the English version cdk wiki has just been created. 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.430
 A rich Russian cd background 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.470
 1 I use it somehow while watching the advice of the forum 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:29.390
 It is in the certain Thunder folder Well First of all I'm playing method of a user mission 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:34.820
 Put the downloaded file in the user mission folder and start 某 Thunder 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.730
 User missions, and if user missions are added, player aircraft 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:42.030
 In possession of 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:45.180
 It is confirmed that it will be a flow of assault Even if you do not possess the expectation 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.080
 It looks like there are missions you can play 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.330
 You're able to easily 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:58.150
 You can play user missions with ease now it's still an offline mission but in the future 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:02:01.810
 It seems to be able to enjoy the created mission and custom battle in multiplayer 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:07.100
 There is no what Yarawakan what too much longer many things terrible 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:11.930
 Mission Hatchmecha 6-speed mission based on historical facts to be enjoyed on the grandchild line 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:18.020
 Explanation of the mission editor itself starts with the fact that it will be 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.040
 Oops, there is something to be said in the moment at the moment the steam all-rounder is cdk 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.480
 I can not use it 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.090
 I get an error for some reason cdk wiki is getting better 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:33.150
 It will be usable if official correspondence corresponds, but is still 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.620
 The immediately mission Editta in the name of be careful when you use ze often still unclear 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.640
 Let's open it 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:47.080
 First of all, it 's divided into four screens like this in the initial setting , so the upper left dragon 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.819
 You always this view easier to see and this way I got to the selected limb 1 viewport 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.219
 I'm doing in the setting 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:57.579
 Map UK should be 3d on the screen by default . 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:03:03.400
 You can place a lot of unit while looking at the map 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:07.329
 But for the three modes that's it then in the upper left feeling that the setting of the mission 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.810
 First to the left of the picture for the Ronmen In this mode 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.010
 Map location displayed 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.410
 You can set preferences for the weather time zone 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.459
 For the next middle of the mission Editta you can set about, such as the sun 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:28.830
 Basically, I will do tasks such as creating a mission here 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:34.890
 Finally, you can change the map displayed on the screen here for the screen view. 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:41.340
 As a method , select the upper left set level bin and also select this part 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:44.700
 A list of map files will be displayed. Select which map you want to open here and open ok 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.860
 If you select it, the map will be displayed. 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.180
 Now the mode is about creating missions that matter 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.500
 Return the mode to Mission Edit The most important thing is 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.400
 There's a lot of modes everywhere just the way you move the viewpoint 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.720
 But before that, about viewpoint movement by default setting 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:10.420
 Move mouse while pressing mouse wheel 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:17.410
 If you do, you can move the viewpoint. If you hold the alt, you can move the angle. 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:23.410
 Next is the viewpoint movement mode, but when you look at the toolbar, there are four viewpoint modes. 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.710
 The fly model is where you can move the viewpoint in the same way as the replay screen 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.389
 About to be good 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:35.960
 The next fps mode to adjust with c is as its name 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:38.840
 The point of view is fixed on the ground and you can walk around in fps mode then in tps mode 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.460
 The last thing is just tps 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.700
 I do not know the last car mode I am sorry but 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.120
 The speed of viewpoint movement 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:56.250
 In such a slow time, hold down the control key and move the viewpoint in the above procedure. 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 As the viewpoint movement speed goes up Another way to do that is on the menu bar 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.360
 Choose a setting, select the top camera, and battle the old camera move figures 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 To give to 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:14.440
 Movement of the point of view goes up , try adjusting it in various ways 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:17.970
 That's the end of the whole story. Next is about mission creation. 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.970
 Thank you for your viewing
