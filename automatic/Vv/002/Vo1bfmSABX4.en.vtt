over<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.370> bar<00:00:42.610> not<00:00:43.360> straight<00:00:43.809> but<00:00:43.840> almost

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
over the bar not straight but almost

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.080

over you pull your feet to kind of get

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.660 
over you pull your feet to kind of get
to<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.989> other<00:00:50.110> side<00:00:50.380> so<00:00:50.590> it's<00:00:50.739> kind<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.010> it's<00:00:51.579> a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
to the other side so it's kind of it's a

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.490 
to the other side so it's kind of it's a
little<00:00:51.880> bit<00:00:51.970> cheeky<00:00:52.180> but<00:00:52.480> it<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> lot<00:00:53.110> easier

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
little bit cheeky but it is a lot easier

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.740 
little bit cheeky but it is a lot easier
to<00:00:53.620> do<00:00:53.739> and<00:00:53.890> if<00:00:53.980> you've<00:00:54.070> never<00:00:54.280> tried<00:00:54.760> any<00:00:55.090> of

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
to do and if you've never tried any of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.360 
to do and if you've never tried any of
these<00:00:55.899> kind<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.320> moves<00:00:56.500> outside<00:00:56.950> then<00:00:57.190> it's

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
these kind of moves outside then it's

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.799 
these kind of moves outside then it's
it's<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.670> great<00:00:57.910> one<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.090> start<00:00:58.420> with<00:00:58.480> instead

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
it's a great one to start with instead

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.780 
it's a great one to start with instead
of<00:00:58.930> going<00:00:59.110> for<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.440> full<00:00:59.649> joint<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.280> I'm<00:01:00.670> going

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
of going for the full joint so I'm going

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.670 
of going for the full joint so I'm going
to<00:01:00.850> show<00:01:00.969> you<00:01:01.000> how<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.180> do<00:01:01.420> those<00:01:01.630> step<00:01:02.320> by<00:01:02.440> step

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
to show you how to do those step by step

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
on your arms and then you're just kind

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.469 
on your arms and then you're just kind
of<00:01:14.229> like<00:01:14.410> your<00:01:15.310> midsection<00:01:15.640> just<00:01:16.000> rests<00:01:16.360> on

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
of like your midsection just rests on

the bar so then what you want to do is

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.130 
the bar so then what you want to do is
the<00:01:18.490> more<00:01:18.729> power<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.750> into<00:01:19.990> this

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
the more power you can get into this

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.750 
the more power you can get into this
move<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.619> better<00:01:20.799> because<00:01:21.010> if<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.549> kind

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
move the better because if you just kind

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.880 
move the better because if you just kind
of<00:01:21.790> like<00:01:21.940> pop<00:01:22.210> away<00:01:22.479> softly<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.260> then<00:01:23.350> you're

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
of like pop away softly and then you're

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.039 
of like pop away softly and then you're
only<00:01:24.010> dropping<00:01:24.400> from<00:01:24.729> down<00:01:25.060> at<00:01:25.270> like<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> 45

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.600 
only dropping from down at like a 45
degree<00:01:26.229> angle<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:26.830> kind<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.280> don't<00:01:27.520> have

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
degree angle you kind of don't have

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.420 
degree angle you kind of don't have
enough<00:01:28.000> momentum<00:01:28.659> in<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.290> swing<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:30.400> I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430

almost<00:01:35.260> high<00:01:35.560> as<00:01:35.619> I<00:01:35.860> can

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
almost high as I can

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.280 
almost high as I can
some<00:01:36.760> people<00:01:37.030> go<00:01:37.180> up<00:01:37.330> into<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.659> handstand<00:01:38.049> and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
some people go up into a handstand and

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.960 
some people go up into a handstand and
let<00:01:38.590> that<00:01:38.770> use<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.340> know<00:01:39.460> kind<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.760> let<00:01:39.880> all

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
let that use you know kind of let all

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.940 
let that use you know kind of let all
the<00:01:40.030> momentum<00:01:40.420> come<00:01:40.630> from<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.020> but<00:01:41.260> I<00:01:41.470> kind

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the momentum come from that but I kind

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.740 
the momentum come from that but I kind
of<00:01:42.010> like<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.280> just<00:01:42.490> kick<00:01:42.670> out<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:43.090> little<00:01:43.479> bit

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
of like to just kick out a little bit

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.359 
of like to just kick out a little bit
above<00:01:43.990> horizontal<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.009> gives<00:01:45.250> me

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
above horizontal and that gives me

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.060 
above horizontal and that gives me
enough<00:01:45.670> speed<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.420> kind<00:01:46.630> of<00:01:46.750> get<00:01:47.290> up<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.740> over

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
enough speed to kind of get up and over

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.460 
enough speed to kind of get up and over
the<00:01:48.189> bar<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.670> that's<00:01:49.570> kind<00:01:49.840> of<00:01:49.900> like<00:01:50.110> that's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
the bar so that's kind of like that's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.050 
the bar so that's kind of like that's
the<00:01:50.650> mechanics<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.340> for<00:01:51.520> me<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.790> then<00:01:51.909> I'll

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
the mechanics of it for me and then I'll

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.630 
the mechanics of it for me and then I'll
um<00:01:52.299> I'll<00:01:52.659> take<00:01:52.930> you<00:01:53.049> through

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
um I'll take you through

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.020 
um I'll take you through
or<00:01:54.300> detail<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:56.040> once<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.430> up<00:01:56.550> on<00:01:56.730> the<00:01:56.760> bar

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
or detail so once you're up on the bar

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.630 
or detail so once you're up on the bar
this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.290> an<00:01:58.410> example<00:01:58.650> off<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.190> cast<00:01:59.460> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
this is that an example off the cast I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.610 
this is that an example off the cast I
won't<00:01:59.820> go<00:01:59.940> for<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.210> thing<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:01.230> kick<00:02:01.500> your

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
won't go for the thing but you kick your

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.980 
won't go for the thing but you kick your
legs<00:02:01.680> out<00:02:02.070> higher<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.360> warm<00:02:03.750> swing<00:02:05.990> okay

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
legs out higher and then warm swing okay

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.450 
legs out higher and then warm swing okay
so<00:02:07.050> once<00:02:07.350> you've<00:02:07.500> got<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.740> once<00:02:08.220> you've<00:02:08.340> got

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
so once you've got your once you've got

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.219 
so once you've got your once you've got
your<00:02:08.490> cast<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.300> nice<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.750> powerful<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
your cast like nice and powerful and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
your cast like nice and powerful and
you're<00:02:10.350> feeling<00:02:10.740> yourself<00:02:10.860> come<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.430> high

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you're feeling yourself come up high

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400 
you're feeling yourself come up high
then<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.750> need<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.990> go<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.200> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
then you just need to go for it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.070 
then you just need to go for it
basically<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.910> technique<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.570> it<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.840> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
basically and the technique to it is is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.480 
basically and the technique to it is is
once<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.410> kick<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.160> come<00:02:17.430> over

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
once you kick out and you come over

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.000 
once you kick out and you come over
you've<00:02:18.030> got<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.320> once<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you've got to think of it like once you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.699 
you've got to think of it like once you
get<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.310> legs<00:02:20.520> up<00:02:20.790> here<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:22.110> that's<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
get your legs up here then that's the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.140 
get your legs up here then that's the
kind<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.980> point<00:02:23.220> where<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.520> bend<00:02:23.880> them<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
kind of point where you bend them and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
kind of point where you bend them and
you<00:02:24.209> try<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.420> tuck<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> bring<00:02:26.010> them<00:02:26.100> pass

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
you try to tuck them and bring them pass

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
you try to tuck them and bring them pass
the<00:02:26.730> bar<00:02:26.940> at<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.300> angle<00:02:27.780> instead<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.440> trying

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the bar at this angle instead of trying

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.040 
the bar at this angle instead of trying
to<00:02:28.709> go<00:02:28.800> all<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.280> way<00:02:29.310> over<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:30.060> try<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:30.900> of

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
to go all the way over I try to kind of

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.930 
to go all the way over I try to kind of
bring<00:02:31.200> my<00:02:31.350> legs<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.070> here<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.459> pull

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
bring my legs up and as I'm here I pull

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.420 
bring my legs up and as I'm here I pull
myself<00:02:33.150> into<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> bar<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.320> I've<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.220> kind

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
myself into the bar and I've and I kind

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
myself into the bar and I've and I kind
of<00:02:35.489> almost<00:02:35.610> frost<00:02:36.030> my<00:02:36.209> legs<00:02:36.420> shoot<00:02:36.690> them<00:02:36.900> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
of almost frost my legs shoot them this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
of almost frost my legs shoot them this
side<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> bar<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.120> case<00:02:39.300> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
side of the bar so in that case it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.910 
side of the bar so in that case it
creates<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> whole<00:02:40.080> circle<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> you've<00:02:40.709> made

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
creates the whole circle and you've made

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920 
creates the whole circle and you've made
it<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.220> you'll<00:02:41.820> see<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.239> my<00:02:42.330> technique<00:02:42.720> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it so you'll see it in my technique that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.449 
it so you'll see it in my technique that
it<00:02:43.020> doesn't<00:02:43.290> go<00:02:43.380> all<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.800> way<00:02:43.830> over<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
it doesn't go all the way over but it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.220 
it doesn't go all the way over but it
comes<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
comes up and then as I get to here I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.630 
comes up and then as I get to here I
kind<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.560> pull<00:02:46.770> myself<00:02:47.130> into<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> bar<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
kind of pull myself into the bar and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.130 
kind of pull myself into the bar and
shoot<00:02:47.820> my<00:02:47.940> body<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.570> legs<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.930> everything

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
shoot my body in my legs and everything

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.600 
shoot my body in my legs and everything
to<00:02:49.410> this<00:02:49.560> side<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.950> bar<00:02:50.100> so<00:02:50.250> I've<00:02:50.340> kind<00:02:50.580> of

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
to this side of the bar so I've kind of

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.400 
to this side of the bar so I've kind of
made<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> full<00:02:51.030> rotation<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.110> now<00:02:52.230> we'll<00:02:52.380> have

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
made the full rotation so now we'll have

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.780 
made the full rotation so now we'll have
a<00:02:52.560> look<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> I'll<00:02:53.100> show<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> how<00:02:53.430> how<00:02:53.760> I

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
a look at it and I'll show you how how I

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:11.200 
a look at it and I'll show you how how I
do

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.390 

that's<00:03:12.210> how<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.840> baby<00:03:13.260> giant<00:03:13.710> my<00:03:14.250> name

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that's how you do a baby giant my name

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.400 
that's how you do a baby giant my name
