everything so when you click on all

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.170 
everything so when you click on all
applications<00:03:05.989> for<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.260> first<00:03:06.470> time<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:07.430> can

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
applications for the first time it can

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.960 
applications for the first time it can
freeze<00:03:08.870> for<00:03:09.260> like<00:03:09.800> one<00:03:10.220> second<00:03:10.700> or<00:03:10.820> two

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
freeze for like one second or two

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
applications when you do that second

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.600 
applications when you do that second
time<00:03:16.550> there<00:03:17.360> will<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.660> no<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:19.280> won't<00:03:19.459> be

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
time there will be no you won't be

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.300 
time there will be no you won't be
writing<00:03:21.790> ok<00:03:23.290> let's<00:03:24.290> look<00:03:24.350> at<00:03:24.530> click<00:03:25.040> on<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
writing ok let's look at click on the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.259 
writing ok let's look at click on the
third<00:03:25.550> and<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.800> good<00:03:27.800> all<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.640> time<00:03:28.940> you

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
third and I can good all the time you

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.100 
third and I can good all the time you
can<00:03:29.330> wait<00:03:29.600> so<00:03:29.930> about<00:03:30.410> one<00:03:30.680> second<00:03:31.190> because<00:03:31.700> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
can wait so about one second because the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.479 
can wait so about one second because the
application<00:03:33.110> have<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.470> calculate<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.459> find

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
application have to calculate and find

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.660 
application have to calculate and find
all<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.180> applications<00:03:35.540> running<00:03:36.430> ok<00:03:37.430> and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
all the applications running ok and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.660 
all the applications running ok and
that's<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:38.540> that's<00:03:39.610> these<00:03:40.610> are<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.910> basics
