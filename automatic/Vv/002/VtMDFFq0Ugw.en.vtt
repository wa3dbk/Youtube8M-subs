this problem let's look at it together

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.910 
this problem let's look at it together
it's<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.299> cool<00:01:39.720> because<00:01:39.930> then<00:01:40.380> when<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's really cool because then when the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
it's really cool because then when the
kids<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.460> finished<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.510> these<00:01:42.630> students

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
entire class into a football field and

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.420 
entire class into a football field and
the<00:02:49.000> kids<00:02:49.239> love<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.260> students<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:50.920> try

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the kids love it the students then try

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
the kids love it the students then try
to<00:02:51.489> answer<00:02:51.700> question<00:02:52.209> number<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:52.690> if<00:02:53.170> they

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
to answer question number one if they

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.500 
to answer question number one if they
get<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> correct<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:54.400> get<00:02:54.549> a<00:02:54.580> roller<00:02:54.820> died<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
get it correct and get a roller died and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.479 
get it correct and get a roller died and
that<00:02:55.810> would<00:02:55.989> tell<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.350> how<00:02:56.470> many<00:02:56.530> yards<00:02:57.040> they

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
that would tell them how many yards they

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.400 
that would tell them how many yards they
get<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.820> travel<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.750> more<00:02:58.959> questions<00:02:59.350> they

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
get to travel the more questions they

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.110 
get to travel the more questions they
get<00:02:59.620> right<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.280> more<00:03:00.430> chance<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:00.940> get<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
get right the more chance they get to

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.030 
get right the more chance they get to
roll<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.780> therefore<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.350> farther<00:03:02.650> they<00:03:02.830> go

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
roll and therefore the farther they go

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.860 
roll and therefore the farther they go
when<00:03:03.670> they<00:03:03.760> finally<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.420> other<00:03:04.570> side

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
when they finally get to the other side

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.690 
when they finally get to the other side
they<00:03:05.350> throw<00:03:05.590> their<00:03:05.769> hands<00:03:06.010> up<00:03:06.190> they<00:03:06.370> score<00:03:06.670> a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
they throw their hands up they score a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.759 
they throw their hands up they score a
touchdown<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.510> it<00:03:07.720> is<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> great<00:03:08.019> way<00:03:08.140> for<00:03:08.170> the

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
touchdown and it is a great way for the

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:09.960 
touchdown and it is a great way for the
class<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.190> review<00:03:09.549> important<00:03:09.940> information

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
