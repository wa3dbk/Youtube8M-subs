00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
having bits in their scones so I'm not

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.449 
having bits in their scones so I'm not
going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.760> with<00:03:20.880> these<00:03:21.860> and<00:03:22.860> then<00:03:23.190> at

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
going to do that with these and then at

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.039 
going to do that with these and then at
this<00:03:23.579> point<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.000> would<00:03:24.150> put<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.540> oven<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
this point you would put the oven on and

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.000 
this point you would put the oven on and
make<00:03:25.170> sure<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.470> you've<00:03:25.590> got<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.829> oven

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
make sure that you've got the oven

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.310 
make sure that you've got the oven
really<00:03:26.400> really<00:03:26.970> hot<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.540> needs<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:28.049> on

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
really really hot so it needs to be on

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.819 
really really hot so it needs to be on
at<00:03:29.090> 220<00:03:30.090> degrees<00:03:30.120> which<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.690> 200<00:03:31.320> degrees<00:03:31.590> for

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
at 220 degrees which is 200 degrees for

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.520 
at 220 degrees which is 200 degrees for
a<00:03:31.860> fan<00:03:32.100> oven<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:33.060> place<00:03:33.360> some<00:03:34.200> baking

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
a fan oven and you place some baking

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.310 
a fan oven and you place some baking
sheets<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.370> oven<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.540> make<00:03:36.720> sure<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.140> get

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
sheets in the oven to make sure they get

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.530 
sheets in the oven to make sure they get
hot<00:03:37.620> before<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.220> place<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.850> scones<00:03:39.090> onto

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
hot before you place the scones onto

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.960 
hot before you place the scones onto
them<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.620> normally<00:03:41.070> put<00:03:41.220> two<00:03:41.459> in<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.670> oven

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
them so I normally put two in the oven

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.729 
them so I normally put two in the oven
get<00:03:42.540> them<00:03:42.690> really<00:03:42.840> hot<00:03:43.079> I'm<00:03:43.320> not<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.620> put

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
get them really hot I'm not going to put

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.080 
get them really hot I'm not going to put
the<00:03:43.829> oven<00:03:43.920> on<00:03:44.100> because<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.640> makes<00:03:44.670> some<00:03:45.060> really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the oven on because it makes some really

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.610 
the oven on because it makes some really
loud<00:03:45.870> noise<00:03:46.820> that's<00:03:47.820> what<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> would<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.620> and

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
loud noise that's what I would do and

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.170 
loud noise that's what I would do and
then<00:03:49.829> while<00:03:50.040> they're<00:03:50.220> heating<00:03:50.549> up<00:03:50.700> we<00:03:50.940> carry

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
then while they're heating up we carry

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.259 
then while they're heating up we carry
on<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.540> make<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.049> scones<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:54.000> add

on and make the scones so you just add

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.610

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
ingredients and here the key is not to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.340 
ingredients and here the key is not to
over<00:04:07.019> mix<00:04:07.370> so<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.640> with<00:04:08.880> your<00:04:09.350> fingertips
