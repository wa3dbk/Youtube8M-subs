00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
use one packet like our sugar base for

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.560 
use one packet like our sugar base for
the<00:02:36.420> eye<00:02:38.640> once<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> gets<00:02:39.910> solid<00:02:40.150> enough<00:02:40.420> you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570
