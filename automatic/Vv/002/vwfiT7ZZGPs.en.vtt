00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:12.100
 It's a great time to watch the spring tide and the Naruto Channel whirlpool 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:18.400
 I went to see a whirlpool on board a tide boat today 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.090
 It is Uzushio observation boat stand today It is fine and many people are visiting for whirlpool watching 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.670
 I will 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.670
 I also think that I want to look at the diagram there is powerful 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:33.120
 The time when the largest whirlpool can be seen today is around noon 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:39.020
 I boarded at 11 am with a large number of tourists 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.020
 It is the appreciation point of the whirlpool in about 10 minutes after leaving 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 Please try going right below today when it is amazing 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 I'm rolling you are so close 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.340
 You can see it, it's powerful 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.500
 Naruto whirlpool is due to the tide 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:07.820
 It is born by the difference of the tide level with the Seto Inland Sea and hearing water supply 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 When it becomes a large vortex, it seems to be 20m in diameter 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.860
 Amazing nature is amazing 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.330
 The power of nature is business 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.130
 I can't put a ball on the grain or back 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:33.260
 About amai issue 50 I am 53 years old 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:39.230
 I remember the very old days I was looking at when I was in high school 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.400
 Marriage to go out of alignment So it's a 50-year Agerutsu 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.670
 Before Tokyo 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.120
 Were you 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.050

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.580
 I was impressed 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:03.530
 A lot of the flow of the tide, but large eddy did not see that there is powerful due strong wind today 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.530
 I was able to see the mortar 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.260
 Naruto's whirlpools are the best view of the tides
