00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
and snow should cause less lag I think
that<00:01:57.270> was<00:01:57.420> building<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.990> building<00:01:58.229> I'm<00:01:58.409> that's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that was building a building I'm that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.200 
that was building a building I'm that's
a<00:01:58.770> really<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.189> good<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.969> lag

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
a really really good one because the lag

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.630 
a really really good one because the lag
that's<00:02:00.990> very<00:02:01.079> very<00:02:01.530> key<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:01.920> they<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.219> fix<00:02:02.369> any

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
that's very very key if they can fix any

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
that's very very key if they can fix any
lag<00:02:02.909> anywhere<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:03.990> very<00:02:04.140> key<00:02:04.350> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
lag anywhere that's very very key so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
lag anywhere that's very very key so
let's<00:02:04.649> talk<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.829> built-in<00:02:05.460> villagers

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
let's talk about built-in villagers

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.990 
let's talk about built-in villagers
always<00:02:07.020> become<00:02:07.439> zombie<00:02:07.829> villagers<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.489> hard

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
always become zombie villagers in hard

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
always become zombie villagers in hard
difficulty<00:02:09.599> internment<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.619> boy<00:02:10.860> water<00:02:11.250> only

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
difficulty internment of boy water only

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.050 
difficulty internment of boy water only
uses<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> lead

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
uses the lead

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.120 
uses the lead
keeps<00:02:13.180> coloring<00:02:13.630> shaders<00:02:14.050> when<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> color

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
keeps coloring shaders when the color

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.089 
keeps coloring shaders when the color
for<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.580> biome<00:02:16.030> actually<00:02:16.630> changes<00:02:17.200> perk

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
for the biome actually changes perk

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.690 
for the biome actually changes perk
increase<00:02:18.760> only<00:02:19.750> samples<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.980> light<00:02:21.340> matte

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
increase only samples the light matte

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.690 
increase only samples the light matte
texture<00:02:22.300> for<00:02:22.690> non<00:02:22.959> transparent<00:02:23.590> pixels<00:02:24.130> and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
texture for non transparent pixels and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.970 
texture for non transparent pixels and
last<00:02:25.239> but<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.480> least<00:02:25.540> they<00:02:26.050> update<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.590> sound

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
last but not least they update it sound

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.830 
last but not least they update it sound
so<00:02:27.160> let's<00:02:27.340> talk<00:02:27.459> about<00:02:27.520> build<00:02:27.940> 11<00:02:28.209> which<00:02:28.690> this

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
so let's talk about build 11 which this

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
so let's talk about build 11 which this
was<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.260> released<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.069> this<00:02:30.220> will<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
was just released so this will be the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.570 
was just released so this will be the
last<00:02:30.880> actually<00:02:31.690> built<00:02:32.019> like<00:02:32.349> name<00:02:33.099> off<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
last actually built like name off that I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.550 
last actually built like name off that I
will<00:02:33.819> be<00:02:33.910> doing<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.390> I'm<00:02:34.690> hoping<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.380> this

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
will be doing now I'm hoping that this

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.589 
will be doing now I'm hoping that this
is<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.800> last<00:02:36.040> bill<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:36.790> I'm<00:02:37.000> not<00:02:37.300> quite<00:02:37.569> sure

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
is the last bill but I'm not quite sure

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.479 
is the last bill but I'm not quite sure
that<00:02:38.170> could<00:02:38.380> be<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.530> possibility<00:02:38.680> we<00:02:39.220> get

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
that could be a possibility we get

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.710 
that could be a possibility we get
actually<00:02:39.790> another<00:02:40.000> bill<00:02:40.269> before<00:02:40.480> they

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
actually another bill before they

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.020 
actually another bill before they
actually<00:02:40.870> released<00:02:41.260> zero-point<00:02:41.980> 12.0<00:02:42.610> they

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
actually released zero-point 12.0 they

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.100 
actually released zero-point 12.0 they
did<00:02:43.209> say<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.540> we're<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.810> try<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.959> get

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
did say that we're going to try to get

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.440 
did say that we're going to try to get
this<00:02:44.230> out<00:02:44.349> August<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.010> we'll<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.299> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450
