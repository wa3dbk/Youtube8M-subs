beasts are going out there rather to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.670 
beasts are going out there rather to

he's going all over the place with these
two<00:02:16.659> goons<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:17.439> think<00:02:18.069> he<00:02:18.129> took<00:02:18.280> most<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.909> his

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
two goons I think he took most of his

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.699 
two goons I think he took most of his
goons<00:02:19.329> off<00:02:19.719> of<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:21.569> off<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.170> top<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.439> his

goons off of the off of the top of his
main<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.549> look<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:24.909> that<00:02:25.060> scouting<00:02:25.989> why<00:02:26.739> not

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
main to look for that scouting why not

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.009 
main to look for that scouting why not
scouting<00:02:27.340> but<00:02:27.549> uh<00:02:27.579> just<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.659> regular<00:02:29.079> Protoss

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
brain is off today and it looks like

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.429 
brain is off today and it looks like
best<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.909> going<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.299> take<00:02:37.480> his<00:02:37.959> expansion

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
best is going to take his expansion

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.099 
best is going to take his expansion

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
hovering around waiting to put down the

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.009 
hovering around waiting to put down the
Nexus<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:45.340> comes<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.669> Nexus<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.269> looks<00:02:46.930> like

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
Nexus here comes the Nexus so looks like

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.569 
Nexus here comes the Nexus so looks like
we<00:02:47.290> are<00:02:47.409> seeing<00:02:47.709> different<00:02:48.069> strategies<00:02:48.459> from

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
we are seeing different strategies from

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.879 
we are seeing different strategies from
both<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.060> thought<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.230> would<00:02:50.439> come<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:50.829> to

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
both I thought that would come down to

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.979 
both I thought that would come down to
AG<00:02:51.370> goon<00:02:51.579> Reever<00:02:52.239> battle<00:02:52.540> in<00:02:52.659> the<00:02:52.780> middle

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
AG goon Reever battle in the middle

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.220 
AG goon Reever battle in the middle
after<00:02:53.650> all<00:02:53.829> looks<00:02:54.609> like<00:02:54.760> bc<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.180> chasing<00:02:55.750> this

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
after all looks like bc is chasing this

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.959 
after all looks like bc is chasing this
observer<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:56.889> his<00:02:57.040> own<00:02:57.159> observer<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.730> he<00:02:57.819> can

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
observer with his own observer so he can

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.420 
observer with his own observer so he can
take<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.180> down<00:02:59.040> probably<00:03:00.040> not<00:03:00.189> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> be

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
take it down probably not going to be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.949 
take it down probably not going to be
able<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.730> ollie<00:03:00.879> does<00:03:01.329> take<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.719> down<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.939> this

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
able to ollie does take it down so this

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.069 
able to ollie does take it down so this
wow<00:03:04.959> that<00:03:05.590> observer<00:03:05.919> barely<00:03:06.700> within<00:03:07.569> range<00:03:07.900> of

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
wow that observer barely within range of

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.420 
wow that observer barely within range of
the<00:03:08.139> other<00:03:08.349> observers<00:03:08.859> so<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.189> looks<00:03:09.370> like

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the other observers so it looks like

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.059 
the other observers so it looks like
these<00:03:09.700> who<00:03:09.849> did<00:03:10.030> take<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.389> down<00:03:10.599> but<00:03:11.439> best<00:03:11.709> he

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
these who did take that down but best he

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.259 
these who did take that down but best he
doesn't<00:03:12.340> even<00:03:12.400> care<00:03:12.519> he's<00:03:12.819> coming<00:03:13.060> down<00:03:13.150> with

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
doesn't even care he's coming down with

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.059 
doesn't even care he's coming down with
his<00:03:13.419> army<00:03:13.659> right<00:03:13.840> now<00:03:13.989> he's<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.889> try<00:03:15.040> to

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
his army right now he's going to try to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.399 
his army right now he's going to try to
put<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.579> pressure<00:03:15.879> while<00:03:16.659> be<00:03:16.959> soo<00:03:17.169> has

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
put on some pressure while be soo has

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.110 
put on some pressure while be soo has
his<00:03:17.769> Reaper<00:03:18.609> out<00:03:18.760> sooner<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.370> I'm<00:03:21.849> not<00:03:22.000> sure

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
his Reaper out sooner and I'm not sure

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.420 
his Reaper out sooner and I'm not sure
what's<00:03:22.329> in<00:03:22.449> that<00:03:22.629> shuttle<00:03:22.989> from<00:03:23.260> best<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.889> he

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
what's in that shuttle from best I he

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.969 
what's in that shuttle from best I he
must<00:03:24.669> have<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.849> river<00:03:25.120> in<00:03:25.239> there<00:03:25.510> but<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.139> think

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
must have a river in there but I think

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.920 
must have a river in there but I think
he's<00:03:27.099> going<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.340> use<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.699> to<00:03:27.729> her<00:03:28.419> ass<00:03:28.599> right

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
he's going to use it to her ass right

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.719 
he's going to use it to her ass right
now<00:03:29.109> even<00:03:29.889> though<00:03:29.979> it<00:03:30.069> might<00:03:30.189> not<00:03:30.340> be<00:03:30.400> too

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
now even though it might not be too

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.550 
now even though it might not be too
successful<00:03:31.269> since<00:03:31.479> bc<00:03:31.870> was<00:03:31.989> kind<00:03:32.229> of<00:03:32.319> hovering
