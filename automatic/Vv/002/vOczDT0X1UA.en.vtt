a 2-point 16f color si tu and you see

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:34.779 
a 2-point 16f color si tu and you see
this<00:01:32.689> timing<00:01:33.109> kind<00:01:33.380> of<00:01:33.499> resembles<00:01:34.069> more<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.639> in

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
this timing kind of resembles more so in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.300 
this timing kind of resembles more so in
appearance<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.420> first<00:01:35.749> one<00:01:36.020> but<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.889> is<00:01:37.009> cut

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
appearance the first one but it is cut

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.760 
appearance the first one but it is cut
slightly<00:01:37.939> different<00:01:38.569> with<00:01:38.749> shorter<00:01:39.409> lo

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
slightly different with shorter lo

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.279 
slightly different with shorter lo
girdle<00:01:40.159> facet<00:01:40.579> length<00:01:40.789> or<00:01:41.420> more<00:01:41.840> common<00:01:42.259> that

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
girdle facet length or more common that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.809 
girdle facet length or more common that
we<00:01:42.409> see<00:01:42.679> in<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.829> haunt<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.310> know<00:01:43.459> in<00:01:43.639> the

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
we see in the haunt you know in the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.170 
we see in the haunt you know in the
traditional<00:01:44.359> hearts<00:01:44.659> and<00:01:44.810> arrows<00:01:44.899> category

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.150 

so<00:01:50.180> all<00:01:50.330> these<00:01:50.480> diamonds<00:01:50.800> slightly<00:01:51.800> different

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
so all these diamonds slightly different

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.790 
so all these diamonds slightly different
personalities<00:01:56.050> probably<00:01:57.050> if<00:01:57.200> anything<00:01:57.620> you'd

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
personalities probably if anything you'd

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.470 
personalities probably if anything you'd
see<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.070> more<00:01:58.250> notable<00:01:58.490> difference<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.300> in

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
see the more notable difference here in

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.740 
see the more notable difference here in
your<00:01:59.750> brightness<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.560> contrast<00:02:01.450> between<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
your brightness and contrast between the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.640 
your brightness and contrast between the
three<00:02:04.450> okay<00:02:05.450> we're<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.350> look<00:02:06.440> at<00:02:06.590> next

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
three okay we're going to look at next

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.639 
three okay we're going to look at next
is<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.340> sparkle<00:02:07.970> pattern<00:02:08.440> next<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.530> these

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
is the sparkle pattern next to these

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.440 
is the sparkle pattern next to these
guys<00:02:09.920> we're<00:02:10.460> going<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.640> put<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.850> sparkle<00:02:11.300> lens

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
guys we're going to put the sparkle lens

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.970 
guys we're going to put the sparkle lens
on<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.690> camera<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.260> look<00:02:12.350> at<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> sparkle

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
on the camera and look at the sparkle

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.380 
on the camera and look at the sparkle
difference<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.700> I'm<00:02:13.850> going<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.090> look<00:02:14.180> at<00:02:14.300> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
difference is I'm going to look at it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.270 
difference is I'm going to look at it
into<00:02:14.630> stronger<00:02:15.110> spotlighting<00:02:15.710> for<00:02:15.980> more

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
into stronger spotlighting for more

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.250 
into stronger spotlighting for more
elements<00:02:16.910> of<00:02:17.030> fire<00:02:19.150> okay<00:02:20.150> here<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:20.780> aren't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
elements of fire okay here we aren't

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.190 
elements of fire okay here we aren't
looking<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.190> little<00:02:23.120> weaker<00:02:23.450> spotlighting

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
looking in a little weaker spotlighting

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.260 
looking in a little weaker spotlighting
for<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.620> sparkle<00:02:25.220> factors<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:25.910> each<00:02:26.030> one<00:02:26.209> of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
for the sparkle factors in each one of

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:35.250 
for the sparkle factors in each one of
these<00:02:26.420> guys

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.930 

it's<00:02:36.260> pretty<00:02:36.440> tough<00:02:36.739> both<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.220> these<00:02:37.310> got<00:02:37.849> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
it's pretty tough both of these got it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.979 
it's pretty tough both of these got it
going<00:02:38.209> on<00:02:38.330> with<00:02:38.569> sparkle

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.509 

the<00:02:44.989> stone<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.409> right<00:02:45.620> also<00:02:45.829> has<00:02:46.189> long

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
the stone on the right also has long

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.500 
the stone on the right also has long
lower<00:02:46.819> girdle<00:02:47.269> facet<00:02:47.719> length<00:02:49.359> so<00:02:50.359> it's

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
lower girdle facet length so it's
