naturalistic stagnant pond it is a very
easy<00:03:02.909> task<00:03:03.329> once<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.109> get<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.379> hang<00:03:04.409> of<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
easy task once you get the hang of it

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.490 
easy task once you get the hang of it
what<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:05.940> will<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.629> pick<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.930> small<00:03:07.230> enough

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
what you will do is pick a small enough

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.649 
what you will do is pick a small enough
piece<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.980> wood<00:03:08.220> make<00:03:09.060> sure<00:03:09.329> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.629> a

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
piece of wood make sure it is a

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.140 
piece of wood make sure it is a
sufficient<00:03:10.230> size<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.190> may<00:03:11.400> make<00:03:11.909> a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
sufficient size so that you may make a

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.930 
sufficient size so that you may make a
wide<00:03:12.510> enough<00:03:12.840> water<00:03:13.170> area<00:03:13.650> for<00:03:14.340> whatever<00:03:14.519> size

wide enough water area for whatever size
frog<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.690> choose<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.139> purchase<00:03:16.669> then<00:03:17.669> take

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
frog you choose to purchase then take

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.319 
frog you choose to purchase then take
your<00:03:18.870> screening<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.680> place<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.730> underneath

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
your screening and place it underneath

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.949 
your screening and place it underneath
the<00:03:21.540> Terra<00:03:22.440> light<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:24.030> make<00:03:24.540> sure<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.870> is

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the Terra light then make sure it is

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.020 
the Terra light then make sure it is
long<00:03:25.200> enough<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.889> come<00:03:26.130> back<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.730> and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
long enough for it to come back up and

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.990 
long enough for it to come back up and
over<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.560> drainage<00:03:29.400> layer<00:03:29.700> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
over so that your drainage layer is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.050 
over so that your drainage layer is
separated<00:03:30.660> from<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.930> substrate<00:03:32.060> placing

and a half to two inches you will

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.110 
and a half to two inches you will
obviously<00:03:52.079> add<00:03:52.739> more<00:03:53.099> once<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.609> decide<00:03:53.970> to
