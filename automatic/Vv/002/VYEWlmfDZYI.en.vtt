00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
we turn this on with this switch out the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.540 
we turn this on with this switch out the
ring<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.870> can<00:02:28.900> hear<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.380> firing<00:02:29.740> up<00:02:30.040> and

then so far that's all we need to do is

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.830 
then so far that's all we need to do is
squeeze<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.560> true<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.340> have<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:34.120> think<00:02:34.600> this

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
squeeze is true so we have I think this

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.510 
squeeze is true so we have I think this
point<00:02:35.110> above<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.680> Darren
