 but no 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.230
 hello friends welcome to a new video 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.810
 of android ash tv so I'll show you a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.840
 very easy way very fast to make a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.960
 small doc or stand for your smartphone 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.820
 this video I found on youtube and it 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.680
 I will show you so that you can achieve 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.689
 you manage to do it you do it from a 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.789
 way the truth very simple and very 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.610
 cheap what we occupy are four 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:38.629
 clips or clips of these that are 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.920
 used for sheets or folders and a 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.040
 tape me in this case 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.159
 I will use a black ribbon on these 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.159
 Brooches are the ones that bend this one 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.480
 he invented this that separate the tips and already 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.310
 is this little brooch try to 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.370
 get it the biggest they can 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.920
 gods but the greatest 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 but come like this and let's start with the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.860
 tutorial before beginning I'll tell you that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.800
 I have tried this docu base with 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.010
 smartphone from 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.620
 5.2 inch screen in my nick 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.470
 its six if I can stand it but until the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.960
 moment to have it put and press it 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.940
 You could go a little bit back so 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.310
 that if you have 5 points 2 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.440
 inches there is so he will hold them well 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.300
 already if you want to try one of older 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.580
 inches can do it and try it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.280
 yourselves now we are going to start 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.410
 let's start preparing these sigma 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.750
 tea not only two that we 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.330
 do simply separate one of those from 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.820
 We separated the metal tips 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.730
 only one and we paste it here is 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.250
 bold so it stays like this 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:52.290
 as you can see it was in this form of l 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.540
 a piece that d'or that recharged that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.190
 black and the other was left floating and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.190
 let's do the same with the other 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.750
 this is how you can see one was left pegadito 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.500
 here something bold and the other was 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.709
 hanging 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.959
 now let's grab the tip of the one that 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.459
 it was hanging and if they have the strength to 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.319
 chuck norris can fold it with their 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 own hands so that the tip is left 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.610
 upwards as you can see stylize 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.280
 a black that gives up the little tip 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 try to bend it like I do right now 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.640
 tired of arms and I do not have the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.960
 Chinese porsche ridgway for a small 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.560
 tweezers and I'll be back in a moment 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.570
 ready as you can see they were left 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.990
 this part of the tip simply 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.780
 lift and also in this it stayed like this 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.060
 lifted now let's go to the next step 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.150
 that are we are going to grab the clues that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.000
 we leave here and can see and these are 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.750
 we open the two until they see 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.700
 totally separate want like this from this 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.170
 way what we are going to do is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.660
 this introduce them 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.660
 in the part is small black back 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.010
 show month 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.049
 we are not going to stay 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.140
 done in this way so 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.530
 and now let's give the other 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.400
 and we are going to open it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.480
 and we are going to introduce it is also in 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.480
 the way in 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.730
 what are you here back 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.730
 the right with the right 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.260
 what 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.810
 and I want, as you can see, 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.280
 this way 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.190
 let's see our friend andy and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.860
 and of course both 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.840
 now let's go to the next good step and 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.690
 now in the last step the simply 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.280
 we have to unite the two parts so that 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.519
 be more 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.680
 more is best grasped me I have 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.680
 here and a few pieces of cut tapes 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.940
 and we are going to paste the ones from here 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.260
 above 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.260
 we have to join them well 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.729
 but so much qatar of the camera 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.260
 I think I want 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.630
 you can put the tape they use 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.660
 I'm not going to wear this and one 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.730
 downstairs 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.730
 besides the very long video 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.470
 we go 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.910
 but we're lucky that transition 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.399
 I like it 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.780
 and they are up just 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.680
 we have to push them to be 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.390
 come down 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.360
 Now let's try it with a motorcycle that 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.370
 I know I have a bike and let's gp 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.040
 try it on our 2 we press for 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.340
 let's go down and how can you see there it works 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.969
 very well accommodate him pressed 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.149
 as you can see we can serve is 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:39.309
 as I told you this screen 5.2 

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:42.899
 This is the first generation motogp 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.899
 the second this 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.440
 they had grabbed him 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.770
 and we can move as you can see well 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.320
 existing pressure does not happen to us like 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.510
 one last hit that I'm going to give him if 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.390
 they want they can tear out another piece of 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.330
 tapes this me in this case the tape 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:05.870
 is insulation helps more because it is a 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.270
 little less does a little more grows if 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.380
 is that the others help me put it 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.380
 in this part of here 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.429
 we put here so this part 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.480
 that remains of the metal does not scratch 

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:25.190
 our devices 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.190
 to start another piece 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.300
 and we are going to put these songs 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.479
 they despair better than me saying yes 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.540
 He was an expert so that they do not make us very 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.960
 long and we finally hit another two 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.680
 pieces 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.680
 never seen 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.070
 and we hit now in the part of here 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.350
 above 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.350
 here he only covered well 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.680
 when he's here , it seems that since 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.680
 do not 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.809
 in this way we will protect a little more 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:17.650
 our device so that we have done 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.650
 achieve there 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.330
 I hope you liked this
