00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:11.299 

I<00:00:09.050> guess<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> did<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> full<00:00:10.530> front<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.860> fox<00:00:11.040> tag

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I guess I did a full front of fox tag

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.070 
I guess I did a full front of fox tag
and<00:00:11.550> today<00:00:11.730> I'm<00:00:11.880> going<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.150> show<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.809> cave

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
and today I'm going to show you the cave

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.990 
and today I'm going to show you the cave
and<00:00:13.259> sooty<00:00:13.530> version<00:00:13.950> two<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.849> see

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
and sooty version two as you can see

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.779 
and sooty version two as you can see
here<00:00:15.240> we<00:00:15.990> are<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> fly<00:00:17.130> video<00:00:17.580> with

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
here we are going to do a fly video with

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.359 
here we are going to do a fly video with
the<00:00:18.029> humanity<00:00:18.990> version<00:00:19.350> 2<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.100> over

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the humanity version 2 and the over

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.970 
the humanity version 2 and the over
cameraman<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> air<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.350> D<00:00:22.590> Drive

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
cameraman in the air is the D Drive

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.519 
cameraman in the air is the D Drive
version<00:00:23.250> class<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.480> I'm<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.720> putting

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
version class and now I'm just putting

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.980 
version class and now I'm just putting
the<00:00:25.710> TJ<00:00:26.099> portion<00:00:26.519> class<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> cave<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> 30%

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the TJ portion class on a cave and 30%

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.769 
the TJ portion class on a cave and 30%
tool<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> size<00:00:29.699> comparison

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
tool so you can do a size comparison

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.959 
tool so you can do a size comparison
vision<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.170> difference<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.399> huge

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
vision and difference is really huge

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.750 
vision and difference is really huge
okay<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.989> under<00:00:34.350> chemistry<00:00:35.130> version<00:00:35.579> 2

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
okay so under chemistry version 2

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.910 
okay so under chemistry version 2
through<00:00:36.239> main<00:00:36.510> difference<00:00:36.989> difference<00:00:37.590> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
through main difference difference and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.030 
through main difference difference and
one<00:00:38.579> difference<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.690> ESC<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.739> which

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
one difference is the ESC which in which

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.209 
one difference is the ESC which in which
in<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> ESD<00:00:41.640> from<00:00:42.059> 40<00:00:42.480> M<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.079> foxtrax<00:00:43.680> motive

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
in the ESD from 40 M to foxtrax motive

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.389 
in the ESD from 40 M to foxtrax motive
health<00:00:44.460> safety<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.450> ESC<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:47.129> we

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
health safety and ESC and also we

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
health safety and ESC and also we
quickly<00:00:47.850> improve<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> motor<00:00:49.110> mount<00:00:49.410> streams

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
quickly improve the motor mount streams

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.910 
quickly improve the motor mount streams
and<00:00:50.190> now<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.030> motor<00:00:51.210> mount<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:52.110> used<00:00:52.739> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and now the motor mount can be used to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.139 
and now the motor mount can be used to
Vista<00:00:53.280> where<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> size<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.780> motors<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
Vista where is a size of motors from the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.740 
Vista where is a size of motors from the
vortex<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> 5<00:00:57.539> 0<00:00:57.570> 8<00:00:58.289> 5<00:00:58.829> 0<00:00:59.160> 10<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> also<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> most

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
vortex to 5 0 8 5 0 10 and also the most

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
vortex to 5 0 8 5 0 10 and also the most
u5<00:01:01.350> u<00:01:01.770> 7<00:01:02.190> +<00:01:02.370> u<00:01:02.640> 8<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.390> even<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> UCAV<00:01:04.589> 11<00:01:05.250> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
u5 u 7 + u 8 and even the UCAV 11 but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
u5 u 7 + u 8 and even the UCAV 11 but
actually<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.140> use<00:01:07.710> em<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
actually if you use use em from the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually if you use use em from the
motor<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.970> 60<00:01:09.630> interpreter<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.979> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
motor with 60 interpreter you can get a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.010 
motor with 60 interpreter you can get a
March<00:01:11.460> improve<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.090> lifting<00:01:12.420> capacity<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
March improve the lifting capacity up to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
March improve the lifting capacity up to
35<00:01:13.799> kilos<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.580> are<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> test<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
35 kilos and if we are going to test it

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.980 
35 kilos and if we are going to test it
later<00:01:15.479> ok<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.430> new<00:01:17.820> yes<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.479> make<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
later ok so the new yes we will make the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.630 
later ok so the new yes we will make the
payments<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.560> aversion<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
payments that aversion to the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
payments that aversion to the
manoeuvrability<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.780> much<00:01:22.049> better<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
manoeuvrability much much better and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
manoeuvrability much much better and
also<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.369> feel<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> control<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.299> much

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
also you can feel the control is much

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.859 
also you can feel the control is much
easier<00:01:25.020> via<00:01:25.439> confirm<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.490> version<00:01:27.060> 1<00:01:27.270> so

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
easier via confirm with the version 1 so

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
easier via confirm with the version 1 so
we<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> live<00:01:29.490> video<00:01:29.640> test<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
we are going to do a live video test of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
we are going to do a live video test of
easy<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.720> please<00:01:31.259> enjoy<00:01:31.500> thanks<00:01:32.130> for

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
easy and please enjoy thanks for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.579 
easy and please enjoy thanks for
watching
