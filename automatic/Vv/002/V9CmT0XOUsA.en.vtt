this<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.670> tell<00:00:29.880> me<00:00:30.029> why<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> make<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:31.109> think

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this so tell me why I make this I think

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.069 
this so tell me why I make this I think
what<00:00:32.430> I've<00:00:32.579> let<00:00:32.759> mostly<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.300> how<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> kind<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
what I've let mostly is how to kind of

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
what I've let mostly is how to kind of
coordinate<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> large<00:00:34.950> group<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> people

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
coordinate like a large group of people

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
coordinate like a large group of people
I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.210> that's<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.500> central<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
I think that's really kind of central to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
I think that's really kind of central to
kind<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> kind<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.170> curate<00:00:40.170> an

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
kind of what it is to kind of curate an

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.780 
kind of what it is to kind of curate an
event<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.890> kind<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.100> collaborate<00:00:41.700> with

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
event and kind of collaborate with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
event and kind of collaborate with
people<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.719> also<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
people and and also the kind of the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.770 
people and and also the kind of the
hierarchies<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.180> state<00:00:45.420> das's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
hierarchies and the kind of state das's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.720 
hierarchies and the kind of state das's
and<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.590> also<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> kind<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> works

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and and also the way that kind of works

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
and and also the way that kind of works
kind<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> collide<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.260> connect<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
kind of collide and connect and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.049 
kind of collide and connect and
disconnect<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.309> each<00:00:50.430> other<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> think<00:00:50.940> it's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
disconnect with each other I think it's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.760 
disconnect with each other I think it's
really<00:00:51.210> interesting<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.620> like

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
really interesting and I think it's like

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
really interesting and I think it's like
a<00:00:52.800> real<00:00:52.949> catalyst<00:00:53.430> for<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> do

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a real catalyst for what I want to do

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209 
a real catalyst for what I want to do
and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.350> helps<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> bring<00:00:55.949> lots<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
and it helps me to bring lots of

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.619 
and it helps me to bring lots of
different<00:00:56.489> sources<00:00:56.640> together<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> our

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
after note and I initially collaborated

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.309 
after note and I initially collaborated
this<00:02:10.369> also<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:10.940> big<00:02:11.150> wall<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.390> post-it<00:02:12.110> notes

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
this also this big wall of post-it notes

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.530 
this also this big wall of post-it notes
we<00:02:12.620> shall<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:12.890> developed<00:02:13.370> into<00:02:13.549> a<00:02:13.940> sculpture

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
we shall have developed into a sculpture

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.680 
we shall have developed into a sculpture
which<00:02:15.160> had<00:02:16.160> found<00:02:16.459> blowing<00:02:16.970> out<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.599> then

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
which had found blowing out it and then

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.479 
which had found blowing out it and then
into<00:02:17.989> sort<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.290> more<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:18.799> know<00:02:18.920> big<00:02:19.160> bigger

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
into sort of more you know big bigger

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.030 
into sort of more you know big bigger
surroundings<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:21.170> sort<00:02:21.380> fascination

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
surroundings and this sort fascination

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.930 
surroundings and this sort fascination
with<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.370> idea<00:02:22.700> already<00:02:22.970> made<00:02:23.269> and<00:02:23.860> either

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
with this idea already made and either

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.280 
with this idea already made and either
manipulation<00:02:25.940> or<00:02:26.060> sort<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.390> multiplying<00:02:27.079> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
manipulation or sort of multiplying the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.199 
manipulation or sort of multiplying the
object<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.739> you've<00:02:27.920> got<00:02:28.130> became<00:02:28.549> really<00:02:28.970> key

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
object that you've got became really key

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.720 
object that you've got became really key
to<00:02:29.390> my<00:02:29.510> work<00:02:29.720> because<00:02:30.579> objects<00:02:31.579> are

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
to my work because objects are

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.880 
to my work because objects are
signifiers<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:32.690> when<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.470> look<00:02:33.680> at<00:02:33.799> an

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
signifiers and when you look at an

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.839 
signifiers and when you look at an
object<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.340> know<00:02:34.459> what<00:02:34.579> it<00:02:34.700> is

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
object you know what it is

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.240 
object you know what it is
nobody<00:02:35.299> you<00:02:35.840> know<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.200> does<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.040> when<00:02:37.160> you

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
nobody you know what it does so when you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680 
nobody you know what it does so when you
begin<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.579> change<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.060> function<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
begin to change the function and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.270 
begin to change the function and
manipulates<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.470> either<00:02:39.620> by<00:02:39.890> putting

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
manipulates it either by putting

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.309 
manipulates it either by putting
material<00:02:40.880> on<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.120> or<00:02:41.299> covering<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.290> in

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
material on it or covering it in

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.530 
material on it or covering it in
something<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:43.130> totally<00:02:43.519> changes<00:02:44.060> what<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.359> was

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
something it totally changes what it was

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.170 
something it totally changes what it was
to<00:02:44.690> begin<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:45.769> as<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.100> viewer<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.700> begin

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
to begin with so as a viewer you begin

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.150 
to begin with so as a viewer you begin
to<00:02:47.359> sort<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.660> contemplate<00:02:48.230> what<00:02:48.889> it<00:02:49.010> is

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
to sort of contemplate what it is

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
to sort of contemplate what it is
differently<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.880> guess<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.870> best<00:02:51.019> place<00:02:51.200> to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
differently I guess the best place to

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.930 
differently I guess the best place to
start<00:02:51.530> is<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.769> I've<00:02:52.040> converted<00:02:52.579> what<00:02:52.790> used

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
start is that I've converted what used

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240 
start is that I've converted what used
to<00:02:52.970> be<00:02:53.030> our<00:02:53.180> old<00:02:53.299> lecture<00:02:53.660> room<00:02:53.780> into<00:02:54.739> I

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
to be our old lecture room into I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.890 
to be our old lecture room into I
suppose<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.910> Caesars<00:02:56.180> describers<00:02:56.600> lobby<00:02:56.750> of

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
suppose the Caesars describers lobby of

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.009 
suppose the Caesars describers lobby of
a<00:02:56.930> refugee<00:02:57.380> camp<00:02:57.590> for<00:02:57.889> sort<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.840> creative<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
a refugee camp for sort of creative and

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.509 
a refugee camp for sort of creative and
fledgling<00:03:00.470> artists<00:03:00.950> who<00:03:01.040> have<00:03:01.160> anywhere<00:03:01.459> to

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
fledgling artists who have anywhere to

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.900 
fledgling artists who have anywhere to
go<00:03:01.730> anymore<00:03:02.889> so<00:03:03.889> I<00:03:03.920> suppose<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.579> it's<00:03:04.850> a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
go anymore so I suppose it's it's a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.970 
go anymore so I suppose it's it's a
little<00:03:05.030> bit<00:03:05.269> personal<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.810> sense<00:03:06.079> that

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
little bit personal in that sense that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.530 
little bit personal in that sense that
it's<00:03:07.520> better<00:03:07.760> sort<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.060> finding<00:03:08.360> a<00:03:08.390> new<00:03:08.420> home

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
it's better sort of finding a new home

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.330 
it's better sort of finding a new home
for<00:03:08.750> these<00:03:08.930> people<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.770> work<00:03:09.920> came<00:03:10.099> about

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
for these people and the work came about

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.780 
for these people and the work came about
it

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
it

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.970

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
been really interested in in the shapes

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.720 
been really interested in in the shapes
that<00:04:45.330> I've<00:04:45.510> created<00:04:46.410> because<00:04:47.130> obviously<00:04:47.310> you

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
that I've created because obviously you

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.220 
that I've created because obviously you
know<00:04:47.880> it's<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> sink<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.780> know<00:04:48.930> it's<00:04:49.140> a

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
know it's the sink you know it's a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.830 
know it's the sink you know it's a
radiator<00:04:49.770> or<00:04:49.950> a<00:04:50.100> chair<00:04:50.370> or<00:04:50.520> whatever<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:51.210> I

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
radiator or a chair or whatever and I

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.750 
radiator or a chair or whatever and I
think<00:04:52.050> it's<00:04:52.290> it's<00:04:52.710> there's<00:04:53.100> a<00:04:53.160> bit<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.310> humor

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
think it's it's there's a bit of humor

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.100 
think it's it's there's a bit of humor
behind<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.240> people<00:04:54.540> find<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.930> quite<00:04:55.050> funny

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
behind it people find it quite funny

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.050 
behind it people find it quite funny
that<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.860> know<00:04:55.950> there's<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.430> chair<00:04:56.730> and<00:04:56.880> it's

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
that you know there's a chair and it's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.270 
that you know there's a chair and it's
wrapped<00:04:57.300> wrapped<00:04:58.200> in<00:04:58.440> cling<00:04:58.650> film<00:04:58.680> but<00:04:59.250> I

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
wrapped wrapped in cling film but I

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.670 
wrapped wrapped in cling film but I
think<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.970> effect<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.450> quite<00:05:00.510> it's<00:05:01.410> quite

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
think the effect is quite it's quite

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.010 
think the effect is quite it's quite
impactful<00:05:01.950> because<00:05:02.760> it's<00:05:03.180> it's<00:05:03.750> so

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
impactful because it's it's so

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.170 
impactful because it's it's so

this whole black and white things
something<00:05:19.439> that<00:05:19.620> worked<00:05:19.830> on<00:05:19.979> for<00:05:20.219> a<00:05:20.279> long<00:05:20.310> time

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
something that worked on for a long time

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.149 
something that worked on for a long time
and<00:05:21.689> because<00:05:21.990> it's<00:05:22.110> P<00:05:22.289> Montford<00:05:22.680> it's<00:05:22.949> kind<00:05:23.129> of

and because it's P Montford it's kind of
part<00:05:23.400> of<00:05:23.490> my<00:05:23.610> whole<00:05:23.789> art<00:05:24.029> so<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> decided<00:05:24.599> that

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
part of my whole art so I decided that

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
makes a bit more intriguing I think we

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.159 
makes a bit more intriguing I think we
kind<00:05:35.879> of<00:05:35.909> had<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.449> don't<00:05:36.810> know<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.930> kind<00:05:37.050> of
