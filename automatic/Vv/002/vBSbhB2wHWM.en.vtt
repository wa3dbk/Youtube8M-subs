00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:11.610
 the thing is like this 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.849
 because you also forget to take me the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.529
 cover cover of your balls sanjuÃ¡n el 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.860
 path of san juan is the way of the 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.500
 dead 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.320
 very hard thing because 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.660
 As you can see, the rain comes frontally, 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.730
 I wear glasses because the glasses of tel aviv 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.559
 and I left them in champions you skin and put 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.559
 they will carry more weight 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.520
 then you have to go looking down 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.230
 because ladies palante you eat the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.230
 rain to the eyes 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.420
 the advantage is that already with so much cold already 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.730
 You do not feel neither cold legs there 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.910
 such acts you do not feel the pain of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.530
 tests because you already have them frozen 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.920
 the feet are soaked also as 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.920
 you can see 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.820
 again 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.920
 it looked like this was going to be epic 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.880
 but I did not imagine that much less 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.210
 would not be in these terms almost 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.400
 to cross the jungle in order the mood is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.090
 the last thing you lose the desire and the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.090
 illusion too 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.220
 I stay here I want that way I will do 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.210
 also a static photo to see if the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.210
 I put in instagram then 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.720
 Oh, the fucking mother who gave birth to the devil and 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.610
 then look if you see buses going by and 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 such and says 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.920
 anyway 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.630
 is less to get to Santiago 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.470
 and here you have to get there as well 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.690
 I will tell you that in the end the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.050
 now and snow forecast so I do not know 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.500
 if today I could keep pulling but 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.500
 will try 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.610
 we're going to arrive not since we've started 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.380
 he says it's as if you hit 100 200 300 400 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.610
 500 600 700 kilometers which are 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.330
 until 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.680
 yes yes the total is 1,400 better to arrive not 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.829
 because you remember that 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.079
 If you have to go, it's going, but go to go 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:30.659
 foolish not to go for this earlier come 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.659
 Well, let's go 3 2 1
