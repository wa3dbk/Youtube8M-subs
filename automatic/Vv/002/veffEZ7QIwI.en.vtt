00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.690
 football and music have always gone 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.060
 hand one puts emotion and passion while 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.860
 that another puts goals and show and is 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.200
 that both arts do not differ much 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.880
 in fact they have many points in common 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.160
 within football we find 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.200
 more classic court players others more 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.970
 aggressive there are those who are in fan 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.590
 terrible when it comes to scoring goals and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.870
 we can meet with defenses 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.420
 more physical rocky and with a mood 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.950
 less dialoguing in music is what 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.990
 same at the time of finding all 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 variety of sounds and that when 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.140
 we talk about guitars what channels 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.630
 distortion pedals 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 What are the guitar pedals? 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.020
 of devices to which they connect 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 the guitars to customize a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.520
 sound the words league goes into the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.770
 cash workshop and wonder so that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.960
 álex and tomás tell us how they have 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.540
 related the guitar pedals and the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 soccer world personalize them with 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.770
 photos of big icons so that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 more soccer players enjoy 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.070
 the time in their two passions and sell them 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.070
 to all the world 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 If the truth is that it's funny how 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.720
 they have put together two worlds without knowing very 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.619
 well without actually looking for it because 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.290
 the story started with this pedal 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 maradona that a friend asked us to 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.060
 they have I am in Barcelona I have dumped 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.799
 Maltese micro studio and what I for a 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.920
 friend your life from napoles that is very very 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.750
 loose from maradona and we did it and the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.869
 it's true that it was a boom, the people 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.940
 started to spend to share it on facebook 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.520
 we started to call people and ask us 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.310
 marías ostias one marías zidane one of 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.479
 raúl de cantona is not in the wrote 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.080
 that has as he wrote a uncle of poway 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.020
 people from outside Argentina and suddenly 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.090
 was what what what he or peto 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.440
 has also served as a result of this for 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.549
 that people knew about our other 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.549
 pedals and all this 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.450
 maradona george best zinedine zidane 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 until raúl gonzález white is part 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 of the template they have made 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.870
 these cash guys and wonder 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.130
 yes, good tea reduces a boy from 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.900
 Reykjavik group that asked us what 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.150
 site is very very forofo very very from 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.170
 madrid and he did not ask us this the truth is 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.170
 who is liking a lot 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.990
 At this point, let's ask about the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.240
 sound of the pedals and sound would have 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.200
 a pedal inspired by messi or 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.200
 Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.070
 that's a very complicated question I 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.420
 I think that I would give them a river that 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.640
 sound as if they were inside a 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.640
 cathedral if something like that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.319
 of white I do not know 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.560
 To the success more they manufacture in an artisan way 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.510
 every pedal from the first design 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.760
 initial up all the electronics 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.580
 looking for a sound that they look after as if 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.800
 they were ancient craftsmen the secret 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.739
 is in which each pedal as each player 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.989
 it is unique at the moment the pedal team 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.020
 is growing little by little and do not rule out 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.790
 rescue old personal aspirations 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.590
 I knew I would like to recover 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.590
 surely that ronaldinho 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.110
 because I remember that when I 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.400
 they signed as a distribution that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.470
 it looked good it seemed a bad 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.060
 surely the way to touch the ball 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.209
 Well, it could remind us of the way 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.430
 he played jimmy hendrix's guitar 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.600
 then the pedal that would touch him is 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.600
 a food face 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.980
 that's why I'm here because for me it's a 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.930
 little when I was little and discover 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.130
 football was with tintin and has been 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.550
 historical if you continue what remains 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.750
 still and I'm waiting for the moment that 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.850
 someone asks for it in fact I think what 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.110
 let's do it anyway and I'm 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.470
 sure we're going to press it when 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.470
 out 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.880
 from his little workshop of the vendrell 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.530
 in catalunya àlex and tomás are 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.320
 prepared to continue growing as 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.850
 team their pedals are unique and they already 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.040
 have become a classic of 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.200
 musical world because they unite the two 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.640
 passions of millions of people the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.640
 soccer and music
