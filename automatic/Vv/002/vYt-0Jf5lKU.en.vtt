 and beta fish are popular pets 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.230
 known for their aggressiveness 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.509
 interactivity and relatively low 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.400
 maintenance cost follows 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.110
 next steps to make sure that

 you provide a happy life and 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.870
 healthy your pet 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.850
 steps first consider giving your vein 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.220
 a decent sized tank what 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.830
 will help prolong your life to a greater 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.590
 amount of water better but a tank of 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.050
 5 gallons is acceptable 20 liters more or 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.629
 less decorate the home of your betta fish 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.820
 one of the hallmarks of beta 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.559
 is your ability to breathe oxygen in 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.410
 the air and water so it does not 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 requires oxygenate the water decorates your house 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.640
 with white silk gravel stones and 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.309
 a small cave structure for 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.610
 hiding a creative home is a home 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.589
 happy avoids rocks or sharp decorations 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.949
 since the vein fins can be 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.780
 tear though the wise plants are 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.190
 a good accessory for the tank 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.409
 beta second prepares the water uses a 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.479
 water conditioner before putting 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.549
 water from the tap in the tank since the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.220
 Chlorine and chloramines can damage the seam 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.500
 it's a good idea to use spring water or 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.180
 purified water but anyway it's 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 good to add a water treatment 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.500
 specifically for beta fish since 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.450
 It has almond oil extract and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.300
 other things that reduce stress in 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 I had 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.240
 third fill the tank if your tank is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.970
 of those who do not have a lid, fill it to a 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.580
 maximum of 80 to prevent the fish 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.950
 beta jump out beta fish 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.410
 They are very active and can jump up to 3 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.510
 inches above the water too 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.820
 You can use some type of mesh over 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.820
 of the fish tank to avoid jumping 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 place the baby is in the water put 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 float the bag of water with fish sees 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.490
 is inside her for five 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.350
 minutes normally the stores of 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.750
 pets deliver them in small bags 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.570
 with water this helps equalize 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 temperature gently pours a bit of 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.280
 aquarium water in the bag every five 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.560
 minutes finally with a network and with 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.870
 very carefully placed the betta fish in its 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.760
 new home you do not empty the water of the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 sachet in the aquarium since it could 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.860
 be contaminated 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.989
 fifth feeds your perbet to your vein the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.420
 diet should consist mainly of 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.580
 fish food for occasions 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.950
 special to feed it with shrimp or 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.769
 Dry worms usually sell them in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.560
 aquarium stores feed your beta 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:37.350

 sixth cleans your aquarium at least once 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.350
 a week depending on its size not 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.780
 Get your beta fish out of the aquarium clean 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 the tank uses a hose to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.200
 extract the water 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.000
 obviously you will not extract all the water 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.920
 of the aquarium but if 30% 50% clean 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.730
 gravel and then clean the accumulation 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.830
 on the side walls 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.830
