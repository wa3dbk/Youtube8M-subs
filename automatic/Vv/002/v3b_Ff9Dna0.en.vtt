injecting<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.920> end<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.850> sequence<00:01:45.299> by<00:01:45.960> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
injecting the end of sequence by a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.219 
injecting the end of sequence by a
ceramic<00:01:46.619> sealer<00:01:47.130> inside<00:01:47.939> each<00:01:48.210> canal<00:01:48.600> after

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
ceramic sealer inside each canal after

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.569 
ceramic sealer inside each canal after
preparation<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.810> irrigation<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.990> drawing

so<00:01:53.689> this<00:01:54.689> injection<00:01:55.110> technique<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.189> very

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
so this injection technique is a very

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
so this injection technique is a very
efficient<00:01:57.119> way<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> placing<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.140> sealer<00:01:58.439> in

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
efficient way of placing the sealer in

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.030 
efficient way of placing the sealer in
the<00:01:58.649> canal<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.520> does<00:01:59.820> require<00:02:00.180> some

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
the canal it does require some

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.069 
the canal it does require some
experience<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.509> blank<00:02:04.020> amount<00:02:06.079> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
experience so that the blank amount the

experience so that the blank amount the
sealer<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:08.310> placed<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> canal

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
sealer is actually placed in the canal

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.110 
sealer is actually placed in the canal
it's<00:02:10.259> important<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> create<00:02:11.489> an<00:02:11.610> overfill

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's important not to create an overfill

now the water is cleaned off using some
paper<00:05:25.610> points<00:05:27.069> and<00:05:32.500> once<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.860> space<00:05:34.759> is

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
paper points and once the space is

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.649 
paper points and once the space is
completely<00:05:35.509> dried<00:05:35.780> off<00:05:36.759> you<00:05:37.759> are<00:05:37.789> pretty<00:05:38.570> much

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
completely dried off you are pretty much
