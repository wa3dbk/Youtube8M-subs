00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.470
 Next we will explain how to create a table that helps us all 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.640
 that our game 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.510
 the editors that decimals igor for example with which we're going to avoid the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.400
 text work with a table or character map made unique among others 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.010
 goals that each game contains a table omapa of characters 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.199
 that does not always coincide with the asfi 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.780
 so that when working for love desalinate all the characters 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.499
 also the table with the equivalences the code of this city 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.609
 and its corresponding symbol that will appear in the game is already spoken of 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.050
 work but for export as for example a parenthesis to the elections 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.340
 The first thing we are going to do is look for a game text about Carlos faces 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 and in the case of gea this one who is prince said 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.390
 the next race will be to look for that same text inside the that or the rom 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.020
 to be able to manipulate it 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.780
 we must avoid modifying everything that does not correspond to the abbreviations of text 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.450
 properly said as what he pointed out next 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.589
 which corresponds to each image 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.589
 and on behalf of the character 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.660
 then, to avoid problems, only the terms that 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.660
 they range from opening to closing in the face of the imminent 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.090
 in my house makes the text box ends here because this point 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.870
 corresponds in this tenth to the zero code to zero who had the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.040
 Most games correspond to a close 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.660
 of this special said that he will be named character until 7 0 0 today the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.259
 code that our game corresponds to the closing 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.319
 will be what contains the text box and here remarked the xerez was the beginning 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.640
 from the end of the box 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.510
 and also writing 0 1 0 2 0 3 and so on to this fact that it is the last 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.530
 system code hexais and bad 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.290
 using all the text boxes that are necessary to reach 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 personal with you here in our exceptional system scheme 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.370
 that respects the character is 16 what gives us 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 256 possibilities with only two digits 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.360
 once all this is done we will play the game again with the modified action 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.420
 to see the changes aker our screenshots of the result in my 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.060
 case 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 where in addition that the different text boxes appear in order all the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.539
 symbols 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.929
 here we see how some weeks are awarded with the karate map this 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.410
 program but others like the vowels stressed I do not know I do not know 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.410
 and for that reason we are going to create our own table 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.230
 as he points out that it is salvation corresponds to chorea 21 in the system it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.309
 burn 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.199
 to create the table itself we will open a text file with blog 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:36.469
 in ancash and we will be counting the chávez code and badly followed by an equal and the 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.109
 corresponding symbol 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.859
 then we will save the file with extension tente l 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:46.379
 because it is more than an example of the table that I made for my game 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.369
 they are arranged and they all have the same suture 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.650
 this lack that we will use after removing that final 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 to display the characters correctly 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:03.439
 also note is that the equivalence of many codes is the same code 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.799
 but with more 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.819
 that's because 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.260
 that these codes do not amount to any character and I placed them like that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.350
 for reasons of gift but I detest but this topic ninth case 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.459
 the windows program allows us to load the tables that we have created 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:24.349
 we open the file of the red one and with the control efe we ​​look for a text that in 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.349
 this case is persists 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.430
 we press this box so that it hurts all results in a list 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.629
 has found a result and we selected it 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.049
 we see the same piece of text that we have worked with before 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.700
 in my case the action contains the same text in different languages ​​and I will 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:52.099
 move to where the text is in Spanish that already 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.200
 see translated inhibits and in order to explain you following if it is not so to load 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.159
 also most of the characters because they are the ones they contain with the 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.219
 program load but it does not recognize for example the unit contains 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.219
 of the words no imas 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:12.059
 to load a famous tangana hotel jaén that the goal we selected to each 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.059
 one and we look for it 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:20.060
 the region with stretches the masters selection and we were to affect 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.129
 to load our table we will check that all the equivalents that 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:26.529
 we had introduced into it 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.849
 includes accented vowels that did not appear before 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.189
 in the part of the right we observe as the length of the rocks now 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.550
 vary because each hexadecimal value 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.820
 it can amount to character shots even for transportation though this 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.910
 will not modify the file itself since it is just a disorientation 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.430
 the reason for using them for a character for an exceptional value can be 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.360
 among others 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.919
 because this value is equivalent for example although in the text a little less here 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.340
 to a line break 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.110
 in the table we put that 24 was equal assault with which the program recognizes 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.830
 the value 24 as holy
