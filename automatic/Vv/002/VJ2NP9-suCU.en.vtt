00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.200 
this one comes with a metal scraper and
I'm<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.560> very<00:01:58.860> excited<00:01:59.549> about<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> metal

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I'm not very excited about the metal

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
I'm not very excited about the metal
scrapers<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:00.930> they<00:02:01.079> tend<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> scratch

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
scrapers because they tend to scratch

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
scrapers because they tend to scratch

never<00:02:15.480> wanting<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.870> try<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:16.950> a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
never wanting to try this one for a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.979 
never wanting to try this one for a
while<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.220> haven't<00:02:17.459> tried<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.790> yet<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.810> I've

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
while I haven't tried it yet but I've

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.750 
while I haven't tried it yet but I've
seen<00:02:19.230> some<00:02:19.500> other<00:02:19.680> ladies<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.400> YouTube

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
seen some other ladies here on YouTube

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.000 
seen some other ladies here on YouTube
try<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.629> seems<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.140> be<00:02:22.260> working<00:02:22.500> really

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
try it and it seems to be working really

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.490 
try it and it seems to be working really
well<00:02:23.190> now<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> reason<00:02:24.629> I<00:02:24.840> wanted<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> try<00:02:25.440> this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
well now the reason I wanted to try this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.009 
well now the reason I wanted to try this
is<00:02:25.799> because<00:02:26.129> it's<00:02:26.310> longer<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:27.900> those<00:02:27.959> of

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
is because it's longer so for those of

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.940 
is because it's longer so for those of
you<00:02:28.230> who<00:02:28.409> have<00:02:28.590> long<00:02:29.159> nails<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:31.560> one

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you who have long nails and this one

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.610 
you who have long nails and this one
just<00:02:32.459> basically<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.170> roll<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.379> on

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
just basically you have to roll it on

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.000 
just basically you have to roll it on
it's<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:35.069> as<00:02:35.280> soft<00:02:35.730> as<00:02:36.299> this<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:37.769> one<00:02:37.980> is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
it's not as soft as this one this one is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.809 
it's not as soft as this one this one is
really<00:02:38.430> its<00:02:39.329> firm<00:02:39.629> but<00:02:39.900> very<00:02:40.379> squishy<00:02:40.860> this

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
really its firm but very squishy this

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.970 
really its firm but very squishy this
one<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.450> very<00:02:43.280> firm<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.909> very<00:02:45.180> squishy<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.620> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
one is very firm not very squishy but I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.670 
one is very firm not very squishy but I
can<00:02:47.310> tell<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.629> very<00:02:49.019> good<00:02:49.379> quality

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
