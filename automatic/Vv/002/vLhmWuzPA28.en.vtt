00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.610
 good how are you what you are that you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.769
 I miss nothing as you already know 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.650
 the other day so suddenly I got up 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.080
 super asleep and with the voice of manolo I decided 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 that I was going to start making a new 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 section that was about how to go to 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 gym and not die in the attempt is 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.550
 true that throughout all this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.939
 Many times you asked me what 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.400
 what music did I wear what was my 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 routine and good I want to put a little 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.210
 this a morcillo that I put to my 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.969
 videos so everything is not like the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 flat my god I 'm going to the gym is what 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.579
 worst in the world and I do not know how to do it like 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.890
 friend and say fuck we are days 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.629
 normal that everyone happens to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 I went back the other day after a month 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 to the gym and how I am a cut of the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.750
 life even if you do not believe it, I am very 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 introverted I go and do not ask where 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 are the changing rooms and then I 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660
 investigate by the gym you know and good 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.090
 I did not find them I had to go back 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.710
 at the reception ask in hello plan 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.970
 I'm an asshole got me in the men's 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
 Thank you 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.560
 and then I got on the elliptical and good 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.500
 those who have tried the analytical 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.370
 you will know that you start alone you start alone 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.620
 you start pedaling so to speak and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.300
 the machine is already turning on and you 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.430
 then you choose then if you want some 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.230
 routine or just start and you're 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.510
 what is good then I started 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.670
 pedaling I started to sweat from nerves of 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.030
 I think that I am a novice 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 The whole world is watching me and we 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.690
 I turned on you know then well I thought 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.220
 that I was dying of shame and Africa was 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.050
 lit up but been stress all you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.100
 I hope for this topic and we will talk about the subject 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.040
 from others they look at you and you are not a bug 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.960
 weird but we think about it today I come 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.840
 talk about another topic that we leave 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.670
 there parked for another day that you think 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.070
 and I'm going to talk about clothing 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.500
 as I have seen to go to the gym is 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.470
 say I signed up for the gym and I did not 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.290
 I have sports clothes, what's wrong with me? 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.270
 life can not go to the gym to see 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.140
 relaxation does not need to be 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.330
 nancy costumes like no athlete 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 I need you to swear I really do 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.280
 people who decide to go to the gym and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.470
 buy the good sportsman kit 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
 it seems fine I think it's an expense that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.099
 in the long run you will want to do if 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.750
 You are taking routine and you want to go 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.269
 every day at the gym every two days 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.390
 or three times a week I do not care 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:35.180
 but you do not need to invest in plan 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.340
 that you buy the athlete clip 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.760
 you do not have to go to the decathlon and raze 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.400
 no no because the important thing is to be 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.900
 comfortable then we have two types of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.900
 people going to the gym 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.110
 there are many types but in the summary that 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 What to do with clothes, that woman is not 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.510
 who decides to go to the gym with the first 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.000
 What is going on I'm going 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.130
 to the gym I'm going to sweat he eats me I put the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.739
 last shit I have in the drawer that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.860
 I see it legal hear what I see it 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.810
 it seems cool to me you know but I think 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 that although we are in the gym that 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.319
 we are sweating that it is a moment 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.930
 pretty little glamorous 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.180
 fuck then feel good I do not know when 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.150
 you leave your house or when you dress up 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.950
 what sportsman feel good bears 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.659
 something that you feel like led to more or 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.659
 unless you see yourself in the mirror and say 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.000
 passable bad with a proof of it 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.069
 it serves because after all if you 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.689
 you put some meshes pos girls the meshes 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.489
 to nobody that you also always know 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.280
 there you think you have the chairs and 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.349
 your things that come out that you see but 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.239
 that is not plan broken mesh 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.269
 that you use to scrub on Sundays 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.150
 Mild morning does not have to be 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.790
 that option is what I want 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.489
 express that you do not need to go as a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.260
 bitch not to say it is that I am 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.939
 very sincere and you do not have to go as a 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.650
 water reginas me because then you go to 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.840
 put like a slut because sodas you know 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.790
 I do not know if you're understanding me 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.069
 understanding 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.670
 Well that's more than anything because in the end you 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.739
 you look ugly and dirty ugly you know if 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.509
 you think you 're not doing anything for 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.049
 you and what you are doing is something very 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:24.229
 handsome necessary for health and good and 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.150
 what do you think we'll talk about in another 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.680
 chapter of the de-stressing model that 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.930
 will be the gym and what happens for your 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.580
 head and as my friend Mariana says 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.900
 world that we arranged when I was in the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.360
 fitness center 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.919
 so as I say, it's not necessary 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.539
 buy the athlete kit but 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.009
 neither is it necessary for you to take the 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.690
 last shit you have in the drawer 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:47.150
 ok we can find something in between 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.580
 in almost all stores are not 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.949
 brand or are not branded and I'm going to 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.610
 forward to the first you know or be a 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.220
 cotton trousers for all sports 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.760
 the life of the god world 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.130
 it's perfect because we're going to see if you're going to 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.230
 go to the Olympics you know you do not need 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.950
 nothing special you need something that is 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.140
 comfortable comfortable to get on a 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.970

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.550

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:38.550
 You can buy yourself some 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.919
 a typical sport tights that will make 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.199
 in almost all the shops there because 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.259

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:49.080

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.960
 and t-shirts you have 15 thousand 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.370
