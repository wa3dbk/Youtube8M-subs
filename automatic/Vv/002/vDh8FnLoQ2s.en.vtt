00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.980
 Hello friends, I am the other day 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.260
 mentioned in one of the videos what the test was doing 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.359
 and genetic there a few years ago a 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.789
 next pass to publish about the squirrel and 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.140
 now send a printout 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:26.689
 and one of our viewers 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.619
 ask a question and what did you do too 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:33.910
 test and a lot of interesting knew there on 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.910
 last then a horn and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.650
 how much 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 Is it convenient how ethical for example 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.690
 share your genetic data 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.280
 test because it is at such 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.220
 he was specifically such a test was where everyones 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.110
 blood that is present in it 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.540
 showed that there is so much that he even 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.360
 did not know there and by percentile there one 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 3 and 2 and 5 and 10 should 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.780
 the whole is such a story and as far as 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.780
 ethically 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.820
 There are several companies that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.090
 are engaged 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.120
 these are these technologies and these 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.150
 for citizens doing analyzes 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.150
 and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.010
 I'm in the same 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 did the analysis because there our guys 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.320
 were in practice they took from us 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.870
 interns and sent me what's there 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.260
 link drive at the time it cost as much 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.090
 1000 dollars so do something 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.530
 but there he was in good health there 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.860
 bend the disease on the propensity 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.080
 diseases for cops and thousands of dollars 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 cost and it was not some kind of promotion 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.760
 Here they sent me a reference I think of growth 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.500
 so much dropped center go do 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:55.770
 curious and i talked to their 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.470
 the manager who came to take 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.210
 trainees and it was a lot 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.350
 new such an unusual activity and here it is 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.500
 I was told such an interesting thing that 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.259
 by results 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.999
 These tests are very interested in Le Havre 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.760
 we are here the government 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:19.069
 in particular, here is the armed force because 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.510
 that all are not armed at all 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.909
 even called equilibrium opportunite 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.389
 syphons are discriminated against when hiring 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.939
 they don't take everybody and now they are very strong 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:32.329
 interested in some data here 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.439
 This genetic data is very strong 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.370
 were interested 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.620
 insurance companies because when 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.189
 man comes to insure something in general 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.019
 that risk 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.930
 certain diseases completely 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.299
 differently much more accurate 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.769
 and so on and so he said that 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.379
 congress that 's just there accepted 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.169
 his law was lobbied by people involved 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.780
 organizations involved in these 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:03.199
 technology was the law I would not see 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.260
 I dreamed, but from the words I convey it means 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:10.969
 there is a law that prohibits 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.459
 discrimination of a person based on his 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:17.780
 genetic data for example 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:20.480
 because the desire to discriminate is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.430
 many and 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.080
 well, really traces from oh man 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.930
 you know something that you don't like 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.099
 Yes, you know what 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.650
 But in general, here it is, such that 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.140
 concerns an individual person here 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.019
 let's say i don't know ivan petr there 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.150
 sidor or i watched i can i 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.220
 share with your results your 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.080
 genetic test if i count 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.629
 possible to do this i can share 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.390
 but but this is my solution to that 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.360
 people who are such very intimate things 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.489
 publicly talk there not to their 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 there in sexual adventures there on 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.870
 video and there we are so on but but this is me 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.280
 also as if internal barriers 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.109
 person or another person is he already 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.599
 thinks no it does not hurt him 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:13.069
 does it hurt someone of those people 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.230
 whom he knows because to know it 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.930
 happens here and sort of talk about myself on 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.639
 there somewhere else people took part in 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.930
 your story is not always 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.510
 conveniently 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.960
 i sometimes know i have very funny 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.630
 stories 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.580
 and sometimes very instructive stories this 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.650
 for never told anyone just 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.410
 because if I often what is it 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.889
 tell to date I can name 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.210
 change there is something else but there 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:43.180
 always someone who finds out 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.889
 but in the characters and and can somehow 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.780
 go out there and say, but I know that 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.940
 this was there Vasya this was calle this 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:55.870
 there were loops and it turns out that I kind of 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.419
 bring on some such negative on that 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:04.270
 or another person so you can sit 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:06.550
 there is no telling which is why something 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.000
 were told just something changing there 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.039
 names there and place of action something at all 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.289
 sit and be silent 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.039
 so this is this internal barrier by three 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:20.759
 human so there is a question no i 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:23.560
 talk about the results of this test i 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.889
 I don't know where he was already in the summer 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.639
 somewhat back and sometime wash 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.320
 or sent or maybe a printout 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.650
 it was but also making for this time moved 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.460
 twice on here I do not know that is not me 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.169
 sorry but 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.949
 but I just don't have it now 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.949
 hand like that such a story from it
