00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
and this pile of crap is an MTD Yard Man

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.140 
and this pile of crap is an MTD Yard Man
and<00:00:04.170> it's<00:00:04.799> got<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.250> those<00:00:05.430> transmission

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and it's got one of those transmission

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.059 
and it's got one of those transmission
drives<00:00:06.450> so<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> transmission<00:00:07.529> drives<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
drives so the transmission drives the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.530 
drives so the transmission drives the
front<00:00:08.370> wheels<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:08.880> supposed<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.179> help<00:00:09.360> you

it you have right here when you squeeze
this<00:00:19.699> that<00:00:20.699> engages<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> belt<00:00:21.660> that's<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
this that engages a belt that's on the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
this that engages a belt that's on the
motor<00:00:22.529> that's<00:00:23.220> spinning<00:00:23.550> around<00:00:23.789> that's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
motor that's spinning around that's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.150 
motor that's spinning around that's
actually<00:00:24.510> spinning<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> blade<00:00:25.109> -<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.859> spins

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
actually spinning the blade - it spins

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.080 
actually spinning the blade - it spins
around<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.550> belt

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
around a belt

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
around a belt
it<00:00:27.570> engages<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.500> wheels<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:29.189> a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
it engages these wheels by a

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.630 
it engages these wheels by a
transmission<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:31.189> there's<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> little<00:00:32.460> knob

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
transmission so there's a little knob

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
transmission so there's a little knob
here<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> use<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.780> tighten<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.260> loosen

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
here that you use to tighten and loosen

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.090 
here that you use to tighten and loosen
the<00:00:35.190> play<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.590> once<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> gets<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the play in this once it gets to a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.619 
the play in this once it gets to a
certain<00:00:38.160> point<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> belt<00:00:39.270> gets<00:00:39.480> all

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
certain point and that belt gets all

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.840 
certain point and that belt gets all
stretched<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.980> doesn't<00:00:41.280> matter<00:00:41.430> how<00:00:41.730> much

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
stretched out it doesn't matter how much

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.060 
stretched out it doesn't matter how much
you<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.420> tighten<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you you tighten it up it's not going to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.619 
you you tighten it up it's not going to
be<00:00:44.160> effective<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.090> what<00:00:45.210> we're<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> do

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
be effective so what we're going to do

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.569 
be effective so what we're going to do
is<00:00:45.750> replace<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> belt<00:00:46.440> today<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:47.520> right

is replace the belt today all right
first<00:00:48.059> thing<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> need<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:51.539> need

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
first thing you need to do is you need

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
first thing you need to do is you need
to<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.260> bolt<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
to take out the bolt or is it there's a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.670 
to take out the bolt or is it there's a
screw<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.180> screw<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
screw here and your screw here so you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
screw here and your screw here so you
just<00:00:55.829> grab<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> driver<00:00:58.550> before<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.699> get<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.210> this

just grab a driver before I get get this

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
just grab a driver before I get get this
motor<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.870> opened<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.949> need

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
motor all opened up first thing I need

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
motor all opened up first thing I need
to<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.840> just<00:01:03.840> connect<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to do is just connect that so now the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.850 
to do is just connect that so now the
motor<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> not<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.939> start<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.240> accident

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
motor is not going to start on accident

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.000 
motor is not going to start on accident
then<00:01:08.210> until<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:10.110> by<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.439> clips<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
then until then it just by some clips so

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
then until then it just by some clips so
you<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.220> pull<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.990> make<00:01:12.990> sure<00:01:13.020> those

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you just pull up on it make sure those

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.310 
you just pull up on it make sure those
nuts<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.130> throw<00:01:14.460> pull<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> off<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:16.020> this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
nuts to throw pull this off now this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.789 
nuts to throw pull this off now this
right<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.240> what<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
right here what this really does is this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
right here what this really does is this
captures<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.610> grass<00:01:20.909> clippings<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
captures all the grass clippings and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
captures all the grass clippings and
everything<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> grass<00:01:22.979> clippings

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
everything and then the grass clippings

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
everything and then the grass clippings
sit<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.790> top<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.330> wheel<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.960> sit<00:01:25.200> on

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
sit on top of this wheel they sit on

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
sit on top of this wheel they sit on
this<00:01:25.470> idler<00:01:25.979> arm<00:01:26.189> they<00:01:26.400> sit<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this idler arm they sit in the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280 
this idler arm they sit in the
transmission<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.689> starts<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> rust

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
transmission it starts to rust

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
transmission it starts to rust
everything<00:01:28.740> out<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.520> actually<00:01:29.729> not<00:01:30.119> going

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
everything out so I'm actually not going

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539 
everything out so I'm actually not going
to<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.689> back<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.340> stay<00:01:32.520> just

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to put this back it's going to stay just

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.030 
to put this back it's going to stay just
like<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> visually<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
like this then you can visually see the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.350 
like this then you can visually see the
belt<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.430> everything<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.210> how

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
belt and everything you can see how

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
belt and everything you can see how
loose<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.840> belt<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> definitely

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
loose this belt is this is definitely

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.340 
loose this belt is this is definitely
worn<00:01:39.060> out<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.049> we're<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.259> to

I'm<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.470> do<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> 7/16

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I'm going to do that is this is 7/16

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.080 
I'm going to do that is this is 7/16
it's<00:01:49.110> got<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> 7/16<00:01:50.220> fitting<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> side<00:01:50.909> it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
it's got a 7/16 fitting on the side it's

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
it's got a 7/16 fitting on the side it's
just<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> nut<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> bolt<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.380> I'm<00:01:52.439> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> put

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
just a nut in a bolt so I'm going to put

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
just a nut in a bolt so I'm going to put
that<00:01:52.860> 7/16<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> bottom<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that 7/16 on the bottom I'm going to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.310 
that 7/16 on the bottom I'm going to
take<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.140> 7/16<00:01:55.950> will<00:01:56.729> loosen<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.149> thing<00:01:57.360> up

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.580 

I'm<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> take<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.890> out<00:02:02.540> boom<00:02:03.590> take

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
I'm going to take this out boom take

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.969 
I'm going to take this out boom take
this<00:02:04.740> apart<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:07.020> can<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.619> has<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this apart you can see that this has a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
this apart you can see that this has a
little<00:02:08.250> hook<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> slides<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.959> it's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
little hook that slides in there so it's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.330 
little hook that slides in there so it's
pretty<00:02:10.110> idiot-proof

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
pretty idiot-proof

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.720 
pretty idiot-proof
this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:14.629> your<00:02:15.629> little<00:02:15.810> either<00:02:16.080> arm

this is just your little either arm

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.080 
this is just your little either arm
clean<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:18.050> when<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.140> get<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> chance

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
clean this up when you get the chance

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.199 
clean this up when you get the chance
now<00:02:21.090> we'll<00:02:21.239> put<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.480> jack<00:02:21.780> stand<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:23.209> here's

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
now we'll put it on jack stand so here's

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.250 
now we'll put it on jack stand so here's
the<00:02:24.420> blade<00:02:25.040> here's<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.280> adapter<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.260> that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the blade here's the adapter and that

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.690 
the blade here's the adapter and that
right<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:29.090> that's<00:02:30.769> where<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.890> belt<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.340> you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
right here that's where the belt is you

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.190 
right here that's where the belt is you
can<00:02:32.879> see<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> belt<00:02:33.269> running<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.049> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
can see the belt running on the on the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.410 
can see the belt running on the on the
other<00:02:34.230> side<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.769> what<00:02:34.920> we're<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.430> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
can come down we're going to take this

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.589 
can come down we're going to take this

going to remove this screw because that

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.330 
going to remove this screw because that
screw<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.480> gonna<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:34.650> right<00:03:34.889> there<00:03:35.130> is

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
screw is just gonna that right there is

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.979 
screw is just gonna that right there is
another<00:03:35.639> guide<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.239> make<00:03:36.420> sure<00:03:36.450> that<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> belt

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
another guide to make sure that the belt

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.509 
another guide to make sure that the belt
doesn't<00:03:37.260> come<00:03:37.530> off<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.920> could<00:03:38.069> take<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> belt

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
doesn't come off I could take the belt

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.849 
doesn't come off I could take the belt
off<00:03:38.730> right<00:03:38.970> now<00:03:39.150> probably<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.680> that

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
off right now probably with it with that

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.559 
off right now probably with it with that
screw<00:03:41.099> on<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.489> but<00:03:42.000> I'm<00:03:42.090> going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.269> take<00:03:42.450> it

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
screw on there but I'm going to take it

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.479 
screw on there but I'm going to take it
off<00:03:42.720> just<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.940> access<00:03:44.940> it<00:03:45.329> more<00:03:45.630> easily

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
off just so I can access it more easily

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.920 
off just so I can access it more easily
that's<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.639> now<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.180> easier<00:03:48.569> for<00:03:48.599> us<00:03:48.900> to

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
that's one now it's easier for us to

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.720 
that's one now it's easier for us to
take<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.380> belt<00:03:49.590> off<00:03:49.769> we're<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.669> to

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
take the belt off we're just going to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.849 
take the belt off we're just going to
take<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.660> off<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:51.900> guide<00:03:52.349> we're<00:03:52.680> going<00:03:52.799> to

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
take it off that guide we're going to

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.830 
take it off that guide we're going to
slide<00:03:53.099> it<00:03:53.130> over<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.669> slide<00:03:54.660> it<00:03:54.810> right
