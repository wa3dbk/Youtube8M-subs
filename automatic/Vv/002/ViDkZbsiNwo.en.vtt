00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
how easy this tent is the pitch so what

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.649 
how easy this tent is the pitch so what
we<00:00:30.009> can<00:00:30.159> see<00:00:30.310> here<00:00:30.339> is<00:00:30.609> a<00:00:30.640> tent<00:00:30.939> has<00:00:31.179> this

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:31.659 
we can see here is a tent has this

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.840 
we can see here is a tent has this
elastic<00:00:32.200> strap<00:00:32.439> around<00:00:32.649> just<00:00:33.399> to<00:00:33.460> hold<00:00:33.610> it<00:00:33.760> in

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
elastic strap around just to hold it in

elastic strap around just to hold it in
place<00:00:33.880> and<00:00:34.660> all<00:00:34.750> we<00:00:34.870> need<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.019> do<00:00:35.230> let's<00:00:35.710> just

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
place and all we need to do let's just

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.069 
place and all we need to do let's just
take<00:00:36.039> this<00:00:36.070> off<00:00:37.109> like<00:00:38.109> so<00:00:38.609> and<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:39.820> tent<00:00:40.079> will

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
take this off like so and the tent will

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.099 
take this off like so and the tent will
pick<00:00:42.039> pretty<00:00:42.399> much<00:00:42.489> instantly<00:00:43.090> just<00:00:43.629> when<00:00:43.960> we

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
pick pretty much instantly just when we

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:52.560 
pick pretty much instantly just when we
do<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.640> there<00:00:51.789> you<00:00:51.879> see<00:00:52.030> just<00:00:52.269> how<00:00:52.390> easy

do this so there you see just how easy

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.299 
do this so there you see just how easy
that<00:00:52.809> really<00:00:53.050> is<00:00:53.170> no<00:00:53.499> what<00:00:53.649> we<00:00:53.739> have<00:00:53.769> to<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.129> is

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
that really is no what we have to do is

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.130 
that really is no what we have to do is
just<00:00:54.489> go<00:00:54.640> around<00:00:54.699> and<00:00:55.030> peg<00:00:55.269> it<00:00:55.420> pull<00:00:55.809> all<00:00:56.050> the

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
guy lanes and put them into position as

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.329 
guy lanes and put them into position as
well<00:00:58.019> so<00:00:59.019> here<00:00:59.230> with<00:00:59.379> the<00:00:59.469> vision<00:00:59.649> 200<00:01:00.219> you'll

well so here with the vision 200 you'll
find<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> flysheet<00:01:00.999> we're<00:01:01.300> using<00:01:01.480> on

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
find that the flysheet we're using on

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.959 
find that the flysheet we're using on
here<00:01:01.899> is<00:01:01.989> our<00:01:02.140> o<00:01:02.289> tex<00:01:02.559> 4000<00:01:03.219> this<00:01:03.789> is<00:01:03.940> a

polyester material which has been pu
coated<00:01:06.460> on<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.670> inside<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.360> then<00:01:07.750> all<00:01:07.990> of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
coated on the inside and then all of

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.930 
coated on the inside and then all of
these<00:01:08.290> themes<00:01:08.590> around<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.190> edges<00:01:09.340> here<00:01:09.670> have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
these themes around the edges here have

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.550 
these themes around the edges here have
all<00:01:10.060> been<00:01:10.240> tipped<00:01:10.480> as<00:01:10.630> well<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.260> this<00:01:11.380> gives

all been tipped as well and this gives

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.290 
all been tipped as well and this gives
us<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.830> hydrostatic<00:01:12.160> head<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.640> four<00:01:12.880> thousand

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
us a hydrostatic head of four thousand

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.030 
us a hydrostatic head of four thousand
millimeters<00:01:13.540> or<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> real<00:01:14.170> really<00:01:14.860> good

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
millimeters or a real really good

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.760 
millimeters or a real really good
quality<00:01:15.460> material<00:01:15.910> here<00:01:16.260> the<00:01:17.260> frame<00:01:17.620> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
quality material here the frame that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.400 
quality material here the frame that
we're<00:01:17.890> using<00:01:18.040> here<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.370> a<00:01:18.550> fully<00:01:18.880> enclosed

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
we're using here is a fully enclosed

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.690 
we're using here is a fully enclosed
integral<00:01:20.410> frame<00:01:20.680> which<00:01:20.920> just<00:01:21.190> allows<00:01:21.280> this

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
integral frame which just allows this

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.570 
integral frame which just allows this
tent<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.150> be<00:01:22.300> an<00:01:23.020> instant<00:01:23.500> pitch<00:01:23.680> style<00:01:24.190> and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
tent to be an instant pitch style and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.460 
tent to be an instant pitch style and
then<00:01:25.210> what<00:01:25.360> you'll<00:01:25.480> also<00:01:25.630> notice<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.230> that<00:01:26.260> we

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
then what you'll also notice is that we

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.530 
then what you'll also notice is that we
have<00:01:26.650> luminous<00:01:27.220> guy<00:01:27.370> leans<00:01:27.640> on<00:01:27.790> all<00:01:28.300> four

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
have luminous guy leans on all four

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.480 
have luminous guy leans on all four
corners<00:01:28.570> here<00:01:29.230> I<00:01:29.380> think's<00:01:29.920> one<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.160> these<00:01:30.250> has

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
corners here I think's one of these has

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.950 
corners here I think's one of these has
its<00:01:30.640> own<00:01:30.760> retainer<00:01:31.120> so<00:01:31.390> when<00:01:31.510> it<00:01:31.600> comes<00:01:31.720> to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
its own retainer so when it comes to

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.810 
its own retainer so when it comes to
pitch<00:01:32.500> air<00:01:32.800> putting<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.250> tent<00:01:33.370> away<00:01:33.520> rather

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
pitch air putting the tent away rather

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.670 
pitch air putting the tent away rather
we<00:01:34.360> wrap<00:01:34.540> up<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.810> guy<00:01:34.930> Lane<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.260> our<00:01:35.350> hands<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
we wrap up the guy Lane in our hands and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.140 
we wrap up the guy Lane in our hands and
pop<00:01:35.860> them<00:01:35.980> in<00:01:36.130> here<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.610> keep<00:01:36.730> them<00:01:36.910> from

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
pop them in here just to keep them from

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.370 
pop them in here just to keep them from
getting<00:01:37.300> tangled<00:01:37.570> up<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.960> next<00:01:38.170> time<00:01:38.290> you

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
getting tangled up the next time you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.230 
getting tangled up the next time you
come<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.590> use<00:01:38.830> them<00:01:38.980> you'll<00:01:39.580> also<00:01:39.730> find<00:01:40.030> that

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
come to use them you'll also find that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.940 
come to use them you'll also find that
we<00:01:40.450> have<00:01:40.600> some<00:01:40.810> ventilation<00:01:41.110> pods<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
we have some ventilation pods on the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.650 
we have some ventilation pods on the
front<00:01:42.190> of<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.730> tent<00:01:42.910> just<00:01:43.060> allowing<00:01:43.390> cool

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
front of the tent just allowing cool

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.450 
front of the tent just allowing cool
fresh<00:01:43.900> air<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.260> here<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.890> there<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.190> also<00:01:45.340> one

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
fresh air in here and there is also one
