well<00:00:01.290> we're<00:00:01.469> here<00:00:01.709> along<00:00:01.979> the<00:00:02.159> river<00:00:02.810> New<00:00:03.810> York

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
well we're here along the river New York

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.080 
well we're here along the river New York
County<00:00:05.150> one<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.359> dams<00:00:06.629> has<00:00:07.080> drawn<00:00:08.090> down

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
County one of the dams has drawn down

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.830 
County one of the dams has drawn down
the<00:00:09.269> water<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:10.260> check<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.920> dam<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the water to check out the dam and as a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.519 
the water to check out the dam and as a
result<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:15.199> shoreline<00:00:16.220> has<00:00:17.220> been<00:00:17.580> exposed

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
result the shoreline has been exposed

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.230 
result the shoreline has been exposed
now<00:00:19.529> unfortunately<00:00:19.980> most<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.820> covered

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
now unfortunately most of it's covered

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.109 
now unfortunately most of it's covered
in<00:00:21.359> mud<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:22.160> there<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.550> spots<00:00:23.789> where

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
in mud but there are some spots where

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.769 
in mud but there are some spots where
you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.449> find<00:00:24.900> artifacts<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> rocks<00:00:27.599> that

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
you can find artifacts the rocks that

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
you can find artifacts the rocks that
you<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.710> part<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.449> canal

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you see there are part of the canal

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.410 
you see there are part of the canal
system<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> can't<00:00:32.850> find<00:00:33.120> too<00:00:33.360> many

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
system so you can't find too many

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
system so you can't find too many
artifacts<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.590> we'll<00:00:34.770> try<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.340> show

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
artifacts here but we'll try and show

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.470 
artifacts here but we'll try and show
you<00:00:35.579> where<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.120> looking

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you where you can this is looking

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
you where you can this is looking
downstream<00:00:41.270> towards<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> dam<00:00:43.370> again<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
downstream towards the dam again all the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.880 
downstream towards the dam again all the
rocks<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.300> are<00:00:45.719> part<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> canal

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
rocks you see are part of the canal

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
rocks you see are part of the canal
system<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> artifacts<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.039> are<00:00:50.129> going

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
system so the artifacts that are going

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
system so the artifacts that are going
to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.000> washed<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.079> on

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
to be washed out or going to be on

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.360 
to be washed out or going to be on
either<00:00:52.559> side<00:00:52.949> as<00:00:53.690> rocky<00:00:54.690> pile<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:56.129> course

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
either side as rocky pile of course

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.799 
either side as rocky pile of course
there's<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.640> lot<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.910> stuff<00:00:57.149> great<00:00:57.420> under<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
there's a lot of stuff great under the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.150 
there's a lot of stuff great under the
stones<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.270> canal<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:01.160> unfortunately

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
stones of the canal but unfortunately

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.680 
stones of the canal but unfortunately
it's<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.430> take<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> while<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> wash

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's gonna take a while for the to wash

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.810 
it's gonna take a while for the to wash
out<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.500> ever<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> let's<00:01:06.810> continue<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.820> see

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out if ever so let's continue and see

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
out if ever so let's continue and see
what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:11.720> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> areas

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
what we can see this is one of the areas

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.880 
what we can see this is one of the areas
where<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> chance<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.490> find<00:01:14.939> something

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
where we have a chance to find something

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
where we have a chance to find something
the<00:01:16.890> whole<00:01:18.500> of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> canal<00:01:20.689> is<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.049> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the whole of the canal is out in this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
the whole of the canal is out in this
area<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.659> land<00:01:25.380> back<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:27.450> all<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
area and the land back here is all the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.440 
area and the land back here is all the
original<00:01:28.700> land<00:01:30.320> from<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:32.000> up<00:01:33.000> towards

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
original land from here up towards

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.620 
original land from here up towards
filled-in<00:01:33.869> along<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> road<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> basically

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
filled-in along the road so basically

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.480 
filled-in along the road so basically
this<00:01:36.930> area<00:01:37.820> has<00:01:38.820> artifacts<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.310> can

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this area has artifacts in it as you can

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
this area has artifacts in it as you can
see<00:01:41.549> most<00:01:42.119> are<00:01:42.299> covered<00:01:42.689> by<00:01:42.869> mud<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:45.840> you

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
see most are covered by mud but if you

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.330 
see most are covered by mud but if you
run<00:01:46.140> into<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> spot<00:01:47.270> such<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.009> see

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
run into a spot such as this you can see

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.910 
run into a spot such as this you can see
that<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
that the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.710 
that the
water<00:01:52.520> has<00:01:52.820> washed<00:01:53.180> away<00:01:53.420> some<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.720> mud

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
water has washed away some of the mud

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.350 
water has washed away some of the mud
off<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:58.400> if<00:01:58.520> anything<00:01:58.730> happens<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.270> be

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
off of it and if anything happens to be

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.410 
off of it and if anything happens to be
laying<00:01:59.630> there

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
laying there

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.219 
laying there
it<00:02:01.810> could<00:02:01.960> be<00:02:02.049> found<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:04.420> can<00:02:04.570> also<00:02:04.720> see<00:02:05.110> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
it could be found you can also see the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.320 
it could be found you can also see the
original<00:02:05.909> soil<00:02:08.310> which<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.340> being<00:02:09.700> washed

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
original soil which is being washed

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.280 
original soil which is being washed
exposed<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:12.250> we'll<00:02:12.400> look<00:02:12.520> around<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:14.080> this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
exposed so we'll look around in this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.830 
exposed so we'll look around in this
area<00:02:14.650> for<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.860> while<00:02:15.450> let's<00:02:16.450> see<00:02:16.569> if<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.720> can

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
area for a while let's see if we can

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.520 
area for a while let's see if we can
find<00:02:17.020> anything<00:02:19.620> well<00:02:20.620> here's<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.920> works<00:02:21.550> toment

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
find anything well here's a works toment

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.270 
find anything well here's a works toment
rather<00:02:23.530> easy<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:24.100> see<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:26.400> way<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> was<00:02:29.280> banged

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
rather easy to see the way it was banged

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.170 
rather easy to see the way it was banged
on<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:34.000> at<00:02:34.150> least<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.540> larger<00:02:35.260> things<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:37.000> be

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
on so at least the larger things can be

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.910 
on so at least the larger things can be
seen<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.019> mud<00:02:40.319> well<00:02:41.319> I<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.530> started

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
seen in the mud well I just started

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.680 
seen in the mud well I just started
scratching<00:02:42.430> around<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.150> likely-looking<00:02:43.870> spot

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
scratching around a likely-looking spot

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.759 
scratching around a likely-looking spot
for<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.750> scratching<00:02:47.140> sound<00:02:47.380> popped<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:49.560> point

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
for a scratching sound popped a point

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.880 
for a scratching sound popped a point
missing<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> base<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:53.200> there's<00:02:53.410> stuff<00:02:53.620> here

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
missing the base so there's stuff here

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.530 
missing the base so there's stuff here
