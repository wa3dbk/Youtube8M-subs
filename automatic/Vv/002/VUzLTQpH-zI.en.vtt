00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.130 
that's we do not know what we can do
with<00:05:01.010> that<00:05:01.150> because<00:05:02.150> we<00:05:02.420> are<00:05:02.510> not<00:05:04.270> we<00:05:05.270> we<00:05:05.900> do

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
with that because we are not we we do

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.540 
with that because we are not we we do
not<00:05:06.170> know<00:05:06.440> how<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.590> garden<00:05:07.010> or<00:05:07.310> anything

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
not know how to garden or anything

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.100 
not know how to garden or anything
everything<00:05:07.970> dies<00:05:08.270> out<00:05:08.570> because<00:05:08.780> we're<00:05:08.960> pretty

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
everything dies out because we're pretty

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
everything dies out because we're pretty
much<00:05:09.320> in<00:05:09.380> a<00:05:09.560> desert<00:05:09.800> that's<00:05:10.610> pretty<00:05:10.910> much<00:05:12.130> we

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
much in a desert that's pretty much we

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.440 
much in a desert that's pretty much we
have<00:05:13.160> like<00:05:13.430> clay<00:05:14.350> instead<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.790> soil<00:05:16.790> but

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
have like clay instead of soil but

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.480 
have like clay instead of soil but
hopefully<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:18.020> can<00:05:19.900> fix<00:05:20.900> it<00:05:21.230> and<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:22.190> don't<00:05:22.280> know

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
hopefully we can fix it and I don't know

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.030 
hopefully we can fix it and I don't know
I<00:05:22.550> think<00:05:22.670> we<00:05:23.060> might<00:05:23.330> push<00:05:23.570> back<00:05:23.810> the<00:05:23.960> wall<00:05:24.170> make

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
I think we might push back the wall make

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.850 
I think we might push back the wall make
the<00:05:25.160> backyard<00:05:25.550> bigger<00:05:25.820> so<00:05:26.450> we'll<00:05:27.320> see<00:05:27.560> but
