00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
more realistic it may look weird now but

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.970 
more realistic it may look weird now but
just<00:02:10.330> keep<00:02:10.479> adding<00:02:10.690> more<00:02:10.869> pieces<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.440> hair<00:02:11.769> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.110 

this<00:02:17.410> part<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.800> pretty<00:02:18.070> tricky<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.970> more

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
this part is pretty tricky but the more

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.820 
this part is pretty tricky but the more
you<00:02:19.180> practice<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> easier<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.590> gets
