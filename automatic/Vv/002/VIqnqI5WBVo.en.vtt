what the fakie wall rides all about my
obstacle<00:00:10.530> here<00:00:10.679> today<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.130> tree<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.880> it's

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
obstacle here today is a tree so it's

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.690 
obstacle here today is a tree so it's
more<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.660> fakie<00:00:13.139> tree<00:00:13.469> ride<00:00:13.650> either<00:00:14.400> way<00:00:14.639> you

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
more of a fakie tree ride either way you

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.440 
more of a fakie tree ride either way you
go<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.120> it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
go with it

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.910 

alright<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.450> fakie<00:00:36.810> wall<00:00:36.960> ride<00:00:37.170> we're

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
alright so the fakie wall ride we're

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.730 
alright so the fakie wall ride we're
true<00:00:38.130> ride<00:00:38.310> in<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.490> case<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> want<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.470> go<00:00:40.560> up

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
true ride in my case you want to go up

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.430 
true ride in my case you want to go up
with<00:00:41.310> enough<00:00:41.520> speed<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> clear<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.300> jump<00:00:42.540> or

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
with enough speed to clear the jump or

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.530 
with enough speed to clear the jump or
the<00:00:44.130> transition<00:00:44.490> that<00:00:44.670> you're<00:00:44.880> taking<00:00:45.150> off<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the transition that you're taking off of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.400 
the transition that you're taking off of
now<00:00:46.530> keep<00:00:46.740> in<00:00:46.860> mind<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.910> fakie<00:00:48.330> wall<00:00:48.990> ride<00:00:49.200> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
now keep in mind the fakie wall ride can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.260 
now keep in mind the fakie wall ride can
be<00:00:49.530> any<00:00:49.980> kind<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.400> obstacle<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.970> can<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.150> on

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
be any kind of obstacle it can be on

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.450 
be any kind of obstacle it can be on
ramps<00:00:51.690> could<00:00:51.900> be<00:00:51.990> on<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.230> tree<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.130> has<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
ramps could be on a tree that just has a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
ramps could be on a tree that just has a
nice<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.910> transition<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.630> bottom<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
nice little transition at the bottom of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
nice little transition at the bottom of
it<00:00:55.220> basically<00:00:56.220> you<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.490> to<00:00:56.520> get<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
it basically you want to get up to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.220 
it basically you want to get up to
transition<00:00:57.360> enough<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> get<00:00:57.870> yourself

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
transition enough to get yourself

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.160 
transition enough to get yourself
completely<00:00:58.740> vertical<00:00:59.700> get<00:01:00.510> both<00:01:00.690> tires<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
completely vertical get both tires to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.980 
completely vertical get both tires to
touch<00:01:01.380> in<00:01:02.160> my<00:01:02.610> case<00:01:02.880> here<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.330> have<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> little

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
touch in my case here I have a little

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.110 
touch in my case here I have a little
gap<00:01:04.230> between<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.800> tree<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.790> axial

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
gap between the tree and the axial

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.990 
gap between the tree and the axial
transition<00:01:06.660> which<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.410> that<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.850> so<00:01:08.850> once

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
transition which about that much so once

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700 
transition which about that much so once
I<00:01:09.120> get<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.479> top<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.350> both<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.530> my

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
I get to the top and get both of my

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.820 
I get to the top and get both of my
tires<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.490> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> pop<00:01:13.020> off<00:01:13.290> keep

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
tires on I need to kind of pop off keep

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
tires on I need to kind of pop off keep
myself<00:01:14.070> level<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:16.410> know<00:01:16.500> push

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
myself level if you you know push

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.350 
myself level if you you know push
forward<00:01:17.100> too<00:01:17.250> much<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.760> pull<00:01:17.940> backwards

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
forward too much or you pull backwards

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880 
forward too much or you pull backwards
too<00:01:18.479> much<00:01:18.660> would<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.410> dangerous

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
too much would be really dangerous

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.560 
too much would be really dangerous
I'm<00:01:20.490> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> come<00:01:20.850> into<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> trainee<00:01:21.360> all

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
I'm going to come into the trainee all

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
I'm going to come into the trainee all
sloppy<00:01:21.979> basically<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.100> want<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.520> up

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
sloppy basically you just want to go up

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.390 
sloppy basically you just want to go up
mimic<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.660> tree<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.440> tires<00:01:25.710> keep

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
mimic the tree with your two tires keep

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
mimic the tree with your two tires keep
it<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.640> keep<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:27.720> straight<00:01:27.869> as<00:01:28.140> possible

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it as keep it as straight as possible

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
it as keep it as straight as possible
and<00:01:28.860> pull<00:01:29.520> yourself<00:01:29.820> back<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.300> tranny

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and pull yourself back into the tranny

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.540 
and pull yourself back into the tranny
and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.590> you're<00:01:31.710> gonna<00:01:31.800> have<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.040> roll<00:01:32.310> back

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
and then you're gonna have to roll back

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.890 
and then you're gonna have to roll back
rolling<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.330> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.540> bit<00:01:33.720> technical

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
rolling back is a little bit technical

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
rolling back is a little bit technical
you<00:01:34.710> might<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> work<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> rolling<00:01:35.670> back

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you might want to work on rolling back

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120 
you might want to work on rolling back
before<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.330> anything<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.590> once<00:01:37.979> you've

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
before you do anything so once you've

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.010 
before you do anything so once you've
done<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.340> you've<00:01:39.060> made<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.570> through<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
done that you've made it through the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260 
done that you've made it through the
fakie<00:01:40.350> wall<00:01:40.740> ride<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.190> tree<00:01:41.610> ride<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.940> my<00:01:41.970> case

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
fakie wall ride or tree ride in my case

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:53.830 
fakie wall ride or tree ride in my case
let<00:01:43.110> me<00:01:43.140> give<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.590> walkthrough

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.310 

take<00:01:54.469> up<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.710> little<00:01:54.799> bit<00:01:55.009> of<00:01:55.100> speed<00:01:56.320> make

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
take up a little bit of speed make

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.319 
take up a little bit of speed make
contact<00:01:58.899> pull<00:01:59.899> off<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:01.429> got<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.759> pull<00:02:01.939> off<00:02:02.119> if

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
contact pull off you got to pull off if

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:03.789 
contact pull off you got to pull off if
you<00:02:02.450> don't<00:02:02.539> pull<00:02:02.780> off<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.140> case<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.560> little

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
you don't pull off and case that little

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.289 
you don't pull off and case that little
thing<00:02:04.009> it's<00:02:04.429> going<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.640> throw<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.880> right<00:02:05.119> to

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
thing it's going to throw you right to

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.169 
thing it's going to throw you right to
your<00:02:05.359> back<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.490> pull<00:02:07.640> off<00:02:07.789> just

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
your back so I like to pull off just

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.609 
your back so I like to pull off just
enough<00:02:08.479> where<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:08.750> land<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.289> training

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
enough where I land in the training
