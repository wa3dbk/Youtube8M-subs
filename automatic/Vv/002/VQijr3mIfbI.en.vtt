00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
actually all crappy sky in me it'd be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.570 
actually all crappy sky in me it'd be
really<00:02:10.379> nasty<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.860> his<00:02:10.950> two<00:02:11.129> racks<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
really nasty of his two racks and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.860 
really nasty of his two racks and
against<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:12.900> again<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> gold<00:02:13.410> too

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
against this so then again a gold too

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.640 
against this so then again a gold too
shouldn't<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.739> strong<00:02:15.299> his<00:02:16.299> repays<00:02:16.930> se

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
shouldn't be that strong his repays se

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.809 
shouldn't be that strong his repays se
be<00:02:17.769> scorned<00:02:18.040> answer<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.340> probably<00:02:18.489> no<00:02:18.760> two

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
be scorned answer is probably no two

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.360 
be scorned answer is probably no two
racks<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:20.049> I'll<00:02:20.530> just<00:02:20.680> build<00:02:20.830> an<00:02:20.950> overlord

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
racks and I'll just build an overlord

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.430 
racks and I'll just build an overlord
here<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.750> yeah<00:02:22.900> I'm<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.170> build<00:02:23.290> some

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
here so yeah I'm going to build some

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.990 
here so yeah I'm going to build some
wings<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.980> standard<00:02:24.280> build<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.730> called

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
wings it's a standard build it's called

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.350 
wings it's a standard build it's called
like<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.420> Jerry<00:02:25.659> zvt<00:02:26.170> or<00:02:26.470> something<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.360> you

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
like the Jerry zvt or something and you

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.930 
like the Jerry zvt or something and you
know<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.540> basically<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.379> try<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.920> make<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
know you basically you try and make the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.509 
know you basically you try and make the
natural<00:02:31.540> lift<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:35.290> since<00:02:36.099> these<00:02:36.220> are<00:02:36.280> gold

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
natural lift but since these are gold

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.100 
natural lift but since these are gold
plays<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.970> generally<00:02:37.450> get<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> main<00:02:37.900> base

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
plays you generally get in the main base

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.979 
plays you generally get in the main base
and<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.680> really<00:02:38.980> really<00:02:39.190> strong<00:02:39.579> I<00:02:39.989> might

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
and that is really really strong I might

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.830 
and that is really really strong I might
have<00:02:41.349> to<00:02:41.579> walk<00:02:42.579> up<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.909> scalp<00:02:43.450> because<00:02:43.599> he

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
have to walk up and scalp because he

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.770 
have to walk up and scalp because he
might<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:45.549> is<00:02:45.760> kind<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.030> funky<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.599> don't

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
might this is kind of funky I don't

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.949 
might this is kind of funky I don't
worry<00:02:46.930> they're<00:02:47.109> cb1<00:02:48.599> alright<00:02:49.599> so<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.780> need<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
worry they're cb1 alright so we need to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.780 
worry they're cb1 alright so we need to
pull<00:02:50.109> off<00:02:50.230> gas<00:02:50.410> obviously<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.489> haven't<00:02:51.640> got

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
pull off gas obviously we haven't got

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.250 
pull off gas obviously we haven't got
much<00:02:51.819> use<00:02:52.000> for<00:02:52.150> gas<00:02:52.510> when<00:02:52.989> we're<00:02:53.140> only

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
much use for gas when we're only

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.530 
much use for gas when we're only
wielding<00:02:53.650> Ling's<00:02:53.859> one<00:02:54.129> two<00:02:54.340> three<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.819> two

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
wielding Ling's one two three one two

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.470 
wielding Ling's one two three one two
three<00:02:59.310> STV's<00:03:00.310> back<00:03:00.549> in<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.790> base<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.239> cool

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
three STV's back in the base that's cool

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.069 
three STV's back in the base that's cool
now<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.230> know<00:03:02.349> he's<00:03:02.560> not<00:03:03.390> doing<00:03:04.390> anything<00:03:04.659> silly

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
now I know he's not doing anything silly

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.630 
now I know he's not doing anything silly
probably<00:03:05.920> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.099> go<00:03:06.190> ahead<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.519> Gale

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
probably going to go ahead and Gale

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.699 
probably going to go ahead and Gale
leaves<00:03:06.670> hopefully<00:03:07.390> is<00:03:07.450> not<00:03:07.569> one<00:03:07.750> Basin<00:03:08.200> that's

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
leaves hopefully is not one Basin that's

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.020 
leaves hopefully is not one Basin that's
probably<00:03:08.890> pretty<00:03:09.129> common<00:03:09.549> in<00:03:09.609> gold<00:03:09.819> league

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
probably pretty common in gold league

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.660 
probably pretty common in gold league
and<00:03:10.650> we'll<00:03:11.650> go<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.920> med<00:03:12.069> room<00:03:12.220> with<00:03:12.459> wings

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
and we'll go and med room with wings

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.349 
and we'll go and med room with wings
real<00:03:12.940> soon<00:03:13.239> okay<00:03:14.519> one<00:03:15.519> more<00:03:15.730> turn<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:17.280> now

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
real soon okay one more turn and now

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.039 
real soon okay one more turn and now
this<00:03:19.359> is<00:03:19.599> where<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.930> fun<00:03:20.290> begins<00:03:21.630> wings<00:03:22.630> on

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
this is where the fun begins wings on

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.750 
this is where the fun begins wings on
wings<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:26.650> we're<00:03:26.739> gonna<00:03:26.859> build<00:03:27.040> Ling's<00:03:27.370> I'm

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
wings so we're gonna build Ling's I'm

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.720 
wings so we're gonna build Ling's I'm
going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.000> hide<00:03:28.090> them<00:03:28.239> all<00:03:28.389> in<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.660> main<00:03:28.810> base

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
going to hide them all in the main base

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.800 
going to hide them all in the main base
hopefully<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.790> expanded<00:03:31.299> let's<00:03:31.450> have<00:03:31.569> a<00:03:31.599> look

this morning mist overlord for a little

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.729 
this morning mist overlord for a little
second<00:03:40.450> expand<00:03:40.810> Ellis<00:03:41.109> is<00:03:41.260> sending<00:03:41.560> all

actually<00:03:42.069> well<00:03:44.489> normally<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.849> would<00:03:46.269> be<00:03:46.419> a

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
actually well normally that would be a

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.689 
actually well normally that would be a
cc<00:03:47.199> first<00:03:47.530> they<00:03:47.709> might<00:03:47.859> be<00:03:47.949> CC<00:03:48.250> first<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:48.639> the

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
cc first they might be CC first in the

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:53.369 
cc first they might be CC first in the
high<00:03:48.790> ground<00:03:50.609> because<00:03:51.609> if<00:03:52.000> it<00:03:52.419> was<00:03:52.599> uh<00:03:52.629> it

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
high ground because if it was uh it

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.619 
high ground because if it was uh it
wasn't<00:03:54.370> CC<00:03:54.790> first<00:03:55.000> he<00:03:55.180> would<00:03:55.299> have<00:03:55.389> four

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
wasn't CC first he would have four

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.240 
wasn't CC first he would have four
Marines<00:03:55.959> right<00:03:56.230> now<00:03:56.379> but<00:03:57.370> he<00:03:57.430> hasn't<00:03:59.250> release

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
Marines right now but he hasn't release

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.379 
Marines right now but he hasn't release
is<00:04:00.400> not<00:04:00.549> showing<00:04:00.790> them<00:04:02.879> all<00:04:03.879> right<00:04:04.060> let's<00:04:04.239> see

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
is not showing them all right let's see

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.050 
is not showing them all right let's see
what<00:04:04.419> we<00:04:04.629> can<00:04:04.750> do<00:04:05.019> guys<00:04:05.760> probably<00:04:06.760> gonna<00:04:06.940> take

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
what we can do guys probably gonna take

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.500 
what we can do guys probably gonna take
a<00:04:07.090> third<00:04:07.299> base<00:04:07.510> behind<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:09.180> yeah<00:04:10.180> we'll<00:04:10.329> take

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
a third base behind this yeah we'll take

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.960 
a third base behind this yeah we'll take
a<00:04:10.569> third<00:04:10.780> piece

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
a third piece

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.350 
a third piece
I<00:04:13.160> think<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.220> got<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.520> retard<00:04:14.880> magnet<00:04:15.150> ahem

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
I think I got to retard magnet ahem

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.030 
I think I got to retard magnet ahem
let's<00:04:15.750> see<00:04:15.900> if<00:04:15.960> we<00:04:16.079> can<00:04:16.200> make<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.470> retard<00:04:16.860> mag

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
let's see if we can make the retard mag

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.660 
let's see if we can make the retard mag
