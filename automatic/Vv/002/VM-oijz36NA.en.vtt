00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.549
 unit virtual training and have 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.720
 we get a lot of news 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.370
 Of course they will be a little bit too 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 That's why we're busy 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.389
 put up with the wall today 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.040
 free surges 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 I also have my assistant again 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.369
 brought the already known blue 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.369
 Wall 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.520
 yes and because the blue wall alone 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.870
 Of course we can not 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.940
 because fortification brought 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:34.000
 people who help us put in the wall 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.950
 the boys a foul before the penalty area 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.200
 we see the gate is actually for us 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.420
 open we could shoot but the 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.960
 Goalkeeper it was informed he will now 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 put a wall yes we have now 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.660
 seen 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.070
 the free kick takes place in front of the goal instead 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.809
 is of course a corresponding distance 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.730
 where we have to put a wall like 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.550
 this wall will be erected and now this 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.620
 we show you and now we see from 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.780
 the goal line from the goalkeeper's point of view 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.300
 where the free kick will take place 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.250
 outside the penalty area about one 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.839
 little on the right is the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.710
 Striker came to fall 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.960
 the referee on free kick 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 decided and we have to be our goalkeeper 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.580
 Now deal with the wall 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.110
 Let's get the boys, the boys 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 unfortunately only perfectly positioned 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.229
 so our goalkeeper will be wrong now 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.299
 put the wall 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.299
 he makes that out of short posts 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.990
 through appropriate gestures or loud 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.940
 the wall will now be called 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.860
 The goalkeeper Lehmann at the post and will 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:42.490
 Now set the wall so that the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.070
 rightmost wall you put so 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.110
 that will be between him and the second 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 in the wall standing the ball too 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.890
 So our goalkeeper has to lie down 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.480
 Wall 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 instead of going to the left very far 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.620
 shift right 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.930
 he will do that now yes it is 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.390
 wall correctly the short corner is to you 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.040
 survived a little to the east that it 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.720
 therefore made a left foot if 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.180
 should try the ball around the wall 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.649
 to pull around on the short corner that 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.540
 that is not so easy and there the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.550
 wall also still covers while now 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.100
 Our goalkeeper now in the long corner 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.990
 which wall is gone indeed done 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.390
 the supply now goes in 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.630
 his goalkeeper corner exactly in the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.330
 middle axis between the outer post 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.630
 which is uncovered and the outside edge of the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.280
 Wall 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.810
 He can also move from the line now 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.370
 dial in the ball to push against 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.430
 the gate a little bit smaller too 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.430
 do 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 now the goalkeeper is in the gate away and 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.200
 actually expected the shot the goal 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.880
 is relatively small what we now look 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.060
 the voice perspective, too 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.050
 View so now at the goalkeeper 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.700
 an ideal position where the gate almost 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.120
 Unreachable, the ball is now high 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.060
 pushed over it or over the wall 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.130
 Correspondingly, as they say 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.990
 Of course, our goalkeeper is flying on one 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.150
 long flight curve up in the angle 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.070
 if at all the striker first 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.850
 creates so cleverly through the ball 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.010
 to bring the wall 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.100
 the short corner which the goalkeeper now 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.340
 Covering alone is through the wall 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.720
 perfectly delivered the long corner 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.880
 where the goalkeeper stands is natural 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.280
 here by the goalkeeper more than 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 secured there should happen nothing 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.200
 we will test this 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.060
 yes and as we saw at one 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.640
 free kick shooting is on the spot 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.620
 then just make some of the balls 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.050
 others are inside the blue wall 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.359
 complies with this regularly 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.560
 training and our free-kick wall the 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.959
 we made ourselves out of the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.940
 Boys are also there to help us 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.740
 we learn to build and learn wall 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.480
 also simultaneously with 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.830
 our field players together this 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.810
 shoot at the gate 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.300
 to recycle the corresponding 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.100
 Free kicks to appropriate opportunities 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.860
 Of course , to train 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.600
 so we hope you enjoy this video 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.600
 I liked it until next time 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.350
 yes, we also like to always put 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.690
 again a war material before ours 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.890
 Boys consists of a hanger 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.780
 a corresponding serenade with 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.550
 corresponding holder and one 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.870
 think about it t shirt we can do it 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.020
 not only use one here now 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.490
 but we create pollution 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.980
 so could my flanks 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.690
 training or shooting on the goal 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.760
 simulate corresponding opponents with it 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.190
 she simply orders from an old one 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.770
 t shirt and are therefore for the 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.960
 sports field optimally suitable as a dummy 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.820
 especially for clubs they may not 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.450
 the money is expensive with it somewhere 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.460
 has to create 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.870
 they consist of materials which 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.910
 actually very cheap everywhere 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.580
 you can and you really can 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.300
 Doing it yourself and you are investing 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.300
 one explained there
