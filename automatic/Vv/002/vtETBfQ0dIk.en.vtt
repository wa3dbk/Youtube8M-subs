 miraculous plant is a plant that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.759
 as correctly said, there are many 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.220
 window-sills and somehow its undeserved 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.100
 not like ghouls tend to be men 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.350
 children and animals because she 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 prickly enough kind of tenacious but 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.989
 occupies a lot of space on the pope 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 his name is hello hello i am here 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.820
 representatives of this kind of spines well 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.579
 yes, maybe not as beautiful as 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.100
 I would like to but we do not show off 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 will we be treated actually yes 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 this is really a unique plant 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.480
 its properties are healing well, just 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.160
 astounding for the treatment and skin and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.920
 all sorts of dermatological problems 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.740
 today we will prepare a mask which 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 invigorates hair and gives them energy life 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 and makes the hair very elastic and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.720
 shiny and also this mask is very 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 affects hair growth and especially this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.840
 mask is useful to do 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.690
 winter time now 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.730
 so write down the recipe and masochki 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.010
 we will try to think so what to do 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.870
 its quick to apply is easy and worth it 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.140
 it is inexpensive it is inexpensive 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.450
 the main thing that was falcons and what are you 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.120
 reunite that you can actually just 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.190
 aloe juice in favor of yes by the way I have 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.860
 a little further tell you how we cook 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.770
 aloe juice and you even need it just 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.080
 clean rub into scalp 2-3 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 times a week to actively 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 treat hair and so we need to take 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.540
 half 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:59.760
 ripe avocado is somewhere here that's so m 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 avocado pulp ripe pulp next 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.190
 the moment we take honey and honey and us 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 need a big teaspoon by the way 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.239
 honey can be warmed a little on 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 steam bath just so he was 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.490
 a little more fluid and warm matter in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.460
 that warm honey 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.940
 connects to others much faster 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.520
 components 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 any home cosmetics you start 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.060
 prepare masochka for hair and foundation 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:29.120
 I understand this salad is a dessert and we 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:33.290
 always say to you what is always what 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.960
 beneficial for our skin hair nails all 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.400
 it is quite possible to eat and that is different to 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.340
 logical cosmetics 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.410
 come and eat a bath of masks obviously we would 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.540
 would like I wish she had hair we 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.670
 for some reason cause we think we bought 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.320
 beautifully wrapped something small drawn and 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.110
 so on all this is very fast to us 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.760
 will help and just ordinary chemistry called and 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.610
 a little bit there added this valuable 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.900
 product and so with honey we connected and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.660
 now we have added one egg yolk 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.440
 again the natural component yes matter 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.900
 tom that yolk 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.720
 this is a great building material 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.410
 for hair, he performs the way the function 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.290
 shampoo 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.300
 over drums red washes and cleans 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.670
 hair plus yolk is 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.350
 biological so builder to our 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.750
 hair i mean it just fills 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.360
 some prague links in the scales of hair in 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.150
 which then break and hair 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.960
 losing vitality you will and now we 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 add 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.880
 and he has a teaspoon of lemon lemon 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.800
 gives your hair a great ticket and very 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 useful as vitamin vitamin c 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.560
 we especially in the winter and air dry under 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.470
 we wear hats and here we come 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.970
 to the most important alois calorie home 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.550
 cosmetics as in traditional medicine 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.140
 used differently there are recipes 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.570
 when enough nip off 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.970
 leaf clean it rinse a little 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.160
 squeeze juice use raw juice but 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.710
 there is a so-called biological method 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.040
 stimulation stretching you what we do we 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.080
 tearing leaves that are 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.660
 at the bottom of the very same either 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.170
 the middle of my necessarily boiled 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.690
 by water 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.050
 well blot dry to not 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.359
 Moisture remained on them and I wrap 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.420
 I wrap up for example have simple landscape 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.880
 cold sheets of paper but only not 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.880
 in the newspaper is by no means a tracing paper 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.700
 that's just good paper and i can 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.370
 it's such a seal and we put these 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.400
 aloe leaves in the refrigerator compartment 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.520
 where vegetables are stored and leave from 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.290
 eight to twelve days what happens 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.270
 that is very very actively begin 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.750
 concentrate accumulate all 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.060
 useful properties of this plant when 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.820
 we got 8 12 days passed 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.070
 some leaves may darken it 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.780
 means that this plant is no good then 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.090
 we have black dark leaves 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.490
 discard therefore stock up if you 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.550
 need 2 petals then tear them up 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.360
 five for example and squeeze the juice through 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.700
 Marlechka 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.200
 and now we have such a juice 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.210
 sometimes it may be a little darker 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.280
 sometimes it may be lighter everything depends on 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.110
 plants and 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.990
 falcon and we add the very-most 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:19.730
 The last moment now is this mask 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:22.430
 which we are ready to apply to the skin 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.550
 heads we cover completely the hair 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.790
 good good good soaking hair and 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.740
 good rubbing in skype call and then we 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.860
 take a towel terry 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:37.790
 and dab it in the bark of whose water is right under 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.250
 tap you and why squeeze all the water and 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.310
 we cover this hot towel 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.890
 make it so warm what 's going on 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.740
 blood circulation begins to open 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.530
 scales and all these microelements here 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.840
 all these juices are contained very 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.170
 very good hair is absorbed and 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.270
 soaked in this mask applied to 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:03.740
 dry or we sheltered on dry hair 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.440
 before you wash them and what 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.200
 I wonder what after this mask is like 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.300
 rule if you have dry hair then you 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.060
 don't even need shampoo for what 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.480
 the yolk worked like a shampoo for how long 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.730
 We keep this mask we keep 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:22.460
 30-40 minutes and change the towel better 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.020
 just as if it had cooled not to freeze and 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.380
 no way towel should always 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.740
 be very warm hot 40 through 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.050
 40 minutes we washed the hair dry head 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.120
 twist it for example on beautiful 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.400
 curlers whether just comb and you 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.330
 wonder what brilliant beautiful 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.419
 hair 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.879
 on your head really how often 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.060
 you can use this mask and when 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.219
 will the effect of such be just after 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.229
 first time use and how often 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:54.439
 you can make this mask once a week 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.969
 completely and do not be afraid that you overdo it 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.129
 You can also alternate this mask with 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.099
 Others like salted or mustard 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.979
 about which we have toning 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:06.500
 mask for shine true hair take 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.990
 half melted and ripe 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.550
 avocado grind its authors 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.509
 add mashed 1 teaspoon honey 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.180
 mix well bring to 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.610
 the consistency of thick cream 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.110
 add one egg yolk as well as 1 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.180
 a teaspoon of lemon juice 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.120
 biological stimulated and plant 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.610
 aloe we squeeze juice quantities 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.180
 turn off the spoon and also add our 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:35.180
 mask carefully mix and aloe 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.159
 proved again that it is infinitely useful 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.569
 including for our hair thank you
