00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi it's marc of top info today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.700
 short videos presenting the 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.200
 delta helmet sounded yesterday is fang that is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.660
 manufactured by so a brand that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 is called color block and that is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 marketed especially in France by 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.520
 a company called modelabs 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 who was a famous distributor and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.550
 same designer accessories for 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 phones 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.550
 so here is the color block delta one year 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 headphone what is this is it 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.490
 famous helmet that you see you 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.539
 see now on which I want 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 come back in terms of materials of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.540
 composition that plugs into jack 3.5 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.010
 and who has a special feature 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.510
 only the first is first a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.420
 specific adapter so once from 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.649
 extension cord will allow you to connect 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.160
 minors even more pleasant and more 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.140
 easy 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.960
 the helmet since you have an extension 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.730
 here is the first particularity 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.320
 the second particularity of this 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.680
 phone so much too much the fact that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.899
 I am unfolding a cable 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 immeasurably long is this famous 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.520
 small case then this beauty a setting 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.510
 volume a sound setting 1 necessarily 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.610
 a small wheel 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.930
 he also has a button hung 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.640
 to drop out simply because you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.250
 can you can also re-read this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 helmet simply as a pedestrian kit 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.119
 then a pedestrian kit certainly more 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 bulky than the famous headphones that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 is time that you are provided with the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.400
 phones in general but let's not forget 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 not that there what is sought here 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.700
 it is a quality of its momentum precisely 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 to come back on this quality of sound 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 she is bluffing I was blown away by 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 the sound quality of this famous helmet 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.329
 so and the delta honor is a fan of 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920
 blocks of color block during I was 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.650
 bluffed simply by the quality of the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.570
 its particular to know that the good your 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.860
 headphones are stuck on your ears 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 by this mold which is an anti foam 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.549
 sweaty and who precisely avoids 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.009
 to have a loss of sound and a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.850
 interfering with your own music by 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.470
 external sounds 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.579
 so you have to know in fact once 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 you put that on your ears you 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 are really cut off from the world 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 you hear nothing else what makes 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.880
 that behind this helmet and is not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.780
 accepted in terms of use 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.740
 road it's there that if you drive 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.200
 you do not have the right 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.840
 well, you probably already know that 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.039
 if you 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.019
 you drive so that's a 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.280
 four wheels a back you're not going to 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.209
 right to have this kind of helmet on 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.250
 ears just because that 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.470
 you world cup and that's the goal 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.790
 the sound that is broadcast by this kind of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.379
 class and very very very good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.190
 quality 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.450
 once again I was blown away 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.769
 by the quality of the sound I was bluffÃ© 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.629
 by the particular the bass management 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.580
 and which are very well rendered are 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.080
 powerful west a phone that is going 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.790
 up to 105 decibels so as much you 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.840
 say 150 watts so much tell you that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.459
 when you put that thoroughly on the 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.510
 ears it's a bug 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.830
 so it's a very very powerful sound 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.329
 very good bass management and also 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.380
 is also very good treble management 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.110
 so in general 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.340
 where this kind of case what's struggling to 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.630
 in general it is on the treble while 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.970
 just because the bass has been 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.579
 quite easily surrenderable the elected 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.930
 get to sizzle very quickly and 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.940
 well here we have a headset that makes very 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.010
 well and the bass so very powerful 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 and elected very clear so a very very 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.510
 good headphones in terms of sound quality 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.799
 who as I wanted to evoke your cuts 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.140
 of the outside world simply because 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.640
 that you will not hear what comes 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.530
 from the outside once you have that 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.849
 on the ears but the advantage 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.480
 also it is that the excellent does not hear 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.680
 your music 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.930
 there is nothing more unbearable 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.760
 precisely and you know that having 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.290
 a neighbor for example in the subway who 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.819
 listen to the music thoroughly 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.700
 headphones that lets sweat this 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.030
 famous the famous sound is there it's 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.709
 the same 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.849
 so there with that but precisely you 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.530
 do not bother your neighbors your 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.190
 neighbors do not bother you rompas I insist 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.560
 well on this point 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.900
 it's the great strength besides the quality 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.540
 of his from this headset so in terms of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.190
 materials used therefore was a one 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.919
 cord so that allows you the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.329
 cable that lets you connect this case 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:38.889
 than your mobile for example or your 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:43.359
 computer anything in jack 3.5 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.970
 therefore is of very good quality is to 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.160
 the very very good quality 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.380
 the cord and we sort of fabric 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.329
 braided so that necessarily goes 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.260
 extend its longevity compared to 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.389
 cables that are usually 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.099
 rubberized and which by force of 200 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.329
 twisting end up breaking 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 so that's not the case we're on a 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.500
 braided rope of very good quality 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.549
 connectors are connectors that 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.709
 are when you see it in gold plated 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.780
 so very very good sound transmission 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.800
 the extension is in the plates 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.570
 wind 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.220
 the materials that are used in 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.620
 terms of plastic are plastics 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 except that which is very soft to the touch 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.680
 may have the small 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.709
 weakness of would be very quickly 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.180
 that's the problem and the helmet 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.940
 itself is coated with a kind 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.380
 imitation leather trim 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.120
 seeing that they have very well it does not make any 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.020
 chips and flying so that was holding you 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.030
 will not hurt your head 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.590
 another particularity of the helmet is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.560
 that it is foldable simply you 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.690
 see and once it is folded a 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.640
 Once you have brought the rope 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.780
 cord so know that you have a 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.370
 small carrying pouch 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.950
 that's it and you can very easily 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.340
 slip your helmet into the pocket of 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.380
 transport 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.020
 all being conditioned in this 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.210
 famous box that is the delta so 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.900
 Delta honey and the phone box 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.120
 color block 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.950
 here is the logo marketed so 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.450
 distributed in France by 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.060
 modelabs so that was the delta in 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.140
 iraq phone and phone sorry with 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.740
 showed very good english accent you 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.330
 will have noticed 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.530
 so that I put it two small seconds 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.420
 to show you in fact that there is a 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.220
 rich range at color-block precisely 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.840
 helmet then there are intra 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.960
 auriculars which is in English 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.720
 is called in is one so I signed 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.810
 one as opposed to the niÃ¨res which is here 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.150
 who is on the ear of the extras 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.380
 auricular therefore we find intra 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.580
 ear-rings which are obviously very 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.610
 good quality that I will introduce you 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.120
 in an upcoming video and we find 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.340
 also many other variations of 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.350
 to hate here we have an alpha which is the 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.450
 alpha ufo redford that I present to you 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.980
 this segment in another video and we have 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.680
 a whole rich range we even arrive 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.750
 until omega is an agent who is a 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.510
 very big headphones bigger than this one 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.730
 but that is even more enveloping and 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.320
 which generates manages anyway even better 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.330
 the sound that offers you missions of 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.400
 better quality yet so that's it 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.620
 so that was the delta onimed test 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.630
 block color block forgiveness 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.910
 markets and distributes in France by 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.500
 modelabs a distributor that you are 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.940
 recommends besides who conceives 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.140
 himself his own accessories that 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.419
 include echoes that deus the 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.650
 cellphone 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.390
 So here we see how this helmet 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.169
 little extra information there 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.020
 you have it in a declination 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.550
 key colors the black and the cyan blue this 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.250
 what they call the blue lagoon 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.140
 it exists in different colors we have 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:29.010
 two tours of the yellow of the red of the rose 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.270
 black black etc etc 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.770
 it's a headset that's marketed to a 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.810
 very aggressive price because its price 20 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.330
 of customers is 30 euros actually more 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.890
 precisely 29.90 so that was a price 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.730
 very aggressive have a helmet of very 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.860
 good quality 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.250
 where usually builders 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.160
