graphics and controls but just in the

then

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
then

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.649 
then
this<00:00:49.039> whole<00:00:49.219> notion<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.729> violent<00:00:50.149> video<00:00:50.390> games

this whole notion of violent video games
is<00:00:51.109> kind<00:00:51.289> of<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.469> new<00:00:51.589> thing<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.309> there'd<00:00:52.489> never

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
is kind of a new thing and there'd never

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.099 
is kind of a new thing and there'd never
been<00:00:52.850> anything<00:00:53.089> like<00:00:53.210> Mortal<00:00:53.719> Kombat

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
been anything like Mortal Kombat

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.130 
been anything like Mortal Kombat
anything<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:54.890> unabashedly<00:00:55.670> gory<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.839> so<00:00:57.049> on

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
anything so unabashedly gory and so on

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.350 
anything so unabashedly gory and so on
its<00:00:57.260> way<00:00:57.469> lots<00:00:58.190> of<00:00:58.339> games<00:00:58.519> did<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:58.879> same<00:00:59.059> thing

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
its way lots of games did the same thing

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:19.469 
its way lots of games did the same thing
loaded<00:01:00.110> is<00:01:00.409> obviously<00:01:01.100> one<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.309> those<00:01:01.489> games

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.510 

thing<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.659> though<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.740> also<00:01:21.979> not<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.310> very

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
thing is though it's also not a very

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.230 
thing is though it's also not a very
good<00:01:22.729> game

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
good game

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.270 
good game

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
I mean loaded certainly has its moments

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.039 
I mean loaded certainly has its moments
thanks<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.819> some<00:01:26.000> surprisingly<00:01:26.600> solid

thanks to some surprisingly solid

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.690 
thanks to some surprisingly solid
gameplay<00:01:27.289> but<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.250> rest<00:01:28.369> of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.580> game

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
gameplay but the rest of the game

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.609 
gameplay but the rest of the game
doesn't<00:01:29.060> fare<00:01:29.240> quite<00:01:29.509> as<00:01:29.630> well<00:01:29.810> as<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.200> result

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
doesn't fare quite as well as a result

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.649 
doesn't fare quite as well as a result
and<00:01:31.280> when<00:01:31.399> you<00:01:31.490> play<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:32.209> feels<00:01:32.479> even

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
and when you play it it it feels even

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.930 
and when you play it it it feels even
more<00:01:32.810> dated<00:01:33.440> because<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:33.860> get<00:01:33.979> that<00:01:34.069> mid-90s

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
more dated because you get that mid-90s

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.969 
more dated because you get that mid-90s
gore<00:01:35.299> obsession<00:01:35.869> along<00:01:36.409> with<00:01:36.560> lots<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.890> the

really<00:02:40.930> blame<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.380> game<00:02:41.560> it's<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.040> fact

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
really blame on the game it's the fact

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.310 
really blame on the game it's the fact
that<00:02:42.310> loaded<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:42.970> top-down<00:02:43.270> shooter<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
that loaded is a top-down shooter to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.500 
that loaded is a top-down shooter to
play<00:02:44.500> with<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.710> d-pad<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.120> sounds

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
play with a d-pad but it just sounds

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.530 
play with a d-pad but it just sounds
problematic<00:02:47.200> turns<00:02:47.890> out<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.730> mean<00:02:49.210> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
problematic turns out it is I mean the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.970 
problematic turns out it is I mean the
game<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.810> those<00:02:49.900> what<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.140> can<00:02:50.350> with<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.740> but

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
game of those what it can with it but

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.950 
game of those what it can with it but
it's<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:52.000> bad<00:02:52.240> setup<00:02:52.570> from<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
it's really just a bad setup from the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.470 
it's really just a bad setup from the
get-go<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.730> press<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> button<00:02:55.270> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
get-go so you have to press a button to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.170 
get-go so you have to press a button to
shoot<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.530> always<00:02:56.770> shoot<00:02:57.160> forward<00:02:57.520> so

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
shoot and you always shoot forward so

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.260 
shoot and you always shoot forward so
you're<00:02:58.960> aiming<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.590> walking<00:03:00.270> simultaneously

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
you're aiming and walking simultaneously

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.130 
you're aiming and walking simultaneously
in<00:03:01.480> four<00:03:02.440> directions<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.240> problem<00:03:04.660> it's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
in four directions see the problem it's

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.780 
in four directions see the problem it's
never<00:03:05.350> as<00:03:05.470> simple<00:03:05.500> as<00:03:05.860> aim<00:03:06.100> at<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.340> bad<00:03:06.520> guys

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
never as simple as aim at the bad guys

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.190 
never as simple as aim at the bad guys
there<00:03:07.180> are<00:03:07.270> times<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.570> just<00:03:07.600> can't<00:03:07.750> aim<00:03:08.080> at

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
there are times you just can't aim at

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.810 
there are times you just can't aim at
the<00:03:08.290> bad<00:03:08.470> guys<00:03:08.500> without<00:03:09.010> moving<00:03:09.640> into

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
the bad guys without moving into

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.520 
the bad guys without moving into
position<00:03:10.240> when<00:03:10.630> those<00:03:10.750> bad<00:03:10.960> guys<00:03:11.170> were<00:03:11.410> this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
position when those bad guys were this

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:23.070 
position when those bad guys were this
fast<00:03:12.030> that's<00:03:13.030> problems<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.900> top<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.260> mothballs

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.160 

now<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.890> will<00:03:24.370> say<00:03:24.610> this<00:03:24.820> these<00:03:25.360> kinds<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.870> pop

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
now I will say this these kinds of pop

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.230 
now I will say this these kinds of pop
down<00:03:26.380> shooters<00:03:26.800> are<00:03:27.010> inherently<00:03:27.670> fun<00:03:27.970> so

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
down shooters are inherently fun so

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
down shooters are inherently fun so
there's<00:03:28.420> definitely<00:03:28.540> some<00:03:28.810> redeeming

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
there's definitely some redeeming

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380 
there's definitely some redeeming
qualities<00:03:29.890> too<00:03:30.100> loaded<00:03:30.460> I<00:03:30.640> mean<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.120> looks

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
qualities too loaded I mean it looks

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.200 
qualities too loaded I mean it looks
awful<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.020> it<00:03:32.710> has<00:03:32.890> some<00:03:33.100> fun<00:03:33.370> themes<00:03:33.700> if

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
awful but it has some fun themes if

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.630 
awful but it has some fun themes if
Psychopaths<00:03:35.080> tied<00:03:35.590> up<00:03:35.710> in<00:03:35.860> straitjackets

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
monsters I mean the gameplay in the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.400
