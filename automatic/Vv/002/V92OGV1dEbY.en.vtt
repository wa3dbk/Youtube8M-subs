00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.990
 to continue the recipe 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.019
 we worked and a pasta to 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.970
 cigarettes of iron this set has them 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.490
 showed go sugar to the mask to the onlookers 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.810
 white flour of leader 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.520
 we're gone we 're gone 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.199
 must begin to simply recipes 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.480
 to take cabbage 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:34.960
 then we will add the butter so he 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:01:03.609
 has an ointment texture our bodies do it 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:01:11.860
 will add the egg white so all these 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:12.130
 small tissues is made with sugar 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.040
 ice cream 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.320
 yes why am I too much but there the 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.770
 sugar masks are beginning to consider a 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:25.440
 color is okay so not even so 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.520
 simple that it can be kept in the fridge 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.010
 long enough and that's right now 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.480
 from another 7 2 baptist france is 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:41.320
 returned to their turn so that's what we 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.970
 can see the two farm cats 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.740
 whatever driving thing for me I 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.920
 the used as a little cat blues rap 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.690
 crisis developed for that I wear it's 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.980
 disagree what do you want 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.220
 dance back with parchment paper 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.140
 so calm if we are afraid the better it is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.040
 because I 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.300
 how are you not going to burn in the fake if 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.979
 we do not use who are he 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 well thought to take a little bit 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.630
 of dough and stick on the board 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.959
 in Switzerland we have one and the bottom at 12:02 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.959
 Let's go 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:28.270
 then using a small statuette 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:31.520
 I come you will learn honey we are 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:35.800
 okay we make retract this will be 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.800
 a lot easier we went beating 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:51.020
 a lot we get something from 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:54.670
 very good but that was common sense can 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.950
 put in the fridge puts it in the fridge 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:08.050
 so we look at it directly on 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:19.000
 the plate every five minutes is gone 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:19.000
 from his eternity neighbor 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:38.310
 we will take off quietly we will 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.020
 book 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.090
 and you'll understand how we're going 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.760
 serve after we do really enough 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.730
 great chords are vintage from 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.820
 nightmare the fronts are simply 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.500
 with a spoon the goal is to go 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
 very finely when it stays very 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.230
 confident because the more dough there is 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.610
 then it's going to be pretty bad of dog to 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.320
 inside are not necessarily what we 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.510
 research 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.460
 here we are, you do not get your cigarette with 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.670
 flour and I'm like a second 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.670
 boat
