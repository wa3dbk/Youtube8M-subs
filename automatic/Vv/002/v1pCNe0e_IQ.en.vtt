00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:11.100
 will be like boys from a master wallace 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:16.449
 I'm here to show you an important one 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:19.800
 technical innovation after this mine 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.570
 short introduction you will see a video 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:28.750
 technical quite short but very much 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:34.239
 clear where you will understand how to use the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:39.130
 now famous wallace cushion despres 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.800
 ok powerball this tool there 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.190
 really makes it possible to improve 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.410
 instantly your power up 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.980
 bench because why you will hire 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.860
 instantly correct posture 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.559
 of the bank what is correct 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.870
 bench posture is essential 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.909
 guys if you want to develop a lot 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.070
 power to become strong on that bench 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.700
 is the is one of the basics of the po of bb 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.340
 network you had to increase over the years 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.810
 body weight the muscular masses 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.869
 because with the weight of a little girl does not 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.680
 you will become very strong to use the right ones 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.080
 strength techniques to increase the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.750
 power but if you don't have the correct 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.229
 bench posture your progress 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.080
 they will always be limited and never at the maximum 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.570
 their potential comes closer here 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.689
 unfortunately for various technical reasons o 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.270
 not even everyone can genetically 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.369
 assume the correct posture 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.970
 what the correct posture of 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:53.590
 funky to the style of power provides 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.060
 two factors lumbar buckle know that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.240
 the lower back is 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 raised so as to make in arc 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.390
 worth the glass version of the shoulder blades 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.240
 because if you when you break down that 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.330
 you have jesus the upper back 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.790
 the flattened shoulder blades will push you in 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.550
 much less powerful than that 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.140
 overload on the shoulders by hiring 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.349
 instead a position of retroversion 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.260
 shoulder blades with retro version 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.420
 you have the shoulder blades instead 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.370
 best thrust possible and without 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.319
 not even too much to strain the flaw but 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.640
 you will have the maximum power from the bottom of the 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.209
 principles of and of the lower part 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 electoral ok so with the pillow 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.430
 wallace you immediately hire 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.350
 this position as you use the pillow 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.200
 wallace now you will see the short video 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:50.230
 simple but where you will understand how to use 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 ticino in a very simple way e 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.130
 so you will know what to do 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.239
 important is that before you sit down 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:03.519
 positioned cushion very attached to 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.410
 you tell us at the bottom of the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.630
 siena do not put it up towards the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.019
 shoulder blades holding it down below 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.150
 then you simply have to lower them e 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.140
 you will have given the particular form of 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.720
 ficino studied on the patented field you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.880
 the moment you bring yourself down you will see 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.540
 the finger you will have in the video you will already have 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.030
 assumed the perfect position and the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.070
 thrusts will be very effective 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.450
 that you for yourself are the new world on 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.420
 park then I leave you now to the video 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.820
 it would be simple linear as a must itself 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.760
 same and demonstrates how to use the pillow 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.460
 wallace 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.750
 remember to improve must 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:57.610
 listen to best and master a bit of 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.610
 green to the best I recommend to the top 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.910
 Go 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.900
 upward 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 ok
