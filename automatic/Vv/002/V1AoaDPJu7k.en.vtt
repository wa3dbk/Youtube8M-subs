00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 classic rolls are very rich that what 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.799
 you can make it to the oven that we can 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.199

 if I ever ask you to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 look for to follow the other side if not 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.230
 you are in Mar del Plata but then 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.669
 and if they give to the use because it is obtained in 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.170
 any side that the fish that more 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.820
 we consume the Argentines 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.690
 Felix some of them we combine with a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.670
 raw ham that is good creates good ones 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.280
 guys more in quite the program and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.440
 saladito that will be impressive to 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.440
 the mouth 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.539
 it's true to think about the table this is 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.640
 pure Portuguese energy we have 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.170
 sunscreen but it hits hard so 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 Obviously the sheets reach you 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.070
 little for you time 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.909
 tell me everything well still in my daddy 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.890
 it's all good, we've been raw and 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.020
 lanús to ask your true friend 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.539
 as we have trips that you 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.369
 take out the thorns and we're going to put two 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.940
 outside, the outside is going to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.520
 stay 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 on the side that we're going to cook well 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.990
 I have for each child 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.690
 when you have salt they put salt 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.310
 outside but I'm just going to turn it around 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.350
 I'll put salt in because it 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.510
 I'm going to put the raw ham that has its 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.430
 salting so let's make the 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.560
 raw ham encouraged them and liquidated as if 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.770
 they are the one for the other the protest with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.480
 already perfect cross in the cyber lusa and what 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.590
 we put all tomato try to be 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.500
 thanks to them because those of tomato with 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 salt acordate outside saves seeks 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.910
 that tomato leaves are infinite 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770
 because because if they are very finite you are going to 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.480
 be able to arm with bits and very decision 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.250
 thick you're going to work there the 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.679
 operation and you will not be able to so 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.060
 little bit whenever I put tomato 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.100
 I put a little salt to the tomato 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.260
 helped because it's pretty thin 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.620
 We are going to put a little box of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.620
 basil 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.930
 to have the ones you have in your house 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.720
 cool and you 're going to put it here you know 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 If you see the program, it is clear that the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.700
 Program 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.740
 It has many people who tell us we see 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.780

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.340
 they all came here a kiss to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.860
 all to distribute fries the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.720
 organito and everyone knows that to me 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.370
 I love garlic so if you have 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.990
