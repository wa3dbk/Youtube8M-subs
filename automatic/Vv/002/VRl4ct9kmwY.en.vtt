00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
completely neglect and the reason I'll

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.630 
completely neglect and the reason I'll
just<00:02:12.900> keep<00:02:13.110> passing<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:13.680> ditch<00:02:14.010> pass<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.490> of

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
just keep passing then ditch pass all of

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.630 
just keep passing then ditch pass all of
them<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.350> that's<00:02:16.350> pretty<00:02:16.530> much<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.459> want

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640

Barbara looks intimidating he is

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:50.389 
Barbara looks intimidating he is
actually<00:06:48.209> one<00:06:48.569> of<00:06:48.629> the<00:06:49.199> easier<00:06:49.769> bosses<00:06:50.189> in<00:06:50.309> the

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:50.399 
actually one of the easier bosses in the

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:52.489 
actually one of the easier bosses in the
game<00:06:50.429> in<00:06:50.789> my<00:06:50.939> opinion<00:06:51.360> there<00:06:51.929> really<00:06:52.229> isn't

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
game in my opinion there really isn't

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.799 
game in my opinion there really isn't
much<00:06:52.800> to<00:06:52.860> the<00:06:53.369> bow<00:06:53.490> spell<00:06:53.789> all<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:54.509> gotta<00:06:54.689> do

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:54.809 
much to the bow spell all you gotta do

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:57.290 
much to the bow spell all you gotta do
is<00:06:54.839> hit<00:06:55.139> once<00:06:55.409> and<00:06:55.619> jump<00:06:56.009> away<00:06:56.279> as<00:06:56.759> long<00:06:57.059> as<00:06:57.209> you

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
is hit once and jump away as long as you

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.850 
is hit once and jump away as long as you
don't<00:06:57.419> make<00:06:57.599> a<00:06:57.659> mistake<00:06:57.839> and<00:06:58.259> fall<00:06:58.499> into<00:06:58.649> the

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
don't make a mistake and fall into the

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.149 
don't make a mistake and fall into the
lava<00:06:59.099> you<00:06:59.519> should<00:07:00.240> be<00:07:00.389> fine<00:07:00.629> or<00:07:01.110> if<00:07:01.800> you<00:07:01.949> get<00:07:02.099> a

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159
