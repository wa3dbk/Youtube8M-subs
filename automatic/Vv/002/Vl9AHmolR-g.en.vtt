they close the ball down really quickly
I<00:00:24.240> don't<00:00:24.689> think<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.900> surface<00:00:25.380> as<00:00:25.560> well<00:00:25.590> that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
I don't think the surface as well that

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.160 
I don't think the surface as well that
doesn't<00:00:26.400> help<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.760> kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> pops<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> kind

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
doesn't help it kind of pops up and kind

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.540 
doesn't help it kind of pops up and kind
of<00:00:28.260> creates<00:00:28.529> her<00:00:28.650> back<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.980> forth<00:00:29.189> game<00:00:29.310> oh

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of creates her back and forth game oh

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.950 
of creates her back and forth game oh
you<00:00:29.789> know<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> thought<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> we<00:00:30.810> were<00:00:30.869> gonna

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you know I thought that we were gonna

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.690 
you know I thought that we were gonna
get<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.199> couple<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:31.890> half<00:00:32.099> but<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
get a couple in the first half but it

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.979 
get a couple in the first half but it
was<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.149> even<00:00:33.420> game<00:00:33.570> than<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.809> thought

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
was more of an even game than I thought

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.360 
was more of an even game than I thought
China<00:00:34.260> came<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.800> we're<00:00:34.890> ready<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.160> play

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
there's going to be a little bit of a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.340 
there's going to be a little bit of a
lull<00:01:14.159> next<00:01:15.090> year<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.900> year<00:01:15.930> after<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
lull next year and the year after that

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
lull next year and the year after that
until<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.340> world<00:01:17.580> cup<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> we've<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.119> got

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
to continue the wave and the momentum of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
to continue the wave and the momentum of
just<00:01:21.420> keeping<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> game<00:01:22.350> popular<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.040> out

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
on top a little different for me to be

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
on top a little different for me to be
wearing<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.530> captain's<00:01:26.009> band<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.420> felt

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
strong I'm sure that they're gonna come

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.880 
strong I'm sure that they're gonna come
out<00:02:24.480> very<00:02:24.750> similar<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.200> how<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:25.470> saw<00:02:25.709> them

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
out very similar to how we saw them

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.520 
out very similar to how we saw them
today<00:02:26.510> should<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.540> another<00:02:27.810> great<00:02:27.989> battle<00:02:28.379> we

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
today should be another great battle we

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
today should be another great battle we
only<00:02:28.650> got<00:02:29.160> away<00:02:29.340> with<00:02:29.489> two<00:02:29.640> goals<00:02:29.819> today<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> I

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
only got away with two goals today and I

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.089 
only got away with two goals today and I
think<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:30.840> would<00:02:31.230> hope<00:02:31.349> for<00:02:31.410> more<00:02:31.680> goals<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
think we would hope for more goals and

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.599 
think we would hope for more goals and
so<00:02:32.160> hopefully<00:02:32.250> we'll<00:02:32.549> see<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:32.910> Houston
