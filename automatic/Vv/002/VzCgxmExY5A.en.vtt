00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.180
 this adventure work 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:16.930
 I wanted to play in England 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:21.380
 and the truth that I was happy to be able 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.439
 start here a new adventure and the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.070
 football and the truth that I thought was a 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.320
 good club a serious club and I decided to come 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.029
 for here 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.449
 as you found in next to English 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.230
 is different from Spanish is much more 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.870
 intense harder but good has its 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.230
 charm and it's different and adapting from 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 little bit 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.040
 the truth 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.560
 with colleagues around the world very 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:01:00.030
 well and the truth that the experience is 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.030
 being very good to the team and 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.370
 well I still do not understand many people because 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 I do not know much English but good 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.620
 people treat me well and also I 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.700
 help for 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.780
 so that you understand 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 on the right 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.950
 and nothing and little by little then trying 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 learn English to be able to relate 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.149
 more with all but the good thing well 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 I'm also lucky that having 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.420
 three or four 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.820
 and vier 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 We are looking at the 30 English classes 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.950
 and the truth that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.979
 difficult because it is a very language 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.979
 different to Spanish but but the truth 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.230
 how good is not small enough because 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.260
 we go together with the teacher and nothing 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.440
 that little by little he had a better time in the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.630
 field with heather 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.630
 Well, I think the first goal 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.010
 and is that if you are getting used to 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.620
 physical game of england every match 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.220
 if you see that you are shifts and each party 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.220
 Well, it's going 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.410
 adapting a little more because it's better 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.209
 at the beginning it always costs the change and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.830
 I believe that every game I can 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.260
 look a little bit 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.010
 and I believe everything 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.890
 how close to seeing how are you 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.070
 better jota to see the best jota how much 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 wants to say how 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.190
 why can not I can not say 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.280
 I think that then 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.590
 keep tying see a little more and I hope 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.670
 that a little while now 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.670
 of two good victories 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.470
 what 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.660
 I interviewed how they are like the environment 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.810
 in the mixed 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.060
 I think that very well because after 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.670
 the three parties that two years draws and 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.830
 we had deserved a little more 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.690
 the team was telling me this and I think that 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.209
 He is very animated and eager to 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.780
 keep fighting to be the most 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.230
 up possible 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.209
 it's something that is a very 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.459
 aggressive 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.850
 the fans squeeze a lot and a 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.459
 very physical team and says it's a field 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.209
 nice to play but that fans 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:51.569
 apply a lot will be your first derby 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.870
 of london and if you're how are you with 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.870
 desire 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.330
 the truth I did not see any good in 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.550
 england and I guess it will be like in 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.380
 Spain from a lot of tension and 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 we hope to win the game 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.890
 as soon as you think we can get to 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.890
 get how far we can get 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.590
 Well, I think the goal is 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.400
 stay as high as possible and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.860
 try to do playback I think that 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.590
 the team can do it 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.930
 and what can we do if we do things well 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.729
 that we can at the end of the season 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.729
 get this center if it is first
