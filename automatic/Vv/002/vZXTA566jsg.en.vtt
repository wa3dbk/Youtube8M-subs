they're doing this I hope it doesn't

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.660 
they're doing this I hope it doesn't
take<00:02:05.259> away<00:02:05.409> from<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.829> actual<00:02:06.040> feel<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.399> the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
take away from the actual feel of the

take away from the actual feel of the
update<00:02:07.000> but<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.600> hope<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.229> does<00:02:08.409> make<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.769> a
