horizon I based on the user content and

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.979 
horizon I based on the user content and
these<00:02:41.799> might<00:02:42.130> be<00:02:42.340> minor<00:02:42.610> for<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.600> gameplay

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
these might be minor for you to gameplay

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.449 
these might be minor for you to gameplay
but<00:02:44.049> if<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.560> actually<00:02:44.739> consolidate<00:02:45.430> all

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
but if you actually consolidate all

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.220 
but if you actually consolidate all
these<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:46.000> much<00:02:46.209> better<00:02:46.450> than<00:02:46.720> bragging<00:02:47.110> on

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
these it's much better than bragging on

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.830 
these it's much better than bragging on
my<00:02:47.470> initial<00:02:47.860> when<00:02:48.430> somepony<00:02:48.850> actually<00:02:49.600> talks

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
my initial when somepony actually talks

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.810 
my initial when somepony actually talks
too<00:02:50.110> much<00:02:50.140> or<00:02:50.650> whatnot<00:02:50.890> these<00:02:51.519> actually

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
too much or whatnot these actually

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.090 
too much or whatnot these actually
eliminated<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:53.049> it<00:02:53.350> will<00:02:53.500> actually<00:02:53.680> cause<00:02:54.070> a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
eliminated so it will actually cause a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.030 
eliminated so it will actually cause a
better<00:02:54.700> gameplay<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.660> when<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.440> play<00:02:56.650> dragon

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040

isn't a circle cycle where they actually
cut<00:06:38.480> that's<00:06:38.840> why<00:06:39.020> they<00:06:39.260> actually<00:06:39.560> came<00:06:39.710> up

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
cut that's why they actually came up

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.010
