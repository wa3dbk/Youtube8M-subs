whose same idea

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.140 
whose same idea
it<00:02:46.680> does<00:02:46.830> feel<00:02:47.040> kind<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> ridiculously<00:02:47.940> light

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
it does feel kind of ridiculously light

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
it does feel kind of ridiculously light
when<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:48.900> taking<00:02:49.170> them<00:02:49.260> off<00:03:04.130> make<00:03:05.130> sure

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
when you're taking them off make sure

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.100 
when you're taking them off make sure
you're<00:03:05.370> switching<00:03:05.580> stances<00:03:06.120> don't<00:03:06.989> get

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
you're switching stances don't get

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
you're switching stances don't get
predictable
