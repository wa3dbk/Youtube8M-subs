00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
they changed a lot about how sniping

they changed a lot about how sniping
works<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.059> game<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.840> if<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.260> use<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
works in this game but if you use the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.930 
works in this game but if you use the
right<00:00:10.679> attachments<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.490> weapons<00:00:11.820> you

right attachments the right weapons you
can<00:00:12.090> actually<00:00:12.509> make<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.110> very<00:00:13.440> positive

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
can actually make this a very positive

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.400 
can actually make this a very positive
experience<00:00:14.009> still<00:00:14.809> so<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.839> first<00:00:16.080> tip<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.379> have

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
experience still so the first tip I have

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.410 
experience still so the first tip I have
for<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> scopes<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.910> you<00:00:18.029> use

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
for you is about the scopes that you use

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.000 
for you is about the scopes that you use
one<00:00:19.020> thing<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.289> changing<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.890> when

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
one thing that's changing this is when

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.830 
one thing that's changing this is when
you<00:00:20.130> zoom<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.730> sniper<00:00:20.970> scope<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.630> not

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you zoom in with a sniper scope it's not

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960 
you zoom in with a sniper scope it's not
exactly<00:00:22.109> dead<00:00:22.830> center<00:00:23.220> like<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.519> used<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.850> be

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
exactly dead center like it used to be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
exactly dead center like it used to be
and<00:00:24.510> we'll<00:00:24.990> see<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> next<00:00:25.740> clip

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and we'll see that here in the next clip

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
and we'll see that here in the next clip
that<00:00:26.430> when<00:00:26.580> i<00:00:26.609> zoom<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:27.240> i<00:00:27.269> still<00:00:27.599> managed<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
that when i zoom in i still managed to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.919 
that when i zoom in i still managed to
pull<00:00:28.019> off<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> triple<00:00:28.590> kill<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.449> scope

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
pull off the triple kill but the scope

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
pull off the triple kill but the scope
is<00:00:31.080> actually<00:00:31.500> higher<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:31.740> sour<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.219> red<00:00:32.399> X

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is actually higher than sour that red X

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.040 
is actually higher than sour that red X
is<00:00:32.730> center<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> look<00:00:33.390> where<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.600> scopes<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.020> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
is center and look where it scopes in a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.810 
is center and look where it scopes in a
little<00:00:34.410> bit<00:00:34.500> above<00:00:34.710> sometimes<00:00:35.640> it's

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
little bit above sometimes it's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
little bit above sometimes it's
diagonally<00:00:36.480> below<00:00:36.840> sometimes<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.559> over<00:00:37.739> to

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
diagonally below sometimes it's over to

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
diagonally below sometimes it's over to
the<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.640> never<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:38.940> tell

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the right you can never really tell

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.549 
the right you can never really tell
where<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.260> zoom<00:00:40.410> in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
where it's going to be when you zoom in

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.600 
where it's going to be when you zoom in
and<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.800> makes<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.520> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
and that makes it so that you have to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.119 
and that makes it so that you have to
scope<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.230> reassess<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.829> triple

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
scope in reassess look at that triple

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.490 
scope in reassess look at that triple
kill<00:00:44.250> who<00:00:44.670> reassess<00:00:45.270> where<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.050> actually

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
kill who reassess where it is actually

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
kill who reassess where it is actually
scoped<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.489> instead<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> relying<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
scoped in instead of relying on the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
scoped in instead of relying on the
center<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.660> screen<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:50.010> adjust

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
center of your screen and then adjust

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.040 
center of your screen and then adjust
and<00:00:50.940> take<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> shot<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.750> makes<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and take the shot and that makes it a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.740 
and take the shot and that makes it a
lot<00:00:52.140> slower<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.920> here's<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.340> tip<00:00:53.550> use<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
lot slower so here's the tip use the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
lot slower so here's the tip use the
variable<00:00:55.500> zoom<00:00:55.770> site<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.699> where

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
variable zoom site you see it here where

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.689 
variable zoom site you see it here where
that<00:00:57.000> X<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.660> exactly<00:00:58.379> where<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> center<00:00:59.670> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
that X is is exactly where the center of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
that X is is exactly where the center of
the<00:01:00.030> scope<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> don't

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the scope is all the time so you don't

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
the scope is all the time so you don't
have<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.370> all<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> guesswork<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> waste

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
have to do all that guesswork and waste

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.660 
have to do all that guesswork and waste
you<00:01:04.170> know<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.409> quarter<00:01:04.769> second<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.309> your

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you know that quarter second in your

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
you know that quarter second in your
shot<00:01:05.939> which<00:01:06.750> often<00:01:07.200> will<00:01:07.320> get<00:01:07.439> us<00:01:07.560> killed<00:01:07.830> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
shot which often will get us killed so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
shot which often will get us killed so
that's<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.729> thing<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.119> definitely<00:01:09.420> be

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
that's the first thing is definitely be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.289 
that's the first thing is definitely be
using<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.290> variable<00:01:11.040> zoom<00:01:11.520> site<00:01:11.850> it'll<00:01:12.090> save

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
using that variable zoom site it'll save

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.289 
using that variable zoom site it'll save
you<00:01:12.510> lots<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.140> times<00:01:13.490> most<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.000> using

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you lots of times most people are using

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.170 
you lots of times most people are using
the<00:01:15.630> Moors<00:01:16.500> sniper<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the Moors sniper just because it's so

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
the Moors sniper just because it's so
powerful<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.840> well<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.350> its<00:01:19.770> body<00:01:20.009> shots<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
powerful as well on its body shots and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
powerful as well on its body shots and
headshots<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.390> hit<00:01:21.840> kill<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
headshots are a one hit kill so that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
headshots are a one hit kill so that
makes<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.189> effective<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
makes it very effective you just have to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
makes it very effective you just have to
take<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.869> shot<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.710> worry<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
take the one shot and not worry about it

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
take the one shot and not worry about it
as<00:01:26.700> long<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.210> again<00:01:27.689> you're<00:01:27.900> above<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.259> waist

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
as long as again you're above the waist

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
as long as again you're above the waist
so<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.640> very<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.000> useful<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so that can be very very useful and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
so that can be very very useful and
that's<00:01:31.229> probably<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.920> first<00:01:32.220> sniper<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.759> would

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that's probably the first sniper I would

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.460 
that's probably the first sniper I would
recommend<00:01:33.240> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.930> sniping

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
recommend if you are going to be sniping

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.980 
recommend if you are going to be sniping
or<00:01:34.590> quickscoping<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.420> Moors

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
or quickscoping is going to be the Moors

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.880 
or quickscoping is going to be the Moors

with the variable zoom site also i like

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.340 
with the variable zoom site also i like

to use on this class fast hands with the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.289 
to use on this class fast hands with the
RW<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.009> pistol<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.180> will<00:01:45.240> happen

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
RW one pistol because what will happen

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090 
RW one pistol because what will happen
is<00:01:45.600> sometimes<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.680> you're<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.950> same

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
is sometimes in if you're in the same

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
is sometimes in if you're in the same
room<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.490> your<00:01:47.610> enemy<00:01:47.670> you'll<00:01:48.270> miss<00:01:48.540> your

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
room as your enemy you'll miss your

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
room as your enemy you'll miss your
first<00:01:48.869> shot<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.409> with<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> Moors<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> don't

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
first shot and with the Moors you don't

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.010 
first shot and with the Moors you don't
really<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.060> time<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> take<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> follow-up

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
really have time to take a follow-up

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
really have time to take a follow-up
shot<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.640> faster

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
shot so it can actually be much faster

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.899 
shot so it can actually be much faster
to<00:01:54.119> swap<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.810> rtw<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:55.979> rail<00:01:56.280> gun<00:01:56.549> pistol

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to swap to that rtw one rail gun pistol

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
to swap to that rtw one rail gun pistol
and<00:01:57.360> finish<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.320> off<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.979> shot<00:01:59.250> from

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and finish them off with one shot from

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
and finish them off with one shot from
that<00:01:59.520> instead<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:01.110> one

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that instead because that is also one

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
that instead because that is also one
hit<00:02:01.530> kill<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:02.009> closer<00:02:02.250> ranges<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> can

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
hit kill in closer ranges so you can

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.359 
hit kill in closer ranges so you can
definitely<00:02:03.630> rely<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> backup<00:02:04.920> for

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
definitely rely on that as a backup for

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.240 
definitely rely on that as a backup for
your<00:02:05.520> sniper<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> if<00:02:07.500> you're<00:02:07.649> not<00:02:07.770> using<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
your sniper so if you're not using the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
your sniper so if you're not using the
Moors<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.729> variable<00:02:09.239> zoom<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.750> should<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
Moors with variable zoom what should you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.190 
Moors with variable zoom what should you
be<00:02:10.289> using<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:11.310> me<00:02:11.459> that's<00:02:11.790> easy<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
be using to me that's easy it's the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
be using to me that's easy it's the
Atlas

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
Atlas

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.100 
Atlas
20-millimeter<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.360> think<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.780> much

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
20-millimeter this I think is much

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.780 
20-millimeter this I think is much
better<00:02:16.410> than<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.680> Moors<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.370> unlocked

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
better than the Moors but it is unlocked

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.250 
better than the Moors but it is unlocked
at<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.970> later<00:02:18.150> level<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.870> why<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.020> listed

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
at a later level so that's why I listed

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260 
at a later level so that's why I listed
the<00:02:19.350> Moors<00:02:19.530> first<00:02:19.890> because<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.180> you're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the Moors first because it's what you're

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.910 
the Moors first because it's what you're
going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.870> access<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.650> most

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
going to be have access to the most

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
going to be have access to the most
though<00:02:23.730> when<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> do<00:02:24.150> unlock<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.630> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
though when you do unlock this I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.300 
though when you do unlock this I
actually<00:02:25.020> use<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.320> permanent<00:02:25.680> unlock<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.130> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
actually use the permanent unlock on it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400 
actually use the permanent unlock on it
because<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.880> like<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:27.330> well<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.080> very

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
because I like this so well it is very

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.540 
because I like this so well it is very
good<00:02:28.710> you'll<00:02:28.860> see<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.160> when<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> aim<00:02:29.520> down

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
good you'll see that when you aim down

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.940 
good you'll see that when you aim down
sights<00:02:29.970> with<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.930> scope<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.800> not

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
sights with it that scope is not

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.140 
sights with it that scope is not
perfectly<00:02:32.370> centered<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.850> center<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
perfectly centered on the center of the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940 
perfectly centered on the center of the
screen<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.660> always<00:02:33.960> much<00:02:34.470> closer<00:02:34.800> than

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
screen but it's always much closer than

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.920 
screen but it's always much closer than
the<00:02:35.130> Moors<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.180> you<00:02:36.240> don't<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.690> worry

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the Moors is so you don't have to worry

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.810 
the Moors is so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.290> scope<00:02:37.530> issue<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.280> had<00:02:38.490> over

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
about the scope issue that you had over

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.420 
about the scope issue that you had over
there<00:02:39.090> using<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.660> variable<00:02:39.870> zoom

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
there using that variable zoom

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.950 
there using that variable zoom
additionally<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.880> seems<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.810> very

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
additionally this seems to have a very

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.840 
additionally this seems to have a very
fast<00:02:43.290> aim<00:02:43.530> down<00:02:43.710> sights<00:02:44.010> time<00:02:44.220> you're<00:02:44.550> able<00:02:44.760> to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
fast aim down sights time you're able to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.430 
fast aim down sights time you're able to
quickscope<00:02:45.300> with<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.170> feels<00:02:46.380> very

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
quickscope with it and it feels very

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860 
quickscope with it and it feels very
intuitive<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.310> me<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.910> intervention

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
intuitive to me this is the intervention

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.380 
intuitive to me this is the intervention
or<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.050> MSR<00:02:49.470> or<00:02:49.620> whatever<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.820> game<00:02:51.150> it's

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
or the MSR or whatever of this game it's

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.820 
or the MSR or whatever of this game it's
the<00:02:51.570> best<00:02:51.750> sniper<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.260> feels<00:02:52.500> good<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:52.800> your

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
the best sniper it feels good in your

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.670 
the best sniper it feels good in your
hands<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.610> four<00:02:54.030> rounds

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
hands it's got four rounds

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.390 
hands it's got four rounds
semi-automatics<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:56.040> need<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> take<00:02:56.370> a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
semi-automatics so if you need to take a

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.920 
semi-automatics so if you need to take a
follow-up<00:02:56.760> shot<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.210> can<00:02:57.360> do<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.720> fairly

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
follow-up shot you can do that fairly

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.080 
follow-up shot you can do that fairly
easily<00:02:58.410> without<00:02:59.250> getting<00:02:59.520> penalized<00:02:59.670> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
easily without getting penalized the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.540 
easily without getting penalized the
same<00:03:00.240> way<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.420> do<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> Moors<00:03:01.550> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
same way you do with the Moors the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.520 
same way you do with the Moors the
downside<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.150> gun<00:03:03.390> is<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.170> can't

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
downside to this gun is that it can't

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.380 
downside to this gun is that it can't
hipfire<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.910> big<00:03:06.030> deal

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
hipfire but that's not a very big deal

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.850 
hipfire but that's not a very big deal
because<00:03:06.600> you're<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:07.050> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> be<00:03:07.410> getting<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
because you're not going to be getting a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.490 
because you're not going to be getting a
whole<00:03:08.070> lot<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.370> no<00:03:08.520> scopes<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.210> game<00:03:09.540> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
whole lot of no scopes in this game the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.750 
whole lot of no scopes in this game the
damage<00:03:10.860> on<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.070> thing<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.730> insane

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
damage on this thing is all so insane

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.510 
damage on this thing is all so insane
it's<00:03:12.510> i<00:03:12.690> believe<00:03:12.930> it's<00:03:13.080> 19<00:03:13.590> default<00:03:14.310> and

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
it's i believe it's 19 default and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.970 
it's i believe it's 19 default and
that's<00:03:15.390> easily<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.990> one-hit<00:03:16.410> kill<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.800> most

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
that's easily a one-hit kill the most

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.070 
that's easily a one-hit kill the most
parts<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> body<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.850> variant<00:03:18.690> i'm<00:03:18.750> using

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
parts of the body the variant i'm using

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.260 
parts of the body the variant i'm using
the<00:03:19.170> elite<00:03:19.350> variant<00:03:19.710> actually<00:03:20.100> has<00:03:20.430> minus<00:03:21.000> 3

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
the elite variant actually has minus 3

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.650 
the elite variant actually has minus 3
damage<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.810> plus<00:03:22.080> 3<00:03:22.290> handling<00:03:22.830> which

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
damage and plus 3 handling which

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.260 
damage and plus 3 handling which
decreases<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.050> hipfire<00:03:25.260> cone<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.580> weapon

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
decreases the hipfire cone of the weapon

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.940 
decreases the hipfire cone of the weapon
which<00:03:27.480> even<00:03:28.020> though<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.170> can't<00:03:28.320> hipfire<00:03:28.710> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
which even though it can't hipfire it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.560 
which even though it can't hipfire it
decreases<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.940> kind<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.180> makes<00:03:30.300> it<00:03:30.420> more

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
decreases the it kind of makes it more

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.780 
decreases the it kind of makes it more

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
forgiving if you fire early while you're

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.150

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.490 
aiming down sights and even with minus 3
damage<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:35.850> one<00:03:36.330> shot<00:03:36.510> kills<00:03:36.810> four<00:03:37.110> days<00:03:37.320> I

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.930 
damage I get one shot kills four days I
almost<00:03:37.740> never<00:03:38.010> get<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.280> hitmarker<00:03:38.460> on<00:03:38.790> this

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
almost never get a hitmarker on this

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
almost never get a hitmarker on this
usually<00:03:39.390> only<00:03:39.510> if<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.690> hit<00:03:39.870> them<00:03:39.960> like<00:03:40.170> below

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
usually only if I hit them like below

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.490 
usually only if I hit them like below
the<00:03:40.770> knee<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.100> seems<00:03:41.310> like<00:03:41.580> and<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.840> it's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
the knee it seems like and so it's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.620 
the knee it seems like and so it's
really<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:44.340> ideal<00:03:44.670> sniper<00:03:45.060> does<00:03:45.360> everything

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
really the ideal sniper does everything

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.970 
really the ideal sniper does everything
I<00:03:45.810> want<00:03:46.080> if<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.410> am<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.770> put<00:03:46.890> an

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
I want if I am going to put an

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.800 
I want if I am going to put an
attachment<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.520> it<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.000> gonna<00:03:48.240> be<00:03:48.390> the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
attachment on it it's gonna be the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.650 
attachment on it it's gonna be the
ballistics<00:03:49.350> cpu<00:03:49.470> or<00:03:49.950> extended<00:03:50.580> mags<00:03:50.790> because

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
ballistics cpu or extended mags because

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.570 
ballistics cpu or extended mags because
really<00:03:52.380> there's<00:03:52.620> very<00:03:52.800> little<00:03:53.070> that<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.400> gun

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
really there's very little that this gun

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.430 
really there's very little that this gun
needs<00:03:53.940> other<00:03:54.330> than<00:03:54.660> what<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.900> comes<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.140> on

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
needs other than what it comes with on

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.370 
needs other than what it comes with on
default<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.510> usually<00:03:57.510> use<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.140> as<00:03:58.350> a

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
default I usually use this as a

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.770 
default I usually use this as a
secondary<00:03:59.010> weapon<00:03:59.430> because<00:03:59.730> it's<00:03:59.910> not<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.450> huge

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
secondary weapon because it's not a huge

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.660 
secondary weapon because it's not a huge
penalty<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.530> take<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.830> as<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.040> secondary<00:04:02.490> to

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
penalty to take this as a secondary to

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.800 
penalty to take this as a secondary to
it<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:02.850> an<00:04:02.940> assault<00:04:03.240> rifle<00:04:03.270> or<00:04:03.540> something

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
it like an assault rifle or something

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
it like an assault rifle or something
like<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.590> makes<00:04:04.710> a<00:04:04.800> killer<00:04:05.010> combo<00:04:05.340> to

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
like that and it makes a killer combo to

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.760 
like that and it makes a killer combo to
