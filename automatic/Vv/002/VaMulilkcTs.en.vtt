 every day to make 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.139
 programming that takes a little 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.850
 road which means that if we are 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.859

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.490
 aggression that will be final for us 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.770

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:51.399
 so we are not spare clothes 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.229

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.849
 door to ask our load 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.649
