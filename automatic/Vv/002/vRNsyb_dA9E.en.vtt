00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 Hey, guys, I'm here on Ford. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.830
 get up and in this video I'll show you how 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.860
 make the pinnacle dungeon conquests 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.770
 Tigard This is a level 80 honor that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.130
 is in hortolÃ¢ndia here on the fjord map 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 lift right here in the basin utility here 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.220
 in this point 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.730
 and here in the bastille they have two 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.310
 dungeons the bastille down there 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.769
 and the opinion that we entered here by 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 then make sure that the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.660
 difficulty of having dungeons in the module 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.760
 five heroic players there and there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.160
 I'll usually speed up the video 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.559
 during the mobs tests until the first 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.899
 box where we will make the first 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.539
 total will be four different achievements 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.610
 in this dungeon 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.980
 so here we will make the first conquest 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.930
 which is incredible with which the conquest 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.260
 requires that you make him speak 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.870
 morbey crypt mate one with which in the scourge 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.420
 so here in the room you have 2 hulk in the scourge 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 which is in the mouth and continues through the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.570
 dungeon and that's what's behind you 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.280
 need to add one of them is going to be life 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 up to about 10% 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.500
 the most important is that you leave the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.750
 Circus life but do not kill 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 but if by chance you kill one of them 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.670
 individually you can pull the other 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.890
 reserve and try again 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.320
 but if everyone is dead then you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 can be of the instance and reset the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.340
 instances like you did not kill any 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 there are still flashmobs to inject 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.020
 while you should be living with what I 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.720
 I suggest you and fitch used damage 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.610
 caused a time and preferably remove 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.299
 some parts of your equipment if you 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 for high level and move has 130 thousand 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.020
 points of sale and you need to leave 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.630
 he between 1 thousand and 9 thousand health points 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.060
 done that starts at the top with bose 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 positions the hulk more or less here where 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.439
 I'm so sure that the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 Google is under 9000 points 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.039
 My life here was 8 thousand and some 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 thing then hit the ball up to 50% 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.840
 be careful not to use the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.030
 my area then the ball will turn 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.099
 donate a player and some modules 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
 will appear do nothing 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.920
 with these furniture keep them alive 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.500
 also just wait and wait and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.900
 when that sword hits the ground all 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.610
 albums will receive damage including 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.950
 cookie that should die by skill 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.959
 and that's it as long as this 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.040
 sword finishes the last points of 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.410
 huck life 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.989
 You will receive the achievement and now we will 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.049
 continue the next boss's dungeon 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.000
 is optional no conquest then 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.670
 When you get here in this room with 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.430
 these four beasts around you can 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.319
 simply go straight but be careful when 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.959
 leave this room you will be an event 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.299
 where we will have two achievements involved 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.040
 which are as follows on top of the bed 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.349
 under the stairs that is only 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.379
 the issue of completing boxes cade or 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.410
 pious after killing his draco with three 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.660
 cards in a short time 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.670
 and the other achievement that is this scad to 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.980
 stay out here that is just a matter of 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.510
 conclude an event on the boss in less than 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.940
 three minutes 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.250
 So when you 're ready, get out of here. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.290
 with the animals and passing through the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.910
 the three minute count for 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.880
 conquer will start 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.340
 run to the end and kill all the 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.040
 enemies that appear called mobs 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.950
 a poem drops them an object on the floor 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.900
 when they die then click on these objects 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.160
 you teach some US airplanes and 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.349
 inventory 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.930
 make sure you have available space 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.910
 in the backpacks then just continue 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.690
 keeping mobs until you have the three 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.280
 warehouses and already with the three in inventory 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.590
 wait until the boss is in range 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.430
 of the card launchers and click the 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.019
 as fast as possible on the three launchers 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.000
 you need to click on three of them 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.669
 while time interval to power 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.650
 obtain the conquest by defeating the moss and 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.840
 if you complete this event in less than 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.750
 three minutes you will have the other achievement 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.079
 and that's it then let's proceed here 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.819
 for the last boss and a tip that I'm going 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.639
 to the previous achievements is the 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.889
 following if you ran out of time or 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.690
 you were able to launch only one or two 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.390
 single sheds 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.940
 missing the third you can go back through 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.250
 where you came to power 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.930
 start the event and try again 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.090
 10 points you have on your 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.070
 inventory will not disappear 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.500
 and here we arrive in the last boston where 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.420
 we will make the last conquest that is iran 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.230
 the kingdom the achievement requires you 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.800
 defeat the king and miron without anyone in the 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.780
 your group turn ruin and this achievement 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 It is very simple if you are level 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.140
 can you escape by foot are borja and 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.390
 will probably die before he 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.370
 use this ability but 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.840
 it depended on you you should only 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.850
 be aware when it launches the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.040
 Choline 's ability is a skill 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.800
 has two seconds to launch and this 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.990
 skill will apply a buffet on the boss 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.890
 so while the ball is with booth 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.890
 hill 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.790
 no one should attack him then if he 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:15.190
 buff ruin just waiting for the 2nd dps 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.040
 wait until the booth inhale and then yes 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.350
 finish with it, you happen and it's 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.770
 I hope you liked it and even 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.770
