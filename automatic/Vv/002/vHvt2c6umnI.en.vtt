00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.949
 nordic walking activity is a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.660
 activity that comes to us from the cold which 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.189
 comes from finland these are the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 Finnish cross-country coaches 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.810
 who have to follow their treatment of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.460
 their athletes during the summer have 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.810
 removed the skis and they kept his 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.760
 boats so it's now go us 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.929
 allow to work the upper part 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.550
 of the body at the same time as a market 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.460
 that is to say, to solicit the pectorals 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.890
 dorsal biceps triceps 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.329
 therefore by soliciting all his 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.270
 muscles we will see the cardio that is going to be 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 very busy so it's an activity 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.430
 we will say a sport probably their share 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.900
 whole and who full of planning 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 it's good that we can work with 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.160
 all really from 7 to 77 years old is on the way 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 apart from people do we know 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:09.330
 yakutia me too breaks down into three 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.280
 sequences 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.440
 firstly the first sequence it's going to be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 warm-up that awakens muscular 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.330
 to rust a little bit 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.400
 joints 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 it goes from the report quarter of an hour more 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 we have what is called the sitting session 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 there for an hour and a half we go 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.690
 to actually go for a hike 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 during which we see a little bit of 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.140
 muscle building hopefully give 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 to his rule and work him some 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.649
 clear data here too it will last to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.190
 about ten minutes to fifteen minutes 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.390
 then we go back and on the end of the body 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.399
 of session we will go to the third 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.300
 sequence that is going to be the stretching a 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:46.680
 little bit of stretching then for 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.450
 Nordic walking requires 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.950
 sticks the specific sticks without this 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.690
 are not hiking poles and who 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.340
 are usually heavier that 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 are telescopic to be eaten in 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.810
 the backpack laurent nordic walking on 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 will use many boats in 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.939
 castle cars there is a specificity 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.380
 it is that he has a skin is inclined goes 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.100
 enable us to work with 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.390
 angles of 60 degrees this is as if he 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 we beat in front of the vertical we go 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.959
 place it well here she supported then 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.580
 we are connected to the drummer with a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.080
 Catholic and will park from the east will us 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 allow to think the plans on the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.610
 stick in order to maintain the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.049
 hand and have a maximum amplitude at 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
 arm level that will give us the 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.890
 crowds and maxim so this morning in 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.720
 taking very important in the choice of 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.030
 this stick simply we will lead if 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.250
 the stick in front of you and we have to see the 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.530
 sea ​​roughly at the level of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.720
 so we laugh parallel sales ground 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.460
 even slightly inclined down 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.020
 because when you are a beginner you 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.490
 can choose short boats so 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.080
 we're going to have carbon sticks and then 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.200
 we'll also see boats go from 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.200
 peer 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.090
 and generally we will rather favored 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.980
 the carbon shutters that are a lot 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.920
 more rigid and we will pay attention to the rate 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.489
 of carbon remembers in his boots 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.620
 generally what to watch 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.540
 it's to have a solid gameplay 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.610
 who takes the same well not too much 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.349
 bulky and that will allow us a 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.849
 on a sufficient clearance to be able to 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.849
 well transfer the effort backwards 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.430
 so to practice Nordic walking 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.870
 in addition to the sticks it took a holding 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.610
 adapted so for that it's relatively 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.910
 simple it is enough we will find that at 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.440
 running ray for example offered 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.150
 from the parties vote at its 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.830
 evidence in something of hop on is 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.760
 comfortable and the most important summit 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.650
 but I am rather shoes of 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.030
 trail ie things he observes 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.650
 for example for mountain running 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.739
 they are simply tennis 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.239
 specific with a very large part 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.739
 pony below everything they avoid from 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.090
 drag after we can possibly 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.410
 also find specific shoes 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.580
 Nordic walking 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.720
 roughly speaking it's a little bit the same 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.459
 it's very good to leave with 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.020
 a little bit of water so the camel back 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.610
 it's a thing that can be pretty good 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.320
 and then possibly have some 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.260
 pasta because it's still a 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.069
 activity that's pretty enough how 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.019
 say 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.790
 energy consumer so you have to 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:14.959
 plan to eat a little bit 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.579
 and recharge some batteries while 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.289
 that there are three fundamental pros to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.209
 know the first beating cd is going 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.650
 never put them in front because there 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.180
 when I press my sticks I go 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.590
 send back an effort that is in the aftermath of 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.229
 stick so here if I do not have so much 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.150
 in front of my effort he leaves behind the 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.460
 name but bad froze the masters well 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.680
 here backward inclined at 60 degrees 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.930
 here are his beveled tips are made 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.520
 to work in that direction and at this 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.009
 moment I will be able to use this 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.500
 propulsive force to move me 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.849
 sticks first things are behind 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.620
 second thing nordic walking is 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.270
 a brand quite natural so if 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.810
 I move left, I will move forward 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.699
 opposite hand 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.990
 ie the right hand and there I 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.389
 see how should we just place ourselves 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.759
 exactly between my feet no wind 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.979
 not too much behind but here between my 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.229
 feet once that's done I'm going 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.639
 open my hand transfer the effort on 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.020
 the cake that connected fighting 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.970
 to allow me to transmit 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.349
 when would be the effort and have here 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.120
 a maximum amplitude at the level of 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.479
 arm so a crowd is relatively 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.270
 long 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:17.500
 okay under these conditions 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.970
 we moved we knew from now on to 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.260
 happen is not difficult but there 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.400
 think more it's the thing was doing 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.900
 plant either you are like that but 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.030
 firm agrees even if you can 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.680
 be good time to be reversed 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.850
 white process launches I transfer the 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.980
 weight on the time and I'll try 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.880
 to bring down the arms 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.890
 and there you are near and the thighs 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.890
 and so in fact you just have to think 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.120
 I kept pushing for expected 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.020
 but opening my hand every time 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.780
 I will push more 150 pages that avoids 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.610
 that the dragons is the opinion of 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.660
 to pass a small pond the reference is 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.920
 your fai lets think of your facebook 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.300
 that your mail to heal the buttocks in 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.830
 opening because if you will not have to 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.540
 you can not go there because to arrive 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.520
 the uci at the level of the hip the wrist 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.260
 block and so I bring back this agreement so 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:08.440
 yes if toy not I can go more 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:10.000
 far all this so that six days then 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.680
 obviously when we walk we tap 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.830
 all this is normal we do not have all the 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.580
 time so it's okay but time 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.170
 in time thought if I tell you proud of the 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.290
 road of the coast draw 17 is the 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.290
 his 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.539
 if you do it from time to time but 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.539
 after that becomes respectively
