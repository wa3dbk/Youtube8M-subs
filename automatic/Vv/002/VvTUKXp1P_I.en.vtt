00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.990 
two galaxies actually collide with each
other<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.620> Stars<00:02:50.920> basically<00:02:51.489> pass<00:02:51.730> right

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
other the Stars basically pass right

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.210 
other the Stars basically pass right
between<00:02:52.360> each<00:02:52.630> other<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.079> the<00:02:53.530> chance<00:02:53.829> of<00:02:54.010> two

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
between each other and the chance of two

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.039 
between each other and the chance of two
stars<00:02:54.519> directly<00:02:55.209> hitting<00:02:55.450> each<00:02:55.660> other<00:02:55.810> is

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
stars directly hitting each other is

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.830 
stars directly hitting each other is
really<00:02:56.530> really<00:02:56.709> small<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.600> likelihood

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
really really small so the likelihood

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.080 
really really small so the likelihood
that<00:02:59.170> our<00:02:59.410> solar<00:02:59.650> system<00:03:00.130> will<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.519> directly

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
that our solar system will be directly

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.110 
that our solar system will be directly
impacted<00:03:01.870> by<00:03:02.560> an<00:03:02.709> other<00:03:02.890> star<00:03:03.280> for<00:03:03.609> example<00:03:04.000> in

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
impacted by an other star for example in

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.729 
impacted by an other star for example in
Andromeda<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:04.780> we<00:03:04.959> collide<00:03:05.170> with<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> is

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
Andromeda as we collide with it is

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.340 
Andromeda as we collide with it is
really<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.430> small<00:03:06.780> well<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:07.959> life<00:03:08.319> is

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
really really small well if life is

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.199 
really really small well if life is
still<00:03:08.739> present<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.190> earth<00:03:09.250> when<00:03:09.639> this<00:03:09.760> happens

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
still present on earth when this happens

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.090 
still present on earth when this happens
the<00:03:10.420> changes<00:03:11.109> in<00:03:11.139> the<00:03:11.260> sky<00:03:11.530> will<00:03:11.769> be<00:03:11.920> quite

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
the changes in the sky will be quite

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.160 
the changes in the sky will be quite
spectacular<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.940> there<00:03:13.209> will<00:03:13.359> be<00:03:13.510> very<00:03:13.810> very

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
spectacular now there will be very very

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.890 
spectacular now there will be very very
slow<00:03:14.620> because<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.549> time<00:03:15.819> scales<00:03:16.180> on<00:03:16.569> the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
slow because the time scales on the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.750 
slow because the time scales on the
scales<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.350> galaxies<00:03:17.859> in<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.100> universe<00:03:18.220> are

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
scales of galaxies in the universe are

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.580 
scales of galaxies in the universe are
very<00:03:19.030> very<00:03:19.329> long<00:03:19.569> so<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:20.230> have<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.560> think

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
very very long so you have to think

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.580 
very very long so you have to think
millions<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.670> years<00:03:21.940> but<00:03:22.600> even<00:03:22.750> then<00:03:23.079> over

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
millions of years but even then over

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.740 
millions of years but even then over
these<00:03:23.769> timescales<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.250> millions<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.880> years<00:03:25.180> we

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
these timescales of millions of years we

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.440 
these timescales of millions of years we
will<00:03:25.870> see<00:03:26.079> big<00:03:26.260> changes<00:03:26.290> if<00:03:27.000> we<00:03:28.000> wait<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.239> few

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
will see big changes if we wait a few

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.240 
will see big changes if we wait a few
billion<00:03:29.019> years<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.590> drum<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> will<00:03:30.130> be

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
billion years and drum and I will be

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.309 
billion years and drum and I will be
huge<00:03:30.519> on<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.819> sky<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.239> will<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.600> as<00:03:31.750> big<00:03:32.079> as<00:03:32.200> our

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
huge on the sky it will be as big as our

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.349 
huge on the sky it will be as big as our
Milky<00:03:32.680> Way<00:03:32.709> because<00:03:33.430> we'll<00:03:33.579> be<00:03:33.609> very<00:03:33.850> close<00:03:34.150> to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
Milky Way because we'll be very close to

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.440 
Milky Way because we'll be very close to
it<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.630> then<00:03:35.530> later<00:03:36.160> when<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.970> galaxies

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
it and then later when the galaxies

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.099 
it and then later when the galaxies
merge<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.739> merged<00:03:39.450> remnants<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.780> Milky

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
merge the merged remnants of the Milky

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.379 
merge the merged remnants of the Milky
Way<00:03:41.230> galaxy<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:41.769> Andromeda<00:03:42.250> will<00:03:43.030> look<00:03:43.239> more

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
Way galaxy and Andromeda will look more

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.720 
Way galaxy and Andromeda will look more
like<00:03:43.540> an<00:03:43.720> elliptical<00:03:44.170> galaxy<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.829> we<00:03:45.489> will<00:03:45.609> be

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
like an elliptical galaxy and we will be

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
like an elliptical galaxy and we will be
sitting<00:03:45.970> right<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:47.079> the<00:03:47.290> view<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.859> the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
sitting right in it so the view of the

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.979 
sitting right in it so the view of the
Milky<00:03:48.549> Way<00:03:48.910> on<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.329> night<00:03:49.480> sky<00:03:49.750> will<00:03:49.959> be

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
Milky Way on the night sky will be

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.860 
Milky Way on the night sky will be
completely<00:03:50.560> gone<00:03:50.769> and<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:52.120> band<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.720> light

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
completely gone and this band of light

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.370 
completely gone and this band of light
will<00:03:53.170> be<00:03:53.290> replaced<00:03:53.680> by<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:54.010> more<00:03:54.400> spheroidal

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
will be replaced by a more spheroidal

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.130 
will be replaced by a more spheroidal
distribution<00:03:56.380> of<00:03:56.470> life

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
distribution of life

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.720 
distribution of life
and<00:03:59.660> so<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.960> son<00:04:01.230> born<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> Milky<00:04:02.580> Way

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
and so the son born in the Milky Way

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.270 
and so the son born in the Milky Way
almost<00:04:03.150> five<00:04:03.420> billion<00:04:03.810> years<00:04:04.140> ago<00:04:04.230> will<00:04:05.100> end

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
almost five billion years ago will end

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.449 
almost five billion years ago will end
its<00:04:05.459> life<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.060> new<00:04:06.270> orbit<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.900> part<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:08.280> new
