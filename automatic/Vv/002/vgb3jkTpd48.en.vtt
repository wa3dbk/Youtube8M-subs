00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
my first readathon ever and so I feel

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
my first readathon ever and so I feel
like<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:33.390> should<00:00:33.690> partake<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.530> many<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> them

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
like I should partake in as many of them

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
like I should partake in as many of them
as<00:00:35.100> possible<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.120> always<00:00:36.329> just

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
as possible because they are always just

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.750 
as possible because they are always just
a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.380> fun<00:00:37.530> now<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.399> someone<00:00:38.640> who

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a lot of fun now I'm not someone who

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.350 
a lot of fun now I'm not someone who
likes<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.350> strict<00:00:40.770> TVR<00:00:41.309> because<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
likes to make a strict TVR because that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.020 
likes to make a strict TVR because that
never<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:43.110> works<00:00:43.770> out<00:00:43.920> quite<00:00:44.340> well<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.879> me

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
never really works out quite well for me

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.520 
never really works out quite well for me
so<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> one<00:00:45.660> goal<00:00:45.840> I'm<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.440> make

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so the one goal I'm going to make

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
so the one goal I'm going to make
confirmed<00:00:46.890> myself<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.430> read<00:00:47.850> 150<00:00:48.510> pages<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
confirmed myself is to read 150 pages a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
confirmed myself is to read 150 pages a
day<00:00:48.960> which<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.700> bit<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
day which is going to be a bit of a

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
day which is going to be a bit of a
stretch<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.510> me<00:00:51.539> because<00:00:52.199> recently<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
stretch for me because recently I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
stretch for me because recently I
haven't<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.489> been<00:00:53.670> reading<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.270> much

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.340 
down below in case you're interested but
that<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.269> read<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.660> like<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.810> day<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.079> if<00:03:28.260> you
