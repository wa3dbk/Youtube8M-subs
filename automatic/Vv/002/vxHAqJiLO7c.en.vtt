 five years was carried out in reform 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.210
 but he was the success of this fair 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.610
 Oscar that was already insufficient you and me 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.500
 we have gone to that place during the five 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.540
 past editions and it was already very difficult 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.990
 walk on the sidewalks of the step of the 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.060
 reform 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.580
 you had to get off even the street was 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 overflowing correctly a 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.240
 moment when they had to close with 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.300
 fences a lane of the reform walk 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.280
 because it was practically impossible 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.350
 that all the people that went that could 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 Easily circulate the canteen this 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.330
 year will be in the zócalo there are 87 stands of 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.830
 29 87 embassies and this started today and it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.450
 will continue for the next two 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.970
 weeks that you will find people 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.520
 obviously then information 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.490
 tourist of these countries gastronomy is 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.700
 say going to see from the roast meats 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.440
 the empanadas and the choripanes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 even some beers that brought 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.370
 some countries 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.370
 some beers like belgian germany go 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.200
 to put beers and eyes on sale now 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.210
 we mentioned a while start to power 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.470
 drinking in the stands is not going to be able 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.830
 walk around the whole sky 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.700
 they stop so they're more careful 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.280
 something that is also being done in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.050
 this at this moment already from now is 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.980
 close the circulation of the socket of the 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 Mexico City 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.050
 precisely so that people can 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.970
 have greater freedom 87 countries to tap is 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.130
 very much is they to the other we talk 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.020
 with the secretary of tourism of 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.390
 federal district is the world in the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.540
 socket so it's literally second in the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.760
 socket countries of asia europe africa and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.140
 Oceania and obviously Latin America 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.700
 there are represented 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.280
 it's worth going for a spin to 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.530
 know a bit of the culture of 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.570
 other countries and eventually why not 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.459
 plan a trip to one of these places 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.709
 because there are also facilities for 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.420
 to take a trip there and I 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.250
 We invite you to continue questioning the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.250
