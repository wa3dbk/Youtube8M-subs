00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.910
 by 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.610
 by the piano the colom method allowed 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.739
 to discover and finally be able to 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.629
 to make tons on the internet which me 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.010
 I was seduced away because, 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.230
 did I wanted to quickly learn from 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.449
 joly pieces whose pieces are 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.280
 beautiful years and from the first 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.579
 week in fact we play something this 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.399
 who convinced me this is the method by 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.229
 cd that seemed very original internship 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.430
 showed me that on the technical level we 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.649
 could progress that there was 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.969
 a lot of interesting things to do 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.620
 and then suddenly I adopted the method 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.299
 through that way because who has me 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.350
 really interested is that I found 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.830
 that there was an educational coherence 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.080
 same subject of difficulties I persevere 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.479
 because I like it today ten 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.860
 double variety curve where I am very 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.780
 of course mid-series 3 it becomes a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.820
 little bit more difficult melodies 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.090
 are absolutely superb 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 and it is very very very activates 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.010
 easy summer learning scores in 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.330
 soo blood 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.980
 I have never done music theory of my life and 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.900
 however after a week I have 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.710
 managed to decipher a partition to the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.310
 to play 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.290
 is it held elsewhere a 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.820
 constant progression in that it is 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.490
 all the time motivated we have all the time 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.659
 a little the method is perfect for 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.360
 people who work people who are 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:54.360
 paid become something necessary 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 the strain and finally 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.590
 to make my childhood dream
