toy yeah majin would be really cool if

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.640 
toy yeah majin would be really cool if
we<00:01:21.270> could<00:01:21.479> build<00:01:21.660> one<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.080> big<00:01:22.410> enough

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
we could build one of these big enough

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.020 
we could build one of these big enough
that<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.070> ride<00:01:25.340> all<00:01:26.340> right<00:01:26.550> here<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.910> is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that we could ride all right here it is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
that we could ride all right here it is
we<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> dual<00:01:28.440> drive<00:01:28.740> motors<00:01:29.130> our<00:01:29.850> next

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
we have a dual drive motors our next

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
we have a dual drive motors our next
step<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:31.110> put<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.440> leg<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.220> see<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.520> we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
step is to put on a leg and see if we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.140 
step is to put on a leg and see if we
have<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> motion<00:01:33.210> right

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
attached our leg now we're gonna put

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.970 
attached our leg now we're gonna put
some<00:01:47.030> juice<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.780> see<00:01:48.470> what<00:01:48.620> happens

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
wing like the ornithopter or simply

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.930 
wing like the ornithopter or simply
flapping<00:02:31.970> your<00:02:32.060> wings<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.630> bird<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:34.790> the

flapping your wings like a bird over the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.330 
flapping your wings like a bird over the
years<00:02:35.240> many<00:02:36.020> people<00:02:36.500> have<00:02:36.709> tried<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> make

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
years many people have tried to make

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.150 
years many people have tried to make
this<00:02:37.550> ornithopter<00:02:38.209> design<00:02:38.570> work<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.260> you've

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
this ornithopter design work as you've

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.970 
this ornithopter design work as you've
seen<00:02:40.370> from<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.700> archival<00:02:41.270> footage<00:02:41.770> most<00:02:42.770> of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
seen from the archival footage most of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.030 
seen from the archival footage most of
them<00:02:43.130> have<00:02:43.160> failed<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:45.320> only<00:02:45.620> working

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
them have failed the only working

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.340 
them have failed the only working
ornithopters<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.760> know<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.120> our<00:02:47.360> lawns<00:02:47.930> and

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
ornithopters I know of our lawns and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.580 
ornithopters I know of our lawns and
poise<00:02:48.680> such<00:02:48.709> as<00:02:49.160> these<00:02:49.750> what<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.870> think<00:02:51.200> that's

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
poise such as these what I think that's

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.140 
poise such as these what I think that's
about<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.280> change<00:02:54.040> okay<00:02:55.040> here's<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.970> layout

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
about to change okay here's the layout

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.620 
about to change okay here's the layout
of<00:02:56.330> our<00:02:56.570> wing<00:02:56.780> here's<00:02:57.590> our<00:02:57.769> main<00:02:57.980> arm<00:02:58.480> here<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
of our wing here's our main arm here the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.360 
of our wing here's our main arm here the
individual<00:03:00.200> ribs<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:01.070> are<00:03:01.130> going<00:03:01.280> to

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
individual ribs that are going to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.800 
individual ribs that are going to
support<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.910> plastic<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.600> we're<00:03:02.720> gonna

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
support the plastic that we're gonna

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.600 
support the plastic that we're gonna
stretch<00:03:03.200> across<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.560> wing<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.160> turn<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.489> into

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
stretch across the wing to turn it into

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.820 
stretch across the wing to turn it into
an<00:03:04.760> airfoil<00:03:06.190> yeah<00:03:07.190> aluminum<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.000> plastic

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
an airfoil yeah aluminum and plastic

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.710 
an airfoil yeah aluminum and plastic
seems<00:03:09.830> pretty<00:03:10.070> flimsy<00:03:10.400> doesn't<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.000> well<00:03:11.600> let

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
seems pretty flimsy doesn't it well let

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.080 
seems pretty flimsy doesn't it well let
me<00:03:11.810> tell<00:03:11.989> you<00:03:12.200> it's<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.890> far<00:03:13.160> cry<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:13.489> the<00:03:13.790> wood

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
me tell you it's a far cry from the wood

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.370 
me tell you it's a far cry from the wood
and<00:03:14.269> paper<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.900> Wright<00:03:15.080> brothers<00:03:15.110> used

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
and paper that the Wright brothers used

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.720 
and paper that the Wright brothers used
here's<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.560> plastic<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.160> we're<00:03:19.370> gonna<00:03:19.489> use
