globe artichoke and it's humongous most

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.910 
globe artichoke and it's humongous most
of<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.420> times<00:00:22.630> you<00:00:22.750> can<00:00:22.960> just<00:00:22.990> sort<00:00:23.470> of<00:00:23.560> steam

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 
of the times you can just sort of steam

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.500 
of the times you can just sort of steam
it<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.340> then<00:00:24.550> just<00:00:24.939> enjoy<00:00:25.090> it

playing<00:00:25.840> as<00:00:26.050> it<00:00:26.200> is<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.500> best<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.800> think<00:00:26.830> just

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
playing as it is the best I think just

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.910 
playing as it is the best I think just
how<00:00:27.670> most<00:00:27.970> people<00:00:28.060> eat<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.570> but<00:00:29.170> artichoke<00:00:29.740> is

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
how most people eat it but artichoke is

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.640 
how most people eat it but artichoke is
really<00:00:30.220> great<00:00:30.460> fresh<00:00:30.850> in<00:00:31.330> salads<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.379> in

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
pasta so when you want to use it in

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.229 
pasta so when you want to use it in
those<00:00:35.470> instances<00:00:35.920> it's<00:00:36.430> really<00:00:36.699> nice<00:00:36.910> to<00:00:37.120> sort

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
those instances it's really nice to sort

of<00:00:37.420> prepare<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:38.020> by<00:00:38.559> removing<00:00:39.400> all<00:00:39.580> the<00:00:39.730> leaves

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
of prepare it by removing all the leaves

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.510 
of prepare it by removing all the leaves
and<00:00:40.480> cleaning<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.050> up<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.500> that<00:00:42.040> way<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.220> can

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.689 
think artichokes just like beet all
right<00:00:55.300> like<00:00:55.420> one<00:00:55.720> of<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:55.960> difficult

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
right like one of the difficult

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.310 
right like one of the difficult
vegetables<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.790> work<00:00:57.970> with<00:00:58.210> but<00:00:58.930> we're<00:00:59.199> gonna

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
vegetables to work with but we're gonna

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.710 
vegetables to work with but we're gonna
we're<00:00:59.769> gonna<00:00:59.860> give<00:01:00.100> it<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.220> try<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.479> first

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
we're gonna give it a try so the first

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.200 
we're gonna give it a try so the first
thing<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.960> do<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.799> you<00:01:03.430> cut<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:03.909> stem

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
thing you do is you you cut the stem

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.770 
thing you do is you you cut the stem
part<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.710> cut<00:01:05.920> about<00:01:06.130> two<00:01:06.400> inches<00:01:07.060> from

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
part and you cut about two inches from

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.690 
part and you cut about two inches from
the<00:01:07.990> base<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:12.400> you<00:01:12.549> cut<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.909> top<00:01:13.150> part<00:01:13.180> off

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the base then you cut the top part off

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.980 
the base then you cut the top part off
about<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.940> same<00:01:16.210> thing

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.170 

and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> feel<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.670> arch<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
and then you feel this the arch of the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.969 
and then you feel this the arch of the
harder<00:01:24.479> part<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:25.860> we're

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
harder part and then this is what we're

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.219 
harder part and then this is what we're
gonna<00:01:26.100> work<00:01:26.310> with<00:01:26.570> alright<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.720> after<00:01:27.900> you've

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
gonna work with alright so after you've

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190 
gonna work with alright so after you've
taken<00:01:28.470> off<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.189> base<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.360> top<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
