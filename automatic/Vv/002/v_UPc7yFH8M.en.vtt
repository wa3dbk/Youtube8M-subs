hey<00:00:01.020> everyone<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.500> is<00:00:01.560> murderous<00:00:02.129> expected

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey everyone this is murderous expected

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.690 
hey everyone this is murderous expected
zero<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.240> gonna<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.339> do<00:00:05.339> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
zero and I'm gonna show you how to do a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.530 
zero and I'm gonna show you how to do a
Punnett<00:00:06.660> square<00:00:07.130> so<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.730> video<00:00:08.970> let's

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
Punnett square so in this video let's

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.950 
Punnett square so in this video let's
cross<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.910> brown-eyed<00:00:11.910> needle<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:15.509> apply<00:00:15.839> on

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
cross a brown-eyed needle and apply on

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.240 
cross a brown-eyed needle and apply on
that<00:00:16.109> female<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.920> they're<00:00:17.100> both

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
that female and they're both

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.050 
that female and they're both
heterozygous<00:00:18.150> meaning<00:00:18.869> they<00:00:19.170> carry<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.880> gene

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
heterozygous meaning they carry the gene

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.500 
heterozygous meaning they carry the gene
for<00:00:21.449> blue<00:00:21.539> eyes<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.439> they<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:23.300> brown<00:00:24.300> eyed

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
for blue eyes but they are brown eyed

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.439 
for blue eyes but they are brown eyed
because<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.289> gene<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.310> dominant<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.240> let's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
because that gene is dominant so let's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.060 
because that gene is dominant so let's
make<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> Punnett<00:00:27.990> square<00:00:28.230> like<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.619> did<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.949> my

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
make a Punnett square like I did in my

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.759 
make a Punnett square like I did in my
last<00:00:29.310> video<00:00:29.760> how<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.570> make<00:00:30.779> another<00:00:31.410> planets

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
last video how to make another planets

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.230 
last video how to make another planets
with

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
with

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.150 
with
early<00:00:33.930> simple<00:00:34.260> make<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> where'd<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> get

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
early simple make and where'd you get

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.300 
early simple make and where'd you get
these<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.640> me

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
these for me

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.070 
these for me
make<00:00:36.790> them<00:00:36.940> out<00:00:37.150> he'll<00:00:37.540> just<00:00:37.810> kind<00:00:37.960> of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
make them out he'll just kind of

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.020 
make them out he'll just kind of
scribble<00:00:38.290> like<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.740> do<00:00:38.800> or<00:00:39.580> you'll<00:00:39.760> memorize

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
scribble like I do or you'll memorize

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.620 
scribble like I do or you'll memorize
how<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.090> work<00:00:43.840> them<00:00:44.050> out<00:00:46.080> down<00:00:47.080> here<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:49.570> you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
how to work them out down here now you

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.680 
how to work them out down here now you
always<00:00:49.930> want<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.290> keep<00:00:50.440> them<00:00:50.620> to<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:52.480> one

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
always want to keep them to the to one

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.750 
always want to keep them to the to one
side<00:00:53.080> you<00:00:53.470> don't<00:00:54.100> want<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.309> mix<00:00:54.489> up<00:00:54.610> the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
side you don't want to mix up the

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.979 
side you don't want to mix up the
letters<00:00:54.910> you<00:00:55.180> can't<00:00:55.360> just<00:00:55.510> put<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.720> letters

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
letters you can't just put the letters

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.900 
letters you can't just put the letters
anywhere<00:00:57.150> there<00:00:58.470> now<00:00:59.470> this<00:01:00.309> is<00:01:00.460> how<00:01:00.610> they<00:01:00.790> work

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
anywhere there now this is how they work

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.600 
anywhere there now this is how they work
them<00:01:01.059> out<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.840> let's<00:01:02.230> start<00:01:02.470> with<00:01:02.680> this<00:01:03.280> box

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
them out and let's start with this box

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.600 
them out and let's start with this box
right<00:01:04.119> here<00:01:04.410> we're<00:01:05.410> going<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.680> bring<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.369> one

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
right here we're going to bring this one

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.460 
right here we're going to bring this one
down<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:08.320> one<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:09.899> if<00:01:10.899> you<00:01:11.140> add<00:01:11.290> them

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
down and this one and if you add them

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.469 
down and this one and if you add them
together<00:01:11.649> it's<00:01:12.040> not<00:01:12.190> be<00:01:12.340> B<00:01:12.490> squared<00:01:12.820> or<00:01:13.090> B

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
together it's not be B squared or B

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.760 
together it's not be B squared or B
squared<00:01:14.160> it's<00:01:15.160> just<00:01:15.550> a<00:01:15.640> BB<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:17.500> add<00:01:17.649> them

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
squared it's just a BB just add them

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.800 
squared it's just a BB just add them
together<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:20.350> after<00:01:21.009> that<00:01:21.220> we<00:01:21.880> move<00:01:22.180> on

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
together and so after that we move on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.310 
together and so after that we move on
-<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:24.290> get<00:01:24.440> this<00:01:24.680> one<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:26.330> then<00:01:26.479> we<00:01:26.750> go<00:01:26.900> all<00:01:27.110> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
- we get this one and then we go all the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.830 
- we get this one and then we go all the
way<00:01:27.950> over<00:01:28.130> there

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
way over there

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.249 
way over there
and<00:01:30.040> then<00:01:31.040> we<00:01:31.760> make<00:01:33.369> Big<00:01:34.369> B<00:01:34.549> little<00:01:34.580> B<00:01:35.259> just

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
and then we make Big B little B just

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.060 
and then we make Big B little B just
like<00:01:36.320> parents<00:01:36.799> same<00:01:37.790> genotype<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.770> then<00:01:39.920> we

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
like parents same genotype and then we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.200 
like parents same genotype and then we
do<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.310> next<00:01:40.340> one

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
do the next one

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.950 
do the next one
then<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.140> last<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.810> how

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
then we do the last one so that is how

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.350 
then we do the last one so that is how
you<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.619> Punnett<00:01:46.979> square

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.910 

and<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.620> two-by-two<00:01:53.040> way<00:01:53.400> is<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> way

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
and that's the two-by-two way is the way

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.960 
and that's the two-by-two way is the way
basically<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> only<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.550> can<00:01:56.760> do<00:01:56.940> that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
basically the only way you can do that

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.130 
basically the only way you can do that
but<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.170> teach<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.610> case

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
but I'm going to teach you just in case

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.930 
but I'm going to teach you just in case
you<00:02:01.140> ever<00:02:01.320> come<00:02:01.650> across<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.160> problem<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
you ever come across a problem and you

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.930 
you ever come across a problem and you
don't<00:02:03.150> want<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:04.260> so<00:02:05.250> why<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
don't want to do it out so why don't we

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.440 
don't want to do it out so why don't we
do<00:02:06.470> Big<00:02:07.470> B<00:02:07.680> Big<00:02:08.040> B<00:02:08.479> homozygous<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:10.050> brown<00:02:11.450> male

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
do Big B Big B homozygous for brown male

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.330 
do Big B Big B homozygous for brown male
with<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.260> blue<00:02:13.650> eyed<00:02:13.830> female<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> let's<00:02:17.160> make

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
with a blue eyed female so let's make

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.710 
with a blue eyed female so let's make
another<00:02:17.460> punnett<00:02:17.970> square

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.260 

kind<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.350> a<00:02:24.470> skinny<00:02:24.860> skirt<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> look

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:40.220 

for<00:02:32.630> Pina

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.350 

look<00:02:40.769> at<00:02:40.890> that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.510 

what<00:02:44.490> well<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.380> see<00:02:47.560> these<00:02:48.070> parents

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
what well as you can see these parents

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700 
what well as you can see these parents
have<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.820> same<00:02:48.850> trait<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:50.050> parent<00:02:50.440> has<00:02:50.620> the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
have the same trait this parent has the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.660 
have the same trait this parent has the
same<00:02:50.890> trait<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.550> can<00:02:51.670> only<00:02:51.790> pass<00:02:52.090> down<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:53.670> be

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
same trait so it can only pass down a be

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.110 
same trait so it can only pass down a be
a<00:02:54.970> big<00:02:55.660> B<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.830> it's<00:02:57.160> kind<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.430> pointless<00:02:57.640> to

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
a big B so it's kind of pointless to

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.780 
a big B so it's kind of pointless to
have<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:59.020> big<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.410> there<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.250> let's<00:03:00.460> get<00:03:00.610> rid

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
have the big be there so let's get rid

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.680 
have the big be there so let's get rid
of<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.500> now<00:03:02.500> it's<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.670> same<00:03:03.880> way<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.510> can

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
of that now it's the same way it can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.720 
of that now it's the same way it can
only<00:03:04.810> give<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> little<00:03:05.260> bit<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.460> big

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
only give a little bit so in that big

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.550 
only give a little bit so in that big
square<00:03:07.000> all<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.480> children<00:03:08.200> would<00:03:08.500> be

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
square all the children would be

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.670 
square all the children would be
heterozygous<00:03:09.190> B

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.160 

and<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.190> in<00:03:16.460> the<00:03:16.520> simplified<00:03:17.210> version<00:03:17.930> of<00:03:18.080> a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
and so it in the simplified version of a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.950 
and so it in the simplified version of a
punnett<00:03:18.500> square<00:03:18.740> one<00:03:19.190> pendant<00:03:19.610> squared<00:03:19.960> so

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
punnett square one pendant squared so

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.020 
punnett square one pendant squared so
that<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.470> how<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.680> do<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> Punnett<00:03:22.310> square<00:03:22.520> even

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that is how you do a Punnett square even

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.210 
that is how you do a Punnett square even
a<00:03:23.120> symbolized<00:03:23.600> version<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.740> only<00:03:24.920> do

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
a symbolized version you can only do

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.490 
a symbolized version you can only do
that<00:03:25.400> when<00:03:25.820> there<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.380> when<00:03:27.380> they're

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
that when there is when they're

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.610 
that when there is when they're
homozygous<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:29.600> may<00:03:29.750> not<00:03:29.900> be<00:03:30.080> able<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.500> do

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
homozygous and you may not be able to do

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.780 
homozygous and you may not be able to do
it<00:03:30.740> for<00:03:30.920> both<00:03:31.040> pairs<00:03:31.960> so<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.640> make

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
it for both pairs so you have to make

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.580 
it for both pairs so you have to make
sure<00:03:34.910> they're<00:03:35.150> both<00:03:35.360> but<00:03:36.020> you<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.380> for

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
sure they're both but you can do it for

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.020 
sure they're both but you can do it for
one<00:03:37.210> so<00:03:38.210> this<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.840> Mark
