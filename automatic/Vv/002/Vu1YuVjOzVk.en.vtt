from<00:00:31.150> a<00:00:31.210> fish<00:00:31.930> that<00:00:32.169> has<00:00:32.320> just<00:00:32.619> died<00:00:32.920> or<00:00:33.700> that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
from a fish that has just died or that

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.170 
from a fish that has just died or that
was<00:00:34.600> killed<00:00:34.960> during<00:00:35.200> cooking

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.300 

what<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.510> deal<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.750> with<00:00:41.020> fish<00:00:41.530> that<00:00:42.160> have

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
what the deal is with fish that have

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.180 
what the deal is with fish that have
died<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.970> then<00:00:43.090> you<00:00:43.210> cook<00:00:43.450> it<00:00:43.740> it<00:00:44.740> is<00:00:45.160> a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
died and then you cook it it is a

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.880 
died and then you cook it it is a
there's<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.670> there's<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.570> slight<00:00:49.350> sour<00:00:50.350> bitter

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
there's a there's a slight sour bitter

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.690 
there's a there's a slight sour bitter
taste<00:00:51.280> to<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.640> fish<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.860> think<00:00:54.100> the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
taste to the fish and I think the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.940 
taste to the fish and I think the
American<00:00:55.120> palate<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.630> used<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.050> fish<00:00:56.290> that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
American palate is used to fish that

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.500 
American palate is used to fish that
have<00:00:57.540> always<00:00:58.540> been<00:00:58.690> killed<00:00:58.960> before<00:00:59.110> cooking

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
have always been killed before cooking

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.400 
have always been killed before cooking
so<00:01:01.650> when<00:01:02.650> when<00:01:03.130> you've<00:01:03.400> been<00:01:03.580> eating<00:01:04.410> fresh

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
so when when you've been eating fresh

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.580 
so when when you've been eating fresh
fish<00:01:05.710> for<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> long<00:01:06.520> time<00:01:07.200> especially<00:01:08.200> here<00:01:08.560> in

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
fish for a long time especially here in

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.960 
fish for a long time especially here in
Asia<00:01:08.830> where<00:01:09.160> fresh<00:01:09.520> fish<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:09.910> very<00:01:10.119> common<00:01:10.540> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
Asia where fresh fish is very common and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.400 
Asia where fresh fish is very common and
and<00:01:12.970> then<00:01:13.210> when<00:01:13.360> you<00:01:13.450> taste<00:01:13.660> a<00:01:13.810> fish<00:01:14.259> that's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
and then when you taste a fish that's

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.950 
and then when you taste a fish that's
been<00:01:14.590> killed<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:16.030> died<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.540> then<00:01:16.690> and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
been killed that that died and then and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.070 
been killed that that died and then and
then<00:01:17.050> cooked<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:18.220> there's<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.940> big<00:01:19.240> noticeable
