00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
absolutely absolutely I started playing

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.159 
absolutely absolutely I started playing
the<00:04:58.160> flute<00:04:58.370> when<00:04:58.640> I<00:04:58.760> was<00:04:59.000> four<00:04:59.780> or<00:04:59.810> five<00:05:00.140> years

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
the flute when I was four or five years

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.040 
the flute when I was four or five years
old<00:05:00.620> my<00:05:01.130> mother<00:05:01.310> was<00:05:01.520> my<00:05:01.640> flute<00:05:01.880> teacher<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.540> I

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
old my mother was my flute teacher and I

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.010 
old my mother was my flute teacher and I
played<00:05:03.260> competitively<00:05:03.940> until<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.330> was<00:05:05.960> about

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
played competitively until I was about

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.930 
played competitively until I was about
19<00:05:06.320> 20<00:05:06.890> and<00:05:06.919> I<00:05:07.100> even<00:05:07.490> still<00:05:07.700> playing

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
19 20 and I even still playing

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.060 
19 20 and I even still playing
orchestras<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.510> I<00:05:08.690> get<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.930> chance<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:09.560> it's

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
orchestras and I get the chance and it's

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.490 
orchestras and I get the chance and it's
just<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.730> just<00:05:10.910> approach<00:05:11.330> things<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:12.080> mean<00:05:12.410> the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
just you just approach things I mean the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.320 
just you just approach things I mean the
flute<00:05:12.740> is<00:05:12.919> all<00:05:13.130> about<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.580> melody<00:05:13.940> anyway<00:05:14.270> so

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
flute is all about the melody anyway so

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.140 
flute is all about the melody anyway so
I<00:05:14.480> guess<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.930> just<00:05:15.470> goes<00:05:15.800> hand<00:05:16.220> in<00:05:16.340> hand<00:05:16.400> just

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
I guess it just goes hand in hand just

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.720 
I guess it just goes hand in hand just
phrasing<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:17.780> everything<00:05:18.260> my<00:05:19.190> vibrato<00:05:19.580> is

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730
