00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.059 

and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:05.730> once<00:03:06.299> you've<00:03:06.569> patted<00:03:07.140> them<00:03:07.349> in<00:03:07.530> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.640 
and then once you've patted them in you
can<00:03:08.459> sweep<00:03:09.269> from<00:03:09.480> left<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.930> right<00:03:10.230> quite

can sweep from left to right quite

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.789 
can sweep from left to right quite
vigorously<00:03:11.659> until<00:03:12.659> all<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.319> pigment<00:03:13.739> has

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
vigorously until all the pigment has

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.410 
vigorously until all the pigment has
disappeared<00:03:14.730> from<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.150> black<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:17.120> then<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
disappeared from the black and then you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.949 
disappeared from the black and then you
