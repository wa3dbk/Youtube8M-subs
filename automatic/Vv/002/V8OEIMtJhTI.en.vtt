wanted to switch it up a little bit and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
wanted to switch it up a little bit and
not<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> regular<00:00:55.260> squat<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.250> went

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
not just do a regular squat so I went

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.750 
not just do a regular squat so I went
for<00:00:56.579> Pascua<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:58.530> took<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.219> pretty<00:00:59.520> big

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
liked it so I'm gonna start doing that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.280 
liked it so I'm gonna start doing that
from<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.759> because<00:01:23.759> um<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.869> muscle

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
from now on because um one of the muscle

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160
