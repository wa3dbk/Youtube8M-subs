00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello what is euros naim cabinet 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.299
 I'm going to talk to you today about the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.899
 place of employees in the procedures 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.849
 collective 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.320
 so this is a recurring topic that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.570
 worries a lot of employees confronted 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.309
 to the difficulties of their business and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 who are wondering what will happen to the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.240
 contract work then in matters of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.949
 receivership contracts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 work in progress continue to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
 normal conditions unless it is decided 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 a restructuring by the chef 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.090
 in partnership with 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.010
 the judicial administrator 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.179
 in this case layoffs 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.300
 can intervene on 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.770
 authorization of the Judge Commissioner in the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.870
 case of judicial liquidation 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.020
 much simpler the entirety of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.190
 workforce is dismissed within a 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.050
 fifteen days from the opening of the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 proceedings by the judicial representative 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.920
 then concretely the agent 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.110
 Judiciary convenes the different 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.130
 employees to a prior interview in 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.020
 during which he will explain 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.360
 possibly if there are two options for 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.620
 the employee then in some cases for 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.720
 some employees who fill 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.240
 certain conditions in particular 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.040
 seniority and 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 because of the size of the company 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.210
 they can opt for the contract of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.860
 professional security which is the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.310
 new name that has been given since the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.260
 law of 28 July 2011 at the convention 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.360
 personalized reclassification but it's 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.400
 truly the same the same state 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.730
 of mind a crp or csp it's the same 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.270
 thing 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.620
 it allows employees who are are 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.620
 employed by companies in 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.910
 difficulty in particular in liquidation 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.410
 judicial system to benefit from 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.460
 training 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.830
 so in this case they are not 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.620
 dismissed the contract is considered 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.030
 broken by mutual agreement and they will 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.710
 to be able to benefit from 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.240
 training then the interest for the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.470
 employee to choose this option this is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.640
 that he can usually touch 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.890
 benefits that are much more 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.160
 important than in the context of unemployment 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.040
 normal since it will benefit from 80 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.770
 % up to 80% of his last salary 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.190
 gross which is actually equivalent to his 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.840
 net salary for several months 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.310
 he is not considered as 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.260
 unemployed and consider them as 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.000
 trainee in vocational training 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.420
 which is not accounted for in the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.200
 unemployment figures and if after only 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.090
 find no job 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.550
 he could fall back into the circuit of 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.080
 normal unemployment then for employees 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.130
 who will have opted for the dismissal 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.360
 classic economic 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.010
 they said they will touch their 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.280
 compensation way 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.959
 e 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.260
 global by German land 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.590
 judiciary that will appeal to the CGA or 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.480
 gs which is a specific organization for 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.290
 taking charge of employees after the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.930
 filing for bankruptcy 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.459
 so we call the gs often 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.720
 wage guarantee insurance but that's 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.850
 an abuse of language on stage 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.640
 no real insurance 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.650
 the cga advances the funds and the agent 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 Judiciary will reimburse this body 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.670
 the first assets to be recovered in the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.440
 case of the judicial liquidation in all 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.360
 state of affairs employees are caught in 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.620
 charge by the one and the same 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.840
 interlocutor the judicial representative 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.090
 so what is rather favorable for the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.880
 employee and even though there may be 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.310
 some lengths to the implementation 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.230
 of the support by the gs the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.970
 employee is certain to be paid at the end 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.840
 Account 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.580
 I hope these tips will have you 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.580
 been helpful thank you your attention
