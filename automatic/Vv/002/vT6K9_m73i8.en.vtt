00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everybody today I'm here to show 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.810
 for you my favorites in the month of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.970
 November then let's go then let's go 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.340
 start with makeup favorites 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.210
 My favorite button of the month was this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.260
 here is the one that the pink sensation is 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 he has a color 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 It's beautiful, it's not quite a rose in the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 Truth is pulled by a roxinho the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.580
 that pro pink and lips it stays type 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 a tone more embroidered so one more thing 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.220
 dark 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 The cool thing about this button is that it has a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 good quality, good durability of it is well 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.840
 cool, it looks pretty good 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.500
 on the lips and a price of is also well on 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 account and another makeup favorite was 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 that mac pocking that is the studio fix 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.020
 my color to in w 15 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.789
 He's super bright when I went 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 buy I looked like this, we were bright 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.379
 It may end and what else on my skin but 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.199
 not the people for whom you have fair skin and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 cipÃ³ that is very very cool was one of the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.359
 poles as soon as my tone changed 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.970
 of skin and if here one of the time I already showed 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 in several videos but here is more 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 clarinha still mainly for 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.070
 winter is very cool to use 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.500
 because in winter we are well 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 white and so it has a texture 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.869
 great and leaves the skin well velvety well 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.850
 sequinha I used it a lot during this 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.850
 even because I have not taken anything to 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 still could not catch the sun so I 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.970
 I'm using it a lot and taking advantage of it. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 while also white 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.240
 I started using those same products 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.549
 new in my hair 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.619
 in fact I had already tested one of them but 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.079
 It's been a long time since I've used 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.860
 now I'm back to using the show oscile with a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.810
 bamboo mix and the mask I also had 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 used that mask that the bank had 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.070
 used to it had already used is normal 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.720
 and had adored it already 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.000
 time I was gone I had not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.490
 most recently purchased I received these 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 two products here and the shampoo I did not 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 had used it yet i'm loving it 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.969
 I found very good shampoo and this set 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.950
 here we are perfect 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.259
 I always received enough comments 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.360
 asking if the silicone mix is 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.420
 really as good as people 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.800
 they talk and people really are very good, it's a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.900
 of my favorite products for the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.690
 hair is wore like I said only to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.690
 mask 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.070
 so spectacular and now that I've started 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.680
 use the shampoo so I'm like this 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.360
 passionate and another product is also 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.510
 being a great ally for my hair 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.130
 is this the only one that also a 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.110
 well- known product so 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.960
 internet has several product reviews 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.430
 so everything they say in the reviews everything 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.350
 who said here on the packaging he 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.020
 really fulfill because he is a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.810
 Wonderful product I had never used 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.790
 so the product as good as this one 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.890
 because I use it as a leave-in 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.560
 after I got out of the shower before 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.690
 land the hair I apply it to us 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.300
 wires and so does not have much difference 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.880
 because my hair is very dry very hard 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.470
 Back off and when I picked up this 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.110
 I already noticed that the product was 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.150
 very easy to handle he left my 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.640
 shiny hair left hair soft 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.070
 she helps in customer control 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.830
 so this product is really very good 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.780
 As I said if it's not the best, it 's one of the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.680
 best fruits I have ever used in my 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.510
 hair 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.950
 so now let's go to the accessories 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.110
 of the month 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.600
 one of them is this one this ring of santa 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.120
 fine and this is very cool to us because 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.090
 he is in elastic so they had to 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.980
 it fits various finger sizes and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.350
 my finger is too thin too difficult 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.610
 find the ring as soon as it works on my 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.520
 I think she's very elegant. 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.380
 I found it very different, very beautiful and I know 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.080
 lot during this month even be 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.120
 quite a is used to use ring 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.190
 because usually the rings do not fit me 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.230
 so the one I was in love with 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.200
 because besides being beautiful and died inside and 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.800
 Another favorite accessory this month was 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.140
 a glasses and that glasses of the marisa that is 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.239
 this glasses round here 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.610
 I think you must have noticed that 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.970
 the round glasses are super high 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.580
 now but I do not like do not feel good 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.440
 wearing those round glasses well 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.140
 Little ones, those really went in. 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 I do not feel good using it and I 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.430
 I really do not like it very much 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.500
 I do not even know how to see others so I do not know 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.230
 I can not adapt to this trend 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.000
 which is a round sunglasses but it has the 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.830
 information here larger 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.020
 he is a bigger glasses he is a glasses 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.970
 more modern then this is obvious that I 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.890
 I arrived 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.840
 my face and I loved a lot of people 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.700
 thinks too big but I like 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.810
 glasses so very big and I found that 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:36.870
 was cool in the face will also 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.310
 now show two pieces of clothing that 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.220
 were my favorites 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.340
 one of them was this shirt and had here 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.530
 with a dog stamp me then she 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.350
 combines with virtually everything and the print 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.440
 she's very cute, that shirt had to 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:57.300
 give coaching and my other favorite piece 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.090
 of the month was this asymmetrical short skirt and 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.920
 I received it from the store does not stop and I 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.130

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.240

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.970
 Of this month 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.500
 Was this review helpful? 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.860

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:16.919

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.570
 other color 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.310

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.160
 besides beautiful is very good actually not 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.990
 I bought him for being a beautiful dryer I 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.910
 I bought it because I needed a 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.680
 My hair dryer is very good because I 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.390
 I was spoiled and then I went to look for 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.540
 and another showed me this in the shop 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.250
 who was one of the best punters and beyond 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.020
 to be one of the best drawers is a 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.400
