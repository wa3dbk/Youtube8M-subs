 he is also the only one 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 and it is empty 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.890
 these recitals of the judgment 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.880
 strange 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 Friday 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.150
 he must also give way 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.739
