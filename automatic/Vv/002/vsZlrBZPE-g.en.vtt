00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello everyone in this video I want to show 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.990
 new apple ipad air tablet which 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.389
 replaced last yearâ€™s generation 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.559
 the new has become noticeably lighter thinner and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.330
 more compact in general, then he perceives 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.500
 style is already more convenient device 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 of course compare it with a little about 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.420
 it is incorrect to cancel the screen diagonal there 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.600
 decently less but at the same time if 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 take the old 54 then the difference between them 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.520
 feel easy enough in general 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 if you put the area next you can 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 see what the old knees were 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 noticeably more 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.270
 The frames around the screen, that is, in general 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 now the difference is quite noticeable 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 decreased and in general the size of the table min 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.370
 width thickness is better in all respects 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 new overtakes old decision let 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 if you put like this then all this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.960
 very clearly visible respectively 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.220
 use it will be much more convenient and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.990
 weight and other parameters here have become more 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.979
 comfortable in daily use 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.140
 it became more comfortable to carry it with you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.450
 It touches the screen, then it is the same 9 and 7 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.150
 inches all too high resolution here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.580
 same and ps security glass matrix 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.520
 assembly is different about talking about it and not 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.189
 worth the connectors everything is where they are 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.189
 you can expect buttons on the sides there 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.869
 connector for put on this case 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.320
 version with modem it supports work 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.939
 in our 4g frequencies but for now 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.070
 blocked at floor level and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.750
 accordingly from this limitation 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 can not connect to a faster 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.560
 Internet but it promises to fix 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.450
 well at least 3g work here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.479
 ok there is a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 isight is the bottom vlogging connector for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.390
 data sync pair 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.100
 stereo speakers 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.780
 very loud and clean inside ios 7 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.299
 now version 703 as for others 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.700
 the possibilities are the same here 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.799
 processes as in iphone 5s but he 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.600
 operate at a slightly higher frequency 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.690
 but the house for poland in principle is not very 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600
 the m7 coprocessor is also critical, which 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.400
 responsible for the movement with all of this in 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.890
 it has excellent offline performance 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.480
 work that is to say , let him go there in mode 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.489
 Internet video still works the same 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.770
 like a big p4 with capacity 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.019
 the battery here is less but 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.980
 Apparently process optimization + mini 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.920
 energy-consuming screen decides to play 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.720
 its role in general then tablet and faster 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.110
 charging and working as much to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.090
 last year's model is very cool 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.950
 You can watch how the Internet works 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.330
 principle 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.470
 slow down anything everything is working great 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.980
 all standard gestures are supported 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:03:01.920
 you can let's open the video and 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:06.739
 you can watch a movie 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.739
 open to music player 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.160
 you can clear the loud dialects 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.190
 the beach with the button you can do something 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:29.329
 the same thing with gestures in general so 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:32.459
 want to come back music plays neither you 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.230
 about the memory said about his own 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.329
 huge application database telling 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.579
 it makes no sense, and it is clear that the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.030
 all good here in bulk 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.910
 performance it takes where I say 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.709
 what's the maximum places but signpost 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.709
 high court in this test 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.490
 he typed run 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.430
 need a leading position it does not overtake 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.150
 true asus tf700 one there galaxy note 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.250
 10 1 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.180
 krukovskiy process music but and there 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.590
 goes to the honorary third position 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.690
 the actual pieces become feeling mascara 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.870
 very cool light thin great 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.120
 the screen is a bunch of applications while it is long 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.270
 running less weighs compared to 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.280
 the previous model prices on the bedspread in 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.530
 America at the exchange level of 500 dollars 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.840
 it starts but there up to 900 something for 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.980
 Top version that will be Russia I do not know 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.810
 but minutes outside 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.970
 the past generation that is the principle 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.000
 Especially actually our retailers are not 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.730
 must change the old 4 to it or not 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.560
 but this question is individually that is 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.380
 if you are satisfied with the west, it makes no sense to you 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.060
 although it works not so much faster but 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.010
 on some demanding applications 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.020
 it's noticeable they are all there more smoothly 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.420
 thinks and everything is in principle too 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.520
 most but more compact body i 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.130
 I think for many it will be pleasant 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.800
 addition additionally appeared new and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.470
 ipad mini with a great screen it will 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.570
 be sold there late in November but 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.800
 I think that many will like a little 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.920
 version due to the fact that it is very similar 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.050
 the case itself is small why look 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.180
 thank you all for your attention 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.160
 it was ipad air put like 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.160
