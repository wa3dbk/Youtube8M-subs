00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.979 
can do that both sides so when you're
not<00:03:53.920> using<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.250> simply<00:03:54.640> detach<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.720> can<00:03:55.900> do

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
not using it simply detach it you can do

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:56.670 
not using it simply detach it you can do
that<00:03:56.110> with<00:03:56.290> it

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
that with it

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.030 
that with it
or<00:03:57.069> you<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.519> put<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.760> back<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:59.040> again

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
or you can just put that back on again

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.960 
or you can just put that back on again
you<00:04:00.129> can<00:04:00.250> use<00:04:00.370> this<00:04:00.489> in<00:04:00.640> four<00:04:00.819> different

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
you can use this in four different

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.819 
you can use this in four different
positions<00:04:01.180> so<00:04:01.810> you've<00:04:02.049> got<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.500> normal

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
positions so you've got it in the normal

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.880 
positions so you've got it in the normal
state<00:04:03.700> like<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.150> or<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.379> detach<00:04:05.650> it

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
state like that or you can detach it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.990 
state like that or you can detach it
turn<00:04:06.670> it<00:04:06.790> around

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.720 

and<00:04:10.000> you've<00:04:10.239> got<00:04:10.450> a<00:04:10.920> board<00:04:11.920> kind<00:04:12.430> of<00:04:12.519> thing

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
and you've got a board kind of thing
