00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.860
 cyberport presents the new coupÃ© 8 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.080
 The Chinese manufacturer Huawei could 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.160
 so far with well-equipped 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 mid-range smartphones for the fair 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.690
 price convince with the p8 wants the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.620
 manufacturer now also the more expensive premium 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 service 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.480
 in terms of quality and performance it should 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 at eye level with the galaxy s 6 or 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.040
 However, iphone is a good thing 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.020
 piece cheaper therefore , inter alia, because the 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.110
 can meet high end requirements 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.680
 we now find out the technical 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.449
 dates 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:39.780
 the p8 is 14 5 cm high 72 centimeters 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.359
 wide and 6 4 millimeters deep that 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.659
 smartphone weighs 144 grams and offers 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:49.760
 a 52 inch ips display with one 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:52.050
 resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 the heart of the device is a hot one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.390
 silicone kirin 930 octa core processor 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.729
 being four cores with two gigahertz and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.719
 another four cores with 1 5 gigahertz 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.989
 overclock 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.110
 the cpu is supported by 3 gb ram 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 for data and applications are 16 gb 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.630
 internal memory available via 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.630
 micro sd card up to 128 gb 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.430
 can be extended 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.219
 The case is one 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.289
 Aluminum unibody in connection with 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.180
 the very good processing is the p 8 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.240
 in quality quite with the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.340
 iphone or htcs on the new comparable 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.409
 The device makes a round send 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.740
 impression even if some details to the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.420
 account of apple 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.220
 with 64 mm deep and a weight of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.799
 144 grams it is very pleasant in the 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.200
 hand there is a small plus point 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.149
 In addition, that the camera completely 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.030
 in the housing was installed and not 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.630
 We are very satisfied and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.149
 give the thumbs up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.429
 the display is 52 inches tall and dissolves in 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.600
 full hd on which is a very good 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:03.100
 pixeldichte of 424 ppr gives the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.869
 screen convinced not only at the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.880
 sharpness but also in color and 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.530
 Contrast value images are in 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.299
 reproduced in natural colors 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.819
 a color cast is not 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.769
 In addition, also become black 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.459
 areas in an optimal black 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.590
 appropriate 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.120
 thanks to ps, the great thing is 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.650
 viewing angle stability also at 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.680
 different viewing angles 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.360
 constant to good last points the p8 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.480
 with a very good brightness of 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 maximum 460 candela per square meter 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 that means even in strong sunlight 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.880
 the display stays legible very well 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.640
 made by the huawei group 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.040
 originating hot lying kirin 930 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.200
 processor provides us with eight cores 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.760
 half of it is only retrieved when 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.450
 Power hungry programs started 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.109
 become 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.370
 this is effective and saves a lot of electricity 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.100
 to support three more 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.329
 gigabytes of memory added 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.850
 compare now the total performance 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.560
 with the iphone or galaxy s 6 like that 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.750
 the p 8 pulls the shorter one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.769
 in day-to-day operations, however, that is 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.170
 barely noticeable 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.450
 the operating system runs extremely smoothly 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.980
 3d games can gambled smoothly 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.620
 and surfing is enough 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.680
 performance is also relaxed 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.750
 very good result 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.150
 We have it with the operating system 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.090
 whichroid 5.0 to do by the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.200
 in-house e motion ios 3.1 but strong 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.750
 was modified 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.420
 as with all huawei devices can be 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.599
 the surface through teams 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.849
 individualize 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.129
 Also, the app drawer was removed 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.739
 Therefore, like ios, they are all 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.780
 apps on the homescreens but also at 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.480
 The gesture control has been a lot of 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.129
 Apple adapts it for that 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.200
 call the quick search one 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.109
 finger-wipe from top to bottom 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.209
 just like the iphone one 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.030
 interesting feature represents the language 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.470
 perception because of this function sets 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.540
 First of all, be a name for yourself 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.489
 smartphone firmly you have it afterwards 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.340
 misplaced somewhere you just call the 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.109
 Names as well as the question where you and 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.000
 already makes the p8 through tones and 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.060
 Attention to vibration 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.870
 a fitness app like some 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.439
 unfortunately there are competition products 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.459
 Not 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.919
 we give a good the main camera on 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.689
 the back solves with 3 10 megapixels 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.699
 on includes an optical 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.130
 image stabilizer and supplies us 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:23.130
 convincing photos are also here 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.360
 iphone and galaxy s 6 a little better yet 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.150
 it is only minimal 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.220
 Differences in low light situations 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.229
 scores the p8 but with a far 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.570
 lower image noise causing the 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.770
 photos sharper and quality look 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.409
 as at the competition 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.900
 a nice accessory feature that 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.610
 Light painting features everything you want 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.199
 For this is needed a tripod and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.930
 someone with flashlights 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.750
 sparklers and co in the air paints the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.930
 The smartphone does rest very well 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.220
 made 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.250
 the battery is with a capacity of 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.180
 2,680 milliamp hours in midfield 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.490
 Accordingly, the designed 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.070
 operating time despite effective 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.180
 processor and a smart one 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.000
 Power saving function creates the smartphone 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.160
 maximum of one working day especially 3d 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.539
 Games rob the device extremely much 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.720
 energy a satisfactory result 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.610
 our conclusion the clock wp 8 brings in general 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.550
 Everything with a premium smartphone 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.889
 an aluminum housing is a sharp one 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.740
 Display a liquid performance as well 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.660
 a good camera in comparison rather 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.410
 low price does not come from 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.020
 approximately 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.669
 so you have to make the battery 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.800
 and additional features like 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.910
 fingerprint sensor or fitness app 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.820
 are missing as well 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.520
 but who can do without it 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.100
 to have fun with the new A8 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.140
 we give four and a half 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.140
 of five stars
