honeybees there's another type of bead
we<00:00:05.490> want<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.790> help<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.750> bumble<00:00:07.170> bee<00:00:07.319> which

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
we want to help the bumble bee which

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
we want to help the bumble bee which
like<00:00:08.160> their<00:00:08.370> honey<00:00:08.610> making<00:00:09.000> counterparts<00:00:09.660> are

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
like their honey making counterparts are

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.990 
like their honey making counterparts are
just<00:00:10.440> as<00:00:10.620> important<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.340> pollinating<00:00:11.820> plants

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
just as important in pollinating plants

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.379 
just as important in pollinating plants
and<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:13.650> too<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.950> rapidly<00:00:14.759> dwindling<00:00:15.240> in

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
and they too are rapidly dwindling in

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410 
and they too are rapidly dwindling in
numbers<00:00:16.190> but<00:00:17.190> there's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> simple<00:00:17.730> design<00:00:18.180> for

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
numbers but there's a simple design for

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.029 
numbers but there's a simple design for
a<00:00:18.449> nest<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.960> we<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.230> all<00:00:19.410> make<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.949> our

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
a nest that we can all make for our

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.939 
a nest that we can all make for our
gardens<00:00:20.460> now<00:00:21.240> these<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:21.750> two<00:00:22.320> fairly

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
gardens now these are just two fairly

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.560 
gardens now these are just two fairly
standard<00:00:23.340> plant<00:00:23.580> pots<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> reasons<00:00:24.539> why

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
standard plant pots and the reasons why

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
standard plant pots and the reasons why
we've<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:24.960> pots<00:00:25.170> inside<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
we've got pots inside it so that if the

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
we've got pots inside it so that if the
nest<00:00:27.210> gets<00:00:27.359> wet<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.289> water<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.769> drain

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
nest gets wet and the water can drain

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
nest gets wet and the water can drain
out<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.519> that's<00:00:29.910> one<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> key

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
out of it and that's one of the key

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.970 
out of it and that's one of the key
things<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.050> starving<00:00:31.560> winter<00:00:31.830> not

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
things that be starving winter not

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.380 
things that be starving winter not
necessarily<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> cold<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.149> they<00:00:33.270> get

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
necessarily the cold but if they get

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260 
necessarily the cold but if they get
down<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.680> drainage<00:00:35.010> holes<00:00:35.280> we've

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
down and on the drainage holes we've

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.750 
down and on the drainage holes we've
we've<00:00:36.719> glued<00:00:36.899> some<00:00:37.110> tights<00:00:37.410> over<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
we've glued some tights over it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
we've glued some tights over it
that's<00:00:38.969> why<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> water<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.440> stop

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that's why the water out but to stop

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.170 
that's why the water out but to stop
ants<00:00:41.040> getting<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> because<00:00:41.670> they'll<00:00:41.820> destroy

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
ants getting in because they'll destroy

ants getting in because they'll destroy
nests<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.660> get<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
nests if they get into we're going to

excellent and bumblebees them live like

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.360 
excellent and bumblebees them live like
honeybees<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.199> live<00:01:01.379> communally

honeybees and that they live communally

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.280 
honeybees and that they live communally
but<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.120> abandon<00:01:03.629> their<00:01:03.750> nests<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> end

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
but they abandon their nests at the end

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570 
but they abandon their nests at the end
of<00:01:04.350> every<00:01:04.530> year<00:01:04.739> whereas<00:01:05.010> honeybees<00:01:05.369> keep

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of every year whereas honeybees keep

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.620 
of every year whereas honeybees keep
them<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.760> throughout<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> winter<00:01:06.330> where

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
them going throughout the winter where

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
do they go when they abandon the nest oh

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.289 
do they go when they abandon the nest oh
that's<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> end<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.700> their<00:01:08.850> life

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's the end of their life

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
that's the end of their life
I<00:01:09.330> really<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.140> yeah<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> year

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
across this the key thing that's going

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
across this the key thing that's going
to<00:01:22.110> get<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.320> into<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> garden<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to get them into the garden is the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.950 
to get them into the garden is the
number<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> pollinated<00:01:24.150> flowers<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.840> need

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
number of pollinated flowers that need

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.060 
number of pollinated flowers that need
pollinating<00:01:25.560> okay

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
pollinating okay

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.740 
pollinating okay
and<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> give<00:01:27.060> them<00:01:27.210> pollen

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and that are going to give them pollen

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.690 
and that are going to give them pollen
and<00:01:27.900> nectar<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:28.950> seal<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.369> edge<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and nectar and then seal the edge so

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.170 
and nectar and then seal the edge so
that<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.939> watertight<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
that it's watertight if you can make it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.380 
that it's watertight if you can make it
rain

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
rain

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.590

it's<00:01:33.479> really<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.810> makeshift<00:01:35.600> fortunately

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's really so makeshift fortunately
