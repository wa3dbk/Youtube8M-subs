for the lols blaster in Hydra cannon
that<00:00:07.230> runs<00:00:07.560> off<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:08.429> tire<00:00:08.849> compressors

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
that runs off of two tire compressors

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.459 
that runs off of two tire compressors
yeah<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.580> last<00:00:11.790> war<00:00:11.969> Nam<00:00:12.660> brought<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> Hydra

tone Stefan about 658 feet per second
through<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> chronograph<00:00:25.160> which<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.369> really

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
through a chronograph which is really

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200 
through a chronograph which is really
really<00:00:27.930> insane<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> wanted<00:00:30.119> to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
really insane so I kind of wanted to

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.930 
really insane so I kind of wanted to
make<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.810> own<00:00:31.019> except<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.219> didn't<00:00:32.790> want

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
make one of my own except I didn't want

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
make one of my own except I didn't want
to<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.300> pump<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.840> 41<00:00:34.410> times<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.100> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to have to pump it up 41 times just to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.840 
to have to pump it up 41 times just to
get<00:00:35.600> crazy<00:00:36.600> FPS<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.430> why<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> just

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
get crazy FPS so that's why I just

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
get crazy FPS so that's why I just
happened<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.149> put<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.629> tire<00:00:39.899> compressors<00:00:40.469> on

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
happened to put two tire compressors on

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.560 
happened to put two tire compressors on
it<00:00:40.710> since<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> uses<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> bladder<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
it since it uses a bladder just like the

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.760 
it since it uses a bladder just like the
max<00:00:42.780> trach<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:43.350> already<00:00:43.590> made<00:00:43.710> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
max trach and I've already made a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470 
max trach and I've already made a
compressor<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> max<00:00:44.489> right<00:00:44.730> before<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> said

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
compressor to max right before I said

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.709 
compressor to max right before I said
you<00:00:46.469> know<00:00:46.590> why<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.000> wanted<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> use<00:00:48.480> two

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
you know why not but I wanted to use two

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.860 
you know why not but I wanted to use two
so<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.079> fills<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:50.070> faster<00:00:50.370> than<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
so it fills up much faster than how the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.850 
so it fills up much faster than how the
max<00:00:52.559> trike<00:00:52.860> fills<00:00:53.219> up<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.140> mean<00:00:55.590> it's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
max trike fills up and if I mean it's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
max trike fills up and if I mean it's
pretty<00:00:56.280> simple<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> show<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.329> what

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
pretty simple I'm going to show you what

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.270 
pretty simple I'm going to show you what
it<00:00:57.660> looks<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.079> inside<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.739> how<00:00:59.160> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it looks like on the inside and how it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
it looks like on the inside and how it
works<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.760> from<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> battery<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:00.930> an

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
works is from the battery you have an

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
works is from the battery you have an
on/off<00:01:01.410> switch<00:01:01.440> from<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> on/off<00:01:02.640> switch<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
on/off switch from the on/off switch it

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.420 
on/off switch from the on/off switch it
goes<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> lever<00:01:03.660> switch<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.589> put<00:01:05.040> right

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
goes to a lever switch that I put right

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
goes to a lever switch that I put right
next<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> air<00:01:06.030> bladder<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> back

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
next to the air bladder and on the back

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.170 
next to the air bladder and on the back
of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> air<00:01:07.680> bladder<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> plastic<00:01:09.030> bit

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
of the air bladder on the plastic bit

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
of the air bladder on the plastic bit
that<00:01:09.390> kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> clamps<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.080> together<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.439> put<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that kind of clamps it together I put a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
that kind of clamps it together I put a
polycarb<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.970> tower<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.170> when<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> bladder

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
polycarb like tower and when the bladder

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
polycarb like tower and when the bladder
fills<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> polycarb<00:01:14.820> switches<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.960> lever

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
fills up the polycarb switches the lever

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
fills up the polycarb switches the lever
so<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> tells<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.700> compressors<00:01:18.150> stop

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so that it tells the compressors stop

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.340 
so that it tells the compressors stop
running<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.369> then<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.670> fire<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> this

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
running and then you can fire so this

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.910 
running and then you can fire so this
thing<00:01:22.560> runs<00:01:22.770> off<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.780> 3000<00:01:24.780> milliamp<00:01:24.990> hour

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
thing runs off a 3000 milliamp hour

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.810 
thing runs off a 3000 milliamp hour
eighteen<00:01:26.700> point<00:01:26.970> five<00:01:27.180> volt<00:01:27.630> lipo<00:01:28.080> battery

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
eighteen point five volt lipo battery

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
eighteen point five volt lipo battery
which<00:01:29.820> fits<00:01:30.180> right<00:01:30.509> into<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> convenient

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
which fits right into this convenient

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010 
which fits right into this convenient
custom-made<00:01:32.159> battery<00:01:33.030> tray<00:01:33.360> right<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
custom-made battery tray right in the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.890 
custom-made battery tray right in the
back<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.680> using<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.850> velcro<00:01:36.240> loops<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
back and I'm using some velcro loops to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
back and I'm using some velcro loops to
hold<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> doesn't<00:01:37.770> go<00:01:37.829> flying<00:01:38.159> out

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
hold it in so it doesn't go flying out

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.560 
hold it in so it doesn't go flying out
so<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:40.530> idea<00:01:40.920> how<00:01:41.340> crazy<00:01:42.000> powerful

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so I have no idea how crazy powerful

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.840 
so I have no idea how crazy powerful
this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.619> charged<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.310> battery<00:01:44.369> up

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this is I just charged this battery up

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.690 
this is I just charged this battery up
to<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.960> full<00:01:46.200> capacity<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.610> I'm

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
to it's like full capacity so what I'm

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.280 
to it's like full capacity so what I'm
going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.119> I'm<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> set<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.570> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
going to do is I'm going to set up this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.770 
going to do is I'm going to set up this
cardboard<00:01:49.799> box<00:01:50.070> I'm<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> shoot<00:01:51.479> at<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
cardboard box I'm going to shoot at it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.550 
cardboard box I'm going to shoot at it
from<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.310> 25<00:01:53.310> 20<00:01:54.180> 25<00:01:54.630> feet<00:01:54.840> away<00:01:54.990> we're

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
from about 25 20 25 feet away we're

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
from about 25 20 25 feet away we're
going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.310> powerful<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to see just how powerful this

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
going to see just how powerful this
thing<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:58.140> probably<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.860> be

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
thing is it's probably not going to be

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.499 
thing is it's probably not going to be
as<00:01:59.009> powerful<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.610> Nam's<00:01:59.850> hydro<00:02:00.210> cannon

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
as powerful as Nam's hydro cannon

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810 
as powerful as Nam's hydro cannon
because<00:02:00.829> it<00:02:01.829> doesn't<00:02:02.219> fill<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> bladder<00:02:02.670> up

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
because it doesn't fill the bladder up

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
because it doesn't fill the bladder up
all<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> way<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.630> Polycarp

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
all the way because of the Polycarp

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
all the way because of the Polycarp
Tower<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.159> does<00:02:05.310> fill<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.759> quite<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.210> bit

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
Tower but it does fill it up quite a bit

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.040 
Tower but it does fill it up quite a bit
so<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:09.270> how<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.989> thing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
so we're going to see how this thing

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:28.150 
so we're going to see how this thing
shoots<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.550> get<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.030> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:50.420 

you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:13.680 

you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.860 

you

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.290 

so<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.770> extent<00:03:18.250> of<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.550> damage<00:03:19.270> that

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
so what is the extent of the damage that

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.050 
so what is the extent of the damage that
this<00:03:19.630> thing<00:03:19.900> can<00:03:20.440> create<00:03:20.860> well<00:03:21.550> not<00:03:21.700> only<00:03:21.940> does

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
this thing can create well not only does

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.120 
this thing can create well not only does
it<00:03:22.090> go<00:03:22.270> through<00:03:22.480> one<00:03:22.780> layer<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.500> actually<00:03:23.920> can

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it go through one layer it actually can

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.309 
it go through one layer it actually can
go<00:03:24.280> through<00:03:24.610> about<00:03:24.700> three<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.480> have<00:03:25.720> the

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
go through about three you have the

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.220 
go through about three you have the
bottom<00:03:26.739> layer<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:27.550> have<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:28.270> side<00:03:28.840> layer

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
bottom layer you have this side layer

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.830 
bottom layer you have this side layer
and<00:03:29.650> then<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.520> also<00:03:30.910> have<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:32.319> top<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.360> this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
and then you also have the top so this

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.339 
and then you also have the top so this
thing<00:03:35.110> shoots<00:03:35.610> kind<00:03:36.610> of<00:03:36.910> ridiculously<00:03:37.870> hard

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
thing shoots kind of ridiculously hard

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.020 
thing shoots kind of ridiculously hard
so<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.040> don't<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.459> I'm<00:03:39.610> ever<00:03:39.760> going<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.970> be

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
so I don't think I'm ever going to be

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.580 
so I don't think I'm ever going to be
using<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:40.360> during<00:03:40.510> an<00:03:40.690> actual<00:03:41.050> round<00:03:41.260> maybe

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
using this during an actual round maybe

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.470 
using this during an actual round maybe
if<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.800> put<00:03:41.980> somewhere<00:03:42.400> like<00:03:42.670> ball<00:03:42.940> attachment

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
if I put somewhere like ball attachment

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.449 
if I put somewhere like ball attachment
on<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.630> front<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.989> or<00:03:44.080> something<00:03:44.260> or<00:03:44.950> if

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
on the front of it or something or if

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.740 
on the front of it or something or if
it's<00:03:45.959> some<00:03:46.959> weird<00:03:47.110> like<00:03:47.470> unban<00:03:48.459> no<00:03:48.880> rules<00:03:49.330> go

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
it's some weird like unban no rules go

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.840 
it's some weird like unban no rules go
crazy<00:03:50.110> around<00:03:50.410> or<00:03:50.650> something<00:03:50.920> but<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.549> thing

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
crazy around or something but this thing

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.090 
crazy around or something but this thing
fits<00:03:52.150> all<00:03:52.420> three<00:03:52.660> criteria<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.470> wanted<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.950> get

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
fits all three criteria I wanted to get

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.250 
fits all three criteria I wanted to get
in<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.310> blaster<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.000> powerful<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.019> hydro

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
in a blaster it's powerful it's a hydro

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.920 
in a blaster it's powerful it's a hydro
cannon<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.769> takes<00:03:57.400> minimal<00:03:58.060> effort<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.660> pump

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
cannon it takes minimal effort to pump

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.750 
cannon it takes minimal effort to pump
up<00:03:59.080> because<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.100> don't<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.400> do<00:04:00.519> anything

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
up because I don't have to do anything

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.449 
up because I don't have to do anything
except<00:04:01.360> flip<00:04:01.569> a<00:04:01.660> switch<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.890> doesn't

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
except flip a switch and it doesn't

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.550 
except flip a switch and it doesn't
weigh<00:04:03.640> too<00:04:03.700> much<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.599> comes<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:04.959> at<00:04:05.049> five<00:04:05.290> point

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
weigh too much it comes in at five point

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.199 
weigh too much it comes in at five point
two<00:04:05.709> five<00:04:05.920> pounds<00:04:06.340> which<00:04:06.459> is<00:04:06.640> less<00:04:06.880> than<00:04:07.030> what

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
two five pounds which is less than what

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.960 
two five pounds which is less than what
Fenrir<00:04:07.690> weighed<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:09.340> just<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.670> nice

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
Fenrir weighed and it's just a nice

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.729 
Fenrir weighed and it's just a nice
overall<00:04:10.390> package<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.230> for<00:04:11.380> something<00:04:11.620> that

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
overall package and for something that

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.500 
overall package and for something that
has<00:04:11.860> all<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.340> components<00:04:12.459> on<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.970> right<00:04:13.180> side

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
has all the components on the right side

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.979 
has all the components on the right side
it's<00:04:14.069> balance<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:15.220> really<00:04:15.940> nice<00:04:16.209> like<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.750> have

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
it's balance is really nice like I have

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.719 
it's balance is really nice like I have
no<00:04:17.260> problem<00:04:17.680> pulling<00:04:17.829> this<00:04:17.979> with<00:04:18.160> one<00:04:18.370> hand

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
no problem pulling this with one hand

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.479 
no problem pulling this with one hand
and<00:04:19.030> it's<00:04:19.930> actually<00:04:20.410> much<00:04:21.070> more<00:04:21.130> well

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
and it's actually much more well

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.370 
and it's actually much more well
balanced<00:04:21.880> than<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.600> rampage<00:04:23.080> with

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
balanced than that of a rampage with

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.050 
balanced than that of a rampage with
like<00:04:23.590> a<00:04:23.770> jungle<00:04:24.220> mag<00:04:24.490> sticking<00:04:24.850> out<00:04:24.940> of

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
like a jungle mag sticking out of

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.520 
like a jungle mag sticking out of
magwell<00:04:25.330> which<00:04:25.479> is<00:04:25.600> really<00:04:25.900> weird<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.470> I

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
magwell which is really weird that I

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.590 
magwell which is really weird that I
always<00:04:26.740> found<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.340> be<00:04:27.430> awkward<00:04:27.789> this<00:04:28.479> is

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
always found that to be awkward this is

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.750 
always found that to be awkward this is
just<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:28.990> much<00:04:29.110> nicer<00:04:29.530> there<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.729> is

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
just so much nicer there you go that is

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.050 
just so much nicer there you go that is
the<00:04:30.970> dual<00:04:31.900> air<00:04:32.350> compressor<00:04:32.890> hydro<00:04:33.610> cannon

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
the dual air compressor hydro cannon

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.670 
the dual air compressor hydro cannon
that<00:04:34.390> I'm<00:04:34.539> thinking<00:04:34.810> about<00:04:34.990> calling<00:04:35.410> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
that I'm thinking about calling the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.950 
left on my fan page I think it goes very
well<00:04:42.610> with<00:04:42.789> what<00:04:43.090> this<00:04:43.210> blaster<00:04:43.539> does<00:04:43.690> which

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
well with what this blaster does which

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.210 
well with what this blaster does which
is<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.350> shoot<00:04:44.820> crazy<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.300> neuter<00:04:46.840> things<00:04:47.220> so

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
is just shoot crazy and neuter things so

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
I'll probably write that somewhere on

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.300 
I'll probably write that somewhere on
here<00:04:49.510> maybe<00:04:49.660> on<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.900> top<00:04:50.080> but<00:04:50.710> yeah<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.100> hope
