which<00:02:50.070> we've<00:02:50.280> got<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.030> natal<00:02:51.450> end<00:02:51.600> on<00:02:51.720> this

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
which we've got the natal end on this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.190 
which we've got the natal end on this
end

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.570

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
and then somewhere out here there's the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.500 
and then somewhere out here there's the
new<00:02:57.790> hard<00:02:58.060> drive<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.150> ask<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.450> about

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
new hard drive have to ask you about

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.510 
new hard drive have to ask you about
that<00:03:01.599> there<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.620> way<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.950> remove<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
that there is a way to remove the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.250 
that there is a way to remove the
current<00:03:03.760> hard<00:03:03.910> drive<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.810> hard<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.020> do<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
current hard drive it's hard to do it

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.680 
current hard drive it's hard to do it
elegantly

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.810 

now<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:13.990> see<00:03:14.170> there's<00:03:14.320> a<00:03:14.640> 250<00:03:15.640> gigabyte

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
now you can see there's a 250 gigabyte

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:22.170 
now you can see there's a 250 gigabyte
label<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:21.070> just<00:03:21.100> pop<00:03:22.030> it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
label on it and then I can just pop it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.730 
label on it and then I can just pop it
out<00:03:24.930> how<00:03:25.930> do<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.080> go<00:03:26.170> about<00:03:26.200> transferring

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
out how do you go about transferring

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.800 
out how do you go about transferring
data<00:03:26.890> from<00:03:27.190> existing<00:03:27.700> Xbox<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:28.600> if<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.720> have

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
data from existing Xbox so if you have

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.860 
data from existing Xbox so if you have
an<00:03:28.900> existing<00:03:28.990> console<00:03:29.740> it's<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.910> same<00:03:31.150> data

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
an existing console it's the same data

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.120 
an existing console it's the same data
transfer<00:03:32.260> process<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.770> we<00:03:32.830> have<00:03:32.950> today

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
transfer process that we have today

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.250 
transfer process that we have today
actually<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.630> use<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.990> data

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
actually so you can use the data

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.340 
actually so you can use the data
transfer<00:03:35.700> which<00:03:36.700> we<00:03:36.940> are<00:03:37.300> actually<00:03:38.020> going<00:03:38.260> to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
transfer which we are actually going to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.620 
transfer which we are actually going to
make<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> retail<00:03:39.070> product<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.150> now<00:03:40.240> buy

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
make a retail product so you can now buy

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.100 
make a retail product so you can now buy
that<00:03:40.840> for<00:03:41.020> 1995<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.640> US<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.630> can<00:03:43.750> also<00:03:43.870> do

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
that for 1995 in the US you can also do

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.590 
that for 1995 in the US you can also do
transfer<00:03:45.070> via<00:03:45.220> USB<00:03:45.489> thumb<00:03:45.760> drive<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.360> we

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
transfer via USB thumb drive so we

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.560 
transfer via USB thumb drive so we
enabled<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.680> know<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.830> month<00:03:47.980> or<00:03:48.130> so<00:03:48.280> ago

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
enabled that you know a month or so ago

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.510 
enabled that you know a month or so ago
you<00:03:49.570> can<00:03:49.720> take<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.230> know<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.800> to<00:03:50.830> 16<00:03:51.280> gigs

the game console are there any like
speed<00:04:03.459> changes<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.630> drive<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.080> just

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
speed changes to the drive is just

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.410 
speed changes to the drive is just
larger<00:04:05.920> than<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.370> optimization<00:04:07.060> few<00:04:07.209> guys

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
larger than the optimization few guys

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.890 
larger than the optimization few guys
have<00:04:07.600> done<00:04:07.810> as<00:04:08.050> far<00:04:08.260> as<00:04:08.530> her<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.810> that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
have done as far as her for you and that

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.630 
have done as far as her for you and that
might<00:04:11.110> actually<00:04:11.260> improve<00:04:11.770> my<00:04:11.950> game<00:04:12.010> mo<00:04:12.370> times

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
might actually improve my game mo times

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.940 
might actually improve my game mo times
right<00:04:12.880> now<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.600> performance<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.620> drives<00:04:14.830> are

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
right now so performance the drives are

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.229 
right now so performance the drives are
always<00:04:15.160> gonna<00:04:15.250> be<00:04:15.370> going<00:04:15.549> up<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.760> performance

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
always gonna be going up in performance

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.150 
always gonna be going up in performance
but<00:04:16.870> there<00:04:16.989> wasn't<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.440> there's<00:04:17.799> there's

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
but there wasn't you there's there's

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.740 
but there wasn't you there's there's
always<00:04:18.400> optimization<00:04:19.030> but<00:04:19.180> nothing<00:04:19.479> specific

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
always optimization but nothing specific

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.580 
always optimization but nothing specific
it's<00:04:20.140> not<00:04:20.290> twice<00:04:20.680> as<00:04:20.859> fast<00:04:21.040> or<00:04:21.310> anything<00:04:21.430> okay

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it's not twice as fast or anything okay

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.850 
it's not twice as fast or anything okay
let's<00:04:23.590> get<00:04:23.830> back<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.370> power<00:04:24.820> brick<00:04:25.090> here

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
let's get back to the power brick here

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.290 
let's get back to the power brick here
which<00:04:26.860> is<00:04:27.010> quite<00:04:27.190> light<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:27.669> compared<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.120> the

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
which is quite light now compared to the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.810 
which is quite light now compared to the
original<00:04:29.229> one<00:04:29.680> but<00:04:29.890> not<00:04:30.430> really<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.760> much

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
original one but not really that much

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.020 
original one but not really that much
smaller<00:04:32.100> scale<00:04:33.100> of<00:04:33.340> lights<00:04:33.550> here<00:04:33.820> on<00:04:33.910> this

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
smaller scale of lights here on this

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.520 
smaller scale of lights here on this
side

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.680 

Co<00:04:43.530> else<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.949> power<00:04:44.820> cable<00:04:47.389> here<00:04:48.389> he's

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
Co else we have power cable here he's

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.230 
Co else we have power cable here he's
the<00:04:49.020> AV<00:04:49.560> Adapter<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.430> I'm<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.790> seeing

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the AV Adapter and I'm not seeing

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.110 
the AV Adapter and I'm not seeing
anything<00:04:51.479> HD<00:04:52.260> this<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.889> composite<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:53.850> we've

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
anything HD this is composite so we've

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.939 
anything HD this is composite so we've
got<00:04:54.330> standard<00:04:55.080> definition<00:04:55.500> out<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.740> box

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
got standard definition out of the box

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:04.909 
got standard definition out of the box
so<00:04:56.790> far<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:01.860> an<00:05:02.190> xbox<00:05:02.430> 360<00:05:03.090> headset<00:05:03.919> in

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
so far we have an xbox 360 headset in

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.530 
so far we have an xbox 360 headset in
black<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.460> match<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.790> console<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.850> a<00:05:09.360> black

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
black to match the console and a black

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:20.510 
black to match the console and a black
controller<00:05:09.930> as<00:05:10.139> well<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.470> again<00:05:19.770> pretty

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
controller as well so again pretty

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.540 
controller as well so again pretty
standard<00:05:20.850> stuff<00:05:22.130> fantasy<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.400> really

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
standard stuff fantasy is really

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.650 
standard stuff fantasy is really
I<00:05:26.200> believe<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.380> is<00:05:27.850> isn't<00:05:28.850> that<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.000> shiny<00:05:29.450> is

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
I believe it is isn't that the shiny is

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.380 
I believe it is isn't that the shiny is
that<00:05:29.810> different<00:05:30.880> they<00:05:31.880> did<00:05:32.030> mention<00:05:32.210> that

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
that different they did mention that

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.180 
that different they did mention that
they<00:05:32.600> made<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.840> AIDS<00:05:33.080> chrome<00:05:33.470> to<00:05:33.710> match<00:05:33.890> the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
they made the AIDS chrome to match the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.790 
they made the AIDS chrome to match the
new<00:05:34.310> console<00:05:34.850> so<00:05:35.030> it<00:05:35.090> could<00:05:35.240> be<00:05:35.800> compared

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
new console so it could be compared

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.560 
new console so it could be compared
slavery<00:05:37.130> time<00:05:37.370> obviously<00:05:38.090> not<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.240> different

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
slavery time obviously not a different

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:49.420 
slavery time obviously not a different
shape<00:05:46.570> kinda<00:05:47.570> batter<00:05:47.810> he<00:05:48.470> does<00:05:48.710> have

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
shape kinda batter he does have
