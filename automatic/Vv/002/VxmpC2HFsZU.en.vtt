plug does not go flush up against the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.490 
plug does not go flush up against the
computer<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.180> any<00:00:54.390> USB<00:00:54.719> port<00:00:54.899> there's<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
computer in any USB port there's the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
computer in any USB port there's the
silver<00:00:55.800> part<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> sticks<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> then

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
silver part that sticks out and then

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.200 
silver part that sticks out and then
there's<00:00:57.480> another<00:00:58.050> piece<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.789> goes<00:00:59.789> straight

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there's another piece that goes straight

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299 
there's another piece that goes straight
out<00:01:00.270> from<00:01:00.660> wherever<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.079> plug<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.710> think

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
out from wherever you plug it in I think

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
out from wherever you plug it in I think
that<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> were<00:01:03.019> flush<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.199> against<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that if it were flush up against a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
that if it were flush up against a
computer<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.430> would<00:01:05.760> work<00:01:05.970> better<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.540> mine

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
computer it would work better but mine

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
computer it would work better but mine
it<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> stuck<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> got<00:01:09.150> bumped<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it just stuck out when it got bumped and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.550 
it just stuck out when it got bumped and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
let just mostly it catches just my voice

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069

so<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:33.000> kids<00:01:33.270> walk<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
so if my kids walk into the back of the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.569 
so if my kids walk into the back of the
room<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> make<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.890> bit<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.100> noise<00:01:35.189> it's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
room and make a little bit of noise it's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
room and make a little bit of noise it's
okay<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> cancels<00:01:36.990> out<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.290> background

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
okay as it cancels out the background

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.960 
okay as it cancels out the background
noise<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.390> enjoy<00:01:39.659> using<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.439> for

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
noise and I do enjoy using them for

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.609 
noise and I do enjoy using them for
voiceovers<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.390> videos<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.229> editing

voiceovers for videos and for editing
videos<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.220> well<00:01:44.430> because<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> way<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
videos as well because of the way the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.230 
videos as well because of the way the
