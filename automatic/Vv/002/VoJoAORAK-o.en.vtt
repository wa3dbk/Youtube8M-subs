00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:12.449
 Yes yeah yeah Amazon Kindle Paper White a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:18.289
 It is an American version, but I finally got what I bought. Well I am not my wife. 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:22.280
 Yes, but I would like to make a debut just to make a debut 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:28.600
 E Pepper Fight First of all, though it looks like it 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:31.510
 Yeah the size specific capital but is the guy he goes on saying things take conventional kindle unmarked gold 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:36.340
 There is almost no difference 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:40.750
 In terms of specs we actually h mm 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:45.040
 The size is large but I do not know at all the feeling I protected 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.380
 I feel very heavy and heavy 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.990
 More unmarked is 165g 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.470
 A even though I know the extent 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.740
 There is also Pepa fight 213 Bella 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:06.910
 day 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:06.910
 I feel pretty Zushiri because 50 g is about a little less than one Yeah right the other is there is an increasing 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.840
 To say in the making part to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.920
 Yes the sea surface is non- slip processing 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:26.189
 The same is true for a kindle owner 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 I just feel that the kindle is kind cheap with the side is plastic 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.470
 Though it was 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.570
 The pattern of bread feize is all up to 9 ancestral 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:40.409
 It has become a Rubberized back integrally 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.270
 I feel that with exchange for that feeling of luxury to the picture thing is 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.330
 It is not at all good is better handle paper Fight 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.500
 Ya when the pair but I'm a front light or that feature the display backlight of the path 5 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.950
 I will try to erase a little bit 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.720
 I understand that there is quite a difference between Toei 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.720
 I can see clearly even in dark places 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:13.770
 I think I think you are bothered by a paper fight, but I still count 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 switching 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.660
 Now this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.650
 Though it enters with the account of dot com 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:34.550
 Health itself is displayed in Japanese only account 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.450
 Of course it is possible to set it with amazon. com 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.450
 Even in this state 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.650
 It is the store of fly and com that this place can access in this condition 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:52.540
 In by entering the account of .co.jp to in this registration by part 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.840
 a now be able to access the kindle store in the direction of .co.jp 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.840
 I will 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:09.970
 If you are using exactly the same id password as a.co.jp 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:13.850
 I I I Yeah but probably I think that is dragged by the language setting 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.450
 of Japanese If you had to a Japanese language settings 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.380
 I made a sushi for kindle star 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:26.260
 And maybe if you set the language English 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.260
 No. I think that you may access to com 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.160
 A 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.940
 It is a Japanese display though 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.940
 Of course 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.050
 It is ms version, but Japanese vertical writing display 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.050
 Corresponding Masu Tei to 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.629
 Japanese font is 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.440
 Nemuritori and Kogoshi-kun 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.460
 Two kinds of ru 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.460
 There is 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:04.860
 In the case of Well is the Japanese word 2 Japanese Japanese language vertical writing 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.860
 a page sent to the 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.650
 Here Here is a tooth left 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.999
 Press the page feed and press the right end 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.239
 It will be the return of the page 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.979
 So Japanese 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:32.480
 Motoki I said this with one hand 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:37.390
 I think I have it, but it feels like sending pages with this 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.390
 So far in the m mark 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.540
 In the case of kindle of 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.140
 With one hand 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.969
 Take it in like this 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:58.480
 Since there is a button in good eight, page feed 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:05:02.130
 Going back to the page is all going or standing 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.130
 I was able to do it 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.639
 Both hands and handle bread Fight doing it is it can no longer this will grab smash 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.900
 If you do not use 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.900
 I can not send a page 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:27.270
 Emma I think this will be like this 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:30.330
 Caught fishing leather to on the train and I wonder if that hold severe Japan in this state 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.570
 There is no need to say 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.570
 I think that there is no problem for what you plan to do 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:47.099
 Yes yes this is an english file 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.099
 Yes , it's a Japanese file 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:57.240
 The right end was the page return, but when it comes to an English file this time the left end is 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:06:00.720
 It changes to the return of the cash register 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:05.150
 The setting changes depending on the file to be displayed 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.150
 I feel that I wonder is made well again this neighborhood 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.320
 In English, fonts are increasing 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.849
 I 'm a bit out of focus 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.070
 Say the way 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:28.850
 ms kindle had 3 kinds of fonts to choose from 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.850
 It has been increased to six types, including helvetica 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:38.379
 After but also set the looks together 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.379
 It is a place where the size of the character can be selected, and the line spacing can be selected. 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:48.400
 Referred to as the x-old in but I do not come out and the other one Ekore Books in Japanese 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.400
 There is a function 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.760
 If this is who said that page will come out 6 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.540
 It is a camp 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.840
 It is a topic 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.720
 But 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.120
 I would like to say where in other parts of the book I will come out, but say that jump in one shot there 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.110
 What 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.840
 a will be able to 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.840
 I this is you enjoy feeling that I wonder it is quite convenient 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.160
 Japanese boy 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.210
 It is a function that I think I want by all means 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:29.190
 I don't think so much for reading novels though 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:34.520
 For example by topic to when or looking at the reference book 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.520
 I think it is very useful to fly
