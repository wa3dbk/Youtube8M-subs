00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450 

breast<00:00:00.269> cancer<00:00:00.510> is<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.930> disease<00:00:01.460> predominantly

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
breast cancer is a disease predominantly

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.160 
breast cancer is a disease predominantly
of<00:00:02.669> women<00:00:03.030> it<00:00:03.389> does<00:00:03.780> occur<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.500> men<00:00:05.370> as<00:00:05.640> well

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
of women it does occur in men as well

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.660 
of women it does occur in men as well
probably<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.290> has<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> relation<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> amount

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
probably it has a relation to the amount

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.060 
probably it has a relation to the amount
of<00:00:09.000> breast<00:00:09.330> tissue<00:00:09.450> so<00:00:10.080> women<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> lot

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
of breast tissue so women have a lot

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.390 
of breast tissue so women have a lot
more<00:00:11.340> breast<00:00:11.790> tissue<00:00:11.910> than<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.139> thus<00:00:13.830> more

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
more breast tissue than and thus more

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.050 
more breast tissue than and thus more
tissue<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> risk<00:00:15.599> for<00:00:16.109> developing<00:00:16.710> cancer

tissue as a risk for developing cancer
usually<00:00:18.060> women<00:00:18.539> find<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> lump<00:00:19.740> or<00:00:20.189> it's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
usually women find it as a lump or it's

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.439 
usually women find it as a lump or it's
discovered<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> mammogram<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:23.000> can<00:00:24.000> if

discovered on a mammogram and can if

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.740

cancer<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.300> predominantly<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.440> disease<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
cancer is predominantly a disease of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.849 
cancer is predominantly a disease of
older<00:00:56.340> women<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> does<00:00:57.539> strike<00:00:57.859> younger

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
older women but it does strike younger

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.479 
older women but it does strike younger
premenopausal<00:00:59.789> women<00:01:00.030> as<00:01:00.600> well<00:01:01.489> mammograms

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
premenopausal women as well mammograms

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.130 
premenopausal women as well mammograms
are<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:04.530> test<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.210> older<00:01:06.210> women<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
are a good test in older women but

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.770 
are a good test in older women but
they're<00:01:07.409> not<00:01:07.560> such<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> great<00:01:08.130> test<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.270> younger

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
they're not such a great test in younger

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
they're not such a great test in younger
women<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.830> reason<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.490> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
women and the reason for that is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.950 
women and the reason for that is
mammograms<00:01:12.510> detect<00:01:13.400> calcium<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.720> contrast<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
mammograms detect calcium in contrast to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.690 
mammograms detect calcium in contrast to
fat<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.369> breast<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> have

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
fat in the breast so when you have

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
fat in the breast so when you have
breasts<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> lot<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> fat<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:21.960> them

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
breasts that have a lot of fat in them

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.330 
breasts that have a lot of fat in them
which<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.860> normal<00:01:23.700> process<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.810> aging

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
which is a normal process of aging

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.160 
which is a normal process of aging
mammograms<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.640> good<00:01:26.970> test<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
mammograms are a good test but in

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
mammograms are a good test but in
younger<00:01:28.560> women<00:01:28.590> who<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
younger women who don't have a lot of

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.289 
younger women who don't have a lot of
fat<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:31.020> normal<00:01:31.680> breast<00:01:32.299> mammograms

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
fat in there normal breast mammograms

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.280 
fat in there normal breast mammograms
can<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:34.320> difficult<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.820> interpret<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
can be very difficult to interpret the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.490 
can be very difficult to interpret the
breast<00:01:38.659> self-examination<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> very<00:01:40.350> good

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
breast self-examination is a very good

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.609 
breast self-examination is a very good
test<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.460> probably<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:42.930> mammography

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
test and probably as good as mammography

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.270 
test and probably as good as mammography
in<00:01:44.280> younger<00:01:44.880> women<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.780> are<00:01:45.990> other<00:01:46.350> imaging

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
in younger women there are other imaging

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
in younger women there are other imaging
techniques<00:01:47.939> including<00:01:48.540> mr

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
techniques including mr

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.220 
techniques including mr
including<00:01:50.160> ultrasound<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.390> we<00:01:51.720> aren't<00:01:51.900> sure

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
including ultrasound but we aren't sure

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.370 
including ultrasound but we aren't sure
how<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.400> normal<00:01:53.880> risk<00:01:54.240> woman<00:01:54.870> how<00:01:55.320> to

how in the normal risk woman how to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.430 
how in the normal risk woman how to
apply<00:01:55.950> these<00:01:56.120> tests<00:01:57.120> yet<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
apply these tests yet but I think the

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.370 
apply these tests yet but I think the
message<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.130> breast<00:01:59.880> lumps<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.020> they're

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
message is that breast lumps if they're

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.120 
message is that breast lumps if they're
discovered<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.540> ignored<00:02:04.130> most

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
discovered should not be ignored most

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.719 
discovered should not be ignored most
breast<00:02:05.790> lumps<00:02:06.690> are<00:02:06.900> not<00:02:06.930> cancer<00:02:07.740> but<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.520> ones

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
breast lumps are not cancer but the ones

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.990 
breast lumps are not cancer but the ones
that<00:02:08.880> are<00:02:09.210> when<00:02:09.690> treated<00:02:10.430> appropriately<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that are when treated appropriately and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.290 
that are when treated appropriately and
treated<00:02:12.390> early<00:02:12.570> are<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.740> curable<00:02:14.300> illness

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
treated early are very curable illness

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.930

breast<00:02:25.260> cancer<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.550> surgically<00:02:27.120> remove

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
breast cancer is to surgically remove

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.430 
breast cancer is to surgically remove
all<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.800> them<00:02:29.010> within<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.030> last<00:02:30.240> 15<00:02:30.720> or<00:02:31.020> 20

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.370 
all of them within the last 15 or 20
years<00:02:31.470> we've<00:02:32.010> gone<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.730> many<00:02:32.970> cases<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:34.200> what's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
years we've gone in many cases to what's

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
years we've gone in many cases to what's
called<00:02:34.590> breast<00:02:35.010> conserving<00:02:35.310> surgery<00:02:35.840> often

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.130 
called breast conserving surgery often
we<00:02:37.320> give<00:02:37.560> either<00:02:37.970> chemotherapy<00:02:38.970> or<00:02:39.140> hormone

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
we give either chemotherapy or hormone

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.140 
we give either chemotherapy or hormone
treatment<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.100> intent<00:02:41.459> of<00:02:41.640> shrinking

treatment with the intent of shrinking
the<00:02:42.300> tumor<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:43.320> can<00:02:43.560> shrink<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.160> tumor<00:02:44.550> to

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the tumor and we can shrink the tumor to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.140 
the tumor and we can shrink the tumor to
a<00:02:44.850> small<00:02:45.209> size<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:46.140> surgeons<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.890> then

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
a small size and the surgeons and then

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.390 
a small size and the surgeons and then
just<00:02:48.150> remove<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.900> lump<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.220> of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
just remove the lump so that's a way of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.810 
just remove the lump so that's a way of
breast<00:02:51.120> conserving<00:02:51.600> surgery<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.830> think<00:02:53.580> that

breast conserving surgery I think that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.800 
breast conserving surgery I think that
we<00:02:54.060> are<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.019> verge<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.800> moving<00:02:56.760> away<00:02:56.970> from

20 years ago we moved away from complete
resection<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> whole<00:03:05.850> breast<00:03:06.200> toward

therapies<00:03:11.820> were<00:03:12.540> close<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.440> making<00:03:13.650> breast
