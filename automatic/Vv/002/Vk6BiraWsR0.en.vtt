that are performed by pain doctors this
is<00:00:54.930> due<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> fact<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.039> risk

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
is due to the fact that the risk

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
is due to the fact that the risk
compared<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> potential<00:00:57.360> gains<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:58.020> very
