 A rich dog is hyperactive when he sees people 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.560
 or dogs then seeks with them 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.820
 meet so it can break and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.560
 the leash I noticed he jumps on you and you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 you support that is you agree it 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 restless agitated one 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.260
 who holds the leash that may 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.110
 control the dog if just him 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.090
 warn calm him down 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.090
 draw attention to yourself like this 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.950
 we must show discontent you 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.850
 show content later 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.980
 imagine the rain and slush and he 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 such same paws will jump on 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.600
 I will show you now how to introduce you 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.149
 with another dog so that he behaves more 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.540
 calm and quiet quiet here is an important point 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.490
 until he calms down until I give him 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.229
 opportunity to sniff this dog he 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.990
 must understand that the only way to 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.050
 this dog calm any 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.369
 anxious and pulling back 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.090
 I show that this behavior to me 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 like not like this 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.390
 he again me again 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.579
 here he starts to worry just 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.929
 jerking just pulls away god 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.939
 preferably if he distracts I attract 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.670
 attention to myself just like that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.579
 the back of the heel like that so he on 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.500
 I paid attention silent he will start 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.990
 whine or be excited because and 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.340
 there is something wrong doing lies on his back 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.740
 or something dabbles 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.850
 right now he is getting excited i 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.780
 can I give him a prize 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:08.239
 calm here so here when he 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.750
 calms down i suggest to chat 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.750
 what 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 not 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.850
 OK 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.860
 it is very important to change the scenarios of his script 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.500
 is the following at the sight of a dog 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.010
 I'm excited for starting to whine 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.290
 pull on two paws pull and i reach 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 my goal is to achieve this dog 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.550
 he has this script very well 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 works since every time he 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.870
 applying this script 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.860
 got to the dogs I am now changing this 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.390
 the scene I say 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.670
 only let him get to these 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 dogs it is only peace I put 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.590
 new script blame my attitude and 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.590
 behavior only then problems
