00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
taught us is to try and be more quiet

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.069 
taught us is to try and be more quiet
when<00:02:47.409> you<00:02:47.530> land<00:02:47.709> so<00:02:48.129> um<00:02:48.360> all<00:02:49.360> your<00:02:49.540> Precision's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
when you land so um all your Precision's

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.259 
when you land so um all your Precision's
and<00:02:50.440> lands<00:02:50.829> you<00:02:50.920> do<00:02:51.069> that<00:02:51.310> like<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.819> it's

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
and lands you do that like this it's

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.880 
and lands you do that like this it's
just<00:02:52.629> about<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.349> there's<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.769> good

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
just about you you there's a good

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.170 
just about you you there's a good
exercise<00:02:54.159> you<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.519> be<00:02:54.700> where<00:02:54.819> your<00:02:54.909> balance

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
exercise you can be where your balance

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.520 
exercise you can be where your balance
on<00:02:55.269> your<00:02:55.299> toes<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.989> jump<00:02:56.260> do<00:02:56.439> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
precision movement and then land again

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.610 
precision movement and then land again
without<00:02:58.120> making<00:02:58.510> any<00:02:58.659> noise<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.470> makes
