 open we will not do it in this case 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.149
 open is also used at a lot in 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.130
 the civil when a presentation appears 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.250
 and says that you want to install it in the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 interaction manual is because first 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.300
 the car room opens and then opens 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.979

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.310
 what are those that if they see it 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.200
 I'm going to change the name because it's 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.200
