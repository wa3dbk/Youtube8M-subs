the exact same shade as this zombie so I

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.160 
the exact same shade as this zombie so I
mean<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.790> can<00:04:09.910> put<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.270> this<00:04:10.510> if<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.900> want

mean you can put it on this if you want
it<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.530> actually<00:04:14.950> when<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.030> look<00:04:16.180> at<00:04:16.270> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
it and actually when you look at the

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.020 
it and actually when you look at the
burn<00:04:16.570> zombie<00:04:16.840> or<00:04:17.200> bz<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.640> packaging

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
burn zombie or bz on the packaging

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.120 
burn zombie or bz on the packaging
you'll<00:04:19.210> actually<00:04:19.330> see<00:04:19.690> he<00:04:19.870> comes<00:04:20.140> with<00:04:20.380> two

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
you'll actually see he comes with two

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.410 
you'll actually see he comes with two
normal<00:04:21.489> arms

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
normal arms

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.840 
normal arms
I<00:04:22.740> mean<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.800> bit<00:04:23.950> different<00:04:24.340> in<00:04:24.430> terms<00:04:24.670> of

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
I mean a bit different in terms of

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.090 
I mean a bit different in terms of
detailing<00:04:25.240> but<00:04:25.570> he<00:04:25.720> comes<00:04:25.960> with<00:04:26.110> two<00:04:26.230> arms<00:04:26.530> so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
detailing but he comes with two arms so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.300 
detailing but he comes with two arms so
this<00:04:27.220> is<00:04:27.340> more<00:04:27.490> accurate<00:04:28.380> though<00:04:29.380> again<00:04:29.860> it's

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
this is more accurate though again it's

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.660 
this is more accurate though again it's
all<00:04:30.400> up<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:31.770> overall<00:04:32.770> Beasley<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.370> nice
