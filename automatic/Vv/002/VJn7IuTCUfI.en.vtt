00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
it is to understand that we just don't

much in order to create movement so the
easiest<00:00:17.520> thing<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> seminars<00:00:18.930> is

back<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.940> boom<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
back just a little bit boom all the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.770 
back just a little bit boom all the
pressure<00:01:04.769> pretty<00:01:05.100> much<00:01:05.280> comes<00:01:05.580> off<00:01:05.790> okay<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
pressure pretty much comes off okay and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.700 
pressure pretty much comes off okay and
when<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.420> also<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.619> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
when we do that also to put it in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
when we do that also to put it in
perspective<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> 5<00:01:11.700> degree<00:01:11.970> lean<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.780> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
perspective at a 5 degree lean which is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
perspective at a 5 degree lean which is
roughly<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:14.220> fallen<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.640> me<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.880> bit

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
roughly just fallen to me a little bit

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.249 
roughly just fallen to me a little bit
roughly<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.299> at<00:01:18.299> 5<00:01:18.750> degrees

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
roughly about like that at 5 degrees

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.640 
roughly about like that at 5 degrees
from<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> ankles<00:01:20.330> he<00:01:21.330> could<00:01:21.479> hold<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.840> 408<00:01:22.380> pace

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
from the ankles he could hold a 408 pace

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.950 
from the ankles he could hold a 408 pace
per<00:01:22.890> mile<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.490> he's<00:01:24.060> getting<00:01:24.360> his<00:01:24.479> foot<00:01:24.750> off<00:01:24.930> in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
per mile if he's getting his foot off in

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
per mile if he's getting his foot off in
time<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.530> he's<00:01:25.799> landing<00:01:26.310> close<00:01:26.580> enough<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
time if he's landing close enough to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
time if he's landing close enough to
underneath<00:01:27.869> his<00:01:28.200> general<00:01:28.590> center<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> mass

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
underneath his general center of mass

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.240 
underneath his general center of mass
which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.509> somewhere<00:01:31.250> between

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
which is going to be somewhere between

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
which is going to be somewhere between
here<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.850> here

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
here and here

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.760 
here and here
where<00:01:34.500> his<00:01:34.650> foot<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.659> ok<00:01:36.659> because<00:01:37.200> anything

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
where his foot is ok because anything

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.640 
where his foot is ok because anything
that<00:01:38.189> lands<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:39.090> front<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> forward<00:01:40.439> moving

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
that lands in front of a forward moving

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.069 
that lands in front of a forward moving
body<00:01:41.090> he's<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.329> putting<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.840> brakes

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
body he's just putting on the brakes

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.520 
body he's just putting on the brakes
okay<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:45.119> he's<00:01:45.270> putting<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.869> brakes<00:01:46.170> he

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
okay so if he's putting on the brakes he

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
okay so if he's putting on the brakes he
Slone<00:01:46.950> himself<00:01:47.399> down<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.479> he's<00:01:48.600> going

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
Slone himself down and then he's going

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.960 
Slone himself down and then he's going
to<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> make<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.040> by<00:01:50.460> creating

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to have to make up for it by creating

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.749 
to have to make up for it by creating
more<00:01:51.119> energy<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.659> order<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> go<00:01:52.020> faster<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
more energy in order to go faster and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
more energy in order to go faster and
what<00:01:53.759> inevitably<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.200> people

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
what inevitably what we see is people

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.920 
what inevitably what we see is people
who<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> run<00:01:56.250> faster<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.090> okay<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
who want to run faster and they okay I

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
who want to run faster and they okay I
understand<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> lean<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.310> going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.520> lean

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
understand the lean I'm going to lean

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.219 
understand the lean I'm going to lean
they're<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.360> break<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.930> waist

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
they're going to break it that waist

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.520 
they're going to break it that waist
because<00:02:01.710> anything<00:02:02.549> really<00:02:03.090> over<00:02:03.570> 15<00:02:04.110> degrees

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
because anything really over 15 degrees

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.130 
because anything really over 15 degrees
20<00:02:05.369> degrees<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:06.990> have

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
20 degrees it's just not we don't have

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.050 
20 degrees it's just not we don't have
the<00:02:07.259> ability<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.710> maintain<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.640> very<00:02:08.819> long

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the ability to maintain for very long

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.559 
the ability to maintain for very long
okay<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.979> 5<00:02:11.400> degree<00:02:11.940> lean

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
okay so it's just that 5 degree lean

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.140 
okay so it's just that 5 degree lean
rough

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
rough

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.479 
rough
or<00:02:13.360> under<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.500> we're<00:02:14.709> really<00:02:14.950> wanting<00:02:15.400> to

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
or under that we're really wanting to

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.640 
or under that we're really wanting to
utilize<00:02:15.909> kay<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.510> most<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.049> us<00:02:17.140> can't<00:02:17.349> even<00:02:17.560> do

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
utilize kay and most of us can't even do

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.009 
utilize kay and most of us can't even do
that<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.129> mile<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:18.879> I<00:02:18.909> mean<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> 408<00:02:19.780> mile

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
that for a mile right I mean a 408 mile

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.149 
that for a mile right I mean a 408 mile
and<00:02:20.379> five<00:02:21.370> degrees<00:02:21.819> so<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.620> get<00:02:23.830> him<00:02:24.040> to

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
and five degrees so if I get him to

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.490 
and five degrees so if I get him to
understand<00:02:24.640> how<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.060> fall<00:02:25.450> correctly<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.290> we

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
understand how to fall correctly and we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.110 
understand how to fall correctly and we
set<00:02:26.769> them<00:02:26.860> up<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.250> hopping<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.670> place<00:02:27.909> we're

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
set them up for hopping in place we're

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.690 
set them up for hopping in place we're
just<00:02:28.239> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.049> ball<00:02:29.230> foot<00:02:29.530> hop<00:02:29.739> go

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
just going to do the ball foot hop go

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.610 
just going to do the ball foot hop go
for<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.030> Doug<00:02:31.379> stabilized<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:33.690> now<00:02:34.690> lean<00:02:35.409> as

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
for it Doug stabilized and now lean as

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.289 
for it Doug stabilized and now lean as
little<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.069> possible<00:02:36.250> he's<00:02:36.909> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> hop

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
little as possible he's going to hop

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.210 
little as possible he's going to hop
forward<00:02:37.599> three<00:02:37.989> times<00:02:38.260> you'll<00:02:38.860> see<00:02:39.069> he's

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
forward three times you'll see he's

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.830 
forward three times you'll see he's
moving<00:02:39.610> now<00:02:39.640> he<00:02:40.030> hasn't<00:02:40.209> done<00:02:40.360> anything<00:02:40.420> other

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
moving now he hasn't done anything other

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.170 
moving now he hasn't done anything other
than<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.230> lean<00:02:41.829> at<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.099> ankles<00:02:42.489> then<00:02:42.940> he'll

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
than just lean at the ankles then he'll

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.500 
than just lean at the ankles then he'll
move<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.690> place<00:02:43.900> he'll<00:02:44.620> lean<00:02:44.860> again

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
move into place he'll lean again

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.599 
move into place he'll lean again
Lieut<00:02:46.510> moving<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.500> out<00:02:47.620> do<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.370> place

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
Lieut moving up and out do it in place

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.650 
Lieut moving up and out do it in place
and<00:02:48.970> then<00:02:49.359> I'll<00:02:49.480> lean<00:02:49.660> again<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.629> a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
and then I'll lean again and then a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.599 
and then I'll lean again and then a
level<00:02:53.079> out<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.829> next<00:02:54.129> time<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.519> he

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
level out and this next time when he

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:55.710 
level out and this next time when he
leans<00:02:54.819> he's<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:55.150> going<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.329> go<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.629> he's

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
leans he's just going to go and he's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.649 
leans he's just going to go and he's
going<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.870> run<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.230> out<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.829> maybe<00:02:57.640> go<00:02:57.909> 15<00:02:58.480> or

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
going to run it out and maybe go 15 or

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.449 
going to run it out and maybe go 15 or
and<00:02:59.140> you'll<00:02:59.290> notice<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.829> absorb<00:03:00.280> that

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
and you'll notice you just absorb that

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.240 
and you'll notice you just absorb that
and<00:03:00.700> redirected<00:03:01.329> it<00:03:01.450> as<00:03:01.810> he<00:03:02.019> ran<00:03:02.290> he<00:03:02.590> didn't

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
and redirected it as he ran he didn't

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.550 
and redirected it as he ran he didn't
just<00:03:03.400> stop<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.030> go<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.209> push<00:03:04.480> off<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:05.200> order<00:03:05.470> to

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
just stop and go to push off in order to

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.559 
just stop and go to push off in order to
move<00:03:05.680> forward<00:03:05.980> which<00:03:06.670> shows<00:03:07.209> you're<00:03:07.390> just

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
move forward which shows you're just

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.470 
move forward which shows you're just
capable<00:03:08.049> of<00:03:08.579> doing<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.670> little<00:03:09.879> bit<00:03:10.030> less<00:03:10.209> work

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
capable of doing a little bit less work

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.319 
capable of doing a little bit less work
right<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.670> move<00:03:12.790> forward

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
right to move forward

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.970 
right to move forward
so<00:03:13.510> we'd<00:03:13.810> have<00:03:13.840> them<00:03:13.959> run<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.230> out<00:03:14.379> go<00:03:14.739> about

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
so we'd have them run it out go about

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.099 
so we'd have them run it out go about
100<00:03:15.340> meters<00:03:15.579> 50<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:16.000> 100<00:03:16.329> meters<00:03:16.569> to<00:03:16.750> come<00:03:16.900> back

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
100 meters 50 to 100 meters to come back

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.259 
100 meters 50 to 100 meters to come back
we'd<00:03:17.349> repeat<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.829> come<00:03:18.340> back<00:03:18.519> we'd<00:03:18.760> repeat<00:03:19.090> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
we'd repeat it come back we'd repeat to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.360 
we'd repeat it come back we'd repeat to
where<00:03:19.419> we<00:03:19.569> understood<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.889> it<00:03:20.980> was<00:03:21.160> we<00:03:21.310> were

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
where we understood what it was we were

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.550 
where we understood what it was we were
doing<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:22.299> order<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.599> maintain<00:03:23.169> the<00:03:23.530> integrity

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
doing in order to maintain the integrity

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.120 
doing in order to maintain the integrity
of<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.040> exercise<00:03:24.459> okay<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:26.680> we're<00:03:26.889> putting

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
of the exercise okay so if we're putting

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.009 
of the exercise okay so if we're putting
on<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> brakes<00:03:27.819> what<00:03:28.450> we're<00:03:28.599> going<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.780> really

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
on the brakes what we're going to really

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.490 
on the brakes what we're going to really
hear<00:03:29.349> here<00:03:29.590> when<00:03:30.310> anybody<00:03:30.700> is<00:03:30.790> running<00:03:31.209> is

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
hear here when anybody is running is

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.770 
hear here when anybody is running is
this<00:03:34.049> okay<00:03:35.079> also<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:36.519> he'll<00:03:36.879> strike<00:03:37.239> okay<00:03:37.750> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
this okay also that he'll strike okay a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.199 
this okay also that he'll strike okay a
heel<00:03:38.169> strike<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.650> fine<00:03:38.950> when<00:03:39.730> we're<00:03:39.910> walking

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
heel strike is fine when we're walking

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.470 
heel strike is fine when we're walking
as<00:03:40.620> there's<00:03:41.620> no<00:03:41.829> as<00:03:42.400> both<00:03:42.760> feet<00:03:43.150> are<00:03:43.299> in

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
as there's no as both feet are in

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.089 
as there's no as both feet are in
contact<00:03:43.930> with<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.199> ground<00:03:44.379> at<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> same<00:03:44.799> time

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
contact with the ground at the same time

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.689 
contact with the ground at the same time
but<00:03:45.340> when<00:03:45.489> we<00:03:45.639> start<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.000> speed<00:03:46.419> up<00:03:46.620> run<00:03:47.699> that

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
but when we start to speed up run that

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.909 
but when we start to speed up run that
that's<00:03:49.120> defined<00:03:49.599> as<00:03:49.780> one<00:03:50.019> foot<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.680> ground

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
that's defined as one foot on the ground

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.490 
that's defined as one foot on the ground
at<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.400> time<00:03:51.639> and<00:03:51.879> we're<00:03:52.449> trying<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.199> switch

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
at a time and we're trying to switch

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.430 
at a time and we're trying to switch
we're<00:03:54.340> trying<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.669> switch<00:03:54.970> support<00:03:55.480> here<00:03:55.780> okay

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
we're trying to switch support here okay

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.009 
we're trying to switch support here okay
so<00:03:56.470> if<00:03:56.829> I'm<00:03:57.069> switching<00:03:57.609> support<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.299> putting

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
so if I'm switching support and putting

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.920 
so if I'm switching support and putting
my<00:03:59.169> heel<00:03:59.560> down<00:03:59.859> there's<00:04:00.699> a<00:04:00.790> reason<00:04:01.329> why

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.540 

your<00:04:04.930> foot<00:04:05.290> was<00:04:05.500> kind<00:04:05.740> of<00:04:05.800> designed<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.430> way

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
your foot was kind of designed the way

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.900 
your foot was kind of designed the way
it<00:04:06.700> is<00:04:06.850> is<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:09.090> got<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.300> archway<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:11.290> it

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
it is is it's got this archway in it

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.410 
it is is it's got this archway in it
okay<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:15.160> you've<00:04:15.370> got<00:04:15.520> a<00:04:15.580> fallen<00:04:16.030> arch<00:04:16.209> you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
okay and if you've got a fallen arch you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.880 
okay and if you've got a fallen arch you
can<00:04:16.450> still<00:04:16.810> work<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.470> strengthen<00:04:17.799> up

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
can still work on it and strengthen up

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.770 
can still work on it and strengthen up
the<00:04:17.920> feet<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:18.459> what<00:04:19.209> we<00:04:19.329> have<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.690> this

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
the feet but what we have is this

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.000 
the feet but what we have is this
archway<00:04:20.170> here<00:04:20.560> okay

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
archway here okay

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.730 
archway here okay
and<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.579> works<00:04:22.420> as<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.720> shock<00:04:23.050> absorber<00:04:23.560> when

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
and that works as a shock absorber when

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.890 
and that works as a shock absorber when
we<00:04:23.890> land<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:24.550> when<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.790> land<00:04:25.150> correctly<00:04:25.750> you'll

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
we land and when I land correctly you'll

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.380 
we land and when I land correctly you'll
notice<00:04:26.350> actually<00:04:27.280> let<00:04:27.580> me<00:04:27.640> do<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.790> with<00:04:27.970> this

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
notice actually let me do it with this

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.280 
notice actually let me do it with this
leg<00:04:29.790> you'll<00:04:30.790> notice<00:04:31.150> that's<00:04:31.600> not<00:04:31.840> real<00:04:32.050> hard

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
leg you'll notice that's not real hard

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.560 
leg you'll notice that's not real hard
and<00:04:32.590> I'm<00:04:32.800> not<00:04:33.120> utilizing<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.180> whole<00:04:34.360> lot<00:04:34.540> of

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and I'm not utilizing a whole lot of

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.370 
and I'm not utilizing a whole lot of
energy<00:04:35.050> boom<00:04:35.919> boom<00:04:36.310> boom<00:04:36.669> now<00:04:36.960> fire<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.080> switch

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
energy boom boom boom now fire to switch

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.720 
energy boom boom boom now fire to switch
that<00:04:38.620> over<00:04:38.860> let's<00:04:39.640> just<00:04:39.820> say<00:04:40.720> we're<00:04:41.200> running

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
that over let's just say we're running

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.090 
that over let's just say we're running
go<00:04:42.730> ahead

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.540 

trying<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.220> do<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.610> same<00:04:48.940> thing<00:04:50.130> by<00:04:51.130> landing

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
trying to do the same thing by landing

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.110 
trying to do the same thing by landing
on<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.760> heel<00:04:52.140> doesn't<00:04:53.140> work<00:04:53.350> out<00:04:53.560> okay<00:04:54.520> so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
on the heel doesn't work out okay so

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.930 
on the heel doesn't work out okay so
most<00:04:55.660> people<00:04:56.169> understand<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:56.950> now<00:04:57.190> why<00:04:57.910> a

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
most people understand that now why a

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.090 
most people understand that now why a
heel<00:04:58.360> strike<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.870> not<00:04:59.110> conducive<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.919> running

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
heel strike is not conducive to running

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.180 
heel strike is not conducive to running
okay<00:05:00.820> but<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.690> heel<00:05:01.930> strike<00:05:02.230> is<00:05:02.380> also<00:05:02.830> putting

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
okay but the heel strike is also putting

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.110 
okay but the heel strike is also putting
on<00:05:03.430> those<00:05:03.610> brakes<00:05:04.440> okay<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.460> landing<00:05:07.030> out

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
on those brakes okay so and landing out

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.400 
on those brakes okay so and landing out
in<00:05:07.270> front<00:05:07.510> of<00:05:07.570> that<00:05:07.660> general<00:05:07.960> Center<00:05:08.200> mass

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
in front of that general Center mass

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.080 
in front of that general Center mass
even<00:05:08.740> if<00:05:08.919> we're<00:05:09.070> landing<00:05:09.430> with<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:09.669> ball<00:05:09.910> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
even if we're landing with that ball of

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.980 
even if we're landing with that ball of
foot<00:05:10.620> okay<00:05:11.620> it's<00:05:12.400> still<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.270> forward<00:05:13.810> moving

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
foot okay it's still a forward moving

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.200 
foot okay it's still a forward moving
body<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.620> it's<00:05:15.070> still<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.700> brakes<00:05:16.030> are

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
body and it's still the brakes are

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.940 
body and it's still the brakes are
coming<00:05:16.479> on<00:05:16.630> so<00:05:16.870> what<00:05:17.050> do<00:05:17.140> we<00:05:17.229> end<00:05:17.350> up<00:05:17.500> loading

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
coming on so what do we end up loading

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.340 
coming on so what do we end up loading
if<00:05:18.070> we're<00:05:18.669> putting<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.210> brakes<00:05:19.479> here<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
if we're putting on the brakes here the

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.200 
if we're putting on the brakes here the
front<00:05:20.860> we're<00:05:21.400> going<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:21.820> that<00:05:22.000> knee

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
front we're going to in that knee

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.340 
front we're going to in that knee
forward<00:05:22.570> position<00:05:23.260> okay<00:05:23.970> quadriceps<00:05:24.970> are

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
forward position okay quadriceps are

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.350 
forward position okay quadriceps are
loading<00:05:26.350> up<00:05:26.500> all<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.520> tensions<00:05:27.940> coming<00:05:28.210> down

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
loading up all the tensions coming down

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.540 
loading up all the tensions coming down
on<00:05:28.510> that<00:05:28.630> patella<00:05:28.990> okay<00:05:29.800> if<00:05:30.070> we're<00:05:30.460> not

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
on that patella okay if we're not

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.550 
on that patella okay if we're not
stabilizing<00:05:31.270> correctly<00:05:31.930> with<00:05:32.050> our<00:05:32.169> glutes

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
stabilizing correctly with our glutes

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.130 
stabilizing correctly with our glutes
okay<00:05:33.220> what<00:05:34.090> Nevitt<00:05:34.360> aliy<00:05:34.510> happens<00:05:34.900> is<00:05:35.020> that

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
okay what Nevitt aliy happens is that

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.440 
okay what Nevitt aliy happens is that
knee<00:05:35.410> tends<00:05:35.979> to<00:05:36.130> torque<00:05:36.430> in<00:05:36.610> anybody<00:05:37.120> ever<00:05:37.270> had

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
knee tends to torque in anybody ever had

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.610 
knee tends to torque in anybody ever had
IT<00:05:37.660> band<00:05:38.020> syndrome

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
IT band syndrome

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.460 
IT band syndrome
boom<00:05:39.220> not<00:05:39.970> stabilizing<00:05:40.479> correctly<00:05:41.050> this<00:05:41.410> is

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
boom not stabilizing correctly this is

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.240 
boom not stabilizing correctly this is
probably<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.100> problem<00:05:42.610> okay<00:05:43.360> so<00:05:44.260> if<00:05:44.590> he's

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
probably a problem okay so if he's

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.010 
probably a problem okay so if he's
putting<00:05:45.490> on<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.669> brakes<00:05:46.060> he's<00:05:46.510> engaged<00:05:46.720> as

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
putting on the brakes he's engaged as

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.930 
putting on the brakes he's engaged as
quadriceps<00:05:47.650> far<00:05:47.919> more<00:05:48.130> than<00:05:48.280> he's<00:05:48.430> needed<00:05:48.760> to

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
quadriceps far more than he's needed to

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.600 
quadriceps far more than he's needed to
if<00:05:49.300> he<00:05:50.140> has<00:05:50.260> a<00:05:50.290> lack<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.680> glute<00:05:51.100> strength<00:05:51.400> or

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
if he has a lack of glute strength or

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.670 
if he has a lack of glute strength or
stability<00:05:51.760> he's<00:05:52.450> not<00:05:52.720> stabilizing<00:05:53.290> the<00:05:53.500> knee

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
stability he's not stabilizing the knee

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.370 
stability he's not stabilizing the knee
okay<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:55.210> we're<00:05:55.450> going<00:05:55.540> to<00:05:55.630> end<00:05:55.870> up<00:05:56.050> having

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
okay so we're going to end up having

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.230 
okay so we're going to end up having
problems<00:05:57.070> associated<00:05:57.370> with<00:05:57.640> that<00:05:57.820> knee<00:05:58.000> or

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
problems associated with that knee or

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.020 
problems associated with that knee or
even<00:05:58.479> ITA<00:05:58.900> band<00:05:59.260> area<00:05:59.650> okay<00:06:00.160> or<00:06:00.729> even<00:06:00.970> the

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
even ITA band area okay or even the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.409 
even ITA band area okay or even the
patella<00:06:02.310> so<00:06:03.310> now<00:06:03.490> we're<00:06:03.669> set<00:06:03.850> up<00:06:03.880> here<00:06:04.000> and

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
patella so now we're set up here and

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.090 
patella so now we're set up here and
what<00:06:04.600> has<00:06:04.750> to<00:06:04.780> happen<00:06:04.990> is<00:06:05.500> he's<00:06:05.740> going<00:06:05.890> to<00:06:05.950> have

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
what has to happen is he's going to have

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.540 
what has to happen is he's going to have
to<00:06:06.130> get<00:06:06.430> over<00:06:06.610> that<00:06:06.760> then<00:06:07.750> make<00:06:08.229> up<00:06:08.440> for<00:06:08.860> what

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
to get over that then make up for what

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.760 
to get over that then make up for what
he<00:06:09.640> wants<00:06:09.910> to<00:06:10.030> do<00:06:10.210> by<00:06:10.780> either<00:06:10.810> pushing<00:06:11.470> out<00:06:11.590> the

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
he wants to do by either pushing out the

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.820 
he wants to do by either pushing out the
back<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.390> creating<00:06:13.390> more<00:06:13.720> energy<00:06:14.620> than<00:06:14.770> he

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
back and creating more energy than he

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.070 
back and creating more energy than he
needs<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.250> in<00:06:15.610> order<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.419> make<00:06:16.630> up<00:06:16.810> for

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
needs to in order to make up for

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.649 
needs to in order to make up for
what<00:06:17.169> he's<00:06:17.319> just<00:06:17.349> lost<00:06:17.889> it'd<00:06:18.789> be<00:06:19.210> like<00:06:19.389> putting

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
what he's just lost it'd be like putting

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.640 
what he's just lost it'd be like putting
an<00:06:20.530> object<00:06:21.370> out<00:06:21.490> in<00:06:21.639> front<00:06:21.879> of<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.180> ball<00:06:22.659> rolling

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
an object out in front of a ball rolling

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.529 
an object out in front of a ball rolling
and<00:06:24.009> saying<00:06:24.610> this<00:06:24.759> is<00:06:24.909> an<00:06:25.000> efficient<00:06:25.419> way<00:06:25.509> to

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
and saying this is an efficient way to

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.149 
and saying this is an efficient way to
move<00:06:26.080> okay

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
move okay

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.830 
move okay
there's<00:06:27.490> nothing<00:06:27.819> efficient<00:06:28.300> about<00:06:28.479> putting

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
there's nothing efficient about putting

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.570 
there's nothing efficient about putting
something<00:06:29.050> in<00:06:29.259> for<00:06:29.530> in<00:06:29.710> front<00:06:30.039> of<00:06:30.159> the<00:06:30.219> forward

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
something in for in front of the forward

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.790 
something in for in front of the forward
moving<00:06:30.729> body<00:06:31.060> so<00:06:31.569> in<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.259> difference<00:06:32.650> between

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
moving body so in the difference between

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.490 
moving body so in the difference between
higher-level<00:06:33.759> runners<00:06:34.210> versus<00:06:34.539> not<00:06:35.289> so

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
higher-level runners versus not so

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.290 
higher-level runners versus not so
high-level<00:06:35.949> runners<00:06:36.250> is<00:06:36.400> that<00:06:37.180> the

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
high-level runners is that the

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.640 
high-level runners is that the
higher-level<00:06:37.659> runners<00:06:38.020> don't<00:06:38.229> land<00:06:38.409> out<00:06:38.620> in

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
higher-level runners don't land out in

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.950 
higher-level runners don't land out in
front<00:06:39.099> of<00:06:39.189> them<00:06:39.340> as<00:06:39.520> much<00:06:40.000> as<00:06:40.270> the<00:06:40.569> lower-level

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
front of them as much as the lower-level

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.929 
front of them as much as the lower-level
runners<00:06:41.349> do<00:06:41.560> okay<00:06:42.159> it's<00:06:42.400> just<00:06:42.490> something<00:06:42.909> that

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
runners do okay it's just something that

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:44.550 
runners do okay it's just something that
doesn't<00:06:43.030> happen<00:06:43.389> because<00:06:43.659> they're<00:06:44.110> not<00:06:44.289> able

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
doesn't happen because they're not able

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.740 
doesn't happen because they're not able
to<00:06:44.770> utilize<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:45.520> type<00:06:45.699> of<00:06:45.729> energy<00:06:46.150> while

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
to utilize that type of energy while

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.020 
to utilize that type of energy while
running
