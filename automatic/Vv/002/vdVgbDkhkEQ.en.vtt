now<00:00:01.079> Vince<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.890> see<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.220> question<00:00:03.170> how

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
now Vince let's see this question how

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.930 
now Vince let's see this question how
many<00:00:04.230> numbers<00:00:04.830> can<00:00:05.100> be<00:00:05.130> formed<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
many numbers can be formed with the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.080 
many numbers can be formed with the
digits<00:00:06.390> 1<00:00:06.660> 2<00:00:06.839> 3<00:00:07.020> 4<00:00:07.379> 3<00:00:07.620> 2<00:00:07.830> 1<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.790> odd

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
digits 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 so that the odd

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.320 
digits 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 so that the odd
digits<00:00:09.690> always<00:00:10.230> occupy<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.830> odd<00:00:11.190> places<00:00:11.940> so

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
digits always occupy the odd places so

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.879 
digits always occupy the odd places so
first<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.809> how<00:00:12.990> many<00:00:13.049> digits<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.710> have

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
first of all how many digits we have

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.910 
first of all how many digits we have
it's<00:00:14.519> 1<00:00:15.360> 2<00:00:16.049> 3<00:00:16.859> 4<00:00:17.820> 3<00:00:18.420> 2<00:00:18.810> 1

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
it's 1 2 3 4 3 2 1

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.429 
it's 1 2 3 4 3 2 1
right<00:00:20.189> now<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.960> therefore<00:00:22.890> 2<00:00:23.160> times<00:00:23.460> 2<00:00:24.359> no<00:00:25.080> x

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
right now to is therefore 2 times 2 no x

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.709 
right now to is therefore 2 times 2 no x
+<00:00:26.010> 3<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:28.080> also<00:00:28.710> therefore<00:00:29.400> 2<00:00:29.609> x<00:00:29.910> +<00:00:32.090> 1<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.300> also

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
+ 3 is also therefore 2 x + 1 is also

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.330 
+ 3 is also therefore 2 x + 1 is also
therefore<00:00:34.170> no<00:00:35.010> times

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.920 

okay<00:00:38.340> now<00:00:38.960> 3<00:00:39.960> 4<00:00:40.290> 5<00:00:40.530> 6<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.270> 4<00:00:42.540> 1<00:00:42.780> 2<00:00:43.140> 3<00:00:43.379> 4<00:00:43.739> 7

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
okay now 3 4 5 6 and this 4 1 2 3 4 7

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.529 
okay now 3 4 5 6 and this 4 1 2 3 4 7
numbers<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.980> 4<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.820> coming<00:00:47.969> front<00:00:48.360> one

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
numbers we have so 4 is coming front one

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.750 
numbers we have so 4 is coming front one
time<00:00:48.719> right<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.950> all<00:00:50.100> without<00:00:50.340> any

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
time right so first of all without any

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
time right so first of all without any
conditions<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.660> many<00:00:51.840> numbers<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.469> be

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
conditions how many numbers can be

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
conditions how many numbers can be
formed<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.309> find<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.969> right<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.930> all

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
formed we find out that right so in all

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770 
formed we find out that right so in all
these<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.530> seven<00:00:56.219> numbers<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
these are seven numbers they can be

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.459 
these are seven numbers they can be
arranged<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.559> seven<00:00:59.129> factorial<00:00:59.489> ways<00:00:59.940> right

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
arranged in seven factorial ways right

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.660 
arranged in seven factorial ways right
now<00:01:02.300> we<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> divide<00:01:03.660> by<00:01:03.930> repetition

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
now we have to divide by repetition

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.330 
now we have to divide by repetition
obviously<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.960> 2<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> coming<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
obviously so if a 2 is coming to time so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
obviously so if a 2 is coming to time so
divided<00:01:08.640> by<00:01:08.820> 2<00:01:09.030> factorial<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.990> 3<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.350> coming

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
divided by 2 factorial then 3 is coming

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
divided by 2 factorial then 3 is coming
two<00:01:10.860> times<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.820> divided<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.299> further<00:01:12.630> 2

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
two times so divided by further 2

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.320 
two times so divided by further 2
factorial<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.680> 1<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.220> also<00:01:14.549> coming<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.180> two

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
factorial then 1 is also coming for two

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
factorial then 1 is also coming for two
times<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.200> further<00:01:16.439> divided<00:01:16.830> by<00:01:17.009> 2<00:01:17.250> factorial

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
times so further divided by 2 factorial

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
times so further divided by 2 factorial
right<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.810> these<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.409> 5<00:01:20.040> 0<00:01:20.580> 4<00:01:20.970> 0<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.600> 2<00:01:21.960> into<00:01:22.500> 2

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
right so these are 5 0 4 0 by 2 into 2

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.569 
right so these are 5 0 4 0 by 2 into 2
into<00:01:23.009> 2<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:27.270> 6<00:01:28.229> 30<00:01:28.619> numbers<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.430> be

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
into 2 so in all 6 30 numbers will be

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
into 2 so in all 6 30 numbers will be
formed<00:01:30.150> right<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.930> too<00:01:31.140> without<00:01:31.350> any

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
formed right that too without any

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
formed right that too without any
condition<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> condition<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.079> there

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
condition now the condition is there

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
condition now the condition is there
with<00:01:34.619> us<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> odd<00:01:35.909> digits<00:01:36.420> always

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
with us that the odd digits always

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.960 
with us that the odd digits always
occupy<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.650> odd<00:01:37.979> places

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
occupy the odd places

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
occupy the odd places
right<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.590> challenging<00:01:41.189> part<00:01:41.490> let's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
right so it's the challenging part let's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:52.490 
right so it's the challenging part let's
do<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:45.350> now<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.490> seven<00:01:48.479> places<00:01:49.310> 1<00:01:50.310> 2<00:01:50.820> 3<00:01:51.329> 4<00:01:52.020> 5

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
do it now we have seven places 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
do it now we have seven places 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:53.009> &amp;<00:01:53.310> 7

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
6 &amp; 7

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
6 &amp; 7
now<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> arrange<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.579> odd<00:01:56.759> numbers

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
now we have to arrange the odd numbers

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
now we have to arrange the odd numbers
at<00:01:57.630> odd<00:01:57.990> places<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.040> how<00:01:59.250> many<00:01:59.280> odd

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
at odd places so we have how many odd

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.080 
at odd places so we have how many odd
places

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
places

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.499 
places
1<00:02:00.450> 2<00:02:01.280> 3<00:02:02.280> &amp;<00:02:02.700> 4<00:02:03.560> right<00:02:04.560> we<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.250> 4<00:02:05.579> odd<00:02:05.790> places<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
1 2 3 &amp; 4 right we have 4 odd places and

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
1 2 3 &amp; 4 right we have 4 odd places and
how<00:02:06.750> many<00:02:06.990> numbers<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.879> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.310 

two<00:02:11.670> times<00:02:12.110> one<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.490> two<00:02:14.490> times<00:02:15.110> two

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
two times one and two times two

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.750 
two times one and two times two
oh<00:02:16.700> sorry<00:02:17.700> three<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.350> we<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:19.950> four<00:02:20.520> odd

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
oh sorry three right so we have four odd

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.780 
oh sorry three right so we have four odd
numbers<00:02:21.270> right<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.440> four<00:02:22.770> places<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
numbers right we have four places and we

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.940 
numbers right we have four places and we
have<00:02:23.970> four<00:02:24.240> odd<00:02:24.480> numbers<00:02:24.870> now<00:02:25.350> for<00:02:25.680> odd

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
have four odd numbers now for odd

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.590 
have four odd numbers now for odd
numbers<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.910> arranged

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
numbers can be arranged

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.810 
numbers can be arranged
four<00:02:28.170> numbers<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.980> arranged<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.550> these

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
four numbers can be arranged at these

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.630 
four numbers can be arranged at these
places<00:02:30.120> as<00:02:30.420> four<00:02:31.140> factorial<00:02:31.500> ways<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.490> we

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
places as four factorial ways but we

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610 
places as four factorial ways but we
need<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.940> divide<00:02:33.180> by<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.420> repetition<00:02:33.720> because

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
need to divide by the repetition because

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.500 
need to divide by the repetition because
one<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.070> coming<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.550> two<00:02:35.700> times<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.120> three<00:02:36.210> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
one is coming for two times and three is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.690 
one is coming for two times and three is
also<00:02:36.660> coming<00:02:36.990> for<00:02:37.290> two<00:02:37.470> times<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:38.460> two

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
also coming for two times so two

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790 
also coming for two times so two
factorial<00:02:39.240> into<00:02:39.690> three<00:02:40.080> factorial

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
factorial into three factorial

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.120 
factorial into three factorial
okay<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.120> till<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.470> arranged

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
okay so till here we have just arranged

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.090 
okay so till here we have just arranged
the<00:02:44.670> odd<00:02:44.940> numbers<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.660> odd<00:02:46.050> places<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:47.040> we

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
the odd numbers at odd places now we

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800 
the odd numbers at odd places now we
have<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> arrange<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.030> remaining<00:02:48.480> numbers

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
have to arrange the remaining numbers

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.990 
have to arrange the remaining numbers
also<00:02:49.020> now<00:02:49.770> remaining<00:02:50.070> numbers<00:02:50.459> are<00:02:50.490> three

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
also now remaining numbers are three

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
also now remaining numbers are three
numbers<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.350> be<00:02:52.500> arranged<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.070> three

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
numbers so they can be arranged in three

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.220 
numbers so they can be arranged in three
factorial<00:02:53.580> ways<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.840> remaining

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
factorial ways but in the remaining

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.860 
factorial ways but in the remaining
numbers<00:02:55.590> also<00:02:55.830> two<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.820> being<00:02:57.150> repeated<00:02:57.480> for

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
numbers also two is being repeated for

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.080 
numbers also two is being repeated for
two<00:02:58.050> times<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.500> further<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.950> were<00:02:59.190> divided<00:02:59.520> by<00:02:59.730> 2

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
two times so further I were divided by 2

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.330 
two times so further I were divided by 2
factorial<00:03:00.300> right<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.950> entire

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
factorial right so this is the entire

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.610 
factorial right so this is the entire
calculation<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.660> calculation<00:03:04.380> we

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
calculation in this calculation we

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.500 
calculation in this calculation we
arranged<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.310> odd<00:03:05.520> digits<00:03:05.940> at<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.330> odd

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
arranged the odd digits at the odd

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.020 
arranged the odd digits at the odd
places<00:03:06.920> divided<00:03:07.920> by<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.130> repetition<00:03:08.520> I'm

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
places divided by the repetition I'm

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.260 
places divided by the repetition I'm
sorry<00:03:09.480> here<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.840> will<00:03:09.959> be<00:03:10.110> 2<00:03:10.290> factorial<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:11.670> 3

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
sorry here it will be 2 factorial this 3

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.350 
sorry here it will be 2 factorial this 3
is<00:03:12.420> coming<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.959> 2<00:03:13.140> times<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.370> number<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.850> 3<00:03:15.060> but

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
is coming for 2 times so number is 3 but

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.509 
is coming for 2 times so number is 3 but
it's<00:03:15.810> coming<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.380> 2<00:03:16.530> times<00:03:16.769> R<00:03:16.950> divided<00:03:17.340> by<00:03:17.370> 2

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
it's coming for 2 times R divided by 2

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.420 
it's coming for 2 times R divided by 2
factor<00:03:17.970> I'm<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:18.420> sorry<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
factor I'm really sorry then the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.970 
factor I'm really sorry then the
remaining<00:03:20.730> three<00:03:21.060> numbers<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.870> 2<00:03:22.380> 2<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
remaining three numbers that is 2 2 and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.430 
remaining three numbers that is 2 2 and
4<00:03:23.400> can<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.760> arranged<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.420> 3<00:03:24.750> factorial

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
4 can be arranged in 3 factorial

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.009 
4 can be arranged in 3 factorial
now<00:03:25.769> 2<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:26.130> coming<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.910> 2<00:03:27.120> times<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.630> we<00:03:27.750> divide

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
now 2 is coming for 2 times so we divide

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.229 
now 2 is coming for 2 times so we divide
by<00:03:28.230> 2<00:03:28.530> factorial<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.550> all<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
by 2 factorial so in all this is the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.550 
by 2 factorial so in all this is the
calculation<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.620> 4<00:03:32.100> factorial<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.790> 24

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
calculation so this is 4 factorial is 24

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.120 
calculation so this is 4 factorial is 24
into<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.950> 6<00:03:35.790> by<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.810> 2<00:03:37.110> into<00:03:37.290> 2<00:03:37.890> into

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
into this is 6 by this is 2 into 2 into

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.220 
into this is 6 by this is 2 into 2 into
2<00:03:38.730> right<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.610> eight<00:03:41.610> threes<00:03:42.030> are<00:03:42.239> 24<00:03:42.840> in

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
2 right so this eight threes are 24 in

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.390 
2 right so this eight threes are 24 in
all<00:03:43.970> 18<00:03:44.970> numbers<00:03:45.600> will<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:46.050> there<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.709> which

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
all 18 numbers will be there in which

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150 
all 18 numbers will be there in which
the<00:03:47.790> odd<00:03:48.000> digits<00:03:48.510> always<00:03:49.110> occupy<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.800> odd

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the odd digits always occupy the odd

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.550 
the odd digits always occupy the odd
places<00:03:50.580> right<00:03:51.209> so<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.810> was<00:03:52.050> quite<00:03:52.230> an

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
places right so it was quite an

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.890 
places right so it was quite an
interesting<00:03:52.860> problem<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:54.030> did<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.390> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
interesting problem that we did and I

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.259 
interesting problem that we did and I
hope<00:03:55.260> now<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.590> concept<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.459> repetition<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
hope now the concept of repetition of

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.620 
hope now the concept of repetition of
numbers<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.050> letters<00:03:59.000> will<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.030> clear<00:04:00.390> in

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
numbers and letters will be clear in

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.750 
numbers and letters will be clear in
your<00:04:00.690> mind<00:04:00.810> right<00:04:01.290> orphans<00:04:02.070> will<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.340> taking

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
your mind right orphans will be taking

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.520 
your mind right orphans will be taking
more<00:04:02.940> problems<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.630> our<00:04:03.780> next<00:04:04.080> session<00:04:04.200> do

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
more problems in our next session do

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.770 
more problems in our next session do
realize<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:05.010> session<00:04:05.370> because<00:04:05.780> gradually

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
realize the session because gradually

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.300 
realize the session because gradually
now<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.950> level<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.610> difficulty<00:04:09.030> will<00:04:09.360> be

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
now the level of difficulty will be

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.530 
now the level of difficulty will be
increasing<00:04:11.310> right<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.940> you'll<00:04:12.120> be<00:04:12.299> better

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
increasing right so you'll be better

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.870 
increasing right so you'll be better
prepared<00:04:12.840> for<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.320> next<00:04:13.440> sessions<00:04:14.010> right<00:04:14.250> do

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
prepared for the next sessions right do

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.690 
prepared for the next sessions right do
revise<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.739> let's<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.130> next<00:04:17.370> session
