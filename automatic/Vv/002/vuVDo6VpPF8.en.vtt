00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.110
 another practical use of the co chorus of 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.529
 this magical machine is for example 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.990
 that of being able to position on ours 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.150
 fishing system only one to be able to 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.710
 stop lead guardian is a lot 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.310
 simple then we have executed 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.780
 this tie between dyneema and nylon e 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.490
 usually where the nylon starts 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.949
 we must of necessity and stop the 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.469
 lead guardian we can do in a 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:39.550
 very simple and practical way we take 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.640
 a small piece of spectra or dyneema 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.850
 give fairly reduced book 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.940
 this is a 100 pounds let's go to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:54.550
 place it on the first piece of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.920
 nylon so we take the co 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.239
 let's start to rotate it from the left 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.879
 to the right 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.780
 simply positioning is not up to the 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.780
 piece of spectra paired with nardÃ² 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.810
 is flowing a little we regulate a moment 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 clutch tightening I repeat the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:19.930
 spout of the co must always remain 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.799
 attached to the binding so here 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.399
 so it is flowing very well let's go 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.399
 over 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.490
 we arrived at the bottom of ours 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 regatta 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 at this point 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.920
 as for the previous binding 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:53.740
 we close everything with two of my uncles 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:53.740
 grandparents and two 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.400
 we cut about a centimeter and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.370
 we remove the excess by creating a small ball 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.600
 of standing on the caricature 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:10.340
 so here is this point as you can 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.700
 see we created our beautiful 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.630
 tying a quiet and very safe 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.730
 very resistant spectra buttonhole very 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.130
 end where we will hook our 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.930
 lead guagliano this is a system 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.150
 I repeat very safely clean the slide 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.100
 where we can hook up our ballast 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.920
 for trolling with in vivo 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.060
 this is one of the many uses of 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.770
 co.co.co nation which could be 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.190
 also used for example to create 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.940
 of the reference signals on the line 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:51.380
 to say in the packaging of the body there 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.890
 are 22 spools multi-fiber nests not a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.350
 colored case in this specific case 1 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.170
 orange as you can see is one 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.080
 yellow just to favor the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.440
 visibility of the binding therefore also 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.200
 if we want to create at some point 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.250
 of the line a reference signal 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.050
 may be useful to say in the fishing of 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.140
 surface trolling in the fishing of 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.870
 depth with artificial where 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.239
 can somehow have the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.660
 reference proper of the meters of 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.870
 unrolled with the co co 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.390
 create very colorful markings 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.400
 very very simple and also very much 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.190
 effective for which we can for example 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.950
 also why not create small aso 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.050
 lines for inserting lead seals 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.849
 of rubber bands for balloons 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.900
 everything 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.300
 undoubtedly it is an extremely system 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.650
 versatile that is used for a thousand 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.430
 use and we have improved too 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.670
 very 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.280
 our performance using this 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.280
 really excellent type of instrument
