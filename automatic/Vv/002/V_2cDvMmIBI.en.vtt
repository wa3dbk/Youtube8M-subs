00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
change out my storage bay locks with the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.560 
change out my storage bay locks with the
some<00:01:03.049> ones<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.030> key<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> only<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
some ones that have a key that only I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.690 
some ones that have a key that only I
have<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> won't<00:01:09.060> make<00:01:09.830> them<00:01:10.830> super<00:01:11.280> secure

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
have so it won't make them super secure

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
have so it won't make them super secure
because<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.270> anybody<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> crowbar

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
because you know anybody with a crowbar

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.149 
because you know anybody with a crowbar
could<00:01:13.860> probably<00:01:14.100> pop<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.729> these<00:01:14.940> open<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
could probably pop on these open but

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.649 
could probably pop on these open but
it'll<00:01:17.159> keep<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> honest<00:01:17.880> people<00:01:18.030> honest

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it'll keep the honest people honest

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.160 
it'll keep the honest people honest
anyway<00:01:19.010> so<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.190> they<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.340> can't<00:01:20.700> open<00:01:20.850> your

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
anyway so that they just can't open your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.580 
anyway so that they just can't open your
your<00:01:22.170> locks<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.830> their<00:01:23.040> keys<00:01:24.590> another

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
your locks with their keys another

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.250 
your locks with their keys another
reason<00:01:26.010> I<00:01:26.100> wanted<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> change<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.120> these<00:01:27.360> keys

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
reason I wanted to change out these keys

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.030 
reason I wanted to change out these keys
is<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> locks<00:01:31.200> are<00:01:31.530> super<00:01:32.130> cheap<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:34.040> half

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
is the locks are super cheap and half

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.820 
is the locks are super cheap and half

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
first I didn't really understand what

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.750 
first I didn't really understand what
these<00:04:12.090> little<00:04:13.090> square<00:04:14.190> washer<00:04:15.190> type<00:04:15.400> things

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
these little square washer type things

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.960 
these little square washer type things
were<00:04:16.049> but<00:04:17.049> they<00:04:17.380> are<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.190> can<00:04:18.459> reuse<00:04:18.940> your

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
were but they are so you can reuse your

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.949 
were but they are so you can reuse your
cam

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
cam

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.820 
cam
that's<00:04:20.709> what<00:04:20.889> these<00:04:21.130> are<00:04:22.350> called<00:04:23.350> your<00:04:23.500> cam

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
that's what these are called your cam

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700 
that's what these are called your cam
and<00:04:24.789> you<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.240> see<00:04:25.449> mine<00:04:25.720> is<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.960> little<00:04:26.139> dimple

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
and you can see mine is a little dimple

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.629 
and you can see mine is a little dimple
on<00:04:26.979> it<00:04:27.160> like<00:04:27.340> that

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
on it like that

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.070 
on it like that
so<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.960> reuse<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.479> just<00:04:31.479> put<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.780> put<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
so to reuse it I just put to put the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.999 
so to reuse it I just put to put the
square<00:04:32.530> into<00:04:33.430> there<00:04:34.330> so<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> modifies<00:04:35.560> it<00:04:35.800> so

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
square into there so it modifies it so

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.610 
square into there so it modifies it so
it<00:04:36.130> can<00:04:36.310> work<00:04:36.490> with<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.880> new<00:04:37.320> new<00:04:38.320> lock

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
it can work with the new new lock

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.460 
it can work with the new new lock
cylinder<00:04:39.449> because<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.600> old<00:04:40.780> one<00:04:41.050> used<00:04:41.289> a

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
cylinder because the old one used a

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.790 
cylinder because the old one used a
little<00:04:41.710> screw<00:04:42.370> on<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:43.300> back<00:04:43.479> here<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.139> the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
little screw on the back here and the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.670 
little screw on the back here and the
new<00:04:44.949> one<00:04:45.160> uses<00:04:45.490> a<00:04:45.520> bolt<00:04:45.850> so<00:04:46.350> that's<00:04:47.350> just<00:04:47.530> a

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
new one uses a bolt so that's just a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.800 
new one uses a bolt so that's just a
little<00:04:47.830> adapter<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:48.759> instead<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.240> using<00:04:49.479> the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
little adapter so instead of using the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.010 
little adapter so instead of using the
cam<00:04:50.259> that<00:04:50.530> came<00:04:50.710> with<00:04:50.949> it<00:04:50.979> I<00:04:51.479> can<00:04:52.479> use<00:04:52.720> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
cam that came with it I can use the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.420 
cam that came with it I can use the
original<00:04:53.340> cam<00:04:54.570> get<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.780> a<00:04:56.020> better<00:04:56.830> fit<00:04:57.250> in

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
original cam get to a better fit in

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.570 
original cam get to a better fit in
there<00:04:58.289> so<00:04:59.289> that's<00:04:59.470> pretty<00:04:59.710> smart<00:05:00.039> idea<00:05:00.250> of

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
there so that's pretty smart idea of

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.909 
there so that's pretty smart idea of
them<00:05:00.729> to<00:05:01.300> include<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:04.500> well<00:05:05.500> there<00:05:05.770> we<00:05:05.889> go

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
them to include that well there we go

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.980 
them to include that well there we go
all<00:05:06.280> installed<00:05:06.759> in<00:05:06.970> the<00:05:07.090> storage<00:05:07.449> bay<00:05:07.720> a

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
all installed in the storage bay a

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.219 
all installed in the storage bay a
really<00:05:08.590> quick<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.009> simple<00:05:09.220> mod<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:11.080> will

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
really quick and simple mod that will

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.450 
really quick and simple mod that will
increase<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.889> security<00:05:13.889> see<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:14.919> like<00:05:15.280> the
