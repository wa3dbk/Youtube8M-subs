not going to be able to get any better

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.320 
not going to be able to get any better
than<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.610> far<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.850> traction<00:00:39.239> is

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
than this as far as traction is

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.150 
than this as far as traction is
concerned<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:40.170> cushion<00:00:40.530> setup<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.129> very

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
concerned the cushion setup is very

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000 
concerned the cushion setup is very
minimal<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.150> is<00:00:42.330> adidas's<00:00:43.110> next<00:00:43.500> generation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
minimal this is adidas's next generation

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.880 
minimal this is adidas's next generation
of<00:00:44.100> pure<00:00:44.340> motion<00:00:44.730> pure<00:00:45.000> emotion<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.890> something

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
of pure motion pure emotion is something

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
of pure motion pure emotion is something
that<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.309> works<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.180> foot<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
that kind of works with your foot in

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.200 
that kind of works with your foot in
tandem<00:00:49.020> with<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.320> foot<00:00:49.940> giving<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> more

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
tandem with your foot giving you a more

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.060 
tandem with your foot giving you a more
natural<00:00:51.630> right<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.950> going

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
natural right so with that you're going

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.250 
natural right so with that you're going
to<00:00:53.160> receive<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:53.820> less<00:00:54.030> cushion<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:55.110> not

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to receive a lot less cushion it's not

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
to receive a lot less cushion it's not
necessarily<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> bad<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.579> enhances<00:00:57.059> your

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
necessarily a bad thing it enhances your

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.580 
necessarily a bad thing it enhances your
court<00:00:57.450> feel<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.870> gives<00:00:58.200> you<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> quicker

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
court feel and also gives you a quicker

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.819 
court feel and also gives you a quicker
first<00:00:58.860> step<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.700> it<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.660> depends<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
first step so it really depends on your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.709 
first step so it really depends on your
preference<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.520> people<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
preference some people actually like a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
preference some people actually like a
firmer<00:01:04.110> ride<00:01:04.440> which<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.280> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
firmer ride which this is going to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609 
firmer ride which this is going to
provide<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.509> other<00:01:06.720> people<00:01:06.930> might

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
provide you and then other people might

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.100 
provide you and then other people might
like<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.270> abundantly<00:01:09.270> cushioned<00:01:09.899> ride

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
like a more abundantly cushioned ride

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
like a more abundantly cushioned ride
like<00:01:10.500> something<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.860> an<00:01:11.039> air<00:01:11.190> max<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> zoom

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
like something like an air max or a zoom

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
like something like an air max or a zoom
setup<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.630> really<00:01:13.200> depends<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> want

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
setup so really depends on what you want

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
setup so really depends on what you want
but<00:01:14.160> if<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.580> low<00:01:14.789> profile<00:01:15.300> feel<00:01:15.600> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
but if you want that low profile feel is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.419 
but if you want that low profile feel is
going<00:01:16.289> to<00:01:16.350> give<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> excellent<00:01:16.860> court<00:01:17.220> feel

00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:17.429 
going to give you excellent court feel

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.719 
going to give you excellent court feel

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
and perfect maneuverability without any

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.919 
and perfect maneuverability without any
restriction<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.759> your<00:01:20.940> flex<00:01:21.209> range<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.600> motion

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
restriction on your flex range of motion

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.779 
restriction on your flex range of motion
this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.410> definitely<00:01:22.800> it<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.280> materials

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
this is definitely it the materials

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.690 
this is definitely it the materials
along<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.209> upper<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.800> fantastic<00:01:25.800> it's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
along the upper are fantastic it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.639 
along the upper are fantastic it's
basically<00:01:27.179> what<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.539> call<00:01:27.720> TECHFIT<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> it's

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
basically what they call TECHFIT so it's

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.589 
basically what they call TECHFIT so it's
kind<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:28.830> like<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> spandex<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.729> neoprene<00:01:30.209> type

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
kind of like a spandex or neoprene type

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:32.839 
kind of like a spandex or neoprene type
of<00:01:30.780> upper<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.289> then<00:01:31.709> it<00:01:31.830> has<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> synthetic

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
of upper and then it has a synthetic

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.749 
of upper and then it has a synthetic
plastic<00:01:33.420> overlay<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.229> add<00:01:34.500> rigidness<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
plastic overlay to add rigidness and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.600 
plastic overlay to add rigidness and
support<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.860> personally<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.890> never<00:01:38.130> had<00:01:38.580> a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
support so personally I never had a

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010 
support so personally I never had a
problem<00:01:38.849> with<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.149> whatsoever<00:01:39.450> actually

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
problem with it whatsoever actually

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.540 
problem with it whatsoever actually
really<00:01:40.289> like<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> way<00:01:40.679> that<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.920> feels<00:01:41.160> it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
really like the way that it feels it

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.279 
really like the way that it feels it
doesn't<00:01:42.030> give<00:01:42.119> any<00:01:42.300> hot<00:01:42.450> spots<00:01:42.599> or<00:01:42.990> anything

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
doesn't give any hot spots or anything

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.690 
doesn't give any hot spots or anything
like<00:01:43.319> that<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.130> very<00:01:44.310> very<00:01:44.520> comfortable

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
like that and it's very very comfortable

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.719 
like that and it's very very comfortable
so<00:01:45.319> materials<00:01:46.319> overall<00:01:46.679> I'd<00:01:46.920> say<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.369> great

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so materials overall I'd say are great

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.279 
so materials overall I'd say are great
as<00:01:47.910> far<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.300> their<00:01:48.509> fit<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.810> concerned<00:01:49.140> they

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
as far as their fit is concerned they

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.139 
as far as their fit is concerned they
fit<00:01:49.500> true<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.740> size<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.429> i<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.940> that<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
fit true to size and i think that the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.690 
fit true to size and i think that the
lockdown<00:01:51.539> is<00:01:51.720> perfectly<00:01:52.170> fine<00:01:52.440> for<00:01:53.039> foot

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
lockdown is perfectly fine for foot

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.219 
lockdown is perfectly fine for foot
lockdown<00:01:54.090> as<00:01:54.239> great<00:01:54.479> heel<00:01:54.780> lock<00:01:54.989> down<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
lockdown as great heel lock down is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
lockdown as great heel lock down is
great<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.800> sprint<00:01:56.160> frame<00:01:56.489> in<00:01:56.640> there<00:01:56.789> for

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
great you have sprint frame in there for

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020 
great you have sprint frame in there for
some<00:01:57.959> extra<00:01:58.259> support<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:58.830> that's<00:01:59.819> basically

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
some extra support and that's basically

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.550 
some extra support and that's basically
what<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> whole<00:02:00.569> shoe<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.840> built<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
what the whole shoe is built on is the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 
what the whole shoe is built on is the
chassis<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.280> it's<00:02:02.940> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.239> literally<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
chassis so it's kind of like literally a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.229 
chassis so it's kind of like literally a
frame<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.860> i<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.399> everything<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.030> this

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
frame so i think that everything in this

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:07.969 
frame so i think that everything in this
shoe<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.569> far<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.899> fit<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.590> support<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
shoe as far as fit and support is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
shoe as far as fit and support is
concern<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> perfectly<00:02:08.880> fine<00:02:09.119> ventilation<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
concern is perfectly fine ventilation is

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.559 
concern is perfectly fine ventilation is
very<00:02:10.470> nice<00:02:10.679> because<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.060> TECHFIT

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
very nice because it is that TECHFIT

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.170 
very nice because it is that TECHFIT
type<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:13.050> spandex<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:14.099> material<00:02:14.640> it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
type of spandex like material it's

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.699 
type of spandex like material it's
definitely<00:02:15.390> well<00:02:15.810> ventilated<00:02:16.110> allows<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> lot

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
definitely well ventilated allows a lot

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.410 
definitely well ventilated allows a lot
of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> heat<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.280> escape<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.060> doesn't<00:02:18.300> allow

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
of the heat to escape it doesn't allow

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.479 
of the heat to escape it doesn't allow
for<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.690> lot<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.870> airflow<00:02:19.349> which<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:20.340> something

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
for a lot of airflow which is something

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.759 
for a lot of airflow which is something
like<00:02:20.610> mesh<00:02:21.000> would<00:02:21.180> do<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.439> keep<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.620> in

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
like mesh would do so just keep that in

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.520 
like mesh would do so just keep that in
mind<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:23.879> a

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
mind it's not a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.530 
mind it's not a
entrance<00:02:24.770> at<00:02:25.100> all<00:02:25.220> it's<00:02:25.550> actually<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> good

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
entrance at all it's actually a good

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.600 
entrance at all it's actually a good
thing<00:02:26.600> tech<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.350> as<00:02:28.069> a<00:02:28.160> material

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
thing tech that as a as a material

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.910 
thing tech that as a as a material
that's<00:02:28.670> actually<00:02:28.910> moisture-wicking<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.990> it's

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
that's actually moisture-wicking so it's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.260 
that's actually moisture-wicking so it's
not<00:02:31.069> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.459> create<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.940> lot<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.090> moisture

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
not going to create a lot of moisture

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.150 
not going to create a lot of moisture
within<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.930> shoe<00:02:33.170> because<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
within that shoe because of that so I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
within that shoe because of that so I
think<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.060> ventilation<00:02:35.690> was<00:02:35.840> all<00:02:36.020> right<00:02:36.230> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
think the ventilation was all right it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.530 
think the ventilation was all right it
wasn't<00:02:36.920> crazy<00:02:37.400> or<00:02:37.700> anything<00:02:37.730> like<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> but

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
wasn't crazy or anything like that but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.270 
wasn't crazy or anything like that but
definitely<00:02:38.959> wasn't<00:02:39.110> bad<00:02:39.380> as<00:02:39.590> far<00:02:39.860> as<00:02:39.950> support

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
definitely wasn't bad as far as support

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.890 
definitely wasn't bad as far as support
goes<00:02:40.459> once<00:02:40.760> again<00:02:41.030> kind<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.420> ties<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.780> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
goes once again kind of ties in the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.990 
goes once again kind of ties in the
whole<00:02:41.930> fit<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:43.130> whole<00:02:43.220> shoe<00:02:43.459> fits<00:02:43.790> like<00:02:43.940> a

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
whole fit the whole shoe fits like a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.550 
whole fit the whole shoe fits like a
glove<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.810> support<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.260> going<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.440> be

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
glove so the support is going to be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.860 
glove so the support is going to be
awesome<00:02:45.739> your<00:02:46.190> low<00:02:46.370> profile<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.150> closer<00:02:47.660> to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
awesome your low profile and closer to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.970 
awesome your low profile and closer to
the<00:02:47.959> ground<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.440> you're<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:48.650> going<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.860> have

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the ground so you're not going to have

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.710 
the ground so you're not going to have
any<00:02:49.160> instability<00:02:49.520> issues<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.569> also

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
any instability issues and then you also

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.510 
any instability issues and then you also
have<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.020> sprint<00:02:51.230> frame<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:51.800> provides

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
have the sprint frame which provides

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.870 
have the sprint frame which provides
most<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.170> additional<00:02:54.170> support<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.880> you're

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
most of the additional support so you're

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.550 
most of the additional support so you're
really<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.270> going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.840> any<00:02:56.989> issues<00:02:57.380> as

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
really not going to have any issues as

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.650 
really not going to have any issues as
far<00:02:57.739> as<00:02:57.830> support<00:02:58.160> is<00:02:58.220> concerned<00:02:58.660> it's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
far as support is concerned it's

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.500 
far as support is concerned it's
actually<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.410> perfect<00:03:01.220> setup<00:03:01.430> for<00:03:01.550> guards<00:03:02.269> if

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
