answer<00:01:12.229> couplings<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:12.950> stuff<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.400> could<00:01:13.580> have

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
answer couplings and stuff I could have

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.500 
answer couplings and stuff I could have
made<00:01:13.790> it<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.940> little<00:01:14.060> easier<00:01:14.360> with<00:01:14.450> less

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
made it a little easier with less

welding<00:01:15.020> if<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.200> would<00:01:15.320> have<00:01:15.440> thought<00:01:16.130> this

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
welding if I would have thought this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.650 
welding if I would have thought this
through<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.640> little<00:01:16.760> better<00:01:17.030> when<00:01:17.210> I<00:01:17.270> was<00:01:17.390> doing

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
through a little better when I was doing

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.880 
through a little better when I was doing
it<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:17.990> oh<00:01:18.140> well<00:01:19.990> um<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.380> know<00:01:21.470> just<00:01:21.680> it's

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
it but oh well um you know just it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.170 
it but oh well um you know just it's
three<00:01:22.130> inch<00:01:22.250> flex<00:01:22.550> pipe

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
three inch flex pipe

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.990 
three inch flex pipe
I<00:01:23.590> know<00:01:24.590> it's<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:24.920> two<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> half<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.850> should

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
I know it's just two and a half I should

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.450 
I know it's just two and a half I should
say<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.869> it's<00:01:30.140> it's<00:01:30.470> mostly<00:01:30.710> done<00:01:31.160> I<00:01:31.190> need<00:01:31.369> to

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
go over the welding those welds ooh

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.240 
go over the welding those welds ooh
at<00:01:34.790> leaks<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.690> got<00:01:36.290> a<00:01:36.320> seal<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:36.800> those<00:01:36.950> holes

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
at leaks and I got a seal in those holes

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.740 
at leaks and I got a seal in those holes
and<00:01:37.490> weld<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.850> pipes<00:01:38.060> down<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.540> Box

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
and weld the pipes down to the Box

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.040 
and weld the pipes down to the Box
better<00:01:39.050> but<00:01:40.119> using<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.240> Waller<00:01:41.600> my<00:01:41.840> dad's

right to welder the if I was using

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.639 
right to welder the if I was using
our<00:01:52.610> Miller<00:01:52.880> welder<00:01:53.330> over<00:01:54.110> at<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.290> shop<00:01:54.500> but

we<00:01:54.740> don't<00:01:54.860> have<00:01:54.920> any<00:01:55.070> wire<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.280> could<00:01:55.610> well<00:01:55.790> just

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
we don't have any wire I could well just

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.740 
we don't have any wire I could well just
fine<00:01:56.180> with<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:56.810> this<00:01:57.710> one<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:59.390> can't

what I do I can clean the metal up

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.000 
what I do I can clean the metal up
perfect<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.320> with<00:02:03.470> all<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.650> settings

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
perfect and with all the settings

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.260

damn<00:02:05.450> thing<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.720> weld<00:02:05.900> rate<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:07.010> all<00:02:07.130> looks

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
damn thing to weld rate so it all looks

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.120 
damn thing to weld rate so it all looks
like<00:02:07.490> hell<00:02:08.019> but<00:02:09.019> whatever<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.619> working<00:02:09.950> for

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
like hell but whatever it's working for

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.990 
like hell but whatever it's working for
now<00:02:10.269> of<00:02:11.269> course<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.040> side<00:02:13.310> note<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.580> did<00:02:13.670> blow

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
now of course on a side note I did blow

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.120 
now of course on a side note I did blow
up<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.810> upper<00:02:14.989> rad<00:02:15.170> was<00:02:15.440> blew<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.799> when<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:15.980> got

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
up the upper rad was blew out when I got

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:25.380 
up the upper rad was blew out when I got
home<00:02:22.600> doesn't<00:02:23.600> really<00:02:23.810> sound<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.230> great

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
home doesn't really sound that great

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.130 
home doesn't really sound that great
basically<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.480> sounds<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.750> an<00:02:26.900> S<00:02:26.989> came

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
basically this sounds like an S came

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.229 
basically this sounds like an S came
with<00:02:27.230> no<00:02:27.320> muffler<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.549> since<00:02:28.790> I've<00:02:28.940> got<00:02:29.120> all

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
with no muffler and since I've got all

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.670 
with no muffler and since I've got all
these<00:02:29.330> leaks<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.810> stuff<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.230> sound<00:02:30.530> doesn't

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
these leaks and stuff that sound doesn't

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.199 
these leaks and stuff that sound doesn't
really<00:02:30.950> come<00:02:31.160> out<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> pipe<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:31.820> well<00:02:31.970> plus

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
really come out the pipe so well plus

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.330 
really come out the pipe so well plus
they're<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:32.570> big<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.049> it's<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.130> lot<00:02:34.280> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
they're so big that it's not a lot of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.509 
they're so big that it's not a lot of
movement<00:02:34.580> coming<00:02:34.910> out<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.180> them<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:37.400> a

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
movement coming out of them it's a

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.949 
movement coming out of them it's a
little<00:02:37.580> different<00:02:37.880> it's<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.269> too<00:02:38.480> low<00:02:38.660> it's

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
little different it's not too low it's

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.810 
little different it's not too low it's
not<00:02:39.140> quiet<00:02:39.769> but<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:42.040> had<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.130> cut<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.340> box<00:02:43.610> back

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
not quiet but I had to cut the box back

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
not quiet but I had to cut the box back
a<00:02:43.880> little<00:02:44.000> farther<00:02:44.120> cuz<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.420> couldn't<00:02:44.660> get<00:02:44.750> the
