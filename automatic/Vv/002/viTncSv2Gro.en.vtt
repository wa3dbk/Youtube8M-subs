dressing is made up of a little olive

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
dressing is made up of a little olive
oil<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.619> around<00:01:16.759> three<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:17.790> four

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

tablespoons<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
tablespoons and then a little bit of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.920 
tablespoons and then a little bit of
sherry<00:01:21.869> vinegar<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.880> couple<00:01:23.880> tablespoons<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
sherry vinegar a couple tablespoons I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
sherry vinegar a couple tablespoons I
kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.619> pretty<00:01:26.009> acidic<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.939> sour

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
kind of like it pretty acidic and sour

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.170 
kind of like it pretty acidic and sour
kind<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> brightens<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.950> food<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> probably

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
kind of brightens up food so I probably

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
kind of brightens up food so I probably
put<00:01:30.360> maybe<00:01:30.600> three<00:01:30.990> tablespoons<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:33.000> bit

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of honey and a little bit of mustard the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.569 
of honey and a little bit of mustard the
honey<00:01:36.990> suite<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
honey suite is it just a little bit and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.200 
honey suite is it just a little bit and
the<00:01:38.700> mustard<00:01:39.530> actually<00:01:40.880> emulsifies<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the mustard actually emulsifies the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
the mustard actually emulsifies the
dressing<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.500> nice<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:45.799> make
