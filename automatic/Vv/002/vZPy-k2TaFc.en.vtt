Cornell<00:00:00.420> University<00:00:00.450> and<00:00:01.110> UCLA<00:00:02.100> decided<00:00:02.790> to

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
Cornell University and UCLA decided to

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.749 
Cornell University and UCLA decided to
figure<00:00:03.149> out<00:00:03.330> whether<00:00:04.049> or<00:00:04.200> not<00:00:04.380> people<00:00:04.890> with

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
figure out whether or not people with

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.419 
figure out whether or not people with
college<00:00:06.089> degrees<00:00:06.299> are<00:00:07.049> more<00:00:07.589> likely<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.130> get

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
college degrees are more likely to get

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.919 
college degrees are more likely to get
married<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.090> what<00:00:09.360> they<00:00:09.480> did<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.809> they

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
married and what they did is they

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.020 
married and what they did is they
specifically<00:00:10.559> looked<00:00:10.800> at<00:00:10.920> people<00:00:11.309> who<00:00:11.519> have<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
specifically looked at people who have a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.970 
specifically looked at people who have a
disadvantaged<00:00:12.870> background<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.650> they<00:00:13.769> come

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
disadvantaged background so they come

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.829 
disadvantaged background so they come
from<00:00:14.160> low-income<00:00:14.549> families<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.690> they

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
from low-income families but they

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.420 
from low-income families but they
managed<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> college<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.310> an

managed to go to college and get an

managed to go to college and get an
education<00:00:17.520> anyway<00:00:18.390> what's<00:00:18.810> interesting<00:00:19.080> is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
education anyway what's interesting is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.320 
education anyway what's interesting is
among<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.890> groups<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> people<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.970> very

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
among these groups of people it's very

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
among these groups of people it's very
unlikely<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.020> they<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.560> married

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
unlikely that they get married

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.859 
unlikely that they get married
well<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.400> unlikely<00:00:23.910> but<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.210> actually<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
well not unlikely but it's actually the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.080 
well not unlikely but it's actually the
rates<00:00:25.109> are<00:00:25.320> lower<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> comes<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.970> them

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
rates are lower when it comes to them

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
rates are lower when it comes to them
getting<00:00:27.330> married<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.619> difficult

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
getting married because it's difficult

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.759 
getting married because it's difficult
for<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.330> marry<00:00:30.960> someone<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.590> comes

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
for them to marry someone that comes

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.590 
for them to marry someone that comes
from<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> privileged<00:00:32.610> background<00:00:33.180> because

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
from a privileged background because

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.819 
from a privileged background because
usually<00:00:33.809> people<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.469> privileged

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
usually people from privileged

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.590 
usually people from privileged
backgrounds<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
backgrounds don't want to do that and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.080 
backgrounds don't want to do that and
they<00:00:37.260> don't<00:00:37.440> want<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> marry<00:00:37.950> down<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.910> who

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
they don't want to marry down people who

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
they don't want to marry down people who
are<00:00:39.239> from<00:00:39.540> disadvantaged<00:00:40.500> backgrounds<00:00:40.710> but

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
are from disadvantaged backgrounds but

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
are from disadvantaged backgrounds but
did<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.460> get<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> college<00:00:42.149> degree<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
did not get a college degree so it's a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770 
did not get a college degree so it's a
really<00:00:44.040> interesting<00:00:44.190> finding<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.660> know

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
really interesting finding and you know

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
really interesting finding and you know
there<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.110> another<00:00:46.289> study<00:00:47.100> done<00:00:47.370> by<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.730> Pew

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
there was another study done by the Pew

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.779 
there was another study done by the Pew
Research<00:00:48.390> Center<00:00:48.719> back<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> 2010<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.219> they

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
Research Center back in 2010 and they

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.069 
Research Center back in 2010 and they
claimed<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.690> college<00:00:52.050> degree

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
claimed that if you get a college degree

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.350 
claimed that if you get a college degree
you're<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.739> likely<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.460> married<00:00:53.879> but

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you're more likely to get married but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
you're more likely to get married but
it's<00:00:54.539> obviously<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> case<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.010> every

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's obviously not the case for every

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
it's obviously not the case for every
group<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.760> people<00:00:57.390> we're<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.780> talking<00:00:58.109> about

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
group of people we're not talking about

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.130 
group of people we're not talking about
you<00:00:58.620> know<00:00:58.710> 10%<00:00:59.010> less<00:00:59.550> likely<00:00:59.910> for<00:00:59.940> men<00:01:00.719> who<00:01:01.050> are

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
you know 10% less likely for men who are

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
you know 10% less likely for men who are
disadvantaged<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> go<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> college<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.460> 40%

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
disadvantaged to go to college it's 40%

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
disadvantaged to go to college it's 40%
less<00:01:03.840> likely<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> huge<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
less likely which is huge so it's like

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.219 
less likely which is huge so it's like
you<00:01:05.880> said<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> mean<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:07.049> who<00:01:07.140> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
you said that I mean people who are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.109 
you said that I mean people who are
well-off<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.860> gonna<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.490> less<00:01:08.700> likely<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
well-off are gonna be less likely to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.969 
well-off are gonna be less likely to
want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.330> marry<00:01:09.540> them<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.020> also<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.799> don't

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
want to marry them and also they don't

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.440 
want to marry them and also they don't
have<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> lot<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.369> people<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> same<00:01:12.060> class

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
have a lot of people of the same class

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
have a lot of people of the same class
in<00:01:12.720> college<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> them<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.590> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in college with them because it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
in college with them because it's
difficult<00:01:14.070> for<00:01:14.340> those<00:01:14.490> people<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
difficult for those people to go to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.830 
difficult for those people to go to
college<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.080> mean<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.860> know<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.220> my<00:01:17.400> own

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
college so I mean I know from my own

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.609 
college so I mean I know from my own
point<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> view<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.290> come<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.040> somewhat

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
point of view I come from a somewhat

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.130 
point of view I come from a somewhat
disadvantaged<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.900> definitely

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
disadvantaged and it's definitely

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.570 
disadvantaged and it's definitely
something<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> think<00:01:25.650> about<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.400> people

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
something that I think about the people

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
something that I think about the people
go<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> college<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.869> from<00:01:28.290> these

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
go to college you know from these

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
go to college you know from these
disadvantaged<00:01:29.220> backgrounds<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.820> want

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
disadvantaged backgrounds so they want

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
disadvantaged backgrounds so they want
like<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> American<00:01:31.110> Dream<00:01:31.350> they<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
like the American Dream they want the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.140 
like the American Dream they want the
money<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.189> want<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> job<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
money they want the job they want the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
money they want the job they want the
stereotypical<00:01:33.509> family<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.259> with<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
stereotypical family and with the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.560 
stereotypical family and with the
economy<00:01:35.189> being<00:01:35.369> bad<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.820> difficult<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> get

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
economy being bad it's difficult to get

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
economy being bad it's difficult to get
some<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> economic<00:01:37.500> portions<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
some of the economic portions of that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.700 
some of the economic portions of that
but<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.670> least<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.409> idea

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
but at the very least you want that idea

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
but at the very least you want that idea
of<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> family<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.640> sort<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> better

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
of like the family that's sort of better

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
of like the family that's sort of better
in<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.899> ways<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.200> your<00:01:43.290> own<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.860> think

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
in some ways in your own was I think

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
in some ways in your own was I think
it's<00:01:44.310> really<00:01:44.700> difficult<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> harder<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it's really difficult this is harder for

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
it's really difficult this is harder for
men<00:01:46.500> than<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.100> women<00:01:47.159> clearly<00:01:47.640> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
men than it is for women clearly you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.310 
men than it is for women clearly you
look<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> numbers<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.140> tell

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
look at the numbers and you can tell

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.230 
look at the numbers and you can tell
that<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.770> women<00:01:50.100> they're<00:01:50.280> 22<00:01:50.759> percent<00:01:51.119> less

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that with women they're 22 percent less

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.859 
that with women they're 22 percent less
likely<00:01:51.600> compared<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.320> those<00:01:52.500> who<00:01:53.220> came<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
likely compared to those who came from I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
likely compared to those who came from I
guess<00:01:55.290> wealthier<00:01:55.890> backgrounds<00:01:56.430> right<00:01:56.579> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
guess wealthier backgrounds right now

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
guess wealthier backgrounds right now
well<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.540> affects<00:01:57.630> men<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> higher<00:01:58.890> rate

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
well it affects men at a higher rate

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330 
well it affects men at a higher rate
because<00:01:59.640> I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.750> society<00:02:01.170> expects<00:02:01.920> men<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
because I think society expects men to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.609 
because I think society expects men to
have<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.759> lot<00:02:03.030> more<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> comes<00:02:04.380> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
have a lot more when it comes to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
have a lot more when it comes to
financial<00:02:05.340> stability<00:02:05.759> exactly<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.079> think

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
financial stability exactly so I think

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.290 
financial stability exactly so I think
someone<00:02:07.890> who<00:02:08.160> comes<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.640> woman<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.270> instance

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
someone who comes a woman for instance

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.050 
someone who comes a woman for instance
who<00:02:09.720> comes<00:02:09.959> from<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.530> wealthy<00:02:10.770> background<00:02:11.060> even

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
who comes from a wealthy background even

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.030 
who comes from a wealthy background even
if<00:02:12.150> she<00:02:12.300> has<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> same

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
if she has the same

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.640 
if she has the same
education<00:02:13.730> as<00:02:13.969> a<00:02:14.030> guy<00:02:14.420> she'll<00:02:15.049> probably<00:02:15.230> look

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
education as a guy she'll probably look

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.649 
education as a guy she'll probably look
at<00:02:15.769> his<00:02:15.950> background<00:02:16.189> and<00:02:16.610> be<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.879> and<00:02:17.569> I

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
at his background and be like and I

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.209 
at his background and be like and I
don't<00:02:17.780> know<00:02:17.959> he<00:02:18.170> comes<00:02:18.290> from<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> poor<00:02:18.739> family<00:02:18.799> I

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
don't know he comes from a poor family I

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.440 
don't know he comes from a poor family I
don't<00:02:19.400> know<00:02:19.489> if<00:02:19.579> I<00:02:19.640> would<00:02:19.760> consider<00:02:19.939> that<00:02:20.239> or

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
don't know if I would consider that or

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.880 
don't know if I would consider that or
bring<00:02:20.629> that<00:02:20.750> into<00:02:21.019> my<00:02:21.170> family<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:21.739> is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
bring that into my family which is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.130 
bring that into my family which is
absurd<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.969> that's<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.480> way<00:02:23.569> society

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
absurd but that's just the way society

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.099 
absurd but that's just the way society
is<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:24.500> don't<00:02:24.620> talk<00:02:24.980> about<00:02:25.390> class<00:02:26.390> anymore<00:02:26.780> you

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
is we don't talk about class anymore you

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.539 
is we don't talk about class anymore you
know<00:02:27.230> which<00:02:27.409> class<00:02:27.739> you're<00:02:27.980> in<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.159> how<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
know which class you're in and how it

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:29.860 
know which class you're in and how it
really<00:02:28.700> affects<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:29.150> but<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.390> does<00:02:29.689> affect

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
really affects you but it does affect

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.599 
really affects you but it does affect
you<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.379> it's<00:02:30.530> it's<00:02:30.829> horrible<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.459> that's

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
you and it's it's horrible that that's

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.599 
you and it's it's horrible that that's
the<00:02:31.790> case<00:02:32.019> yeah<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.049> think<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:34.129> lesson<00:02:34.489> from

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
the case yeah I think the lesson from

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.429 
the case yeah I think the lesson from
this<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:35.000> if<00:02:35.239> you're<00:02:35.359> a<00:02:35.390> guy<00:02:35.599> in<00:02:35.840> college<00:02:36.019> don't

not until you've locked the girl down
