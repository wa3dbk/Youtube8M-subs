agent<00:01:02.230> I<00:01:02.289> believe<00:01:02.589> so

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
agent I believe so

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.160 
agent I believe so
biofuel<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.089> available<00:01:04.690> e85<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.410> available<00:01:06.340> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.330 
biofuel is available e85 is available in
Scandinavian<00:01:08.170> countries<00:01:08.620> yeah<00:01:09.070> and

Scandinavian countries yeah and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.310 
Scandinavian countries yeah and
obviously<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.700> gives<00:01:09.790> more<00:01:10.000> power<00:01:10.270> yes<00:01:10.900> but

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
obviously it gives more power yes but

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.370 
obviously it gives more power yes but
when<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.220> go<00:01:12.400> kind<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.420> run<00:01:13.659> out<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:13.840> power<00:01:14.110> on

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
when you go kind of run out of power on

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.290 
when you go kind of run out of power on
the<00:01:14.500> streets<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:15.070> understand<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:16.030> he

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
seems any anything is possible if that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.400 
seems any anything is possible if that

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.660 
Europe and when you get to for example
the<00:01:40.180> NuvaRing<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.870> undo<00:01:41.620> your<00:01:41.830> your<00:01:42.160> roof<00:01:42.400> box

put your normal roof back on have a few

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.170 
put your normal roof back on have a few
laps<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.560> continue<00:01:44.950> down<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.130> France<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.090> it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
laps and continue down to France so it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.670 
laps and continue down to France so it
kind<00:01:46.390> of<00:01:46.480> puts<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.870> hypercar<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.560> new

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
kind of puts the hypercar in a new

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.560 
kind of puts the hypercar in a new
perspective<00:01:47.950> yes<00:01:48.760> it's<00:01:48.970> kind<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.360> gimmick

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
perspective yes it's kind of a gimmick

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.860 
perspective yes it's kind of a gimmick
but<00:01:49.900> it's<00:01:50.320> actually

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
but it's actually

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.900 
but it's actually
makes<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.680> possible<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.130> use<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.370> hypercar

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
makes it possible to use a hypercar

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.630 
makes it possible to use a hypercar
completely<00:01:54.390> different<00:01:54.860> as<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.010> say<00:01:56.280> luggage

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
completely different as you say luggage

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
completely different as you say luggage
space<00:01:56.910> is<00:01:57.120> always<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.450> problem<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.050> either

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
space is always a problem you either

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
space is always a problem you either
have<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.440> have<00:01:58.620> a<00:01:58.650> support<00:01:59.070> vehicle<00:01:59.250> another

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
have to have a support vehicle another

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.000 
have to have a support vehicle another
car<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.720> I<00:02:00.780> guess<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.530> puts<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.830> new

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
car so I guess this kind of puts a new

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.330 
car so I guess this kind of puts a new
slant<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.610> things<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.680> isn't<00:02:04.890> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
slant on things but also this isn't so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.570 
slant on things but also this isn't so
much<00:02:05.550> lighter<00:02:05.850> than<00:02:06.540> say<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.590> Veyron<00:02:08.040> or

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
much lighter than say the Veyron or

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.930 
much lighter than say the Veyron or
which<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.180> often<00:02:09.540> compared<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.790> what<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.880> we

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
which is often compared to what are we

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.270 
which is often compared to what are we
talking<00:02:12.330> about<00:02:12.510> performance<00:02:12.990> wise<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.950> it's

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
talking about performance wise well it's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.040 
talking about performance wise well it's
of<00:02:14.400> course<00:02:14.550> massive<00:02:15.090> performance<00:02:15.270> us<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.870> so

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
of course massive performance us it's so

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
of course massive performance us it's so
light<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.680> 1,100<00:02:17.640> 15<00:02:17.940> horsepower<00:02:18.480> and

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
light we have 1,100 15 horsepower and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.010 
light we have 1,100 15 horsepower and
1200<00:02:20.070> Newton<00:02:20.220> meters<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.730> torque<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.840> does

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
1200 Newton meters of torque so it does

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.680 
1200 Newton meters of torque so it does
0<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.740> 100<00:02:23.460> kilometers<00:02:23.790> per<00:02:23.820> hour<00:02:24.000> under<00:02:24.450> 3

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
0 to 100 kilometers per hour under 3

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.850 
0 to 100 kilometers per hour under 3
seconds<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.700> zero<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.880> 200<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.540> 7.5<00:02:28.320> seconds

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
seconds and zero to 200 in 7.5 seconds

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280 
seconds and zero to 200 in 7.5 seconds
so<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.760> massive<00:02:30.330> massive<00:02:30.570> performance

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
so it's just massive massive performance

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620 
so it's just massive massive performance
but<00:02:31.770> more<00:02:32.010> than<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.330> mean<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
but more than that it's it's I mean the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.930 
but more than that it's it's I mean the
driving<00:02:34.080> experience<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.950> very<00:02:35.160> well<00:02:35.400> refined

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
driving experience is very well refined

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660 
driving experience is very well refined
with<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.810> new<00:02:37.080> tuned<00:02:37.590> suspension<00:02:37.920> with<00:02:38.430> 3

with a new tuned suspension with 3
dampers<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.330> rear<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:40.110> got<00:02:40.320> electronic

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
dampers in the rear we got electronic

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.260 
dampers in the rear we got electronic
differential<00:02:41.870> latest<00:02:42.870> generation<00:02:43.320> ABS<00:02:44.270> so

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
differential latest generation ABS so

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.300 
differential latest generation ABS so
this<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.900> across<00:02:46.260> damper<00:02:46.770> here<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.190> we're

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
this is across damper here that we're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
this is across damper here that we're
seeing<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.910> here<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.270> like<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> strat<00:02:48.900> price

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
seeing but here is like a strat price

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.390 
seeing but here is like a strat price
that<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.530> normally<00:02:49.650> would<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that you normally would have on the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.100 
that you normally would have on the
front<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.880> car<00:02:51.090> you've<00:02:51.420> also<00:02:51.600> got<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.020> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
front of a car you've also got it on the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.410 
front of a car you've also got it on the
rear<00:02:52.320> or<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:53.550> something<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:53.970> start<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.270> see

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
rear or it's something you start to see

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.690 
rear or it's something you start to see
on<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> latest<00:02:55.080> generation<00:02:55.230> formula<00:02:55.920> cars<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
on the latest generation formula cars it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.630 
on the latest generation formula cars it
gives<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.200> third<00:02:58.200> dimension<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.980> setup

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
gives a third dimension of setup

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.220 
gives a third dimension of setup
possibilities<00:03:00.270> where<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> actually<00:03:00.660> link<00:03:01.050> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
possibilities where you actually link to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.110 
possibilities where you actually link to
left<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.860> wheel<00:03:02.160> with<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.790> spring

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
left to right and wheel with the spring

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.630 
left to right and wheel with the spring
and<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> shock<00:03:03.690> absorbers<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> unload<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and the shock absorbers to unload the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.729 
and the shock absorbers to unload the
normal<00:03:06.000> sets<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:07.110> springs<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.620> shock

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
normal sets of springs and shock

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.260 
normal sets of springs and shock
absorber<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> third<00:03:08.820> dimensional

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
absorber so you get a third dimensional

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.020 
absorber so you get a third dimensional
set<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:10.110> course<00:03:10.370> also<00:03:11.370> mostly<00:03:11.640> access

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
set up and of course also mostly access

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.060 
set up and of course also mostly access
a<00:03:12.060> very<00:03:12.330> good<00:03:12.540> anti<00:03:12.840> squat<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:13.440> needed

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
a very good anti squat when needed

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.640 
a very good anti squat when needed
right<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.390> car<00:03:15.570> doesn't<00:03:15.600> dig<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
right so the car doesn't dig in to the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.130 
right so the car doesn't dig in to the
same<00:03:16.830> degree<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.820> remains<00:03:18.510> slightly<00:03:18.780> more

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
same degree it remains slightly more

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.070 
same degree it remains slightly more
pliable<00:03:19.670> except<00:03:20.670> except<00:03:21.239> than<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.630> when<00:03:21.989> you

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
pliable except except than you when you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.900 
pliable except except than you when you
wanted<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.470> dig<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.830> for<00:03:23.010> example<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.489> takeoff

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
wanted to dig in for example for takeoff

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.310 
wanted to dig in for example for takeoff
then<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.270> bowing<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.780> set<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.170> actually

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
then the bowing is set so it actually

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.160 
then the bowing is set so it actually
does<00:03:25.680> sit<00:03:26.370> settle<00:03:26.850> down<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.390> take<00:03:27.600> off<00:03:27.750> very

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
does sit settle down and take off very

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.080 
does sit settle down and take off very
nicely<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.890> do<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.580> all<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.850> fancy

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
nicely and do you have all the fancy

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
nicely and do you have all the fancy
gizmos<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.140> launch<00:03:31.350> control<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.130> things

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
gizmos the launch control and things

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.790 
gizmos the launch control and things
like<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.730> or<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.120> this<00:03:33.300> over<00:03:33.630> brutal<00:03:34.170> race

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.820 
like that or is this over brutal race
tight<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:36.390> actually<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.870> anything<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.680> can

at<00:03:57.100> 1330<00:03:58.100> kilos<00:03:58.700> yeah<00:03:59.510> we've<00:03:59.720> been<00:03:59.750> looking<00:03:59.900> at

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
at 1330 kilos yeah we've been looking at

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.530 
at 1330 kilos yeah we've been looking at
the<00:04:00.740> aventador<00:04:01.520> obviously<00:04:02.000> that's<00:04:02.180> become

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the aventador obviously that's become

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.690 
the aventador obviously that's become
