00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.319
 you know the guys noticed that 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.600
 the last time I stopped running 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.519
 solo campaign in general that is in 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 absolutely in any game they want some 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.740
 exclusive and even there i know what is there 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.080
 awesome story it does not cling to me no 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.289
 already desires to run the company and 30 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.029
 hours to suffer in it in the end 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.130
 finish it and then go running again 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.140
 multiplayer in this video I want to tell 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 such a small story and share 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.310
 your opinion why the single player campaign 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
 not so much attracted 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.390
 no longer touches as it was in times 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 playstation 1 and playstation 2 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.820
 Well, spend a few reasons why 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 it happened let's remember 2006 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.270
 2007 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 it was then that the legendary fallout 2 came out 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.129
 the game focused on solitary 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.930
 campaign but the plot you tried to hook 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.579
 it is the plot because in principle on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 that moment you will have nothing more to unhook 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.280
 Now the situation has completely changed 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 Now every year there are new vidyuhi 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.420
 Consoles are new constantly and now 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 the creators are focusing specifically on 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.049
 the visual component that is on 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.150
 number of pixels on the number 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.590
 polygons on a single player campaign almost 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.420
 nobody looks remember the same 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 battlefield 4 battlefield 3 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.159
 there is a pretty typical single player campaign 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.200
 I don't want to offend anyone but 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.880
 seriously there is pretty typical single 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.220
 campaign but it only touches 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 at the shaft there everything breaks down and everything looks 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 awesome before this was not before 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.060
 focused on the storyline 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.490
 the campaign that you were involved and and those were 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.990
 absolutely don't care how many pixels there are and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 what are there polygons 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 fps until the stage is you do not 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 worried you were interested in studying 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.530
 from beginning to end everything is completely to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 understand the whole point now 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.880
 what we see battlefield cool of duty 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.610
 everything looks awesome I do not argue everything 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.640
 breaks but you stupidly run down the hall 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.009
 you run those you can not go anywhere for you 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.869
 already doing everything they put us dumb 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.119
 heels where you need to run you run 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.950
 like a monkey in a straight line and shoot at 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.829
 all that goes to you that is to say 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.659
 You even did not particularly interact 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.729
 all that all you need for you already 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.450
 made a point just click on 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.360
 drain 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 runs down and the mission is over earlier in 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.519
 2007, this was not done 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.530
 absolutely everything is different now absolutely 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.690
 too much competition because of this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.519
 every publisher is the same yubisoft either 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.680
 activision launch new call of duty 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.239
 and assassin's creed every year because 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.430
 this in the same assassin's creed 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.980
 single player campaign is becoming more 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.319
 and more linear increasingly predictable 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.810
 and all the action comes down to what you need 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.030
 drive to one place kill there 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.530
 somebody take some bag there and 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.140
 bring it to another place 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.220
 About call of duty, I generally keep quiet is stupid 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.110
 running down the hall 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.870
 kill bots that are in front of you 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.450
 appear and everything is on this whole plot in 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.579
 principle ends so here is understandable 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.230
 the fact is that from year to year the same 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.180
 assassin's creed same call of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.220
 duty he gets bored and basically i have 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.110
 exactly this situation happened to me 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.940
 no more interest assassin's creed 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.489
 no call of duty because all this already 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.000
 too predictable and understand perfectly 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.400
 the fact that 2005 was 2006 when I was still running 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.260
 playstation 1 and playstation 2 understandable 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.030
 i only ran into solo campaign 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.519
 because then the multiplayer was not so 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.560
 Here, in principle, almost everything I went to 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.410
 playstation 2 and playstation 1 i will remember 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.720
 and remember exactly for a long time I remember very well 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.569
 almost every mission why because in 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.519
 that moment I had a real wow effect 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.040
 I have not seen this before and it seemed to me 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.549
 something unusual now again 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 I repeat 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.230
 from the fact that every year you let out stupidly 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.299
 this is already accustomed you yourself can 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.069
 predict what will happen in this single 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.510
 campaign do you know how it will end 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.970
 our what missions there will be 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.850
 Now this is exactly the shaft effect 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.620
 which was not 2005 2006 from 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.280
 single player campaign i have created in 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.769
 call of duty 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.769
 and just recently ran to put your voice on 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.900
 x-box he ran championships ran match 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.639
 for money and know almost every match 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.980
 almost every championship I remember 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.829
 I remember well how we ran I remember 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.169
 how we shot how we shouted when 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.019
 did you win merged match why 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.090
 because they really carry such matches 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.040
 some goal yes it is clear that you 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.709
 not a million bucks win but even 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.689
 there is a win for 10 20 bucks you 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.200
 you will remember him anyway because 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:18.940
 it is at least something 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.700
 do you understand what they are running against 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.520
 you people they also sweat also want 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.370
 win and at this moment you have a maximum 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.340
 emotion appears why because you 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.920
 completely focused and you give everything 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 strength to win single 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.520
 Campaign for this you just will not 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.770
 Many of course can not say about 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.660
 what here to run there any 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.670
 mission put it on mac strongly on 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.710
 maximum complexity and you will be so 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.260
 it's hard so what 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.270
 will kill not in this mission before i start again 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.190
 Well I won't lose anything from it. 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.800
 everything will remain just as the mission will be 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.140
 repeat and repeat until you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.900
 you can finally figure out where that is 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.060
 make someone kill in call of duty in that 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.400
 I got a completely different feeling because 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.320
 that if they kill you, then you all have 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.370
 no more attempt all you leaked 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.740
 gave my money 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.410
 about some American or European there 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.910
 and he's happy you're angry at that 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.380
 in such moments you appear 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.110
 maximum of emotions 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.970
 now here i'm waiting witch 3 can 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.450
 explain why witcher 3 appeared 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.760
 very interesting mode called him but 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.260
 this mode is no longer a level of difficulty and 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.690
 I think is called once whether 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.090
 maximum or something else as it is in general the essence 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.870
 that if you are killed then you are no longer 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.000
 appear 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.040
 and that's it in this game you should be 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.870
 reality is focused and surrender 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.560
 the game completely because if you 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.060
 kill yes you start all over again 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.220
 absolutely everything all over again that is you have no 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.920
 another attempt so it seems to me 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.530
 if companies were not so light 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.030
 not so predictable understandable 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.160
 a single player campaign would run 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.540
 many more people now 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.960
 most people are preferred 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.390
 of the same to put a battlefield 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.640
 I understand such people very well because 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.850
 you don't get a single campaign 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.710
 such fun fun as you get 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.870
 multiplayer here is such a small 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.730
 I got the story I hope you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.710
 Like this video because 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.750
 if there are many likes such stories i 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.760
 I will release more often and of course 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.130
 subscribe to my channel there is not yet 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.130
 subscribe to all bye and good luck
