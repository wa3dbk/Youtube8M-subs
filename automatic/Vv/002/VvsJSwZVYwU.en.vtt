what we've done is to challenge
everything<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.380> hope<00:00:04.830> that<00:00:05.100> there's<00:00:05.310> plenty

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
everything we hope that there's plenty

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.660 
everything we hope that there's plenty
of<00:00:06.120> innovation<00:00:06.720> where<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:07.859> not<00:00:08.040> innovative

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
of innovation where it's not innovative

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.150 
of innovation where it's not innovative
it's<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:09.000> least<00:00:09.179> state-of-the-art<00:00:10.170> we've

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's at least state-of-the-art we've

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.830 
it's at least state-of-the-art we've
reviewed<00:00:11.490> everything<00:00:11.790> our<00:00:12.030> design<00:00:12.389> targets

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
reviewed everything our design targets

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.539 
reviewed everything our design targets
the<00:00:12.960> way<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.530> things<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.889> structure<00:00:14.429> of

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
the way we do things the structure of

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.880 
the way we do things the structure of
the<00:00:14.670> team<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.540> makes<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.049> Fuss<00:00:16.320> rally<00:00:16.650> car

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the team what makes a Fuss rally car

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
the team what makes a Fuss rally car
we've<00:00:17.070> challenged<00:00:17.430> everything<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.420> hopefully

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
we've challenged everything so hopefully

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.870 
we've challenged everything so hopefully
you'll<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.199> when<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.949> car<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.730> know

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you'll see when the car you know

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.320 
you'll see when the car you know
surfaces<00:00:21.510> you'll<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.369> again<00:00:23.939> what

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
surfaces you'll see not just again what

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.580 
surfaces you'll see not just again what
we<00:00:24.420> hope<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:24.570> be<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> very<00:00:24.990> good<00:00:25.170> carving

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
we hope will be a very good carving

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.050 
we hope will be a very good carving
you'll<00:00:25.710> see<00:00:25.859> things<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:26.939> or

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
you'll see things that you know one or

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.189 
you'll see things that you know one or
two<00:00:27.150> things<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.720> won't<00:00:27.840> have<00:00:27.990> seen

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
two things that you won't have seen

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.759 
two things that you won't have seen
before<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:29.250> relatively<00:00:30.060> easy<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.869> make<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
before it's relatively easy to make a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.970 
before it's relatively easy to make a
very<00:00:32.309> strong<00:00:32.700> reliable<00:00:33.690> car<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.829> it's

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
very strong reliable car and it's

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.430 
very strong reliable car and it's
relatively<00:00:35.610> easy<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.000> make<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.570> fast<00:00:37.140> car

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
relatively easy to make a very fast car

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.549 
relatively easy to make a very fast car
what<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.879> difficult<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> hit<00:00:40.110> just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
what is really difficult is to hit just

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
what is really difficult is to hit just
the<00:00:40.649> right<00:00:40.800> balance<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:41.579> where<00:00:42.090> you've<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the right balance so where you've got a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
the right balance so where you've got a
car<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.629> faster<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.410> anybody<00:00:43.559> else's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
car that's faster than anybody else's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
car that's faster than anybody else's
and<00:00:44.219> more<00:00:44.879> reliable<00:00:45.270> than<00:00:45.390> anybody<00:00:45.750> else<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
and more reliable than anybody else is

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.380 
and more reliable than anybody else is
that's<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.590> bloody<00:00:47.250> difficult<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.940> rally

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
that's really bloody difficult a rally

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.270 
that's really bloody difficult a rally
