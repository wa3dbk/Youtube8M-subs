take a regular piece of paper you have

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.250 
take a regular piece of paper you have
your<00:00:09.650> original<00:00:09.740> two<00:00:10.250> existing<00:00:10.700> holes<00:00:11.170> put<00:00:12.170> it

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
your original two existing holes put it

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.100 
your original two existing holes put it
on<00:00:12.350> the<00:00:12.440> inside<00:00:12.559> so<00:00:12.980> you<00:00:13.070> can<00:00:13.219> trace<00:00:13.460> it<00:00:13.730> and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
on the inside so you can trace it and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.660 
on the inside so you can trace it and
you're<00:00:15.110> gonna<00:00:15.230> transfer<00:00:15.530> these<00:00:15.830> holes<00:00:16.100> about

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
you're gonna transfer these holes about

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:33.040 
you're gonna transfer these holes about
it<00:00:16.850> eight<00:00:17.119> inches<00:00:17.420> straight<00:00:17.690> down<00:00:31.810> so<00:00:32.810> you<00:00:32.900> can

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
it eight inches straight down so you can

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.529 
it eight inches straight down so you can
see<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.380> hole<00:00:39.789> these<00:00:40.789> are<00:00:40.940> reference<00:00:41.329> holes

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
see the hole these are reference holes

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.050 
see the hole these are reference holes
we're<00:00:42.110> gonna<00:00:42.199> be<00:00:42.410> taping<00:00:42.829> it<00:00:42.920> down

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.760 

we'd<00:00:49.060> be<00:00:49.180> taking<00:00:49.480> our<00:00:49.570> measuring<00:00:49.930> tape<00:00:50.170> the

inches<00:00:54.489> straight<00:00:55.300> down<00:00:55.570> just<00:00:58.079> take<00:00:59.079> your

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
inches straight down just take your

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.890 
inches straight down just take your
template<00:00:59.650> that<00:00:59.890> you<00:01:00.010> just<00:01:00.220> made<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.809> a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
template that you just made and a

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:18.930 
template that you just made and a
referencing<00:01:02.530> right<00:01:02.680> there

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.130 

roughly<00:01:19.940> score<00:01:20.330> that's<00:01:20.540> why<00:01:20.690> we're<00:01:20.840> gonna<00:01:20.930> be

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
roughly score that's why we're gonna be

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.000 
roughly score that's why we're gonna be
done<00:01:21.350> drilling<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.890> holes

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.859 

but<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.550> lined<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:31.580> ahead<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:33.030> uh

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.800 

usually<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.899> use<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.549> bottom<00:01:40.720> indentation<00:01:41.720> on

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.309

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.920 

and<00:02:41.580> bend<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.670> back<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:46.360> you're<00:02:46.540> at<00:02:46.660> 90

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
and bend it back now you're at 90

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.400 
and bend it back now you're at 90
degrees<00:02:48.540> you're<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.840> forming<00:02:50.260> this

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
degrees you're going to be forming this

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.120 
degrees you're going to be forming this
for<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.980> rod<00:02:51.640> into<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.420> Z<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.830> actually

with a vise in hand this is the kind of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.730 
with a vise in hand this is the kind of
angle<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.280> want<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.110> basically<00:03:10.500> going

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
angle you want this is basically going

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.500 
angle you want this is basically going
to<00:03:10.830> slide<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.210> be<00:03:12.300> able<00:03:12.360> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to slide you're going to be able to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.800 
to slide you're going to be able to
slide<00:03:12.720> your<00:03:13.550> actuator<00:03:14.550> through<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.420> original

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
slide your actuator through the original

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.150 
slide your actuator through the original
hole<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.320> it's<00:03:17.160> gonna<00:03:17.250> work<00:03:17.460> like<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.700> chance

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
hole and it's gonna work like a chance

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.260 
hole and it's gonna work like a chance
now<00:03:20.160> you're<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.430> going<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.610> cut<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:21.030> to

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
now you're just going to cut it to

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.020 
now you're just going to cut it to
roughly<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:21.750> 8<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> 10<00:03:22.380> inches<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.030> then

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
roughly about 8 to 10 inches and then

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.570 
roughly about 8 to 10 inches and then
you're<00:03:24.180> going<00:03:24.300> to<00:03:24.360> attach<00:03:24.660> this<00:03:25.290> top<00:03:25.620> part<00:03:25.890> to

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
you're going to attach this top part to

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.400 
you're going to attach this top part to
the<00:03:26.760> original<00:03:27.300> lock<00:03:27.570> pin<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> u-bolt<00:03:30.410> with
