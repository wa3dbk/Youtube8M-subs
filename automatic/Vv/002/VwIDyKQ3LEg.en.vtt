and it's worth 6 points and you need art

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
and it's worth 6 points and you need art
and<00:02:47.430> basic<00:02:47.819> science<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.209> writing<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.629> have<00:02:48.780> a

influence<00:02:52.739> cubes<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.069> either<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.730> to

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
influence cubes on either so you have to

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.009 
influence cubes on either so you have to
be<00:02:53.879> quick<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.060> put<00:02:54.239> influence<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.870> because

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
be quick to put influence on it because

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.449 
be quick to put influence on it because
it<00:02:55.079> can<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.200> grabbed<00:02:55.470> by<00:02:55.650> anybody<00:02:56.069> the

it can be grabbed by anybody the

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.740 
it can be grabbed by anybody the
invention<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.909> universities<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.629> there's

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
invention of universities and there's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.839 
invention of universities and there's
banking<00:02:58.290> which<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.280> gives<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.609> top-end

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
banking which you know gives the top-end

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.050 
banking which you know gives the top-end
for<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.859> currency<00:03:02.310> law<00:03:02.670> stuff

for the you know the currency law stuff
which<00:03:03.209> currently<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.599> isn't<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.049> it's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
which currently there isn't it so it's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.509 
which currently there isn't it so it's
really<00:03:04.319> nice<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.530> there's<00:03:04.829> basically<00:03:05.340> these

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
really nice that there's basically these

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.869 
really nice that there's basically these
give<00:03:05.730> more<00:03:05.970> long<00:03:06.420> term<00:03:07.129> long<00:03:08.129> term<00:03:08.159> abilities

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
give more long term long term abilities

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.360 
give more long term long term abilities
to<00:03:09.480> shoot<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:11.069> know<00:03:11.129> in<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to shoot for it you know in the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.039 
to shoot for it you know in the
satellite<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.000> these<00:03:12.299> are<00:03:12.569> really<00:03:12.720> great<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
satellite so these are really great to

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.020 
satellite so these are really great to
all<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> wax<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.500> should<00:03:13.650> say<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.340> antibiotics

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030

apparently is a typo it says there were
six<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.340> apparently<00:03:17.579> they're<00:03:17.760> really

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
six but apparently they're really

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.000 
six but apparently they're really
supposed<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.180> be<00:03:18.269> worth<00:03:18.389> four<00:03:18.739> which<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.769> what

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
me know and also I say I'm trying to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.460 
me know and also I say I'm trying to
think<00:04:07.620> of<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.859> time<00:04:08.160> quote<00:04:08.549> to<00:04:08.730> go<00:04:08.849> out<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.470> but

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
think of a time quote to go out on but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.430 
think of a time quote to go out on but
the<00:04:10.709> only<00:04:11.090> time<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.629> fire<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.139> which<00:04:13.260> we

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the only time is the fire in which we

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.530 
the only time is the fire in which we
burn<00:04:13.709> not<00:04:14.609> necessarily<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.150> best<00:04:15.239> one<00:04:15.449> but

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
burn not necessarily the best one but

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.479 
burn not necessarily the best one but
the<00:04:15.629> only<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> can<00:04:15.959> think<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.590> guess<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.370> could

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
the only I can think of I guess I could

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.560 
the only I can think of I guess I could
