00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.670
 our members our readers we have 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.800
 quite a lot of questions can be asked 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.689
 in relation to love, there is one 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.640
 feature on the face that I can interpret 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.400
 a wealth so everything starts with it 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.570
 at which priority area is 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.970
 in a person bigger or smaller 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.619
 For example, when I am completely it is always 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.379
 a flat rate goes in an interview 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.699
 im not in full width when i am 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.789
 For example, a person with a high 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.210
 forehead and a human with a small one 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.890
 star 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.960
 then the priority area is where 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.179
 this will be different with respect to 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.559
 the love will be a bit more difficult though 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.350
 I have a person's full lips 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.999
 that's why communication has increased 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.379
 love the creativity faces 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:52.359
 and he also meets a human 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.889
 then wet lips will have too 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.969
 give trouble why want 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.639
 no one kissing a human like that 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.409
 he may be totally nice yes 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.110
 i say man the market maybe 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.640
 to be totally nice though 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.440
 I suppose I would kiss lips 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.450
 there are features on the face completely 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.350
 The lips point clearly to the love 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.360
 are the strongest 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 next is even that much around to 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.770
 call this is this area 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.650
 ancient greek the magic of love 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.180
 and here we have the armor bow too 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.180
 that says a lot about it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.479
 pronounced the field is to film 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.360
 all the more attractive American 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.140
 Fans again say sex appeal 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.660
 but that is nonsense that one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.490
 reducing the attraction 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.750
 may also have to do with love 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.920
 But the attraction can also be for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.960
 political or whatever used 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.550
 many actors just become 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 have a very strong filter around 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.460
 that means they rap we are very 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.140
 clear to see 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 and if someone does not filter this 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 owns or a weak then pick it up 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.920
 Often overreacting to his charisma 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 the eyes or over the body the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 then have to invest somewhere else and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.119
 Federal even if somewhere a feature 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.490
 it does not mean that you're up 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.320
 But there are other possibilities 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.570
 a man with full lips has with 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.190
 security more possibilities in the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 love to be with women we land a man 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 where the lips move inwards 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.510
 that is definitely a disadvantage
