in order to do that it's really

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.380 
in order to do that it's really
necessary<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.369> good<00:00:17.699> broad<00:00:18.029> view<00:00:18.359> of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
necessary to have a good broad view of

hard to see these pictures I'm going to
zoom<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.590> bit<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> much

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
zoom in a little bit to get a much

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.660 
zoom in a little bit to get a much
better<00:00:25.350> view<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.430> here

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
better view of them you can see here

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.419 
better view of them you can see here
that<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.000> title<00:00:27.359> world<00:00:27.630> hunger<00:00:27.900> goes<00:00:28.740> until

approximately three point six seven
seconds<00:00:33.300> now<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.170> that's<00:00:34.380> quite

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
seconds now I don't think that's quite

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.229 
seconds now I don't think that's quite
long<00:00:34.829> enough<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.399> title<00:00:35.790> page<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.149> what

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
long enough for my title page so what

give the viewer five seconds to look at
the<00:00:43.649> title<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.940> once<00:00:45.270> I've<00:00:45.420> done<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.809> can

scroll over and I can see that I've got

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.470 
scroll over and I can see that I've got
this<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.110> map<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.070> shaded<00:00:50.670> area<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
this the map this shaded area here is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.229 
this the map this shaded area here is
the<00:00:51.539> transition<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.039> actually<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> fade<00:00:53.820> so

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the transition it's actually the fade so

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
the transition it's actually the fade so
the<00:00:54.360> fade<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> almost<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> full<00:00:55.530> second<00:00:55.920> long

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the fade is almost a full second long

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.970 
the fade is almost a full second long
starts<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> ends<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.890> at

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
starts here and ends here and then at

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
starts here and ends here and then at
this<00:00:59.160> point<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.059> only<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.449> we're<00:01:00.570> looking

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this point the only thing we're looking

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.640 
this point the only thing we're looking
at<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.070> map<00:01:02.309> until<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.930> point<00:01:04.199> add

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
at is just the map until this point add

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.250 
at is just the map until this point add
two<00:01:05.040> three<00:01:05.369> three<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.030> point<00:01:06.479> five<00:01:06.720> seconds

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
two three three two point five seconds

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
two three three two point five seconds
at<00:01:07.470> which<00:01:07.920> case<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.369> next<00:01:08.760> transition<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
at which case the next transition is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.510 
at which case the next transition is
happening<00:01:09.570> shatter<00:01:10.290> now<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.040> don't<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
happening shatter now I don't think this

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.920 
happening shatter now I don't think this
is<00:01:11.580> quite<00:01:11.820> long<00:01:12.060> enough<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> goes<00:01:12.840> from

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
is quite long enough that goes from

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920 
is quite long enough that goes from
about<00:01:13.260> five<00:01:13.470> seconds<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.010> just<00:01:14.340> over<00:01:15.000> six<00:01:15.360> so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
about five seconds to just over six so

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.240 
about five seconds to just over six so
I'm<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> make<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.590> photo<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.189> little

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
I'm going to make this photo a little

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
I'm going to make this photo a little
bit<00:01:17.610> longer<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.770> click

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bit longer and as I do that I just click

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.740 
bit longer and as I do that I just click
and<00:01:20.189> drag<00:01:20.340> makes<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.630> longer

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
and drag makes it a little bit longer

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
and drag makes it a little bit longer
while<00:01:22.140> keeping<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> transition<00:01:23.280> intact<00:01:23.880> we

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
while keeping the transition intact we

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
while keeping the transition intact we
can<00:01:24.689> now<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> goes<00:01:25.320> fully<00:01:26.009> from<00:01:26.250> about

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
can now see that goes fully from about

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850 
can now see that goes fully from about
five<00:01:26.729> seconds<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.450> only<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.900> showing<00:01:28.290> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
five seconds with only that showing to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
five seconds with only that showing to
about<00:01:29.220> seven<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> half<00:01:29.820> seconds<00:01:30.390> let's<00:01:30.570> see

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
about seven and a half seconds let's see

to<00:03:35.669> bring<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.910> scrub<00:03:36.150> back<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.480> about<00:03:36.629> a

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
to bring the scrub back to about a

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.990 
to bring the scrub back to about a
second<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.370> you're<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> see<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.819> world

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
second and you're going to see the world

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.110 
second and you're going to see the world
hungers<00:03:39.359> now<00:03:39.540> over<00:03:40.230> top<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.680> map<00:03:40.859> so<00:03:41.819> even

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
hungers now over top of the map so even

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.150 
hungers now over top of the map so even
though<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.359> very<00:03:42.389> easy<00:03:42.870> to<00:03:43.169> change<00:03:43.889> the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
though it's very easy to change the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.680 
though it's very easy to change the
duration<00:03:44.639> of<00:03:44.760> your<00:03:44.819> pictures<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.389> whatnot

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
duration of your pictures and whatnot

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.439 
duration of your pictures and whatnot
once<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.560> audio<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.310> then<00:03:47.519> titles<00:03:48.150> all

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
once you have audio and then titles all

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.270 
once you have audio and then titles all
over<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.720> place<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.590> good<00:03:49.769> idea<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.129> make

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
over the place it's a good idea to make

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.949 
over the place it's a good idea to make
sure<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.609> you<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:51.120> your<00:03:51.269> timing<00:03:51.569> right<00:03:51.810> of

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
sure that you get your timing right of

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.559 
sure that you get your timing right of
your<00:03:52.049> video<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.500> photos<00:03:52.829> first<00:03:53.160> before<00:03:53.970> you

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
your video and photos first before you

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.030 
your video and photos first before you
start<00:03:54.810> playing<00:03:54.989> with<00:03:55.139> time<00:03:55.470> with<00:03:55.650> these<00:03:55.799> it's

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
start playing with time with these it's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.920 
start playing with time with these it's
much<00:03:56.160> easier<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.519> move<00:03:56.699> these<00:03:56.819> around<00:03:57.090> than<00:03:57.810> it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
much easier to move these around than it

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.460 
much easier to move these around than it
is<00:03:58.049> to<00:03:58.169> change<00:03:58.379> all<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.129> pictures<00:03:59.459> again<00:03:59.579> and

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
is to change all the pictures again and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.960 
is to change all the pictures again and
that's<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.709> for<00:04:01.919> changing<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.519> duration<00:04:02.760> of

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
that's it for changing the duration of

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.809 
that's it for changing the duration of
your<00:04:03.030> photos<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.569> video

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
your photos in video

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.879
