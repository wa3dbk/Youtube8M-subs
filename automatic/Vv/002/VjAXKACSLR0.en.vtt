00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
in the body would start to shake so to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.370 
in the body would start to shake so to
kind<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.300> alleviate<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.990> what<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:33.260> would

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
kind of alleviate that what they would

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.750 
kind of alleviate that what they would
do<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.590> only<00:02:33.740> drive<00:02:33.980> at<00:02:34.100> certain<00:02:34.400> speeds<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
do is only drive at certain speeds and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.460 
do is only drive at certain speeds and
then<00:02:34.880> speed<00:02:35.210> up<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> film<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.080> make<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.320> look

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
then speed up the film to make it look

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.980 
then speed up the film to make it look
like<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.790> something<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.300> we<00:02:38.570> don't

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990
