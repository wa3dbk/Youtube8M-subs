00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
that on the camera and then unwrapped

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.290 
that on the camera and then unwrapped
guess<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.590> must<00:03:43.800> mean<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.070> summertime<00:03:44.640> so

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.209 

again<00:04:01.900> you're<00:04:02.290> just<00:04:02.439> going<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.620> wrap<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:02.860> I

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
again you're just going to wrap it I

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.020 
again you're just going to wrap it I
love<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.780> just<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.959> button<00:04:05.140> pushing<00:04:06.030> just

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
love this just the button pushing just

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.330 
love this just the button pushing just
because<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.359> seems<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:07.689> adds<00:04:08.159> so<00:04:09.159> much

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
because it seems like adds so much

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.699 
because it seems like adds so much
little<00:04:09.609> curl<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:11.579> now<00:04:12.579> when<00:04:12.790> I'm<00:04:12.909> done<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.709> am

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
little curl to it now when I'm done I am

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.159 
little curl to it now when I'm done I am
going<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.280> put<00:04:16.150> some<00:04:16.299> hairspray<00:04:16.600> onto<00:04:17.079> her

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
going to put some hairspray onto her

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.870 
going to put some hairspray onto her
hair<00:04:17.380> because<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.549> helps

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
hair because I just think that helps

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.779 
hair because I just think that helps
hold<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:20.199> tightness<00:04:20.709> of<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:20.949> curl<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.489> helps

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
hold the tightness of the curl it helps

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:25.140 
hold the tightness of the curl it helps
you<00:04:22.389> know<00:04:22.509> last<00:04:22.810> throughout<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.259> day<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.940> you

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
you know last throughout the day but you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.210 
you know last throughout the day but you
can<00:04:25.300> also<00:04:25.509> add<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.930> little<00:04:26.169> hairspray<00:04:26.410> before

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
can also add a little hairspray before

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.920 
can also add a little hairspray before
you<00:04:27.430> run<00:04:27.610> it<00:04:27.729> through<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:28.030> curling<00:04:28.419> iron<00:04:28.570> too

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
you run it through the curling iron too

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.610 
you run it through the curling iron too
and<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:30.250> will<00:04:30.400> also<00:04:30.580> help<00:04:30.820> with<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.840> holding

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
and that will also help with the holding

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.879 
and that will also help with the holding
for<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.160> day<00:04:33.990> so<00:04:34.990> if<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.139> have<00:04:35.320> trouble<00:04:35.530> like

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
how come I just like the way that it

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:25.440 
how come I just like the way that it
looks

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:40.610 

and<00:05:26.450> you<00:05:26.960> guys<00:05:27.140> get<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.530> idea

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:52.240 

one<00:05:41.250> more<00:05:41.520> after<00:05:41.700> this

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.340 

the<00:05:52.850> thicker<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.510> strands<00:05:54.140> are<00:05:54.410> obviously

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
the thicker that strands are obviously

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.690 
the thicker that strands are obviously
the<00:05:57.350> longer<00:05:57.530> you<00:05:57.770> need<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:57.950> hold<00:05:58.220> it<00:05:58.400> in

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:58.700 
the longer you need to hold it in

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.240 
the longer you need to hold it in
because<00:05:59.570> it<00:05:59.780> takes<00:05:59.990> longer<00:06:00.590> to<00:06:00.800> heat<00:06:00.950> the<00:06:01.100> hair

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
because it takes longer to heat the hair

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.810 
because it takes longer to heat the hair
through<00:06:01.610> and<00:06:01.880> also<00:06:02.870> the<00:06:03.800> less<00:06:04.010> tight<00:06:04.340> the<00:06:04.610> curl

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
through and also the less tight the curl

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.150 
through and also the less tight the curl
is<00:06:04.940> going<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.180> be<00:06:05.620> like<00:06:06.620> these<00:06:06.770> front<00:06:07.130> ones

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
is going to be like these front ones

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.190 
is going to be like these front ones
were<00:06:07.490> super<00:06:07.910> super<00:06:08.090> tight<00:06:08.480> because<00:06:08.960> they<00:06:09.140> were

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
were super super tight because they were

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.250 
were super super tight because they were
really<00:06:09.680> thin<00:06:09.920> strands<00:06:10.550> so<00:06:11.420> if<00:06:11.930> you<00:06:12.080> have<00:06:12.230> a

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
really thin strands so if you have a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.150 
really thin strands so if you have a
super<00:06:12.680> thick<00:06:12.890> hair

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
super thick hair

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.240 
super thick hair
