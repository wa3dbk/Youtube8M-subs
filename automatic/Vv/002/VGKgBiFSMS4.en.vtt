timeline and kind of set the parameters
to<00:00:12.570> sound<00:00:13.410> really<00:00:13.679> close<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.190> DM<00:00:14.429> -<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to sound really close to the DM - and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.510 
to sound really close to the DM - and
see<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.179> close<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.870> get<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.830> I'm<00:00:17.130> playing

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
see how close we can get so I'm playing

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
so that is the comparison of these two

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.160 
so that is the comparison of these two
delay<00:03:18.530> pedals<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.820> timeline<00:03:20.240> sounds<00:03:20.690> pretty
