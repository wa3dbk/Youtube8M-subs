leave that right here okay so I'm gonna
try<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> make<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.470> that

try to make it so you can see so that

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:28.039 
try to make it so you can see so that
can<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.520> I'll<00:01:27.180> connect<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.810> over

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
can be up and then I'll connect it over

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:28.460 
can be up and then I'll connect it over
there

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
there

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
there
that's<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:29.189> ear<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:32.189> I'll<00:01:32.700> stop<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.240> right

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's one ear and I'll stop it right

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
that's one ear and I'll stop it right
here<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.840> there's<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.960> nose<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
here and then there's a nose there's a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:02:14.180 
here and then there's a nose there's a
space<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> other<00:01:40.829> ear

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.930 

okay<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.440> that's<00:02:16.920> good<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.610> ears

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
okay so I think that's good for the ears

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay so I think that's good for the ears
right<00:02:18.270> now<00:02:19.550> yeah<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:23.340> will<00:02:23.550> go

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right now yeah okay and that will go

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:33.920 
right now yeah okay and that will go
past<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:25.230> over<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> past<00:02:32.570> y'all<00:02:33.570> keep<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
past that over the past y'all keep it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.580 
past that over the past y'all keep it
like<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.420> it<00:02:36.420> goes<00:02:36.660> down<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:37.080> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
like that and then it goes down to a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.490 
like that and then it goes down to a
square<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:40.320> we'll<00:02:40.470> do<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.810> then<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.290> goes

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
square so we'll do that and then it goes

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.080 
square so we'll do that and then it goes
up<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:44.070> way

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
up that way

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.180 
up that way
oh<00:02:46.610> wait<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.940> think<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.990> was<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:50.240> this<00:02:51.240> and

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
oh wait I think it was like this and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.620 
oh wait I think it was like this and
like<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:55.970> think<00:02:56.970> so

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
like that I think so

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.280 
like that I think so
there<00:02:58.620> goes<00:02:58.980> keeps<00:02:59.490> him<00:02:59.640> going<00:02:59.990> and<00:03:00.990> then<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
there goes keeps him going and then it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:14.170 
there goes keeps him going and then it
goes<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:05.330> think<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.720> too<00:03:07.170> long

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.940 

you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.330> I'll<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.630> start<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.320> from<00:03:16.530> here

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
you know I'll just start it from here
