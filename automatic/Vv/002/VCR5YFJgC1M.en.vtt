00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.880 
the conjured and as you can see there is
an<00:00:21.640> element<00:00:22.000> important<00:00:22.750> I've<00:00:22.840> got<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.109> hit

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
an element important I've got a hit

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.200 
an element important I've got a hit
conserved<00:00:24.640> in<00:00:24.970> email<00:00:25.270> at<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.739> high<00:00:26.919> hate<00:00:27.759> and

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.390 
he is a conduit and death you just put
it<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.110> there<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.480> leave<00:00:34.720> it<00:00:34.989> for<00:00:35.019> about<00:00:35.710> a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400

minute or so wall while ties in it and

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:52.650 
minute or so wall while ties in it and
now<00:00:41.920> I<00:00:41.949> just<00:00:42.640> spelled<00:00:42.940> it<00:00:43.120> out<00:00:43.269> for<00:00:43.329> me

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.080

so yeah just tied to that and they write
it<00:01:05.570> down<00:01:06.280> in<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.430> big<00:01:07.790> open<00:01:08.660> I<00:01:09.140> slide<00:01:09.830> hard<00:01:10.160> Birds

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
it down in a big open I slide hard Birds

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.860 
it down in a big open I slide hard Birds
I<00:01:11.060> just<00:01:11.510> along<00:01:11.960> here<00:01:12.230> like<00:01:12.260> this<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.840> I've<00:01:14.840> got

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
I just along here like this and I've got

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.030 
I just along here like this and I've got
a<00:01:15.110> funny<00:01:15.620> side<00:01:15.890> they<00:01:16.190> do<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.560> contain<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.860> have

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
a funny side they do that contain I have

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280 
a funny side they do that contain I have
just<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.520> be<00:01:19.760> like<00:01:19.880> survivor<00:01:20.390> just<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.990> known

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
just to be like survivor just a known

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.380 
just to be like survivor just a known
artist<00:01:21.470> initially<00:01:22.480> to<00:01:23.480> flatten<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:23.990> out<00:01:24.230> just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
artist initially to flatten it out just

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.530 
artist initially to flatten it out just
lay<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.660> container<00:01:27.200> here<00:01:27.500> for<00:01:27.860> though<00:01:28.070> I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
lay this container here for though I

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.410 
lay this container here for though I
just<00:01:29.540> test<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.230> weapon<00:01:30.680> in<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.880> here<00:01:32.090> we<00:01:32.240> are<00:01:32.270> I

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
just test a weapon in so here we are I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.859 
just test a weapon in so here we are I
think<00:01:32.810> it's<00:01:32.930> enough<00:01:33.170> time<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.850> take<00:01:35.300> this<00:01:35.570> off

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
think it's enough time to take this off

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.920 
think it's enough time to take this off
now<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.530> I'll<00:01:36.800> just<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.460> look<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.479> see<00:01:38.510> how

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
now and I'll just have a look to see how

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.880 
now and I'll just have a look to see how
Chimeran<00:01:39.890> as<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.190> can<00:01:40.369> see<00:01:40.550> it's<00:01:41.410> flat<00:01:42.410> now

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
Chimeran as you can see it's flat now

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.750 
Chimeran as you can see it's flat now
and<00:01:43.479> it's<00:01:44.479> probably<00:01:44.930> still<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.200> bit<00:01:45.440> warm<00:01:45.680> but<00:01:46.190> a

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
and it's probably still a bit warm but a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.790 
and it's probably still a bit warm but a
little<00:01:47.240> bit<00:01:47.360> flexible<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.080> as<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.410> can<00:01:48.590> see

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
little bit flexible but as you can see

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.950 
little bit flexible but as you can see
we've<00:01:49.640> got<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.850> nice<00:01:50.119> flat<00:01:50.600> piece<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.580> PVC

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
we've got a nice flat piece of PVC

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.650 
we've got a nice flat piece of PVC
conduit<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:56.530> now<00:01:57.530> all<00:01:57.890> proceed<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.509> next

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
conduit and now all proceed to the next

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.850 
conduit and now all proceed to the next
step

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.270 

so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.140> concert<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.319> conduct<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
so you get the concert and conduct and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.020 
so you get the concert and conduct and
the<00:02:12.150> person<00:02:12.569> holding<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.319> with<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.680> heat<00:02:13.890> gun

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the person holding up with the heat gun

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
the person holding up with the heat gun
and<00:02:15.349> just<00:02:17.959> exchange<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.380> will<00:02:19.680> click<00:02:20.040> again

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.000 

the<00:02:33.350> magnetism<00:02:33.830> no<00:02:34.280> way<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.700> yes<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:36.800> also

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the magnetism no way and yes we also

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.700 
the magnetism no way and yes we also
just<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.790> do<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.780> ability<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.650> do<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:43.480> so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
just a do not the ability to do it so

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.090 
just a do not the ability to do it so
we'll<00:02:45.710> see<00:02:45.740> how<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.790> goes

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
we'll see how this goes

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.990 
we'll see how this goes
by<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.160> way<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:50.180> ports<00:02:50.600> are<00:02:50.840> 2<00:02:51.020> inch<00:02:51.520> I'll<00:02:52.520> do

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
by the way the ports are 2 inch I'll do

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.340 
by the way the ports are 2 inch I'll do
or<00:02:53.390> 15<00:02:54.260> millimeter<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.950> day<00:02:55.070> apart<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.990> as<00:02:57.230> you

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
or 15 millimeter a day apart and as you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.430 
or 15 millimeter a day apart and as you
just<00:02:57.380> noticed<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.490> else<00:02:58.820> we<00:02:59.090> haven't<00:02:59.270> heated<00:03:00.260> at

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
just noticed I else we haven't heated at

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
just noticed I else we haven't heated at
talking<00:03:01.040> in<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.250> water<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.940> I'll<00:03:02.360> have<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
talking in the water this I'll have to

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:11.930 
talking in the water this I'll have to
go<00:03:02.840> over<00:03:02.870> again

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.050 

he'll<00:03:12.450> fart<00:03:12.930> again

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
he'll fart again

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.410 
he'll fart again
so<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.120> saw<00:03:15.510> you<00:03:16.170> wrap<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.470> around<00:03:16.650> Lord<00:03:17.100> this

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
so you saw you wrap it around Lord this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.710 
so you saw you wrap it around Lord this
just<00:03:18.420> get<00:03:18.569> be<00:03:18.690> hard<00:03:18.930> there<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:20.510> your<00:03:21.510> holes

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
just get be hard there and your holes

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.110 
just get be hard there and your holes
that<00:03:21.959> they're<00:03:22.370> full<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:26.100> all<00:03:26.430> until<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:29.120> con

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
that they're full of all until the con

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.300 
that they're full of all until the con
dude<00:03:30.450> pulls<00:03:30.870> off<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> little<00:03:31.530> bit<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> think

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
dude pulls off a little bit so I think

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.000 
dude pulls off a little bit so I think
it's<00:03:38.310> worth<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.760> come<00:03:38.970> off<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.800> can

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
it's worth to come off and as you can
