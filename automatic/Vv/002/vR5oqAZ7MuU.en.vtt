something else they noted was that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.510 
something else they noted was that
ground<00:01:07.110> zeroes<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:08.280> product

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
ground zeroes is a different product

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.609 
ground zeroes is a different product
from<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.939> phantom<00:01:09.450> pain<00:01:09.479> meaning<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
from the phantom pain meaning that it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.740 
from the phantom pain meaning that it
will<00:01:10.799> contain<00:01:11.220> different<00:01:11.430> features<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.299> other

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
will contain different features in other

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.419 
will contain different features in other
words<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.229> stuff<00:01:13.500> that's<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.799> ground<00:01:14.039> zeroes

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
words some stuff that's in ground zeroes

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.190 
words some stuff that's in ground zeroes
may<00:01:14.670> not<00:01:14.909> end<00:01:15.149> up<00:01:15.329> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.570> phantom<00:01:15.960> pain

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
may not end up in the phantom pain

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
may not end up in the phantom pain
although<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:17.070> mostly<00:01:17.429> has<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.149> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
although that mostly has to do with the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.849 
although that mostly has to do with the
fact<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.079> phantom<00:01:19.469> pain<00:01:19.679> will<00:01:19.829> be

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
fact that the phantom pain will be

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.310 
fact that the phantom pain will be
expanding<00:01:20.520> upon<00:01:20.729> its<00:01:20.909> prologue<00:01:21.359> then<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
expanding upon its prologue then the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.080 
expanding upon its prologue then the
host<00:01:22.469> moved<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.979> by<00:01:23.189> answering<00:01:23.609> questions

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
host moved on by answering questions

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
host moved on by answering questions
about<00:01:24.359> some<00:01:24.539> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> new<00:01:24.810> mechanics<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
about some of the new mechanics that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.010 
about some of the new mechanics that
Kojima<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.159> introduced<00:01:26.670> thus<00:01:26.880> far<00:01:27.119> first<00:01:27.810> up

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
Kojima has introduced thus far first up

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
Kojima has introduced thus far first up
is<00:01:28.170> reflex<00:01:28.649> mode<00:01:28.859> which<00:01:29.130> according<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> them

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
is reflex mode which according to them

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
is reflex mode which according to them
serves<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> simulate<00:01:31.140> snakes<00:01:31.499> lightning

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
serves to simulate snakes lightning

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
serves to simulate snakes lightning
reflexes<00:01:32.539> instinctive<00:01:33.539> reactions<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
reflexes instinctive reactions and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.160 
reflexes instinctive reactions and
complete<00:01:35.369> badassery<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.749> emphasize

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
complete badassery but they emphasize

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
complete badassery but they emphasize
that<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.469> feature<00:01:37.679> is<00:01:37.920> completely<00:01:38.490> optional

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that the feature is completely optional

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
that the feature is completely optional
in<00:01:39.149> fact<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.960> game<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.380> encourage<00:01:40.740> players

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in fact the game will encourage players

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.880 
in fact the game will encourage players
to<00:01:41.249> retry<00:01:41.880> missions<00:01:42.359> without<00:01:42.539> reflex<00:01:43.170> mode<00:01:43.409> by

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to retry missions without reflex mode by

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.440 
to retry missions without reflex mode by
rewarding<00:01:44.369> them<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.579> completing<00:01:45.299> missions

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
rewarding them for completing missions

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.809

with<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> feature<00:01:46.170> turned<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.890> they<00:01:47.460> also<00:01:47.609> go

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
with a feature turned off they also go

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.639 
with a feature turned off they also go
into<00:01:47.969> why<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> feature<00:01:48.749> was<00:01:49.020> introduced<00:01:49.469> in

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
into why the feature was introduced in

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.529 
into why the feature was introduced in
the<00:01:49.679> first<00:01:49.979> place<00:01:50.270> reiterating<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> it

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
the first place reiterating that it

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.629 
the first place reiterating that it
balances<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:52.139> the<00:01:52.200> open-world<00:01:52.979> nature<00:01:53.490> of

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:53.639 
balances out the open-world nature of

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.730 
balances out the open-world nature of
the<00:01:53.789> game<00:01:53.819> which<00:01:54.539> makes<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> lot<00:01:55.139> easier<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the game which makes it a lot easier to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.739

zones<00:04:04.890> are<00:04:05.100> much<00:04:05.340> closer<00:04:05.670> but<00:04:06.120> increase<00:04:06.360> the

chances of heavy retaliation which could

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.850 
chances of heavy retaliation which could
result<00:04:09.240> in<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.720> destruction<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.440> chopper

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.830 
result in the destruction of the chopper
which<00:04:11.280> will<00:04:11.550> force<00:04:11.850> players<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.300> exit<00:04:12.750> the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
slightly more badass methods the safer

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.400 
slightly more badass methods the safer
landing<00:04:18.270> zones<00:04:18.480> on<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.750> other<00:04:18.870> hand<00:04:19.049> while

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
landing zones on the other hand while

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.229 
landing zones on the other hand while
they<00:04:19.590> decrease<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.280> chances<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.670> retaliation

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
they decrease the chances of retaliation

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.630 
they decrease the chances of retaliation
they<00:04:22.020> are<00:04:22.140> also<00:04:22.320> significantly<00:04:23.100> further<00:04:23.370> away

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
they are also significantly further away

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.180 
they are also significantly further away
so<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.600> balancing<00:04:25.140> act<00:04:25.320> but<00:04:25.800> choppers

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
so it's a balancing act but choppers

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.620 
so it's a balancing act but choppers
will<00:04:26.400> work<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.790> little<00:04:26.940> differently<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.600> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
will work a little differently in the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.630 
will work a little differently in the
phantom<00:04:28.050> pain<00:04:28.080> while<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.980> hosts<00:04:29.190> didn't<00:04:29.490> go

into much detail they did state that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.250 
into much detail they did state that
