I<00:04:40.510> think<00:04:41.020> powerful<00:04:41.770> tree<00:04:41.980> was<00:04:42.160> trying<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.550> be

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
I think powerful tree was trying to be

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.000 
I think powerful tree was trying to be
more<00:04:42.850> realistic<00:04:43.450> and<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.870> definitely<00:04:44.350> reached

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
more realistic and it definitely reached

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.310 
more realistic and it definitely reached
that<00:04:45.280> with<00:04:46.090> call<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.480> duty<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.960> know<00:04:47.080> it's

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
kind of got a bit of realism but then in

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.830 
kind of got a bit of realism but then in
another<00:04:50.640> aspect<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.850> just<00:04:52.090> with<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.540> perks
