00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.700

 so me first put me the link of your 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.940
 chain and then with the video you 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.890
 want me to put on my channel for 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.010
 you make the pub itself alone 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.290
 so here is thanks for participating and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.780
 we will start immediately so everything 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.210
 first we will take our laces 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.960
 and we will do what I call the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:13.649
 therefore basis over the tab 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 will be inside if I have nothing so we 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:19.140
 goes like that feels neither the rooms 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.310
 inside for now and we're going 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310
 pass that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.600
 like that so especially beautiful bullshit 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:41.200
 especially it must be flat so 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:41.200
 check that it fits well so 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:56.620
 so that's adjusted then 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:56.620
 now we're going to get that movie 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 right here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:18.620
 then here always making sure that this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:23.140
 be well flat so we do that 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.140
 now with each other 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:56.480
 so we repeat the action until here and then 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:58.780
 with the mens no I was wrong like 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780
 it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.570
 and to finish 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:25.520
 So here now if we need it 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.140
 will just have the laces and that's good 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:32.530
 we finished we did we made our laces 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:38.630
 so now when we put them on rats 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:44.240
 and then we will place inside 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.270
