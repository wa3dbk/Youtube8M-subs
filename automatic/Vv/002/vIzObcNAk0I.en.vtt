 [Music] 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 today 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.000
 [Music] 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.980
 hello friends we are already back and in the 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.050
 tutorial today we want to teach you to 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.020
 make these original bracelets 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.340
 using rope for cutting let's see 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.340
 the material that we need 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.989
 The first thing we need is going to 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.789
 be three meters of rope for core that 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.789
 is a force used in climbing 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.680
 we will also need a quick closure 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.340
 and we will help each other with a pair of scissors and a 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.530
 lighter since you see that the material is 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.220
 very simple so let's see how 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.220
 perform the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:11.829
 [Music] 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:13.659
 You can see that the closure is very easy 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.880
 use and it looks very nice in these 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.670
 bracelets the same can be put without 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.259
 any kind of problem well for 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.439
 make the wristbands I have already cut 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.539
 one and a half meters of rope for cutting in 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.789
 green and blue since I 'm going to do it 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:31.149
 bicolor and what I do with the first 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.079
 color is to pass it through the closure and make 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.079
 a knot 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.750
 and now I'm going to place the other end 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.750
 of the closing 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.630
 for this he headed the longest end 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.850
 that I have stayed and the edge also the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.470
 another color of rope if only the 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 we would like to make a color 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.090
 the same only with one color 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.240
 and I now to join the two colors what 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.000
 what I do is cut one of the tips 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.000
 well flush in this case the green tip 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.049
 and at the short blue tip a 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.760
 little more the threads that come inside 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:24.069
 so that I stay hollow and able 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.069
 introduce the part of rope bell 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 once I have made the union I am going to 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:36.720
 burn a little with the lighter so that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.720
 be perfectly fixed 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.610
 she would have it and now we're going to see 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.440
 how far to start the knots 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.959
 I will use as a bracelet 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.390
 that I have already made but you have 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.790
 careful and when choosing the length of 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.220
 your bracelet calculate that then at 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.590
 take the knots a bit shorter 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.450
 well, once we have it 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.550
 we're just going to start doing the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.680
 children in this case we are going to use the 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.019
 flat world or square knot but in 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.330
 next tutorials we will teach you to 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.050
 make other type of bracelets using 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.050
 another knot 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.810
 Well you see the square knot as 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.390
 always very easy to do 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.099
 we are tightening well so that we stay 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.099
 well fix the bracelet 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.300
 It is a very easy rope to handle and the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.970
 result the truth that is very nice 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.590
 [Music] 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:06.520
 do not 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:06.520
 [Music] 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.909
 and here as you see when we get to the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.829
 part of the union there is no problem 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.100
 there is something in the knots we cover it and it does not 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.100
 note nothing 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.690
 and now already once we come to the end 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:37.180
 of the bracelet we tighten the knots well and 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.180
 let's proceed to cut the ends 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.520
 what we do is cut the end 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.650
 near the bracelet and now with the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.660
 lighter let's take a little tip and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.660
 we're going to leave it to the bracelet 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.150
 and so we will make sure that we are not 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.150
 shred 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.449
 at the other end we do the same 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.970
 We cut near the bracelet and with the 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.970
 lighter burn and crush the tip 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.540
 and look at that the most beautiful result and 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.030
 original the truth that I love 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.730
 for guys and as I said in the next 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.350

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.600
