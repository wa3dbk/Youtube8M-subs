00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
coming now was another surprise little
bit<00:01:45.960> once<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> scale<00:01:46.740> Hot<00:01:47.040> Toys<00:01:47.250> figure<00:01:47.759> we

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
bit once this scale Hot Toys figure we

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.270 
bit once this scale Hot Toys figure we
got<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> sideshow<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.530> too<00:01:49.680> long<00:01:49.829> ago<00:01:49.890> like

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
got a sideshow one not too long ago like

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
got a sideshow one not too long ago like
me<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.790> couple<00:01:50.970> years<00:01:51.240> ago<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.560> fact

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
me just a couple years ago so the fact

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.840 
me just a couple years ago so the fact
that<00:01:52.860> we're<00:01:53.009> getting<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.220> Boba<00:01:53.460> Fett<00:01:53.670> I'm

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
that we're getting a Boba Fett I'm

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.280 
that we're getting a Boba Fett I'm
guessing<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:56.270> new<00:01:57.270> hope

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
guessing this is the new hope

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
guessing this is the new hope
I<00:01:58.320> mean<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.890> new<00:01:59.070> hope<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.430> Empire<00:02:00.000> Strikes

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
I mean a new hope and Empire Strikes

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.149 
I mean a new hope and Empire Strikes
Back<00:02:00.780> because<00:02:01.079> Boba<00:02:01.439> Fett<00:02:01.619> has<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:01.979> minor

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
Back because Boba Fett has some minor

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
Back because Boba Fett has some minor
differences<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.729> Empire<00:02:03.600> Strikes<00:02:03.810> Back<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
differences in Empire Strikes Back and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.779 
differences in Empire Strikes Back and
Return<00:02:04.710> Joey<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.579> yeah<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.899> I'm<00:02:07.860> guessing

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
Return Joey so yeah so I'm guessing

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.219 
Return Joey so yeah so I'm guessing
that's<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:09.270> they<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.569> work<00:02:09.660> around<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
that's the way they can work around that

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.260 
that's the way they can work around that
and<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:10.920> yeah<00:02:11.099> another<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.520> here's<00:02:12.120> all
