how to catch mice series and we are

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.450 
how to catch mice series and we are
gonna<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:06.060> talking<00:00:06.270> about<00:00:06.660> bait<00:00:07.500> now<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
gonna be talking about bait now the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.600 
gonna be talking about bait now the
first<00:00:08.700> thing<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.599> about<00:00:09.900> bait<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:11.219> that

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
first thing to know about bait is that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.539 
first thing to know about bait is that
you<00:00:12.030> shouldn't<00:00:12.300> use<00:00:12.630> too<00:00:12.960> much<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.280> two

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
you shouldn't use too much there are two

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.530 
you shouldn't use too much there are two
reasons<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.059> them

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
reasons for them

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.320 
reasons for them
first<00:00:15.870> one<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.609> any<00:00:17.850> kind<00:00:17.970> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
first one is just that with any kind of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.750 
first one is just that with any kind of
spring-loaded<00:00:18.779> trap<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.490> recommend

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
spring-loaded trap of which I recommend

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.689 
spring-loaded trap of which I recommend
several<00:00:21.510> using<00:00:22.439> too<00:00:22.650> much<00:00:22.830> bait<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.580> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
several using too much bait is going to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.029 
several using too much bait is going to
make<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.029> easy<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> mouse<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.439> steal<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
make it easy for the mouse to steal the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.160 
make it easy for the mouse to steal the
bait<00:00:26.250> without<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:27.570> triggering<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
bait without actually triggering the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.200 
bait without actually triggering the
trap<00:00:28.410> too<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.160> bait<00:00:29.429> too<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.029> mouse

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
trap too much bait too little mouse

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
trap too much bait too little mouse
mouse<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.289> gonna<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.650> away<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.369> second

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
mouse is gonna get away the second

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209 
mouse is gonna get away the second
reason<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.329> using<00:00:34.110> too<00:00:34.290> much<00:00:34.440> bait<00:00:34.739> can

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
reason is that using too much bait can

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.139 
reason is that using too much bait can
actually<00:00:35.910> hurt<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> mouse<00:00:37.020> or<00:00:37.410> kill<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> which

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
actually hurt the mouse or kill it which

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
actually hurt the mouse or kill it which
we<00:00:39.300> probably<00:00:39.540> don't<00:00:39.899> want<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.500> this

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we probably don't want to do on this

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
we probably don't want to do on this
channel<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.430> mice<00:00:41.760> don't<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
channel you see mice don't have a

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
channel you see mice don't have a
regurgitation<00:00:44.090> reaction<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.450> like

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
regurgitation reaction so you know like

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080

we just puke it back up mice though

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.799 
we just puke it back up mice though
can't<00:00:53.460> regurgitate<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.960> they're<00:00:55.680> like<00:01:01.579> and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
not use as bait that's a question I get

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.890 
not use as bait that's a question I get
sometimes<00:03:13.450> well<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.440> my<00:03:14.740> experience<00:03:14.860> at<00:03:15.490> least

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
sometimes well in my experience at least

sometimes well in my experience at least
cereal<00:03:16.900> or<00:03:17.230> bread<00:03:17.740> or<00:03:17.770> anything<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.940> made

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.140 
cereal or bread or anything that's made
with<00:03:19.510> processed<00:03:20.290> wheat<00:03:20.620> flour<00:03:20.980> usually<00:03:21.910> works

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
with processed wheat flour usually works

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.660 
with processed wheat flour usually works
really<00:03:22.540> bad<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.530> can't<00:03:23.950> tell<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.310> like<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
really bad I can't tell you like the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.400 
really bad I can't tell you like the
scientific<00:03:25.330> reason<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.990> but<00:03:26.230> that's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
scientific reason for that but that's

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.380 
scientific reason for that but that's
just<00:03:26.470> what<00:03:26.710> I've<00:03:26.830> observed<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.670> do<00:03:28.000> think

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
just what I've observed and I do think

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.910 
just what I've observed and I do think
that<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.750> something<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.470> with<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.680> flour

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
that it's something to do with the flour

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.690 
that it's something to do with the flour
mice<00:03:30.670> just<00:03:31.120> don't<00:03:31.390> like<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.340> if<00:03:33.340> we<00:03:33.580> were

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
mice just don't like it and if we were

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.580 
mice just don't like it and if we were
smart<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.450> probably<00:03:34.780> wouldn't<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.440> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
smart we probably wouldn't like it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.370 
smart we probably wouldn't like it
either<00:03:35.710> so<00:03:36.670> anyways<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.420> lot<00:03:37.720> more<00:03:37.960> stuff<00:03:38.260> I

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
either so anyways a lot more stuff I

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.010 
either so anyways a lot more stuff I
could<00:03:38.560> say<00:03:38.770> about<00:03:39.100> how<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:39.760> catch<00:03:40.060> mice<00:03:40.390> but<00:03:40.780> as

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
could say about how to catch mice but as

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.800 
could say about how to catch mice but as
far<00:03:41.440> as<00:03:41.470> baiting<00:03:42.310> your<00:03:42.490> trap<00:03:42.790> goes<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.510> just

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
far as baiting your trap goes that just

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.340 
far as baiting your trap goes that just
about<00:03:44.020> does<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.320> just<00:03:45.070> remember<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.270> not<00:03:46.750> use

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
about does it just remember to not use

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.699 
about does it just remember to not use
too<00:03:47.380> much<00:03:47.860> bait<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:49.150> use<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.720> lot<00:03:50.050> of<00:03:50.290> different

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
too much bait to use a lot of different

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.020 
too much bait to use a lot of different
kinds<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.490> bait<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:52.110> try<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.170> stay<00:03:53.440> away<00:03:53.680> from

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
kinds of bait and try to stay away from

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.930 
kinds of bait and try to stay away from
cereal<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.390> bread<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.650> things<00:03:57.400> like<00:03:57.670> that

cereal and bread and things like that

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.840 
cereal and bread and things like that
just<00:03:58.150> doesn't<00:03:58.480> seem<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.260> work<00:03:59.530> too<00:03:59.890> well<00:04:00.070> thank

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
just doesn't seem to work too well thank

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.330
