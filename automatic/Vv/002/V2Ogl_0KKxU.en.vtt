basically<00:01:09.270> at<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.509> point<00:01:09.689> speed<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
basically at that point speed and

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.789

computer edited and get it out of there
I<00:01:21.210> win<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.140> battle<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> getting<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.159> image<00:01:23.460> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I win the battle of getting my image out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.929 
I win the battle of getting my image out
first<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:25.049> makes<00:01:25.890> our<00:01:26.100> controller<00:01:26.670> tick

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
first so what makes our controller tick

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.899 
first so what makes our controller tick
so<00:01:27.090> fast<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.890> again<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> design

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so fast is again from the design

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810 
so fast is again from the design
standpoint<00:01:30.329> we've<00:01:30.950> looked<00:01:31.950> at<00:01:32.130> our<00:01:32.310> fourth

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
standpoint we've looked at our fourth

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.760 
standpoint we've looked at our fourth
generation<00:01:33.450> controller<00:01:33.899> that's<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.619> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
generation controller that's in the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.580 
generation controller that's in the
extreme<00:01:35.159> Pro<00:01:35.340> product<00:01:35.759> line<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.590> determined

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
extreme Pro product line and determined

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
extreme Pro product line and determined
what<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.829> needs<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.340> be<00:01:38.820> able<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.119> move<00:01:39.509> data

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
what it needs to be able to move data

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.520 
what it needs to be able to move data
faster<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.880> also<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:43.229> power

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
faster and also to be more power

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.520 
faster and also to be more power
efficient<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.310> well<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.990> very

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
efficient as well because that's very

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
efficient as well because that's very
important<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.070> terms<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.729> camera<00:01:48.119> battery

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
important in terms of camera battery

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.230 
important in terms of camera battery
life<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.770> again<00:01:50.280> look<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> holistic

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
life so we again look at the holistic

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510 
life so we again look at the holistic
approach<00:01:51.689> as<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.710> how<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.070> produce<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
approach as to how we can produce a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.040 
approach as to how we can produce a
better<00:01:53.700> product

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
better product

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.920 
better product
speed<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:56.200> very<00:01:56.470> important<00:01:57.570> may<00:01:58.570> not<00:01:58.750> be

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
speed is very important may not be

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.020 
speed is very important may not be
applicable<00:01:59.380> for<00:01:59.830> other<00:02:00.430> fashion

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030

photographers but I show you a lot of
movement<00:02:03.820> my<00:02:04.570> work<00:02:04.810> overall<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.590> general<00:02:05.950> I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
movement my work overall in general I

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.730 
movement my work overall in general I
like<00:02:06.130> movement<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:07.570> high<00:02:07.869> energy<00:02:08.110> it

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
like movement I like high energy it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.270 
like movement I like high energy it
comes<00:02:09.100> back<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.520> my<00:02:09.880> life<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:11.050> like<00:02:11.560> high

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
comes back to my life I like I like high

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.550 
comes back to my life I like I like high
energy<00:02:12.490> in<00:02:12.850> general<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.420> need<00:02:13.570> fast<00:02:14.050> cameras

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
energy in general I need fast cameras

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.030 
energy in general I need fast cameras
and<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.770> need<00:02:14.950> fast<00:02:15.310> cars<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.390> capture

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and I need fast cars so it can capture

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.090 
and I need fast cars so it can capture
movement<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.660> we<00:02:19.660> wanted<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.800> able<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:20.980> meet

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
movement so we wanted to be able to meet

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.070 
movement so we wanted to be able to meet
the<00:02:21.250> demands<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.880> next<00:02:22.660> generation

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the demands of the next generation

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.830 
the demands of the next generation
cameras<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.070> we've<00:02:24.250> looked<00:02:24.880> at<00:02:25.570> ways<00:02:25.810> to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
cameras and so we've looked at ways to

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.140 
cameras and so we've looked at ways to
improve<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.650> host<00:02:26.980> interface<00:02:27.250> speed<00:02:27.580> which

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
improve the host interface speed which

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.030 
improve the host interface speed which
is<00:02:28.180> between<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.140> camera<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.860> card

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
is between the camera and the card

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.990 
is between the camera and the card
itself<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.570> able<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.870> maintain<00:02:33.000> no

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
itself and to be able to maintain no

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.180 
itself and to be able to maintain no
bottleneck<00:02:34.540> between<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.380> camera<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
bottleneck between the camera and the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.340 
bottleneck between the camera and the
card<00:02:36.400> we've<00:02:36.790> maximized<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.900> by<00:02:38.110> building

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
card we've maximized that by building

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.100 
card we've maximized that by building
two<00:02:38.770> channels<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:40.110> internal

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
two channels on the internal

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.710 
two channels on the internal
architecture<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.580> when<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.420> have<00:02:43.540> this

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
architecture so that when we have this

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.720 
architecture so that when we have this
one<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.020> very<00:02:44.200> high<00:02:44.650> speed<00:02:44.980> high<00:02:45.190> way<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.520> data

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
one a very high speed high way of data

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.699 
one a very high speed high way of data
coming<00:02:45.970> in<00:02:46.150> from<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.420> cameras<00:02:46.780> buffer<00:02:47.080> we're

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
coming in from the cameras buffer we're

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.910 
coming in from the cameras buffer we're
able<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.100> manage<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.269> throughput<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.170> try<00:02:50.860> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
able to manage the throughput and try to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.040 
able to manage the throughput and try to
keep<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.340> data<00:02:52.150> moving<00:02:52.480> as<00:02:52.690> fast<00:02:52.870> as

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
keep that data moving as fast as

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.410 
keep that data moving as fast as
possible<00:02:53.620> through<00:02:53.860> our<00:02:53.980> controller<00:02:54.420> you're

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
possible through our controller you're

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.210 
possible through our controller you're
there<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.110> shot<00:02:56.380> you're<00:02:56.800> not<00:02:56.980> there

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
there to get the shot you're not there

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.100 
there to get the shot you're not there
to<00:02:57.340> watch<00:02:57.489> the<00:02:57.730> race<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.390> if<00:02:58.540> something<00:02:58.930> fails

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
to watch the race and if something fails

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.080 
to watch the race and if something fails
it's<00:03:00.100> all<00:03:00.340> for<00:03:00.549> nothing

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
it's all for nothing

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.650 
it's all for nothing
so<00:03:01.330> we<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:02.290> do<00:03:02.440> spend<00:03:02.799> quite<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:04.180> lot<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.330> money

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
so we we do spend quite a lot of money

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.810 
so we we do spend quite a lot of money
every<00:03:05.230> year<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.010> not<00:03:06.070> just<00:03:06.370> money<00:03:06.549> it's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
every year and it's not just money it's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.970 
every year and it's not just money it's
the<00:03:07.030> people<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.540> thousands<00:03:08.470> of<00:03:08.530> people<00:03:08.590> that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
the people it's thousands of people that

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.699 
the people it's thousands of people that
go<00:03:09.100> into<00:03:09.420> engineering<00:03:10.420> and<00:03:10.840> designing<00:03:11.500> our

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
go into engineering and designing our

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.860 
go into engineering and designing our
next-generation<00:03:12.190> flash<00:03:12.820> memory<00:03:13.150> technology

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
next-generation flash memory technology

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.319 
next-generation flash memory technology
and<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.220> our<00:03:15.370> next-generation<00:03:15.670> flash

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
and so it is our next-generation flash

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.880 
and so it is our next-generation flash
technology<00:03:16.900> that's<00:03:17.079> currently<00:03:17.410> being<00:03:17.620> built

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
technology that's currently being built

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.830 
technology that's currently being built
into<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.220> extreme<00:03:18.519> Pro<00:03:18.730> product<00:03:19.090> line<00:03:19.239> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
into the extreme Pro product line and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.660 
into the extreme Pro product line and
we're<00:03:20.019> very<00:03:20.049> proud<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.650> technology<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
we're very proud of that technology and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.150 
we're very proud of that technology and
we<00:03:21.850> feel<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.180> we've<00:03:22.329> gone<00:03:22.959> quite<00:03:23.680> quite<00:03:24.130> a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
we feel that we've gone quite quite a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.199 
we feel that we've gone quite quite a
bit<00:03:24.310> further<00:03:24.459> than<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:24.820> did<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
bit further than we did with the

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.440 
bit further than we did with the
previous<00:03:25.360> memory<00:03:26.019> technology<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.450> it's

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
previous memory technology and it's

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.900 
previous memory technology and it's
going<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.079> produce<00:03:29.320> a<00:03:29.620> much<00:03:29.860> better<00:03:30.130> faster

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
going to produce a much better faster

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.810 
going to produce a much better faster
more<00:03:31.600> reliable<00:03:31.900> product<00:03:32.829> than<00:03:33.459> anybody's

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
more reliable product than anybody's
