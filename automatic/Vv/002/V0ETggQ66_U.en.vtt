where we going to Lake Cherokee going
and<00:00:14.400> scanning<00:00:14.820> for<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.179> bait<00:00:15.389> fish<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:16.680> know

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and scanning for some bait fish you know

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.740 
and scanning for some bait fish you know
if<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> transition<00:00:18.000> period<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.539> time

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
if this is a transition period of time

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.439 
if this is a transition period of time
so<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:20.220> places<00:00:20.490> we're<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.970> auto<00:00:21.180> lap

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
so the places we're going to auto lap

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.630 
so the places we're going to auto lap
we're<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.260> main<00:00:22.500> leg<00:00:22.769> as<00:00:23.039> well

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
we're going out on the main leg as well

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.400 
we're going out on the main leg as well
as<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.090> back<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> creeks<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.960> pockets

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
as in the back of the creeks and pockets

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.290 
as in the back of the creeks and pockets
because<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.220> transition<00:00:26.730> time<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.119> don't

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
because it's a transition time we don't

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
because it's a transition time we don't
really<00:00:27.570> know<00:00:27.779> where<00:00:28.439> they're<00:00:28.560> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.890> at

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
really know where they're going to be at

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.769 
really know where they're going to be at
until<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.000> actually<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.510> them<00:00:30.630> on

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
until we go and we actually see them on

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.139 
until we go and we actually see them on
a<00:00:30.810> graph<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.859> looking<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> lake<00:00:32.910> map

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
a graph you know looking on the lake map

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.450 
a graph you know looking on the lake map
I<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.989> some<00:00:34.260> spots<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.680> here<00:00:34.860> already<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
I see some spots on here already that I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
I see some spots on here already that I
think<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.360> might<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.719> good<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.260> go<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.559> scan

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
think that might be good to go and scan

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
think that might be good to go and scan
you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.579> right<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.270> some<00:00:39.450> islands

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you know right here we have some islands

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290 
you know right here we have some islands
and<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.980> river<00:00:41.219> channel<00:00:41.640> comes<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.149> runs

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
and the river channel comes and runs

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.819 
and the river channel comes and runs
right<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:43.020> next<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
right up next to it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.049 
right up next to it
that<00:00:44.040> looks<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.340> it'd<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.940> good

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
that looks like it'd be a really good

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.670 
that looks like it'd be a really good
place<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.660> scamsters<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.200> baitfish<00:00:46.350> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
place to go in scamsters and baitfish of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.279 
place to go in scamsters and baitfish of
course<00:00:46.890> anytime<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.000> have<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.239> point<00:00:48.690> or<00:00:49.110> a

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
course anytime you have a point or a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
hump that comes up rap on the river

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
hump that comes up rap on the river
channel<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> place<00:00:51.960> where<00:00:52.350> bass<00:00:52.620> are
