00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.000
 I will introduce you to the petrol max h45 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.150
 center that diffuse a light of 400 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 watts these are oil lamps to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.410
 pressure ie it is not 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.850
 a flame that illuminates but it is the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
 sleeve that becomes a camp of the saints 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:27.000
 so we put inside the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:29.849
 flavored oil that is the lamp 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.280
 comes with a small funnel for 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.790
 facilitate filling and you have 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.940
 in the box of caps so we 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.610
 uses a tale already has previously 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 installed where to turn on the lamp 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.710
 can once oil is in 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 we close here laval 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.930
 we put the arrow 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.829
 him who was there up that's it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:10.369
 very important and we can pompey 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:11.850
 to reach 2 bat sure here the gauge 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.930
 microwave 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.619
 it'll take a minute or a minute 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.619
 little more his 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 this is the arrow starts at the ewer 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.370
 begins to reach the level of the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 two bars so we go to store the pump 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:42.110
 we prepare its flame to present it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.110
 in front of the torch 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.720
 we prepare the flame 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.470
 this has the effect of 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.470
 ceramic rocket 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.710
 we will leave this path of the word when 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.880
 their cold heads pretty much then minutes 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.870
 in competition once achieved hears 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.870
 contact the pressure 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.210
 stop 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.200
 we will be able to get off the skipper 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.290
 which will have the effect 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.150
 as going down the proven jet 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.440
 with the with the blue controller we go 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.460
 close the torch 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.460
 we are going down 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.720
 the torch and here is the lamp that is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 lit up 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:16.300
 we have one last who told us 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.300
 can put the yellow ball 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.120
 the light is so that's the hqe to 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.519
 500 which broadcasts 400 watts 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.549
 there is a slightly smaller model 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.840
 which is called the 150 hqe that broadcasts 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.120
 100 watts they exist here in brass 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:46.859
 polished including john but also chrome 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:50.849
 their money it's an ideal survey for 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.870
 to light and heat a hut 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.110
 inside a boat outside 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.340
 miage 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.340
