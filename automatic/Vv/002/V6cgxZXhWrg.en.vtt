your son as well first of all you know

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
your son as well first of all you know
it's<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.640> bit<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> loaded<00:00:54.449> question<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it's a bit of a loaded question and I'm

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
it's a bit of a loaded question and I'm
going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> say<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.890> because<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.579> don't<00:00:57.180> know

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
going to say that because I don't know

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
going to say that because I don't know
your<00:00:57.600> son<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> haven't<00:00:58.350> evaluated<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:59.160> he

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
your son I haven't evaluated how he

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.990 
your son I haven't evaluated how he
moves<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.140> haven't<00:01:01.140> seen<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.680> he<00:01:01.739> moves<00:01:02.129> at<00:01:02.489> all

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
moves I haven't seen how he moves at all

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.600 
moves I haven't seen how he moves at all
or<00:01:03.809> any<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> don't<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.680> anything<00:01:05.129> about<00:01:05.250> him

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
or any I don't know anything about him

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
or any I don't know anything about him
really<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.600> tough<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> say<00:01:07.229> specifically

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
really so it's tough to say specifically

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.730 
really so it's tough to say specifically
what<00:01:08.130> programming<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> give<00:01:09.299> them<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
what programming to give them but in a

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
what programming to give them but in a
general<00:01:11.159> sense<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.030> definitely<00:01:12.299> give<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
general sense I can definitely give you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.160 
general sense I can definitely give you
some<00:01:13.170> things<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.650> about<00:01:14.750> first<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.960> all

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
some things to think about first of all

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.190 
some things to think about first of all
at<00:01:16.740> 8<00:01:16.979> years<00:01:17.009> old<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.420> soon<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
at 8 years old it's a bit soon to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
at 8 years old it's a bit soon to
determine<00:01:20.009> whether<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.460> any<00:01:20.970> child<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
determine whether or not any child is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.679 
determine whether or not any child is
athletic<00:01:22.439> or<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.710> non<00:01:23.070> athletic<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.509> could

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
athletic or a non athletic and I could

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
athletic or a non athletic and I could
cite<00:01:24.960> several<00:01:25.409> several<00:01:25.830> examples<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
cite several several examples of that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.240 
cite several several examples of that
but<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> what<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.350> more<00:01:28.560> pertinent<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
but I what I think is more pertinent and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.289 
but I what I think is more pertinent and
more<00:01:29.420> important<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.720> point<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:32.579> try

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more important at this point is to try

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
more important at this point is to try
to<00:01:33.360> directly<00:01:33.960> answer<00:01:34.200> your<00:01:34.350> question<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:34.979> best

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I can so first we use something in here

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
I can so first we use something in here
for<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> six<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> nine<00:01:40.409> year<00:01:40.650> old<00:01:40.799> age<00:01:41.070> group
