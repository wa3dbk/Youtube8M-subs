00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.810
 Hello everyone 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.040
 It is Minegishi and Shearu Dance Company of Motoike order 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.040
 It is six tone Noriko 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.600
 From the preparation 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 Natural turn 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.990
 Closed change 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.470
 Open 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:55.110
 Then, it will be the theme of today before the concrete point commentary 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:57.000
 I would like to announce that this body is also a magic move 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.440
 I call it 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.090
 It is more than my reading I am my master 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.250
 It is what Richard Gree taught me . 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.390
 What does the magic move mean? 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.390
 Do not say 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:22.289
 Then let me give an explanation of the open theme 9 and wings from within group 1 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.350
 I would like to receive 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:30.360
 From a closed change 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 I'm in the open telemark, but in the textbook it's called a closed Tendo change 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.229
 Things are 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:43.050
 For although there is no gender to enter smoothly into our open telemark after this 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:48.870
 The end of the closed change is from the left side up 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:54.420
 It will come to commentary of double reverse spin is continued is that of the up 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:58.890
 This is also about how Magic Move can be used. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.870
 Just as it was at the time of Faraway River Slip Pivot 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.510
 Also here is the reverse rotation 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:13.900
 Please do not wake up that you go forward while pulling your left hand 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.200
 And there's a double reverse spin that women make heel turns and men are men 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.770
 Even your feet 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.830
 Although a very complex rotational movement continues 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:26.140
 First of all, women's heel turn is correct 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.760
 Or must be completed 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.710
 It's time to urge your heel turn 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.940
 A woman turns heel turn 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:41.270
 Color 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:48.590
 I think that it is the most difficult place in wd bar spin where I put the lock 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:50.020
 Rather than think in a straight line as 8 were saying earlier this pond teacher 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.600
 Tightly 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.260
 Imagine herbs 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.590
 It has become important to say Rutte give to tape 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.590
 Along in 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.580
 That first of all developers from the Amarugameshon you are taking this time 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:25.740
 I would like to explain the picture pose 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.740
 And although those called dba Lope is do things that women kick Well 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.550
 Up to that kick 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.400
 Female 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:45.670
 Women, I hope a little Noriko teacher commentary that say that you are doing exactly the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:51.480
 Hmmm- here is my point of view as a woman so my sanling is 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.480
 Though it's an eight figure like it would be
