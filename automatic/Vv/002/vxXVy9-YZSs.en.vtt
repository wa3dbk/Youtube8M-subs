which this is the easy glitch to get on

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.969 
which this is the easy glitch to get on
top<00:01:42.400> of<00:01:42.640> it<00:01:42.820> may<00:01:43.720> take<00:01:43.930> it<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.290> try<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.620> three

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
top of it may take it to try the three

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.040 
top of it may take it to try the three
to<00:01:45.190> get<00:01:45.310> on<00:01:45.430> top<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.970> and<00:01:46.030> to<00:01:46.120> learn<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.570> but

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
it's a pretty easy glitch at you learn

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.540 
it's a pretty easy glitch at you learn
it<00:01:49.470> now<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.530> can<00:01:50.740> catch<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.979> couple<00:01:51.160> of<00:01:51.370> kills

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550

it now you can catch a couple of kills
from<00:01:51.700> here<00:01:51.970> curls<00:01:52.450> up<00:01:52.570> on<00:01:52.720> killed<00:01:53.080> now<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.920> also

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
from here curls up on killed now be also

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.520 
from here curls up on killed now be also
showing<00:01:54.520> you<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.760> bonus<00:01:55.210> glitch<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:56.110> won't
