pull your hair down and it springs up a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
pull your hair down and it springs up a
certain<00:01:01.230> amount<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> inches<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
certain amount of inches then you have a

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.810 
certain amount of inches then you have a
certain<00:01:03.180> curl<00:01:03.480> pattern<00:01:03.840> for<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.920> me<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
certain curl pattern for for me it's the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.710 
certain curl pattern for for me it's the
fractal<00:01:07.040> or<00:01:08.040> zigzag<00:01:08.580> pattern<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.330> because

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
fractal or zigzag pattern and because

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.609 
fractal or zigzag pattern and because
mine<00:01:09.960> springs<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:12.060> five<00:01:12.600> inches<00:01:12.930> but

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
mine springs up about five inches but

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.950 
mine springs up about five inches but

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
brings up from nine to 16 inches but

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.399 
brings up from nine to 16 inches but
with<00:01:18.240> shorter<00:01:18.570> hair<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.930> cut<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.229> time

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
with shorter hair you can cut that time

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.510 
with shorter hair you can cut that time
in<00:01:19.470> half<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.670> cut<00:01:20.820> those<00:01:21.000> inches<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.659> half

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
in half you can cut those inches in half

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.770 
in half you can cut those inches in half
so<00:01:23.520> um<00:01:24.180> yeah<00:01:24.869> that's<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.650> part<00:01:25.830> look<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.130> like

the<00:02:37.159> cons<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> book<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.150> most<00:02:38.420> of<00:02:38.569> it

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
the cons of the book is that most of it

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:42.280 
the cons of the book is that most of it
is<00:02:38.840> about<00:02:39.200> girls<00:02:39.680> who<00:02:39.859> have<00:02:40.159> curly<00:02:40.579> hair<00:02:40.900> um<00:02:41.900> in

is about girls who have curly hair um in

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.379 
is about girls who have curly hair um in
the<00:02:43.129> S<00:02:43.310> pattern<00:02:43.909> or<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.980> 23<00:02:45.980> curl<00:02:46.760> pattern<00:02:47.180> um

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
the S pattern or the 23 curl pattern um

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.800 
the S pattern or the 23 curl pattern um

have a 4c be or a hair then this is

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.020 
have a 4c be or a hair then this is
