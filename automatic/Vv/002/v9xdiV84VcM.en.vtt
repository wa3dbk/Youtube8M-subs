00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.840
 abuse and today I want to show you 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 some of the things that have been 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.320
 doing and that I want to transmit are the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.560
 to you 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 either showing itself side by side in a 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.880
 photographic video that does not require us to 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.239
 so long and you already have the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.440
 technical work we are doing 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.180
 regardless of that I want 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.019
 show them something also that was 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.540
 making a friend marriage launched 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.960
 a book about the petroglyphs of the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.360
 area and a lot of work is being done on that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 with the children with the people of the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.050
 area also in the cultural sphere already 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.320
 I happened to apply the costume jewelery 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.199
 also in this cultural area of â€‹â€‹this 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 well-known marriage that has taken this 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.289
 book has helped with archaeologists everything is 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.009
 a very serious book very nice have been 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.240
 reproduced the petroglyphs of the area 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.030
 in all parts of the world the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.250
 petroglyphs take good care of themselves close 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.179
 there are places which can not be 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.890
 visit then here they are forgotten but 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.939
 at least there is someone who cares 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.220
 of that among those things I did this not 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.060
 I know if you are going to be able to appreciate it 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.870
 I do not think much, but it's good 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.550
 petroglyph very very 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.610
 common in the human figure but it is here 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.580
 with a variant of the peyote technique 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.180
 this been doing also now I am 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.830
 doing another that is not a meter tap 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.560
 but it is a tucume bird in Peru 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 then I will show it to you but what 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.820
 it calls us today 28 is this this flower 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.800
 this flower that is a rose this is not the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.530
 big rose that we did in the tutorial 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.640
 but it is a little more rose 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.720
 tiny and it's very easy to do less 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.210
 complicated than the other and it is also 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 tremendously decorative can be done 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.300
 arrangements in which three or four go 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:32.110
 roses or a bunch of roses and this is 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.950
 very simple to do it is much easier 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.470
 that in the previous one does not have much 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.750
 I work mainly the leaves 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.360
 Leaves are very artistic very beautiful 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.950
 those of 8 these are not ugly 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.310
 they are more born of nature 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.000
 how have we started with this I after 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.940
 I'm going to put together the tutorial 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.580
 and let's do allow me 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.980
 put on my glasses because if I do not see 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.379
 nothing 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.870
 we have to do two of these little ones 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:14.310
 petals these little small petals 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:18.870
 they have a center a center there of seven 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.900
 beads and three laps nothing more than three 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.060
 turns after we have to do three 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.959
 petals with seven accounts center 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:34.340
 plus four turns around him and for 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.400
 last for the flower we have to do 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:41.489
 five petals of which also 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.430
 they have a center of seven stories and 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.569
 five laps around him 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.690
 these are then going to be given 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:54.840
 move everything and we're going to put together 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.599
 leaves both the leaves are well 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.629
 varied you have to make them some more 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.870
 great others more girls for example 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:08.069
 we have sheets that I put 14 15 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:11.370
 accounts and I gave it three laps there are other 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:15.180
 when the same amount that are these 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.870
 that are here that have only two 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.470
 turns and then there's a big one in that 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.539
 you have to put approximately 18 20 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.680
 accounts to the center and we do 5 laps in 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:34.889
 the around you see there is that is the most 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.789
 big the others are smaller and 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:43.020
 the sepals are very easy to make 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:46.380
 you have to put about 14 accounts and one 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:49.130
 turn nothing else and then turn it around 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.490
 I will show them in the video 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.370
 photographic for you to do this is 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.840
 a very fast flower to make very beautiful 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.230
 very decorative 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.139
