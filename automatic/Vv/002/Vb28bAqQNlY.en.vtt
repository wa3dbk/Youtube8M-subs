great to see about 160 K as well so look

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
great to see about 160 K as well so look
I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> bowlers<00:01:10.170> deserve<00:01:10.409> credits

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I think all the bowlers deserve credits

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440 
I think all the bowlers deserve credits
and<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> say<00:01:11.280> D<00:01:11.340> certainly<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> result<00:01:12.270> but

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
and I say D certainly got the result but

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.700 
and I say D certainly got the result but
I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:13.049> guys<00:01:13.229> performed

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
I think the way the other guys performed

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
I think the way the other guys performed
young<00:01:14.490> Smitty<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> ball<00:01:15.240> underboob

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
young Smitty with the ball underboob

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
young Smitty with the ball underboob
fantastic<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.979> again<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.549> thought<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:17.880> we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fantastic and again I thought the way we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
fantastic and again I thought the way we
filled<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.330> outstanding<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.320> set

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
filled it was outstanding and you set

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.050 
filled it was outstanding and you set
aggressive<00:01:20.159> fields<00:01:20.460> throughout<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.850> kept

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
aggressive fields throughout you kept

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.219 
aggressive fields throughout you kept
slips<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.540> whole<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.960> through<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
slips in the whole way through the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
slips in the whole way through the
innings<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.220> had<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.490> weakest

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
innings well we had to get weakest

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
innings well we had to get weakest
didn't<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.030> didn't<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> said<00:01:24.990> as

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
didn't we didn't make like I said as

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.179 
didn't we didn't make like I said as
many<00:01:25.170> runs<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.560> would've<00:01:25.740> liked<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
many runs as we would've liked so I

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.289 
many runs as we would've liked so I
thought<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.460> had<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.640> attack<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> take

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
thought we had to attack out to take

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
thought we had to attack out to take
wickets<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.439> bottlers<00:01:28.740> did<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> job<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
wickets and the bottlers did the job and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.880 
wickets and the bottlers did the job and
we<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.700> tried<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> hang<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.119> which<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.570> nice

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890
