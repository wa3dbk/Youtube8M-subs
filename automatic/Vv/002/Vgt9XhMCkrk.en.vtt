00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 good evening legend if you do not know 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.730
 still I'm about to tell you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 two other defendants have value added 3 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
 very very well that's good then 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.619
 today is the day 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.650
 international dance and who says 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.270
 dance dice juxtaposition of movement on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 music a body expression 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.269
 graceful and artistic expense 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.830
 dance styles 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.539
 but what is certain is that it is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.460
 practice since the dawn of time in 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.890
 effect of many dance styles exist 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.230
 each having its particularity its codes 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.790
 his dancing rhythms in Algerian is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 innate we have it in the blood 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 just one note of music 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.370
 sound so that our body 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.660
 to move in a fast pace 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.660
 different movements in rhythm and sees 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.949
 boxing has recognized that of the 6th of his 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.629
 Kabyle style is a Kabyle dance 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 so it makes sense to say that Kabyle 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.579
 without those who invented the to work 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.710
 these pop vibrations in the end accentuated by 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.710
 hurts a scarf that gives the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.630
 thanks to the greece oc seduce your future 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.140
 the chosen one of your hips in a party 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 it is a weapon of mass destruction 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 a practice dance and of course roger by 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.180
 men which does not give the same 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.799
 result but it remains very appreciable 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.970
 count used in a harem pants 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.970
 loubia or a bernos 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.360
 and you change your style and of course you 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.979
 have recognized this is the chaoui that I have 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.840
 that I gathered with the girls style 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.549
 to make it small this little 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.689
 paragraph nothing to envy to the dance of 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.700
 oriental belly 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.439
 this dance requires years of putting 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.179
 in full condition of honeyed tamesna 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.950
 slot and some doors and later 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.509
 you have the perfect belly for a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.610
 perfect execution of the movement of 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.880
 falls backed by a headscarf to the 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.799
 cut 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.840
 the man also lends himself tight belt 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:59.880
 at the third hole and sometimes we play 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 shoulders and we tilt towards the nose it is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.479
 harmony 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 his trip is there yes we switch to the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.350
 to love handkerchief by hand the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.210
 handles spinning 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.550
 and constantly twirling endlessly 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.130
 the story of iron cocktail line is 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.870
 not light of vibe in this waltz 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.580
 modest and that the acoustic puts all the 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.160
 world okay on how to waddle 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:44.400
 looks proud and pedantic but nevertheless without 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 class and fat and yes let's talk about 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 class and we talk about grace of why 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 why or literally the translation of the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.930
 why why a slew of adjectives 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.730
 immediately comes to mind I 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 will choose but term to describe 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.709
 this subtle and abstract art that expresses 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.600
 anything and that's exactly what it is 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.130
 secret just as the relays cheick the 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.560
 tecktonik or the gun club style 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.570
 the Algerian invented his style of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.610
 anything alas that besides words that 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.530
 characterize which characterizes forgiveness and 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.050
 accompanies his styles and of course a 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.180
 crocodile tracks the spider at the foot of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.299
 the sega on the earth with meneca 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.980
 the spider in the night and these do not 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.870
 did not speak our theater circles of course 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.580
 who lend themselves to this blind tooth 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.040
 with the same accoutrement why not 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.360
 here are most gifts look alike 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.100
 sometimes it's a story of a toe 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.380
 instead of another for the site there 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.299
 change of name then anyway 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.190
 and no matter how the dance is 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.750
 become an entertainment first and foremost a 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.000
 way to let off steam and get 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.959
 pleasure and express his joy or 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.940
 to forget his sorrows 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.040

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:52.110
