 sunedison world leader company in the 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.790
 development of renewable energies has 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.740
 returned to choose Chile as a country 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 within its strategic plan 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.420
 growth and international expansion 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.660
 becoming the benchmark of 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.480
 renewable sector in the country 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.670
 the solar photovoltaic power plant 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.950
 mariaelena is the third major project 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.880
 Spread of Sunedison in Chile- and 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.760
 has an installed capacity of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.010
 72.8 megawatts Maria Elena is located 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 in the Antofagasta region only 15 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.019
 kilometers from the town of María 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.280
 Elena in the province of Tocopilla 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.769
 located inside this area 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.690
 it has a very favorable desert climate 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.150
 for the development of projects based 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.190
 in solar energy one of the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.469
 main economic activities of the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.540
 zone is the energy being the investment 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.079
 of sunedison a significant contribution 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.180
 for the local economy 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.730
 The new Maria Maria plant will generate 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.000
 year 200 6 gigawatts hour of energy 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.310
 clean this great electric potential with 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.619
 capacity to supply almost 100 thousand 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.560
 Chilean households will be injected to 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.460
 interconnected system of the large north 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.490
 the plant has 240 thousand 640 modules 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.770
 photovoltaic 340 inverters and one 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.060
 substation distributed in a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.310
 extension of 185 hectares 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.619
 always betting on clean energy 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.200
 and the environment the energy produced 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.990
 in Maria Elena will avoid the emission to the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 atmosphere of more than 107 thousand tons of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.049
 co2 a year its equivalent would be to withdraw 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.289
 of the street the polluting gases of 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.210
 23,000 cars production 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.060
 execution and development of this ambitious 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.009
 project on the part of sunedison has been 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.210
 carried out on land granted by 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.210
 the ministry of national assets 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 it shows once again the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.130
 commitment of the government of Chile with the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.930
 environment a commitment already expressed 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.030
 on the energy agenda of the ministry 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.459
 of energy that aims 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.069
 last that in 2025 the energies 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.470
 Renewables represent unconventional 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.370
 20 percent of the generation of 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.370
 country energy 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.520
 the project of the plant maría elena 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.740
 executed within a period of five months has 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.460
 counted with an investment of 190 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.460
 million dollars 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.879
 Maria Elena joins the plants of 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.150
 solar sunrise cap san andrés and javier 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.340
 to add about 300 megawatts 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.500
 developed and built by 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.319
 sunedison in chile since its entry into 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.629
 the market and confirm your leadership 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.790
 in the market for renewable energy 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.849
 not only in Chile but in all 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.920
 Latin America the present projects and 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.689
 sunedison futures in chiles leave 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.599
 his commitment to the development of 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.340
 clean energies in the country decision 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.590
 that will help the government 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.970
 Chile can achieve its objective of 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.370
 have an energy matrix 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.370
 diversified and sustainable 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.990
 Sunedison committed since 2011 with 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.320
 Renewable energies and development 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.920
