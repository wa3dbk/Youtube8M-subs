00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.359
 nor does it give you time to be distracted by the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.759
 landscape 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.860
 we are sailing in the waters of itacuruçá 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.220
 south state river coast 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.490
 our destination is not a beach we are 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.650
 yes behind a discrete plantation 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.080
 near management within water algae 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.370
 What may also surprise some is the 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:44.129
 of these plants that they fame 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 they carry emergency but I want to leave 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.270
 guard José the first impression seems 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 that it kind of looks like verminoses and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.660
 still favors the worms gives a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 dirt print 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.320
 how much injustice the algae are the largest 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.390
 producers of the planet help 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.929
 to clean the waters by feeding on 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.740
 organic matter and believe with 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:12.570
 We have contact every day. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.200
 Let me get a water bike here and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.800
 on here 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.289
 This is the cover that was saved is exactly 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.179
 this biologist works in a company that 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.789
 cultivate seaweed in Brazil 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.940
 the cover was saved s is already known and 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.520
 We explored for years at different points 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.750
 of the world especially in Asia 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.330
 A carrageenan jelly is extracted from it. 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 used in various paste products 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.440
 tooth horizon a shampoo ice cream an 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.660
 she acts like she prevents 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.599
 formation of ice crystals at home 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.069
 Ana will pull this unit to prevent 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.200
 she frozen inside a chevette 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.500
 keeping that creamy texture 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.869
 the ice cream in Brazil so far has only been 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.349
 planting permission between the Bay of 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.399
 sepetiba on the river and ilhabela in são paulo 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:07.890
 the cultivation is easy and quick in 45 days 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.069
 something is at the point of harvest is made 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.400
 in the arm bringing the net that maintains them 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.379
 on the surface as it cut there already in the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.010
 in that part that floats 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.010
 after talking 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.340
 a ton and a half in each barrel 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.739
 production not for the whole year 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.099
 You come by the sale. Everything comes here. 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.940
 who waits for the hand but also sees these 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.940
 cute little people here 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.579
 now you did not know but there is already a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.040
 search to extract from cover 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.500
 savarese another product 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.750
 even with all your knowledge about 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.269
 this alga on this plant that 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.980
 surprised the possibility of 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.170
 capaf the yellows and become 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.720
 also in fuel 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.870
 sure was taken by surprise despite 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 wide range of application and it 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.019
 biofuel really is me not 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.060
 knew and that's exactly what it is going 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.680
 To know you now, my friend from Brazil. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.440
 We're going to leave the sea and we're going 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.780
 laboratory to see this transformation of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.329
 algae in fuel 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.760
 the research of professor mauro cabral da 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.540
 federal university of the river already lasts two 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.849
 years 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.709
 the discharge arrives very different from what we saw 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.989
 a milestone after going through a 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.120
 drying process 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.940
 from this dry algae arriving with the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.220
 the laboratory as well as the 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.540
 gotta save that turns into something 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.519
 good 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.530
 the first thing is to do the rehydration 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.949
 traces and wastes that have 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.799
 still the body of the state this time and 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:53.090
 when washing that you have the classes that 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.250
 begin to be rehydrated the boil of this 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.989
 material is the next step 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.109
 adding acids to break the routine 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:06.290
 turning it into a liquid after new 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.500
 now mixes with yeast cells that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.739
 ferment and produce alcohol from 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.449
 sugar molecules 26 minutes later 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.900
 Let's see what the experience of the 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:20.930
 Mauri teacher here in the greenhouse at 30 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.360
 pleasant temperature 10 hours and 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.150
 20 minutes or the amount of gas you 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.150
 we had here in that tube was from there 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.190
 up 26 minutes later 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.110
 Look at how much carbon dioxide it gets 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.970
 in here it means what 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.530
 question that I am majority 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 we had a perfect fermentation that the 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.020
 person also performs a demonstration 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.290
 for high quality television and this 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:48.830
 means gas is up here 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.790
 in this liquid to a mixture of water and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.580
 ethanol 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.730
 this mixture of water and ethanol to 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.940
 used as biofuel needs 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.530
 this mixture is further distilled 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.080
 needs to undergo a process of 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.770
 distillation to turn into alcohol 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.530
 That's exactly the fuel 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.930
 according to mallory teacher if everything 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.570
 right in 2013 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.630
 the project gets off the ground, it's still necessary 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.660
 increase production of algae improve 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.090
 techniques to invest in new research 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.810
 Just so we will have here is being 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.960
 considered the third generation of alcohol 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.960
 fuel
