just<00:05:22.770> make<00:05:22.980> sure<00:05:23.010> when<00:05:23.370> your<00:05:23.520> crimping<00:05:23.880> these

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
just make sure when your crimping these

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.739 
just make sure when your crimping these
now

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:25.749 
now

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
variable-speed be good pretty slow speed

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:34.899 
variable-speed be good pretty slow speed
the<00:05:33.439> process<00:05:33.949> up<00:05:34.069> a<00:05:34.129> little<00:05:34.339> bit<00:05:34.490> using<00:05:34.789> that

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 
the process up a little bit using that

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:49.909 
the process up a little bit using that
impact

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.240 

make<00:05:50.340> sure<00:05:50.550> you<00:05:50.699> get<00:05:50.849> a<00:05:50.909> nice<00:05:51.120> tight<00:05:51.860> grip<00:05:52.860> on

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
going to fall out you can also do this

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:16.670 
going to fall out you can also do this
when<00:06:14.159> the<00:06:14.330> doors<00:06:15.330> up<00:06:15.719> maybe<00:06:16.199> just<00:06:16.289> put<00:06:16.620> a
