him<00:01:10.260> before<00:01:11.070> yep<00:01:11.880> before<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> guess

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.630 

so<00:01:16.230> there<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.690> how<00:01:18.690> I<00:01:19.280> would<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> know

so there is is how I would like to know

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
so there is is how I would like to know
where<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.180> 28<00:01:24.800> anyway<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.920> hitboxes

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
where that is 28 anyway the hitboxes

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.540 
where that is 28 anyway the hitboxes
won't<00:01:26.730> be<00:01:26.940> available<00:01:27.450> for<00:01:28.050> 7.0<00:01:28.740> up<00:01:28.920> kadiri
