 mood a few weeks before the race 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 Our radio partner has become the only 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 radio station broadcasting directly from 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.520
 Yalta 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.279

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.520

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.680
 our rally resume 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.080
 but also masterfully supported and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:56.190

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.210

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.570
 distance 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.800

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.160

 consider one of them to be quite 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.940
 important for me as a radio worker 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.890
 includes their technical equipment 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:12.430

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.180
 the air we no longer just feel 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:53.069
 short-term and our carefree 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.650
 it's time to rest and we are in the service park 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.329
 September 14, the second day about close 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.430
 regulations during familiarization with 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.430
 highway cars may be 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 only the pilot and navigator here is the third rice 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.299
 there is no place 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.300
 so instead of an operator for registration we 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.610
 send our camera 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.950
 so it all starts first pilot 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.920
 dictate your vision to the navigator 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.320
 tracks and then put up and then 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.310

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.310
 If you have gathered there 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.200
 this problem will be solved by friends and 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.780
 colleagues and already 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.500

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.670
 sealant for gasket should be bought in 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.760

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.010
