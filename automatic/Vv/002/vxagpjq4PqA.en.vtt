 jokingly speaking that the Japanese are 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.480
 I better tell you what the 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.100
 Japanese guitars are better but 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.090
 public harley goalkeeper - 1 - are very 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.400
 controversial 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.680

 We 're going to have to talk about this beginning. 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.650
 for hours the team will not reach 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.570
 a definition of one of the Americans to 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.280
 American industry would say that 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.989
 is the world's largest instrument 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.700
 that I've spoken here on the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.959
 Japanese are the best indeed 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.940
 they were your best they are very good 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.650
 also it is not possible to define that the best 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.150
 Dude, I really like the geeks that are 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.730
 Americans but there are people who like the 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.410
 grills are Japanese and finally can not really 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.840
 Speak the guitar, it has to be good. 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.140

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.000
 This was the heat of the drink 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.400
 I was wrong was the key word of the city. 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.980

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.430
 out of the way, we got the rope. 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.950
 project even has 21 food cast ours 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.410
 less profitable project is unfortunately the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.480
 people have to think about it and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.040
 children but I was not sad 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.340
