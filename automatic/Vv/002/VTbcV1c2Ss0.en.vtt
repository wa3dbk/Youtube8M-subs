00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.980
 our blood actually was a great 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 problem in Brazil today that only 2% of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.030
 population is a donor of a tablet 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.030
 being the recommended one is of 35% 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 then moving forward is a form of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.390
 be fighting this we are 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.310
 trying with our part of society 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.930
 who just hired two things like 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
 solve a problem that also wants 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 show the planetinha corinthians se 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.680
 when there is this campaign that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.869
 donation campaign is important the name 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 a social side to this passion 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.840
 that we really can 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.930
 reach the public 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.180
 the masses have ready an opportunity that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.879
 knows so interesting and important 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 for all of us 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.120
 I'm very glad the campaign is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 growing every edition the corinthians 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.219
 supporting each and every edition already 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.239
 we are the biggest ones that make it connected 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 to sport having the color race none of this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.110
 nor twisted 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.440
 people from other twisted campinas 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.420
 and then I think super super cool and it's 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.580
 rewarding for those who are donating 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.010
 I came to more than one person for happy 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.510
 I'm glad everyone first disc 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.670
 expect to see with special for all 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 we as surely have gone through heavy 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.720
 is a campaign that bets more on the future 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.000
 is extremely necessary with 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 hemocentros with low stock and thanks 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.370
 the Corinthians fans who embraced this 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.900
 cause 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.950
 I think it's a gift that we give 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.950
 for Corinthians and for Society 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.530
 the April sheet I'm sure that this 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.130
 idea because it will surely be the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.280
 be a soccer practice the sport 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.380
 aligned with the social appeal for a world 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.790
 can understand how important and 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.790
 fundamental and buried 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.610
 I want to know that there are people there. 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.610
 helping people
