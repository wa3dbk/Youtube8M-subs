00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.580
 is the operating pressure is reached 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.460
 compressed air to release the parking brake 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.170
 to disposal 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.269
 when moving the handbrake lever sin 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.130
 Presentation will put pressure in the spring 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.190
 save the combi cylinder built 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.460
 and release the parking brakes on the truck 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.460
 yourself 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.960
 at the same time is about a second 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.110
 Line the trailer control valve pressure 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.330
 acted as trailer control valve 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.850
 then sends the trailer brake 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.270
 Valve the impulse to release the trailer 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.270
 slow down 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 should the train at a fall 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 always be turned off first 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.430
 check if the entire train without 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 trailer brakes could be kept 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.369
 this will be done first with the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.080
 Parking brake braked and then over 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.750
 the control position on the parking brake 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.750
 lever the trailer brake system vented 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.530
 Now only the spring memory will work 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.720
 brake the truck rear left to the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 Parking brake lever in control points 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.050
 He starts automatically in the brenz 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.750
 The parking brake will return 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.750
 now the truck is ready to go 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.110
 the parking brake valve 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.349
 in position 1 of the handbrake lever sist 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.140
 the parking brake is braked 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.989
 condition over the open outlet 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.730
 the combi cylinders are vented that 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.349
 Trailer control valve is on 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.599
 corresponding input also 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.730
 vented and thus gives the trailer 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.580
 brake valve the control pulse to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 slow down 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.690
 the control position 2 only works 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.239
 the brake system of the trailer 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.519
 It causes a venting of the trailer 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.910
 the brakes on the towing vehicle brake 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.470
 stay in the braked state will 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.110
 the handbrake lever is released again 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 he automatically jumps to position 1 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.299
 back and the trailer will brake 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.340
 re-aerated for the ride will be in 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.290
 zeroing compressed air to the combi 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.239
 cylinders guide the spring force 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.049
 the error memory picks up and the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.049
 brakes releases 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.370
 the trailer control valve 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.739
 the trailer control valve is used for 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.780
 controlling the trailer brakes through 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.920
 the operation and the parking brake 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.200
 installation of the towing vehicle in imagination 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.370
 Supply air from the towing vehicle to 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.370
 trailer passed 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.470
 at the same time there is pressure from the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.180
 Parking brake on the turn the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.819
 Brake hose to the trailer brake 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.060
 The trailer brake is depressurized 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.060
 solved 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.209
 at full braking, the maximum 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.840
 Pressure on the trailer brake valve 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.840
 controlled 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.730
 The release of the foot brake vents the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.810
 ports for the brake circuits 1 and 2 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.640
 then the brake connection 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:46.290
 of the trailer via the trailer tax 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:48.240
 Valve also vented to actuate 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.460
 the parking brake causes a 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.860
 bleed the detection connection at the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.090
 trailer control valve 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.280
 This allows the brake line to 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.830
 trailer be subjected to pressure 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.830
 The trailer goes into the fire position 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.310
 the combi cylinder 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.870
 in the combi cylinder can have a braking effect 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.550
 over the foot brake valve and over the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.220
 Parking brake can be achieved 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.500
 the parking brake is activated 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:41.080
 For safety reasons, depressurize only via the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:43.090
 the error memory springs when driving 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.590
 this spring force is due to compressed air 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.540
 overcome and the brake released 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.220
 Partial braking will be a part 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.630
 pressure in the brake chamber of the combination 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.460
 Cylinder driven by the itself 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.320
 the braking chamber and the brake 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.520
 rod will join with the adjacent one 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.520
 pressure in the brake a 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.680
 at full braking is the maximum 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.630
 Brake pressure in the brake chamber of the combination 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:22.960
 cylinder and on the 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:24.730
 brake applied to solve the operation 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.130
 Braking happens by opening one 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.320
 attachment on foot brake valve the 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.390
 Pressure drop in the brake cylinders leaves 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.190
 the brake rods are out of the brakes 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:38.710
 back is the brake system by a 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.880
 Defective in the towing vehicle are depressurized 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.520
 combi cylinder brakes must have 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.290
 defective truck can be towed 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.370
 the spring storage of the combi cylinder 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.370
 mechanically loosen 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.000
 after towing is on it too 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.890
 Pay attention that the emergency solution screw 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.210
 completely back in the brake cylinder 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.210
 be turned back
