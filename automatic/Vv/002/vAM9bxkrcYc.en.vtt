00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:10.800
 One day suddenly why not just a specific site like google or facebook 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.800
 We will explain how to handle when you can not access 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.920
 For example 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.830
 Like this in the google search window 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 For example, with Yahoo! 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.330
 Search with Yahoo auction 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.930
 After you search for emmer 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.980
 Such a real 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.960
 I can not connect to ww. google. co. jp 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.680
 You may see something like this or facebook Click here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.000
 Even if 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.790
 I can't access facebook 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.500
 If this happens, here is a detailed view, but look here 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:55.750
 Even if that encryption sa sale is somehow 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:59.559
 The Tteyuu security certificate if Toka explanation do not know of such meaning is written 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.990
 I think there are cases where I do not know what to do 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.000
 At that time 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.670
 today 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 First of all 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 Bottom right Kedomo I would like to try this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.890
 This is the bottom right case of the windows even though I know the case of windows 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.010
 There is this watch 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.480
 Please double-click on the watch 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.810
 Then 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:27.159
 The actual time and the time displayed on the clock have not gone wrong 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.159
 If this is crazy 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.430
 Please adjust to that actual time First of all the year is 2012 now, but in practice 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.640
 It is 2014 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.390
 so 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.690
 Well actually it is also the month is March you have still 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 Time is March 2 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:54.000
 Actually it is 4:11 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:58.110
 It's 4:11 So let's set it up and apply where 16:11 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.760
 And with ok you can now access 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.650
 If you try to fit on facebook like this on facebook 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.640
 You can access 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.040
 And google well 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:16.580
 You will be able to search for google and thus access Google 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.740
 First of all, the security commentary 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.340
 If it becomes such a display is 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:29.320
 First of all please check this time 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.320
 You will be able to access by setting the correct time that you think is always crazy
