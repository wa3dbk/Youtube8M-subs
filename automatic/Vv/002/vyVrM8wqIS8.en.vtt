go from second short the third eye I go
up<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.509> reason<00:01:27.810> why<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.380> is

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
up and the reason why I do that is

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
up and the reason why I do that is
second<00:01:29.159> base<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.759> bit<00:01:29.850> smaller

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
double play so I like the smaller glove

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
double play so I like the smaller glove
to<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> feel<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.320> just<00:01:37.320> feeling<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
to have the feel of just feeling the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.310

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
when I when I went over to third and

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.559 
when I when I went over to third and
realized<00:02:47.629> that<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:48.470> got<00:02:49.400> missing<00:02:49.879> balls<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.480> a

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
realized that you got missing balls in a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.530 
realized that you got missing balls in a
sense<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.080> me<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.890> logic<00:02:52.250> makes<00:02:52.459> sense

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.399 

in<00:02:55.629> case<00:02:55.840> how<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.799> stay<00:02:57.310> sharp<00:02:57.640> oh<00:02:58.290> it's<00:02:59.290> a

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
in case how do you stay sharp oh it's a

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:06.589 
in case how do you stay sharp oh it's a
matter<00:02:59.650> of<00:03:01.439> that<00:03:02.439> particular<00:03:02.890> day<00:03:03.040> where<00:03:04.859> and

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
matter of that particular day where and

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.000 
matter of that particular day where and
you<00:03:07.599> know<00:03:07.689> when<00:03:07.810> you<00:03:07.870> do<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.230> an<00:03:08.530> occasional

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
you know when you do have an occasional

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.470 
you know when you do have an occasional
off<00:03:09.159> day<00:03:09.340> I'll<00:03:09.489> make<00:03:09.670> sure<00:03:09.879> that<00:03:09.909> I<00:03:10.090> bounced

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
off day I'll make sure that I bounced

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.929 
off day I'll make sure that I bounced
around<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.989> and<00:03:11.260> get<00:03:11.980> some<00:03:12.159> ball<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.609> short

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
around and and get some ball to short

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.270 
around and and get some ball to short
and<00:03:13.629> get<00:03:13.810> some<00:03:14.019> double<00:03:14.379> plays<00:03:14.590> turns<00:03:14.920> from

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
and get some double plays turns from

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.839 
and get some double plays turns from
from<00:03:15.640> second<00:03:16.060> base<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.549> it's<00:03:18.670> just<00:03:18.760> a

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
from second base and so it's just a

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.789 
from second base and so it's just a
matter<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.239> out<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.659> using<00:03:19.989> VP<00:03:20.530> for

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
matter of going out and using VP for

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.830 
matter of going out and using VP for
that<00:03:20.980> for<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.340> practice<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:22.599> being

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
that for that practice and being

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.619 
that for that practice and being
prepared<00:03:22.959> for<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.349> again<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:27.329> think<00:03:28.329> it'd<00:03:28.599> be

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
prepared for it again I think it'd be

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.929 
prepared for it again I think it'd be
fun<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.439> know<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:30.220> your<00:03:30.250> career<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.760> can

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
kind of hit every one of them I think

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.520 
kind of hit every one of them I think
it'd<00:03:33.129> be<00:03:33.159> fun<00:03:33.280> yeah<00:03:33.790> I'd<00:03:34.180> love<00:03:34.389> to<00:03:34.450> have<00:03:34.689> the
