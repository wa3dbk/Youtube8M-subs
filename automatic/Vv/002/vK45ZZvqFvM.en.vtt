00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.510 

so<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.720> an<00:02:09.840> e<00:02:10.050> add<00:02:10.289> nine

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.370 

that's<00:02:16.520> an<00:02:16.670> e<00:02:16.820> at<00:02:17.030> 9:00<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.600> here<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.960> an<00:02:18.110> eight

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
that's an e at 9:00 and here is an eight

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.070 
that's an e at 9:00 and here is an eight
at<00:02:18.740> nine<00:02:19.070> point<00:02:19.720> instead<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.780> playing<00:02:20.990> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
at nine point instead of playing the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.660 
at nine point instead of playing the
normal<00:02:21.200> Abe<00:02:23.770> I'm<00:02:24.770> adding<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.310> nine<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
normal Abe I'm adding on this nine the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.470 
normal Abe I'm adding on this nine the
same<00:02:25.850> way<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:27.350> note<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.740> on<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.910> g<00:02:28.940> string<00:02:29.120> on

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
same way this note a on the g string on

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.610 
same way this note a on the g string on
the<00:02:29.570> second<00:02:29.840> fret<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:32.750> number<00:02:33.230> off<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the second fret is number off to the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.090 
the second fret is number off to the
fourth<00:02:33.890> fret

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
fourth fret

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:41.620

this<00:02:42.230> is<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.440> same<00:02:42.710> approach<00:02:42.980> as<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:43.370> E<00:02:43.400> chord

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:58.260 

the<00:02:47.940> fingering<00:02:48.270> looks<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:48.630> different

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:11.140 

as<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.840> nice<00:02:59.110> ring<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.500> them

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.150

here's Abby's escort that works well to

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.440 
here's Abby's escort that works well to
a<00:03:14.370> plane<00:03:15.300> almost<00:03:15.510> like<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> power<00:03:16.019> cord<00:03:17.450> heading

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
a plane almost like a power cord heading

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.809 
a plane almost like a power cord heading
on<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.560> B<00:03:19.739> note<00:03:19.920> here<00:03:20.129> with<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> pinky<00:03:20.700> on

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the fourth fret on the g string and then

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.690 
the fourth fret on the g string and then

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:44.630 

then<00:03:33.700> back<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.150> 8th<00:03:34.300> at<00:03:34.540> 9:00

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.820 

you<00:03:45.640> can<00:03:45.790> also<00:03:45.940> play<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.510> AO<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:47.050> way<00:03:47.470> if<00:03:47.739> I

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
you can also play the AO this way if I

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.490 
you can also play the AO this way if I
make<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> rush<00:03:48.580> sounding<00:03:49.060> chord<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:50.290> play<00:03:50.319> the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
make a rush sounding chord you play the

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.210 
make a rush sounding chord you play the
normal<00:03:50.920> shaped<00:03:51.760> bar<00:03:51.970> chord

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.980 

but<00:03:55.820> you<00:03:55.940> actually<00:03:56.300> let<00:03:56.480> the<00:03:56.600> bottom<00:03:56.900> two

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
but you actually let the bottom two

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.960 
but you actually let the bottom two
strings<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.440> ring<00:03:57.590> open<00:03:57.920> so<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.430> bend<00:03:58.700> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
strings to ring open so you bend the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.160 
strings to ring open so you bend the
