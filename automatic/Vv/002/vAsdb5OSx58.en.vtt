00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:42.460
 the gameplay of zombie trànsit that 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.550
 it's basically the only thing that I come 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.720
 playing black ops 2 and then we see how 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.490
 come here up here in the title 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.630
 Sorry for working a little bit, but not 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.970
 I'm talking a little fluid 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.800
 lately since I'm a little 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.010
 stressed out since I do not know whether to play call of 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.810
 duty black ops 2 or keep me updated 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.510
 at school so you can play the 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.640
 Coptic and good let's continue with the topic 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.750
 as you can see here 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.380
 how can you see up here 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.320
 sorry the issue is the achievement or interest 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.410
 greater than black ops zombies black ops or 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.229
 zombies or clear transit the good this 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.060
 achievement is called babel tower so 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.860
 Well, I bring a theory, a theory 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.080
 here developed by other people or 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.750
 a good theory that is made to me 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.340
 something logical and so that I am more 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.010
 interesting to bring you people and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.310
 what 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.810
 basically babel tower good as 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
 we know is that someone 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.980
 built the story good to see according to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.750
 the history and built a tower towards 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.740
 the sky so they can be seen so 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 great as well god or so and so says 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.909
 what 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.409
 and he's going to confuse his language so that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.930
 can not work together to build 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.110
 the tower so much confusion or in 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.050
 other senses babbling like this 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.170
 then how related how 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.900
 relate this to the tower 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.930
 babel with the good achievement because we believe or 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.819
 I think that from what we have seen images 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.730
 or videos posted by treyarch 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.510
 to what seems to be good what is in 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.650
 transit 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.189
 it looks more like a radio tower 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:25.719
 destroyed good then our work 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.920
 to make this steak I think it's 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.900
 rebuild it though it could be 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.859
 numerous types of buildings 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.580
 infrastructure for good based on the 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:40.270
 babel tower theory the achievement 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.130
 a radio tower would make more sense 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.590
 this radio tower is what we have 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 what to fix good I suppose that is what 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.370
 what we have to do to do this 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.350
 interest then we have to obey 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.120
 the voices which voices good at 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.040
 principle when you rebuild is one thing 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.990
 or when not rebuilding when 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.000
 You build a thing when you create something 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.310
 hear a voice telling you build what 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 now it is the device or this voice 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.840
 that is giving indications and then as 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.120
 says in the achievement tower of babel obeys 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.830
 to the voices the voices that indicate us 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.990
 that we have to rebuild the tower 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.860
 radio to communicate with good here 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.470
 here are several theories stories sorry 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.940
 here we can say that the tower of 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.220
 communication we can give it so that 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.700
 communicate with other survivors or 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:30.410
 to our heroes in the moon attack or ni 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.280
 with the dempsey guide or with straight end or 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.470
 with maxis or 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.340
 or I do not know anything else that can be revealed 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.530
 until the last moment we can we can 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.780
 think that it's about the good heroes 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 of these guys who are on the moon but 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.990
 because we need a radio tower 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.420
 to communicate with them if you already 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.830
 we can hear the voices or we have 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.569
 voices in the head telling us what to do 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.459
 because rays we can not communicate with 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.770
 others with the other guys who are in 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.540
 the moon we could say that the rest Zen 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.090
 but because I was going to be trying to 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.650
 help us or it could also be maxis 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.120
 but you have to take into account that he is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.310
 the one that caused all this mess all this 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.000
 chaos that was made on earth like this 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.170
 that we do not know where they come from 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.900
 come the voices forgive where 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.420
 the voices come 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.769
 but someone is telling us that 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.670
 we have to build the tower to 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.930
 communicate with someone outside the map 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.930
 the mine 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.280
 this mark lamía includes intimate 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.500
 and options on the moon that affect the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.970
 playability so we really do 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.689
 It makes us think that we are trying to 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.160
 communicate with these types 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.230
 good 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.060
 then that's all I had to 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.460
 tell them good people this is a theory 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.380
 about the tower of babel or the achievement 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.760
 of the tower of babel that we have to 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.650
 listen to the voices let's make a 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.270
 review of the theory 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.520
 this theory can say that we have to 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.259
 rebuild a tower that is lying on 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.320
 middle of the map do not know if they've seen what 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:05.800
 is 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.110
 a tower that also the voice tells you that 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.240
 you have to 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.920
 activate the electricity that when 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.110
 active you have to proceed to the next 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.480
 step then this is what also 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.490
 it does that we follow the theory of 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.530
 activate a radio tower that makes us 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.900
 communicate with other survivors 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.760
 the types on the moon of magris rector 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.710
 or any other living being or a 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.410
 special force that will rescue us 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.630
 from this place good people this has been 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.130
 everything for this video I hope you have them 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.330
 liked do not forget to subscribe like 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.430
 comment and all those who know how to do 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.430
 people except troll see you
