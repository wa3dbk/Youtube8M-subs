 part of what God is doing to 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.240
 translate the vision that I have given them 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.130
 as a congregation as a house of god not 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.960
 only for guatemala but for many 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.000
 countries of Latin America 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.790
 we've been to previous congresses of 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.180
 facts and it has been a tremendous joy 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.070
 see so many young people that good now no longer 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.110
 they are so young but they started 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.590
 teenagers and it's been like a 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.510
 generation that is in need of god and 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.420
 see how he has evolved spiritually 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.220
 our youth here in Guatemala in 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.740
 Many places we are passionate about fills us with 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.140
 so much joy and today once again be 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.890
 part of this blessing is great joy 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.409
 my parents are pastors in san marcos 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.729
 and praises to Manuel San Marcos and although 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.210
 maybe we had so many dreams 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.280
 personal dreams and promises on behalf of 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 God we were being faithful to God in 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 the vision and in the English house 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.970
 does not have 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.120
 the team praising the violation 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.690
 do 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.990
 and the bonfires in the vigils 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.780
 in the fasts and although we dreamed and 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.670
 we did well two was that one day I was going 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.850
 to spend something with us but 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.530
 we were being obedient in the vision 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.110
 from home then when we started that 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.560
 walking the Lord began to surprise us 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.360
 and being faithful to the Lord at home God 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 he began to surprise us 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.790
 began to fill with gifts of promises and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.640
 we were quite excited but always 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.460
 We were faithful at home faithful to the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.729
 called that god had us the church 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.210
 in san marcos and during a process like 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.400
 of nine years we dreamed of traveling with 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.360
 do the will of the Lord with going to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.790
 preach to young people with being in nights 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 of adoration and although we looked at it far away 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
 but during those nine years being 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.500
 faithful to God in the vision of my parents 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.040
 the mission of the god house surprised us 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.140
 and then after nine years we started 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.000
 to see the fulfillment of dreams 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.550
 personal we start to see the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.890
 fulfillment of that vision that god 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.400
 put in our heart from years ago 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.850
 I started to comply violently that's 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 the book of avacu in chapter 2 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.050
 texts in the others because it says although 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.630
 late vision 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.270
 because one day will come a day will come the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.740
 compliance we have only seen but I 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.340
 I think everything starts when someone is 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.040
 faithful in English or with skin at home has 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:14.710
 the church faithful to its parents to its 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:17.380
 shepherds god honors I think one of 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.120
 you could call them secrets I do not know how 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.220
 call him but is that our praise 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.350
 all songs are directed towards 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.870
 god towards our letters are 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.030
 focused on his word 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.250
 we have a very internal slogan that says 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.340
 his word becomes a song 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.550
 I think when I sing the word of God 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.300
 you are singing the truth you are singing 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.540
 your word and it's your word you have to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.900
 do row on so much in young children 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.750
 Elders the power of God's word 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.310
 it's so powerful awesome and something 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.340
 related to what you mentioned from 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.000
 of the vision had my mind when Jesus 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.090
 sanz to some blind people and tell them to do 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.360
 in you 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.730
 according to his faith then the vision 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.560
 it has to do a lot with faith the vision 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.780
 it comes from god they put it in your 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.050
 heart but says now uses faith 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.330
 that you have to do what I give you and 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 take it to many places depends on the 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.180
 faith of each one of us putting in 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.040
 marches the vision that God has given us and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.430
 I think it starts in frames be it 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.100
 I have been able to achieve 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.919
 maybe not 100% but we're trying 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.410
 to follow in the vision that God 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.199
 has given and keep us faithful and every time 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.770
 put him and mix him more faith be faithful 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.780
 to god where where are 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.900
 at the moment they are if maybe 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.900
 you are now 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.870
 only in a cell and your dream is because in 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.870
 stadiums 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.150
 will come to many countries or I do not know but 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.360
 right now you're just in a cell right now 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.790
 you have something that as soon as you say there is no 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.340
 another and what little you have with that is 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.350
 faithful to God in the vision of his parents 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.830
 be faithful to God and the vision of your 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.750
 pastors and then while you're in that 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.050
 process of them to put a vision 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.510
 great in you those those dreams the lord 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.720
 will be fulfilling because there I have 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.910
 seen that many young people as they yearn 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.040
 great things but they are not faithful in their 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.440
 house are not faithful with the little that 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.320
 they have are not faithful in the trial with the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.480

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.480

 send them we need to see the 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.280
 fulfillment of our vision but for 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.380

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.930
