00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
think with Pixar sequels you definitely

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.109 
think with Pixar sequels you definitely
expect<00:01:07.960> quality<00:01:08.320> especially<00:01:08.740> with<00:01:09.310> how<00:01:10.060> you

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
expect quality especially with how you

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.130 
expect quality especially with how you
know<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.540> toy<00:01:10.689> story<00:01:11.049> trilogy<00:01:11.320> went<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:13.360> I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
know the toy story trilogy went and I I

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.380 
know the toy story trilogy went and I I
think<00:01:14.799> one<00:01:14.979> of<00:01:15.010> Pixar's<00:01:15.520> greatest<00:01:16.119> skills

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
think one of Pixar's greatest skills

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.539 
think one of Pixar's greatest skills
especially<00:01:16.630> with<00:01:17.110> its<00:01:17.380> sequels<00:01:18.369> its

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
especially with its sequels its

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.320 
especially with its sequels its
franchises<00:01:19.060> is<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:20.049> it's<00:01:20.200> able<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.970> age<00:01:21.970> them

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
franchises is that it's able to age them

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.450 
franchises is that it's able to age them
up<00:01:22.570> for<00:01:22.960> you<00:01:23.259> know<00:01:23.470> their<00:01:23.650> original<00:01:24.070> target

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
and yeah I just I think that's the kind
of<00:01:37.210> humor

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
of humor

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.940 
of humor
really<00:01:38.730> relatable<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.810> us<00:01:39.990> okay<00:01:40.620> so<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
really relatable to us okay so that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.860 
really relatable to us okay so that
wasn't<00:01:41.160> planned<00:01:41.550> but<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.060> awesome<00:01:42.270> what

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
wasn't planned but that is awesome what

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.330 
wasn't planned but that is awesome what
do<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> think<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.290> blue<00:01:43.440> umbrella<00:01:43.470> that
