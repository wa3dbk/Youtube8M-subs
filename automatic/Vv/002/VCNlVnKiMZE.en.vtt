anesthesia and we use tickle lipo to
kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.060> vibrate<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> area<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.600> we're<00:01:18.869> doing

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
kind of vibrate the area as we're doing

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.080

you're<00:01:22.830> removing<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> fact<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you're removing the fact that

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.929 
you're removing the fact that
accentuates<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> projection<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.939> robotics

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
accentuates the projection of robotics

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.499 
accentuates the projection of robotics
which<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.960> side<00:01:28.590> benefit<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.310> doing<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.210> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
which is a side benefit of doing that so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.480 
which is a side benefit of doing that so
you<00:01:30.570> ain't<00:01:30.869> you're<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.710> with<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.189> your

tickle lipo I am right now I'm doing a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.050 
tickle lipo I am right now I'm doing a
little<00:01:34.770> bit<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> evidence<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.790> see<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
little bit of evidence you can see and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120 
little bit of evidence you can see and
you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.479> she's<00:01:36.750> fully<00:01:37.049> anesthetized<00:01:37.380> she

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you can see she's fully anesthetized she

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
you can see she's fully anesthetized she
doesn't<00:01:38.400> feel<00:01:38.520> anything<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:39.900> just
