house anything actually some people will
say<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.280> can<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:14.790> fighting<00:00:15.059> fish

but that is not recommended it's a small

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.570 
but that is not recommended it's a small
tank<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.449> actually<00:00:18.660> had<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.050> only<00:00:19.350> two<00:00:19.550> for<00:00:20.550> a

tank I actually had this only two for a
hospital<00:00:20.850> tank<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.769> need<00:00:23.039> gravel<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
hospital tank you will need gravel I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.490 
hospital tank you will need gravel I
have<00:00:25.170> ready<00:00:25.560> leftover<00:00:26.130> gravel<00:00:27.170> it's<00:00:28.170> not<00:00:28.320> only

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
have ready leftover gravel it's not only

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
have ready leftover gravel it's not only
for<00:00:28.800> decoration<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.150> you

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
for decoration to make it pretty you

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
for decoration to make it pretty you
can't<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.869> pretty<00:00:31.199> gravel<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:32.340> bacteria

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
can't get pretty gravel but bacteria

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.600 
can't get pretty gravel but bacteria
that<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.690> extremely<00:00:34.649> important<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.399> fish

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that is extremely important in fish

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.720 
that is extremely important in fish
keeping<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.630> bacteria<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.739> live<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
keeping the bacteria will live in it and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.860 
keeping the bacteria will live in it and
it<00:00:38.910> will<00:00:39.230> break<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:40.290> fish<00:00:41.160> waste<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.910> eat

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it will break down fish waste and eat

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.319 
it will break down fish waste and eat
ammonia<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.520> ammonia<00:00:44.789> won't<00:00:45.120> affect

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
ammonia so that the ammonia won't affect

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
ammonia so that the ammonia won't affect
your<00:00:45.450> fish<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.590> important<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> need

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
gravel you need to have a filter no

matter what kind of fish you have you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.080 
matter what kind of fish you have you
should<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> filter<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> small<00:00:56.969> one

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
should have a filter this is a small one

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.910 
should have a filter this is a small one
that<00:00:57.300> came<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.960> tanks<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.530> actually

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
that came with this tanks was actually

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.000 
that came with this tanks was actually
like<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> complete<00:00:59.879> set<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> buy

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
like a complete set thing you can buy

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.820 
like a complete set thing you can buy
this<00:01:02.010> will<00:01:02.280> collect<00:01:02.850> fish<00:01:03.239> waste<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.110> any<00:01:04.589> bad

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this will collect fish waste and any bad

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
this will collect fish waste and any bad
stuff<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.250> bacteria<00:01:05.760> will<00:01:06.000> also<00:01:06.270> live<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
stuff and bacteria will also live in the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.190 
stuff and bacteria will also live in the
filter<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:08.420> things<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:12.200> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
filter you'll have things like this you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
filter you'll have things like this you
you<00:01:13.560> put<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.729> water

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you put it in like this and the water

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.149 
you put it in like this and the water
will<00:01:15.210> run<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.009> don't

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
will run through but these things don't

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
will run through but these things don't
really<00:01:17.400> recommend<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.939> because<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
really recommend it because you have to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.070 
really recommend it because you have to
change<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.229> every<00:01:19.320> month<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.810> bacteria<00:01:21.810> live

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
change it every month and bacteria live

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.480 
change it every month and bacteria live
in<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> filter<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.920> should<00:01:23.130> live<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
in the filter they should live in the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
in the filter they should live in the
filter<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.509> help<00:01:24.689> break<00:01:24.960> down<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.290> waste<00:01:25.490> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
filter to help break down the waste you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
filter to help break down the waste you
can<00:01:26.640> buy<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.330> fluff<00:01:28.159> before<00:01:29.159> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
can buy this kind of fluff before you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
can buy this kind of fluff before you
put<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> filter<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.869> filters<00:01:31.290> are

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
put in a filter this filters are

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.870 
put in a filter this filters are
actually<00:01:31.829> built<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.189> hold<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.579> kind<00:01:32.820> of

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
actually built to hold this kind of

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
actually built to hold this kind of
stuff<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
stuff but you can do that so the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
stuff but you can do that so the
bacteria<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:36.060> live<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> will

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
bacteria will live in this and will

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.600 
bacteria will live in this and will
thrive<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:37.979> eat<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> fish

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
thrive in here it will eat the fish

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.469 
thrive in here it will eat the fish
waste<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.630> reduce<00:01:40.409> ammonium<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.579> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
waste and again reduce ammonium so you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.960 
waste and again reduce ammonium so you
don't<00:01:42.750> want<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.020> throw<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.890> every<00:01:44.220> month

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
don't want to throw this out every month

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.000 
don't want to throw this out every month
one<00:01:45.150> Winston<00:01:45.600> an<00:01:45.690> aquarium<00:01:46.110> water<00:01:46.230> filter<00:01:46.980> I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
one Winston an aquarium water filter I

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.190 
one Winston an aquarium water filter I
have<00:01:47.130> requires<00:01:47.730> an<00:01:48.000> air<00:01:48.180> pump<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.630> an<00:01:49.050> air

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
have requires an air pump and an air

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370 
have requires an air pump and an air
hose<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.070> some<00:01:51.030> filters<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.690> you<00:01:51.750> buy<00:01:52.020> will

hose so some filters that you buy will

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.870 
hose so some filters that you buy will
come<00:01:52.620> with<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.920> sometimes<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.550> have<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.760> buy

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
come with it sometimes you have to buy

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.870 
come with it sometimes you have to buy
it<00:01:53.940> separately<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:55.250> some<00:01:56.250> filters<00:01:56.640> don't

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
it separately and some filters don't

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.680 
it separately and some filters don't
require<00:01:57.270> air<00:01:57.630> pump<00:01:57.900> but<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.690> recommended

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
require air pump but it is recommended

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.530 
require air pump but it is recommended
that<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:00.900> have<00:02:01.200> some<00:02:01.470> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> air<00:02:02.790> hose<00:02:03.150> or

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that you have some kind of air hose or

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.250 
that you have some kind of air hose or
air<00:02:03.990> stone<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:06.840> bubble

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
air stone that will that will bubble

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.650 
air stone that will that will bubble
because<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> will<00:02:07.920> help<00:02:08.040> oxygen<00:02:08.640> come<00:02:09.450> into

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because that will help oxygen come into

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.650 
because that will help oxygen come into
the<00:02:09.750> water<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.200> carbon<00:02:10.619> dioxide<00:02:10.649> escape

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
the water and carbon dioxide escape

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.700 
the water and carbon dioxide escape
depending<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.170> fish<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.500> have

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
depending on what kind of fish you have

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.250 
depending on what kind of fish you have
you'll<00:02:14.250> need<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.520> heater<00:02:14.880> unless<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:16.050> live

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you'll need a heater unless you live

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.660 
you'll need a heater unless you live
somewhere<00:02:16.500> where<00:02:16.740> it's<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.040> warm<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.580> you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
know that the water temperature is what

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.310 
know that the water temperature is what
it's<00:02:20.430> supposed<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.720> reason<00:02:22.020> I'm<00:02:22.140> not

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:24.209 
this cartridge thingy to show this kind

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:26.959 
this cartridge thingy to show this kind
has<00:05:24.449> kind<00:05:24.749> of<00:05:24.809> suctioning<00:05:25.199> things<00:05:25.469> in<00:05:25.619> it<00:05:25.969> so

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
has kind of suctioning things in it so

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.850 
has kind of suctioning things in it so
just<00:05:27.449> put<00:05:27.629> in<00:05:27.749> a<00:05:27.839> corner<00:05:28.110> there<00:05:28.319> and<00:05:30.589> this<00:05:31.589> also

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
just put in a corner there and this also

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.939 
just put in a corner there and this also
has<00:05:32.279> an<00:05:32.939> air<00:05:32.999> hose<00:05:33.449> like<00:05:34.019> I<00:05:34.050> showed<00:05:34.319> earlier<00:05:34.439> so

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
has an air hose like I showed earlier so

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.859 
has an air hose like I showed earlier so
you<00:05:35.009> would<00:05:35.279> put<00:05:35.939> the<00:05:36.029> arrows<00:05:36.269> in<00:05:36.479> there<00:05:36.659> but

00:05:36.859 --> 00:05:36.869 
you would put the arrows in there but

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:38.029 
you would put the arrows in there but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
I'm not going to show that now because

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.069 
I'm not going to show that now because
filters<00:05:38.969> are<00:05:39.089> different<00:05:39.449> some<00:05:39.779> filters

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:40.079 
filters are different some filters

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:43.459 
filters are different some filters
require<00:05:40.379> that<00:05:40.559> or<00:05:40.649> not<00:05:40.739> so<00:05:41.839> some<00:05:42.839> of<00:05:42.869> them<00:05:43.199> have

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:43.469 
require that or not so some of them have

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:45.559 
require that or not so some of them have
a<00:05:43.619> cord<00:05:43.979> that<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.159> immediately<00:05:44.939> plug<00:05:45.239> in<00:05:45.360> so

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.569 
a cord that you immediately plug in so

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.649 
a cord that you immediately plug in so

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
just make sure it's on the oil heater

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:58.379 
just make sure it's on the oil heater
now<00:05:49.610> if<00:05:50.689> you<00:05:51.689> need<00:05:51.899> a<00:05:51.959> heater

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.689 

now<00:05:58.990> for<00:05:59.199> the<00:05:59.259> heater<00:05:59.469> for<00:06:00.129> the<00:06:00.189> heater<00:06:00.430> you

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
now for the heater for the heater you

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.580 
now for the heater for the heater you
would<00:06:00.879> put<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.210> somewhere<00:06:01.569> where<00:06:01.990> they<00:06:02.469> get

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
would put it somewhere where they get

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.420 
would put it somewhere where they get
school<00:06:03.900> close<00:06:04.900> to<00:06:05.139> the<00:06:05.289> tank<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:06.120> filter<00:06:08.430> like

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
school close to the tank a filter like

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.689
