swing<00:01:24.270> check<00:01:24.600> valve<00:01:25.070> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
swing check valve you can see how the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.219 
swing check valve you can see how the
water<00:01:26.759> gets<00:01:27.119> routed<00:01:27.360> behind<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> pressure

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
water gets routed behind the pressure

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
water gets routed behind the pressure
tank<00:01:28.619> away<00:01:28.890> from<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> goes

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
tank away from it and then it goes

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340 
tank away from it and then it goes
through<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.890> conventional<00:01:33.049> gate<00:01:34.049> valve

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
through just a conventional gate valve

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.700 
through just a conventional gate valve
over<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.340> use<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> set<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> off

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
over here that we can use to set it off

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.410 
over here that we can use to set it off
through<00:01:37.710> another<00:01:38.040> Union<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
through another Union and then up this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.469 
through another Union and then up this
elbow<00:01:40.820> then<00:01:41.820> there's<00:01:42.110> 12<00:01:43.110> feet<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.740> rise<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:45.210> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
elbow then there's 12 feet of rise up to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.499 
elbow then there's 12 feet of rise up to
the<00:01:45.689> point<00:01:45.869> where<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.790> water<00:01:48.000> starts<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> flow

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the point where the water starts to flow

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.850 
the point where the water starts to flow
downhill<00:01:48.930> into<00:01:49.409> our<00:01:49.770> collection<00:01:50.220> reservoir

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
downhill into our collection reservoir

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.080 
downhill into our collection reservoir
you<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> cycles<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.720> are

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you can see that the cycles of this are

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.990 
you can see that the cycles of this are
about<00:01:57.090> three<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.540> four<00:01:57.689> seconds<00:01:58.140> long

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.819 

most<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.179> the<00:02:02.270> lighter<00:02:02.450> gets<00:02:02.810> used<00:02:03.109> as<00:02:03.259> ways<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
most of the lighter gets used as ways to

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.990 
most of the lighter gets used as ways to
drive<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:04.700> pump<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:07.429> pressure<00:02:07.670> can't

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
drive the pump the pressure can't

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.600 
drive the pump the pressure can't
collect<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.989> extra<00:02:09.619> pressure<00:02:09.800> of<00:02:10.099> water<00:02:10.250> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
collect the extra pressure of water and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
collect the extra pressure of water and
helps<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.940> push<00:02:11.950> any<00:02:12.950> excess<00:02:13.720> up<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.050> pipe

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
helps to push any excess up the pipe

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.390 
helps to push any excess up the pipe
so<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.709> get<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> little<00:02:16.310> bit<00:02:16.459> free<00:02:16.849> cycle<00:02:21.400> you

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so you get a little bit free cycle you

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.800 
so you get a little bit free cycle you
can<00:02:22.549> kind<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.849> hear<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.180> swing<00:02:23.480> check<00:02:23.780> valve

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
can kind of hear the swing check valve

valve<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.140> does<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:46.459> one's<00:02:46.700> a

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
valve and it does just that this one's a

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.509 
valve and it does just that this one's a
little<00:02:46.940> different<00:02:47.090> to<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:48.620> Rye<00:02:48.799> fram's<00:02:49.160> or

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
little different to the Rye fram's or

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.280 
little different to the Rye fram's or
more<00:02:50.209> expensive<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.660> operates<00:02:53.930> on<00:02:54.230> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
more expensive but it operates on the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.089 
more expensive but it operates on the
same<00:02:54.410> principle<00:02:55.150> and<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.599> just<00:02:57.349> almost

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
same principle and it's just almost

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.330 
same principle and it's just almost
exactly<00:02:58.610> like<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:59.440> boost<00:03:00.440> converter<00:03:00.620> and

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
exactly like a boost converter and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.599 
exactly like a boost converter and
electronic<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.680> kind<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.040> see<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.280> working

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
electronic and kind of see it working

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.110 
electronic and kind of see it working
from<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.819> angle<00:03:06.579> it's<00:03:07.579> like<00:03:07.760> we'll<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:08.060> to

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
from that angle it's like we'll have to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.069 
from that angle it's like we'll have to
extend<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.609> waste<00:03:10.609> container<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.660> little

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
extend the waste container a little

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.450 
extend the waste container a little
higher<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.500> collect<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:13.190> little<00:03:14.150> more<00:03:14.420> water

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
higher to collect a little more water

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.550 
higher to collect a little more water

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.980 

and<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.130> see<00:03:22.280> that<00:03:22.459> foot<00:03:23.150> valve<00:03:23.360> open<00:03:23.810> and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
and to see that foot valve open and

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.190 
and to see that foot valve open and
close<00:03:25.000> closes<00:03:26.000> rather<00:03:26.209> suddenly

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
the slacker valve air valve I picked a

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.909 
the slacker valve air valve I picked a
little<00:04:24.970> grating<00:04:25.870> screen<00:04:26.229> off<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.710> top<00:04:26.889> of

little grating screen off of the top of

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.110 
little grating screen off of the top of
that<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:27.610> could<00:04:27.760> clean<00:04:28.720> out<00:04:28.930> trash<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.120> so

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
that so you could clean out trash and so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.060 
that so you could clean out trash and so
it<00:04:31.270> could<00:04:31.389> let<00:04:31.570> debris<00:04:31.960> go<00:04:32.229> through<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.919> not

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
it could let debris go through and not

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.220 
it could let debris go through and not
stop<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.970> up<00:04:34.090> together

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
a lot nicer view than some of the other

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
idea for the schematic for this they

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.140 
idea for the schematic for this they
have<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.480> little<00:04:50.810> one-inch<00:04:51.020> one<00:04:51.500> but<00:04:51.910> you<00:04:52.910> can't

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
have a little one-inch one but you can't

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.820 
have a little one-inch one but you can't
really<00:04:53.360> tell<00:04:53.630> where<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.020> water's<00:04:54.350> coming<00:04:54.440> and

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
really tell where the water's coming and

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.380 
really tell where the water's coming and
where<00:04:54.950> it's<00:04:55.130> going<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:55.850> they<00:04:55.910> don't<00:04:56.090> they

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
where it's going to and they don't they

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.000 
where it's going to and they don't they
don't<00:04:56.420> really<00:04:56.690> tell<00:04:56.990> you<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:59.710> hard<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.860> know

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
don't really tell you so hard to know

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
don't really tell you so hard to know
what<00:05:01.250> your<00:05:01.430> fishing<00:05:01.910> is<00:05:03.520> most<00:05:04.520> of<00:05:04.700> these<00:05:04.790> they

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
what your fishing is most of these they

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.520 
what your fishing is most of these they
say<00:05:05.500> get<00:05:06.500> about<00:05:06.680> a<00:05:06.740> 20%<00:05:07.520> efficiency<00:05:08.530> cycles

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
say get about a 20% efficiency cycles

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.860 
say get about a 20% efficiency cycles
with<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.770> smaller<00:05:10.190> pumps<00:05:10.730> are<00:05:10.970> anywhere<00:05:11.420> from<00:05:11.660> 1

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
with a smaller pumps are anywhere from 1

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.720 
with a smaller pumps are anywhere from 1
to<00:05:11.900> 2<00:05:12.200> seconds<00:05:12.710> each<00:05:12.890> this<00:05:13.250> one's<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.610> lot

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
to 2 seconds each this one's a lot

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.860 
to 2 seconds each this one's a lot
larger<00:05:14.240> so<00:05:15.220> see<00:05:16.220> this<00:05:17.320> more<00:05:19.420> more<00:05:20.420> time<00:05:20.630> is

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
larger so see this more more time is

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.430 
larger so see this more more time is
required<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.910> fill<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:23.060> volume<00:05:23.600> of<00:05:23.750> water

essentially<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.320> get<00:05:36.590> free<00:05:37.190> water<00:05:37.460> up<00:05:37.850> at<00:05:38.030> the

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
essentially you get free water up at the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.330 
essentially you get free water up at the
head<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:38.870> now<00:05:39.200> we'll<00:05:39.710> go<00:05:39.830> down<00:05:40.040> to<00:05:40.160> the<00:05:40.250> other

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
head so now we'll go down to the other

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.260 
head so now we'll go down to the other
side<00:05:40.670> and<00:05:40.910> see<00:05:41.150> what<00:05:41.300> our<00:05:41.330> yield<00:05:41.660> is<00:05:41.870> for<00:05:42.110> this
