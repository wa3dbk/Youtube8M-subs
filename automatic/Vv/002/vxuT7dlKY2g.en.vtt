you<00:04:56.980> know<00:04:57.310> in<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:58.150> UK<00:04:58.480> i<00:04:58.510> completely

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
you know in the UK i completely

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.900 
you know in the UK i completely
understand<00:04:59.650> its<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.130> know<00:05:00.220> three<00:05:00.490> points<00:05:00.790> for

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
understand its you know three points for

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.120 
understand its you know three points for
when<00:05:01.120> one<00:05:01.360> point<00:05:01.570> per<00:05:01.690> jar<00:05:01.900> all<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.230> I<00:05:02.440> guys<00:05:02.980> see

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
when one point per jar all so I guys see

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.890 
when one point per jar all so I guys see
where<00:05:03.280> they<00:05:03.370> were<00:05:03.430> coming<00:05:03.610> from<00:05:03.790> but<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.450> way

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
where they were coming from but the way

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.690 
where they were coming from but the way
the<00:05:05.080> rules<00:05:05.350> were<00:05:05.530> stated<00:05:05.920> all<00:05:06.310> right<00:05:06.460> I

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
the rules were stated all right I

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.270 
the rules were stated all right I
definitely<00:05:07.420> think<00:05:07.870> we<00:05:08.200> have<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.770> rearrange

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
definitely think we have to rearrange

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.370 
definitely think we have to rearrange
that<00:05:09.610> around<00:05:09.880> African<00:05:10.270> yeah<00:05:10.480> we're<00:05:11.080> gonna<00:05:11.170> do

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
that around African yeah we're gonna do

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.320 
that around African yeah we're gonna do
football<00:05:11.980> soccer<00:05:12.430> stuff<00:05:12.880> we're<00:05:13.060> gonna<00:05:13.180> have

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
football soccer stuff we're gonna have

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.150 
football soccer stuff we're gonna have
to<00:05:13.420> probably<00:05:13.600> do<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.080> way<00:05:14.170> they<00:05:14.320> say<00:05:14.770> we<00:05:14.980> do

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
to probably do it the way they say we do

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.550 
to probably do it the way they say we do
that<00:05:15.400> makes<00:05:16.270> more<00:05:16.420> sense<00:05:16.480> makes<00:05:17.140> more<00:05:17.320> sense

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
that makes more sense makes more sense

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.830 
that makes more sense makes more sense
yeah<00:05:18.310> what<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.790> mean<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.300> know<00:05:19.360> what<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:19.630> live

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
and you learn you got to try once and

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.460 
and you learn you got to try once and
then<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:21.550> can<00:05:21.730> legit<00:05:22.600> states<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.290> so

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
then you can legit states and so

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.990 
then you can legit states and so
definitely<00:05:23.890> all<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.370> future<00:05:24.550> stuff<00:05:24.820> will<00:05:24.910> be

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000
