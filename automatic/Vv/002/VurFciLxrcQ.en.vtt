greetings YouTube today I'm doing a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.549 
greetings YouTube today I'm doing a
plug-in<00:00:08.610> showcase<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.389> leveled<00:00:09.840> mobs<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.380> what

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
plug-in showcase on leveled mobs so what

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.470 
plug-in showcase on leveled mobs so what
does<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:11.040> well<00:00:11.309> if<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.670> hoped<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:12.090> this

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
does this do well if we hoped with this

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.810 
does this do well if we hoped with this
pic<00:00:12.719> here<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.110> says<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:13.980> level<00:00:14.280> they<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
pic here it says what level they are and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.140 
pic here it says what level they are and
their<00:00:15.299> health<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:17.279> further<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:18.090> away

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
their health so the further you get away

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.929 
their health so the further you get away
from<00:00:18.420> predefined<00:00:19.380> spawns<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.279> higher<00:00:20.760> their

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
from predefined spawns the higher their

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.029 
from predefined spawns the higher their
level<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.539> higher<00:00:21.720> their<00:00:21.930> health<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
level the higher their health and the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
level the higher their health and the
higher<00:00:23.220> XP<00:00:23.670> they<00:00:23.880> grow<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.180> early<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.840> get

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
higher XP they grow up so early to get

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.500 
higher XP they grow up so early to get
into<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> config<00:00:25.789> here<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.000> love<00:00:27.750> mobs<00:00:29.510> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
into the config here it is love mobs so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.870 
into the config here it is love mobs so
to<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.289> this<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.160> LM<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
to get this up you can want to do LM and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.290 
to get this up you can want to do LM and
then<00:00:33.090> setup<00:00:34.130> there<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.760> says<00:00:36.059> level

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
then setup there we go it says level

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.600 
then setup there we go it says level
months<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.660> been<00:00:36.809> set<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.100> that's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
months have been set up and the that's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
months have been set up and the that's
how<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.809> here<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.469> go<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
how you get this so here we go that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.850 
how you get this so here we go that's
scroll<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> top<00:00:42.170> distance<00:00:43.170> away<00:00:43.469> from

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
scroll to the top distance away from

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
scroll to the top distance away from
each<00:00:44.520> spawn<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:47.550> jump<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.120> new<00:00:48.300> level

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
each spawn that they jump up a new level

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
each spawn that they jump up a new level
so<00:00:49.020> every<00:00:49.680> 20<00:00:50.010> blocks<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:50.760> level<00:00:50.910> 1

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
so every 20 blocks will go from level 1

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.310 
so every 20 blocks will go from level 1
to<00:00:51.210> 2<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> 3<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.020> 4<00:00:52.170> 5<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.129> 6<00:00:53.719> multiplier<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
to 2 to 3 to 4 5 to 6 multiplier this is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.270 
to 2 to 3 to 4 5 to 6 multiplier this is
8<00:00:56.160> times<00:00:56.610> its<00:00:56.820> health<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:59.010> staff

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
8 times its health by that so the staff

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810 
8 times its health by that so the staff
would<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.750> health<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> 2.4

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
would like to health and then go to 2.4

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.859 
would like to health and then go to 2.4
and<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> 2.8<00:01:03.539> etc<00:01:04.970> XP<00:01:05.970> multiplier<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.720> very

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and and 2.8 etc XP multiplier it's very

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.660 
and and 2.8 etc XP multiplier it's very
simple<00:01:07.229> damage<00:01:07.650> multiplier<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.460> more

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
simple damage multiplier so they do more

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
simple damage multiplier so they do more
damage<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:10.080> understand

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
damage to you you probably understand

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.890 
damage to you you probably understand
that<00:01:10.590> quite<00:01:10.799> low<00:01:13.010> visibility<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.340> seeing<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
that quite low visibility of seeing the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.039 
that quite low visibility of seeing the
bar<00:01:16.680> above<00:01:17.040> their<00:01:17.250> head<00:01:17.659> probably<00:01:18.659> done<00:01:18.930> on

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
bar above their head probably done on

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.160 
bar above their head probably done on
that<00:01:19.229> too<00:01:19.530> high<00:01:19.830> cuz<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> give<00:01:21.030> enemy<00:01:21.659> position

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
that too high cuz it give enemy position

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.060 
that too high cuz it give enemy position
away<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:23.880> 5<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.509> spawn<00:01:25.439> points<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.009> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
away so that's 5 a spawn points this is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.330 
away so that's 5 a spawn points this is
a<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.400> important<00:01:26.820> thing<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:28.049> you'll<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.040> 2

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
a very important thing so you'll get 2

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060 
a very important thing so you'll get 2
to<00:01:29.490> begin<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.270> copy<00:01:30.659> them<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.710> rename

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
to begin with you copy them you rename

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.120 
to begin with you copy them you rename
them<00:01:32.310> 2<00:01:32.460> 3<00:01:32.759> 4<00:01:33.090> 5<00:01:33.299> etc<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.610> change

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
them 2 3 4 5 etc and then you can change

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.789 
them 2 3 4 5 etc and then you can change
them<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.329> let's<00:01:39.329> go<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:41.659> walk<00:01:42.659> north<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.470> get

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
them so let's go to walk north and get

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.749 
them so let's go to walk north and get
the<00:01:44.220> coordinates<00:01:44.759> appear<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the coordinates appear so what is it it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
the coordinates appear so what is it it
is<00:01:49.460> -<00:01:50.460> 7<00:01:50.790> 7<00:01:51.119> 8

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
is - 7 7 8

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.640 
is - 7 7 8
-<00:01:53.010> mhmm<00:01:53.580> eight<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.480> sixty-eight<00:01:55.050> again

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
- mhmm eight and then sixty-eight again

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.760 
- mhmm eight and then sixty-eight again
and<00:01:57.260> Zed<00:01:58.260> is<00:02:00.200> four<00:02:01.280> five<00:02:02.280> nine<00:02:03.140> there<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.260> go<00:02:04.500> so

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and Zed is four five nine there we go so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.400 
and Zed is four five nine there we go so
save<00:02:04.980> that<00:02:06.590> yep<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.880> let's<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
save that yep and then let's look at the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.770 
save that yep and then let's look at the
rest<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.740> convict<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.660> into

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
rest of the convict so now we get into

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.570 
rest of the convict so now we get into
more<00:02:12.960> things<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.710> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.190> very<00:02:14.490> very

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
more things so this is very very

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.520 
more things so this is very very
straightforward<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.450> add<00:02:15.900> giants

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
straightforward you can add giants

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
straightforward you can add giants
that's<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.370> cool<00:02:17.520> feature<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.090> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
that's a really cool feature and the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.900 
that's a really cool feature and the
chance<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.440> people<00:02:19.650> having<00:02:20.100> armor<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.850> you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
chance of people having armor so you

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.080 
chance of people having armor so you
might<00:02:21.240> want<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.420> say<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.690> quite<00:02:21.870> high<00:02:23.090> number

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
might want to say that quite high number

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.020 
might want to say that quite high number
of<00:02:24.180> levels<00:02:24.570> before<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.490> new<00:02:26.670> tier

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
of levels before they get the new tier
