see what you guys thought about it cuz

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.719 
see what you guys thought about it cuz
like<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.530> said<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.369> think<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
like I said I just I don't think it's

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.039 
like I said I just I don't think it's
legit<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.180> we'll<00:01:36.270> have<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> wait<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.689> see<00:01:36.810> so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
legit but we'll have to wait and see so

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
legit but we'll have to wait and see so
anyway<00:01:37.680> what<00:01:38.100> he's<00:01:38.280> claiming<00:01:38.579> number<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
anyway what he's claiming number one is

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
anyway what he's claiming number one is
it's<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.869> next<00:01:40.259> gen<00:01:40.619> only<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> don't

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
it's gonna be next gen only and I don't

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
it's gonna be next gen only and I don't
think<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.659> that's<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> case<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.649> K<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.100> fact

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
think that that's the case and K in fact

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
think that that's the case and K in fact
I<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.119> they<00:01:45.240> did<00:01:45.450> announce<00:01:45.689> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
I think that they did announce it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.139 
I think that they did announce it's
gonna<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.200> multi-platform<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.970> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
gonna be multi-platform I think that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.609 
gonna be multi-platform I think that
that's<00:01:48.329> something<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.840> may<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.049> coming<00:01:49.380> in

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that's something that may be coming in

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
that's something that may be coming in
the<00:01:49.740> near<00:01:49.920> future<00:01:50.189> though<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:51.149> some

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
the near future though I think some

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.690 
the near future though I think some
games<00:01:51.659> some<00:01:52.020> series<00:01:52.409> might<00:01:52.740> they'll<00:01:53.220> start

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
games some series might they'll start

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
games some series might they'll start
thinking<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.090> switching<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> next

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
thinking about switching over to next

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
thinking about switching over to next
gen<00:01:55.500> only<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.090> previous<00:01:57.420> gen

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
gen only because you know previous gen

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.330 
gen only because you know previous gen
is<00:01:57.990> gonna<00:01:58.140> start<00:01:58.380> becoming<00:01:58.649> extinct<00:01:59.219> after

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
is gonna start becoming extinct after

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
is gonna start becoming extinct after
the<00:01:59.549> next<00:01:59.759> couple<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> years<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.420> should

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the next couple of years so that should

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
the next couple of years so that should
be<00:02:00.630> interesting<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.259> works<00:02:01.409> out

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
be interesting how that works out

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.010 
be interesting how that works out
he<00:02:02.159> says<00:02:02.369> campaign<00:02:02.820> looks<00:02:03.030> gorgeous<00:02:03.240> best

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
he says campaign looks gorgeous best

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.350 
he says campaign looks gorgeous best
graphics<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.950> cod<00:02:05.189> state<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.119> three

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
graphics in a cod state and the three

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
graphics in a cod state and the three
year<00:02:06.509> cycle<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:07.020> helped<00:02:07.380> graphics<00:02:08.069> are

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
year cycle really helped graphics are

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.369 
year cycle really helped graphics are
better<00:02:08.520> than<00:02:09.000> advanced<00:02:09.539> warfare<00:02:09.959> by<00:02:10.110> quite<00:02:10.349> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
better than advanced warfare by quite a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.320 
better than advanced warfare by quite a
bit<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.640> pretty<00:02:11.910> cool<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.270> know

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
bit so that's pretty cool you know

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.650 
bit so that's pretty cool you know
advanced<00:02:12.629> warfare<00:02:13.020> graphics<00:02:13.379> were

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
advanced warfare graphics were

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.820 
advanced warfare graphics were
really<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:13.930> good<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.320> hopefully<00:02:14.650> that's

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
really really good so hopefully that's

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.580 
really really good so hopefully that's
the<00:02:14.890> case<00:02:15.150> next<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.390> he<00:02:16.480> says<00:02:16.690> campaign<00:02:17.410> will

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
the case next up he says campaign will

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.220 
the case next up he says campaign will
have<00:02:17.710> an<00:02:17.830> open<00:02:18.310> world<00:02:18.790> but<00:02:19.480> missions<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.200> be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
have an open world but missions to be

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.080 
have an open world but missions to be
somewhat<00:02:20.770> linear<00:02:20.980> will<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> ton<00:02:22.060> of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
somewhat linear will have a ton of

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.750 
somewhat linear will have a ton of
collectables<00:02:22.750> exosuit<00:02:23.650> as<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> jetpack<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.640> get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
collectables exosuit as a jetpack to get

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.240 
collectables exosuit as a jetpack to get
around<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> world<00:02:25.270> easier<00:02:25.570> uh-oh<00:02:26.320> EXO<00:02:27.010> suits

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
around the world easier uh-oh EXO suits

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
around the world easier uh-oh EXO suits
and<00:02:27.430> jetpacks<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.750> campaign<00:02:29.170> will

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
and jetpacks and then that campaign will

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.630 
and jetpacks and then that campaign will
have<00:02:29.380> multiple<00:02:29.800> main<00:02:29.980> characters<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.520> can

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
have multiple main characters you can

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.910 
have multiple main characters you can
switch<00:02:30.910> between<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.690> add<00:02:31.840> an<00:02:32.050> extra<00:02:32.440> layer<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
switch between to add an extra layer to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.490 
switch between to add an extra layer to
mission<00:02:33.520> variety<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.480> what<00:02:35.080> does<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.200> sound

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
mission variety so what does that sound

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.010 
mission variety so what does that sound
like<00:02:35.620> Grand<00:02:36.370> Theft<00:02:36.460> Auto<00:02:36.760> 5<00:02:37.120> an<00:02:37.390> open<00:02:37.810> world

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
like Grand Theft Auto 5 an open world

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.510 
like Grand Theft Auto 5 an open world
but<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> missions<00:02:38.770> are<00:02:38.920> linear<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.430> you've

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
but the missions are linear and you've

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.920 
but the missions are linear and you've
got<00:02:39.670> multiple<00:02:39.880> characters<00:02:40.510> you<00:02:40.600> can<00:02:40.720> switch

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
got multiple characters you can switch

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.840 
got multiple characters you can switch
through<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.680> actually<00:02:42.040> sounds<00:02:42.430> pretty<00:02:42.640> cool

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
through that actually sounds pretty cool

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.120 
through that actually sounds pretty cool
but<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.450> don't<00:02:43.540> know<00:02:43.780> like<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.980> seems

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
but I don't know like it just seems

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.800 
but I don't know like it just seems
weird<00:02:45.220> for<00:02:45.490> call<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.060> campaign<00:02:46.480> called

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
weird for call to the campaign called

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.480 
weird for call to the campaign called
video<00:02:47.020> campaigns<00:02:47.380> never<00:02:47.740> been<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
video campaigns never been like that I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.010 
video campaigns never been like that I
feel<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.730> they<00:02:48.910> wouldn't<00:02:49.240> make<00:02:49.330> like<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> huge

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
feel like they wouldn't make like a huge

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.650 
feel like they wouldn't make like a huge
change<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.680> campaign<00:02:51.310> overnight<00:02:52.240> like<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
change to campaign overnight like that

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.000

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.290 
asking for for a long time there are a
lot<00:04:20.020> of<00:04:20.049> games<00:04:20.410> out<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:20.650> that<00:04:20.890> have<00:04:21.640> custom

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
lot of games out there that have custom

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.540 
lot of games out there that have custom
map<00:04:22.539> editors<00:04:22.990> look<00:04:23.289> at<00:04:23.440> GTA<00:04:23.830> look<00:04:24.250> at<00:04:24.400> like

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
map editors look at GTA look at like

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.850 
map editors look at GTA look at like
old-school<00:04:25.270> games<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:25.870> skate<00:04:26.169> three<00:04:26.560> like

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
old-school games like skate three like

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.430 
old-school games like skate three like
there

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
there

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.810 
there
a lot<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.710> games<00:04:27.980> out<00:04:28.190> there<00:04:28.430> they<00:04:28.790> have

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
a lot of games out there they have

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.640 
a lot of games out there they have
custom<00:04:29.390> map<00:04:29.540> editors<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.200> think<00:04:30.500> that

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
custom map editors and I think that

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.560 
custom map editors and I think that
would<00:04:30.800> be<00:04:30.830> awesome<00:04:31.130> to<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.030> able<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.240> make<00:04:32.420> our

like<00:04:42.410> across<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.310> border<00:04:43.550> maps<00:04:43.700> guys

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
like across the border maps guys

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.430 
like across the border maps guys
remember<00:04:44.090> playing<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.420> back<00:04:44.660> in<00:04:44.840> cod4<00:04:45.050> and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
remember playing that back in cod4 and

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.200 
remember playing that back in cod4 and
overgrown<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.280> stuff<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:46.790> that<00:04:47.000> there

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
overgrown like stuff like that there

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.580 
overgrown like stuff like that there
would<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.690> much<00:04:47.960> more<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.320> you<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.440> do

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
would be so much more that you can do

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.500 
would be so much more that you can do
you<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.740> think<00:04:48.980> about<00:04:49.040> all<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.460> different

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
you know think about all the different

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.420 
you know think about all the different
maps<00:04:50.510> on<00:04:50.780> foundry<00:04:51.320> in<00:04:51.470> Halo<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.040> stuff<00:04:52.310> like

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
maps on foundry in Halo and stuff like

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.980 
maps on foundry in Halo and stuff like
that<00:04:52.670> like<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:53.030> would<00:04:53.120> be<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.420> think<00:04:53.630> that<00:04:53.930> would

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
that like it would be I think that would

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.570 
that like it would be I think that would
totally<00:04:54.470> take<00:04:54.650> called<00:04:54.920> leads<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.340> next

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
totally take called leads to the next

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.920 
totally take called leads to the next
level<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:55.910> if<00:04:56.060> there's<00:04:56.240> anything<00:04:56.600> that's

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
level and if there's anything that's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.840 
level and if there's anything that's
true<00:04:57.170> about<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:57.500> post<00:04:57.740> I've<00:04:58.100> got<00:04:58.340> my<00:04:58.460> fingers

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
true about this post I've got my fingers

crossed that that said because that

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.410 
crossed that that said because that
would<00:05:00.680> be<00:05:00.770> pretty<00:05:00.800> insane<00:05:01.280> now<00:05:01.580> next<00:05:02.150> up<00:05:02.300> he

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
would be pretty insane now next up he

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.910 
would be pretty insane now next up he
says<00:05:02.600> there<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.780> gonna<00:05:03.050> be<00:05:03.200> picked<00:05:03.410> 30<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:03.800> the

aren't<00:05:09.110> gonna<00:05:09.200> be<00:05:09.320> including<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.680> game<00:05:09.860> I

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
aren't gonna be including the game I

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.530 
aren't gonna be including the game I
could<00:05:10.550> see<00:05:10.700> that<00:05:10.820> being<00:05:11.000> legit<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.450> know

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
could see that being legit you know

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.140 
could see that being legit you know
obviously<00:05:11.960> pick<00:05:12.830> 13<00:05:13.190> will<00:05:13.400> probably<00:05:13.910> stay

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
obviously pick 13 will probably stay

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.120 
obviously pick 13 will probably stay
around<00:05:14.390> forever<00:05:14.870> or<00:05:15.320> picked<00:05:15.560> in<00:05:15.740> or<00:05:15.860> whatever

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
pick system it is I don't see the call

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.600 
pick system it is I don't see the call
to<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.080> create<00:05:18.200> classes<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.800> going<00:05:19.280> back<00:05:19.460> to

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
to to create classes and going back to

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.090 
to to create classes and going back to
the<00:05:19.730> old<00:05:19.910> way<00:05:20.150> because<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.290> new<00:05:21.440> pick<00:05:21.650> 13

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
the old way because the the new pick 13

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.950 
the old way because the the new pick 13
system<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.640> it<00:05:22.850> allows<00:05:23.060> for<00:05:23.270> so<00:05:23.510> much<00:05:23.720> more

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
system just it allows for so much more

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.170 
system just it allows for so much more
variety<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:24.740> customization<00:05:25.670> in<00:05:25.820> your<00:05:25.970> class

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
variety and customization in your class

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.400 
variety and customization in your class
in<00:05:26.390> different<00:05:26.690> ways<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.900> play<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.140> game<00:05:27.170> so

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
in different ways to play the game so

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.530 
in different ways to play the game so
that's<00:05:27.470> pretty<00:05:27.680> cool<00:05:27.950> next<00:05:28.670> up<00:05:28.760> he<00:05:28.850> says<00:05:29.030> maps

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
that's pretty cool next up he says maps

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.720 
that's pretty cool next up he says maps

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.730 
two parter maps similar to recovery from
advanced<00:05:41.300> warfare<00:05:41.360> but<00:05:42.140> is<00:05:42.260> struggling<00:05:42.530> to

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
advanced warfare but is struggling to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.140 
advanced warfare but is struggling to
find<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.040> right<00:05:43.070> balanced<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:43.700> those<00:05:43.880> may<00:05:44.120> be

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
find the right balanced and those may be

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.140 
find the right balanced and those may be
axed<00:05:44.780> for<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.410> release<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.070> this<00:05:46.970> is

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
axed for the release so this is

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.550 
axed for the release so this is
something<00:05:47.510> that<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:47.720> could<00:05:47.960> see<00:05:48.140> going<00:05:48.320> both

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
something that I could see going both

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.070 
something that I could see going both
ways<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:49.040> does<00:05:49.280> seem<00:05:49.580> like<00:05:49.750> interactivity<00:05:50.750> it

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
ways it does seem like interactivity it

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.080 
ways it does seem like interactivity it
is<00:05:51.380> kind<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.770> the<00:05:51.890> way<00:05:52.070> of<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.520> future<00:05:52.910> with

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
is kind of the way of the future with

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.570 
is kind of the way of the future with
call<00:05:53.300> duty<00:05:53.570> like<00:05:53.720> we<00:05:54.080> really<00:05:54.410> started<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:55.430> see

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
call duty like we really started to see

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.250 
call duty like we really started to see
this<00:05:55.730> in<00:05:55.970> ghosts<00:05:56.480> with<00:05:56.630> like<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.960> different

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
this in ghosts with like the different

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.750 
this in ghosts with like the different
doors<00:05:57.500> you<00:05:57.680> could<00:05:57.770> blow<00:05:57.919> up<00:05:58.040> with<00:05:58.160> the<00:05:58.250> c4<00:05:58.640> and

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
doors you could blow up with the c4 and

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.800 
doors you could blow up with the c4 and
kind<00:05:58.940> of<00:05:59.000> breach<00:05:59.210> although<00:05:59.480> you<00:05:59.540> like<00:05:59.720> the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
kind of breach although you like the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.350 
kind of breach although you like the
walls<00:06:00.050> on<00:06:00.290> octane<00:06:00.710> and<00:06:00.919> stuff<00:06:01.100> like<00:06:01.280> that<00:06:01.550> and

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
walls on octane and stuff like that and

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.700 
walls on octane and stuff like that and
then<00:06:02.600> now<00:06:02.750> we're<00:06:02.930> seeing<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.230> in<00:06:03.320> advanced

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
then now we're seeing it in advanced

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.830 
then now we're seeing it in advanced
warfare<00:06:03.860> with<00:06:04.669> you<00:06:04.910> know<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.240> two-part

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
warfare with you know the the two-part

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.210 
warfare with you know the the two-part
map<00:06:05.990> like<00:06:06.200> recovery<00:06:06.620> or<00:06:06.770> you<00:06:06.830> know<00:06:06.919> all<00:06:07.070> the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
map like recovery or you know all the

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.380 
map like recovery or you know all the
other<00:06:07.310> stuff<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.669> see<00:06:07.850> going<00:06:08.030> on<00:06:08.120> like<00:06:08.300> the

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
other stuff to see going on like the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.180 
other stuff to see going on like the
floods<00:06:08.630> that<00:06:08.840> come<00:06:09.050> in<00:06:09.200> and<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.710> tidal<00:06:09.950> wave

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
floods that come in and the tidal wave

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.110 
floods that come in and the tidal wave
and<00:06:10.310> all<00:06:10.430> that<00:06:10.520> kind<00:06:10.669> of<00:06:10.700> stuff<00:06:10.880> so<00:06:10.910> I

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
and all that kind of stuff so I

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.820 
and all that kind of stuff so I
definitely<00:06:11.720> think<00:06:11.960> there<00:06:12.169> is<00:06:12.290> gonna<00:06:12.440> be<00:06:12.590> some

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
definitely think there is gonna be some

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.100 
definitely think there is gonna be some
interactivity<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.610> you<00:06:14.390> know<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.660> next<00:06:14.870> game

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
interactivity in you know the next game

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.990 
interactivity in you know the next game
but<00:06:15.530> I'm<00:06:15.740> not<00:06:15.919> sure<00:06:16.220> you<00:06:16.460> know<00:06:16.580> just<00:06:16.610> how<00:06:16.850> much

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
but I'm not sure you know just how much

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.760 
but I'm not sure you know just how much
there's<00:06:17.240> gonna<00:06:17.360> be<00:06:17.510> a<00:06:17.660> next<00:06:18.110> if<00:06:18.320> he<00:06:18.380> says<00:06:18.560> it's

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
there's gonna be a next if he says it's

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.550 
there's gonna be a next if he says it's

he says that maps in general are much

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.670 
he says that maps in general are much
larger<00:06:34.790> than<00:06:35.030> advanced<00:06:35.600> warfare<00:06:36.050> and<00:06:36.200> it's

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
larger than advanced warfare and it's

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.750 
larger than advanced warfare and it's
going<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.890> be<00:06:37.010> 16<00:06:37.610> verses<00:06:38.060> 16<00:06:38.630> and<00:06:39.260> 32
