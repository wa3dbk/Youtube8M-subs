it's gonna be a geocache
cuz<00:02:13.960> they're<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> emails<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:15.010> set<00:02:15.220> off

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
cuz they're one of the emails to set off

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.350 
cuz they're one of the emails to set off
like<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.660> was<00:02:16.840> digging<00:02:17.200> around<00:02:17.460> digging<00:02:18.460> holes

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
like I was digging around digging holes

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.530 
like I was digging around digging holes
everywhere<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.050> he<00:02:20.140> was<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.410> who<00:02:21.370> said<00:02:21.580> been

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
everywhere and he was like who said been

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.270 
everywhere and he was like who said been
buried<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:25.090> know<00:02:25.180> they've<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:27.070> many

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
buried so you know they've just so many

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.490 
buried so you know they've just so many
references<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.940> geocaching<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:29.050> think<00:02:29.140> if

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
references to geocaching so I think if

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280 
references to geocaching so I think if
we<00:02:29.650> can<00:02:29.800> get<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> team<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.670> geocaches<00:02:31.480> team

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
we can get a team of geocaches team

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.100 
we can get a team of geocaches team
geocache<00:02:32.950> network<00:02:33.400> maybe<00:02:33.730> down<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.600> Santa<00:02:34.840> Fe

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
geocache network maybe down to Santa Fe

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.170 
geocache network maybe down to Santa Fe
New<00:02:35.320> Mexico<00:02:35.830> maybe<00:02:36.820> for<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> week<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.570> find<00:02:37.900> this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
New Mexico maybe for a week to find this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.510 
New Mexico maybe for a week to find this
it<00:02:40.180> could<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.480> done<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.080> actual<00:02:41.860> value<00:02:42.490> of

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
it could be done and the actual value of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.060 
it could be done and the actual value of
the<00:02:42.760> chest<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.360> today's<00:02:43.690> money<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.140> valued<00:02:44.980> at

the chest in today's money is valued at

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.860 
the chest in today's money is valued at
something<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.700> three<00:02:46.030> million<00:02:46.420> dollars
