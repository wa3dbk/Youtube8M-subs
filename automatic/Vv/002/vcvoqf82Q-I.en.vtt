so<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.630> speak<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> lot<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.350> people<00:00:01.650> about

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so we speak to a lot of people about

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.550 
so we speak to a lot of people about
compatible<00:00:02.520> cartridges<00:00:02.780> in<00:00:03.780> comparison<00:00:04.529> to

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
compatible cartridges in comparison to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.579 
compatible cartridges in comparison to
originals<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.460> everybody<00:00:05.879> asks<00:00:06.240> us<00:00:06.589> exactly

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
originals and everybody asks us exactly

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:08.960 
originals and everybody asks us exactly
what<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> difference<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:08.849> they

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
what the difference is and what they

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.370 
what the difference is and what they
should<00:00:09.150> buy<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.570> we<00:00:09.690> thought<00:00:09.840> we'll<00:00:10.050> make<00:00:10.200> an

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
should buy so we thought we'll make an

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.129 
should buy so we thought we'll make an
experiment<00:00:11.330> not<00:00:12.330> sure<00:00:12.509> you'll<00:00:12.719> ever<00:00:12.809> see

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
experiment not sure you'll ever see

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
experiment not sure you'll ever see
anything<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.950> one<00:00:14.160> man<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:15.120> your

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
anything like this one man and your

YouTube channels again here we go we've
bought<00:00:19.020> two<00:00:19.350> identical<00:00:20.010> printers<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.630> we're

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
bought two identical printers and we're

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.779 
bought two identical printers and we're
going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> unpackage<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.279> front<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.670> you

details but we're going to run a
comparison<00:00:30.779> between<00:00:31.170> compatible<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
comparison between compatible and

27<00:00:35.730> over<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> brand-new<00:00:37.020> out-of-the-box<00:00:37.700> and

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
27 over to brand-new out-of-the-box and

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
27 over to brand-new out-of-the-box and
we'll<00:00:39.719> open<00:00:39.899> them<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.020 

okay<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.500> original<00:00:50.370> eggs<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
okay so here are the original eggs that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.660 
okay so here are the original eggs that
came<00:00:51.269> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> printer<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> power

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
came with the printer and the power

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.630 
came with the printer and the power
cable<00:00:54.559> remember<00:00:55.559> we're<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> test

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
cable remember we're going to do a test

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.380 
cable remember we're going to do a test
with<00:00:57.860> original<00:00:58.860> king<00:00:59.640> jet<00:00:59.820> cartridges<00:01:02.390> versus

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
with original king jet cartridges versus

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
with original king jet cartridges versus
the<00:01:03.510> compatible<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> two

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the compatible so here we have the two

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
the compatible so here we have the two
printers<00:01:05.940> with<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.149> different<00:01:06.600> inks<00:01:07.110> loaded

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
printers with a different inks loaded

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.529 
printers with a different inks loaded
onto<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> left<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.509> your

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
onto them the one on the left of your

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.749 
onto them the one on the left of your
picture<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.950> compatible

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
picture is the one with the compatible

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.480 
picture is the one with the compatible
non<00:01:12.299> original<00:01:12.799> ink<00:01:13.799> cartridge<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.369> what

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
non original ink cartridge and what

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.010 
non original ink cartridge and what
we're<00:01:14.640> going<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> do<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> print<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> same

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we're going to do is print the same

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.230 
we're going to do is print the same
image<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.500> both<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.890> them<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.820> send<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
image on both of them and just send it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.570 
image on both of them and just send it
to<00:01:18.450> print<00:01:19.259> loads<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> loads<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.069> times<00:01:20.340> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
to print loads and loads of times and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.660 
to print loads and loads of times and
see<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:21.569> results<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.440> get<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.890> printer<00:01:23.399> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
see what results we get which printer is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.899 
see what results we get which printer is
better<00:01:23.909> which<00:01:24.210> printer<00:01:24.630> gives<00:01:24.869> more<00:01:25.909> prints

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
better which printer gives more prints

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
better which printer gives more prints
per<00:01:27.450> cartridge<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.200> we'll<00:01:29.039> show<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
per cartridge and we'll show you the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:02:20.500 
per cartridge and we'll show you the
result<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.940> end

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.870 

okay<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:21.570> as<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.870> can<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.670> printer<00:02:23.670> on

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
okay so as you can see the printer on

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.160 
okay so as you can see the printer on
the<00:02:23.910> left-hand<00:02:24.360> side<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:24.960> that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the left-hand side the one that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
the left-hand side the one that
contained<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.920> compatible<00:02:26.490> cartridges

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
contained that the compatible cartridges

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.840 
contained that the compatible cartridges
has<00:02:27.240> stopped<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.810> ran<00:02:27.990> out<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.140> ink<00:02:28.500> after<00:02:29.310> 22

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
has stopped it ran out of ink after 22

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.290 
has stopped it ran out of ink after 22
shots<00:02:30.540> after<00:02:31.290> 22<00:02:31.710> prints<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.090> the

right with the original canon inks is

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.810 
right with the original canon inks is
still<00:02:37.200> printing<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:37.770> do<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> low<00:02:38.550> ink

the test now we must stress this is not
the<00:02:56.790> scientific<00:02:57.480> tests<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.020> haven't<00:02:59.000> checked

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the scientific tests we haven't checked

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.650 
the scientific tests we haven't checked
anything<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:01.530> far<00:03:01.740> as<00:03:01.800> ink<00:03:02.330> capacity<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.450> just

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
anything as far as ink capacity we just

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.950 
anything as far as ink capacity we just
yeah<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.370> bought<00:03:05.640> two<00:03:06.090> sets<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
yeah we just bought two sets of

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.570 
yeah we just bought two sets of
cartridges<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.620> original<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.430> one

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
cartridges one original and one

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.660 
cartridges one original and one
compatible<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:10.260> as<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> curiosity<00:03:10.890> test<00:03:11.490> to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
compatible just as a curiosity test to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.430 
compatible just as a curiosity test to
see<00:03:11.850> what<00:03:12.000> happens<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.840> left<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
see what happens on your left is the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.630 
see what happens on your left is the
compatible<00:03:14.400> cartridge<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.840> printed<00:03:16.640> 22

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
compatible cartridge it printed 22

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.300 
compatible cartridge it printed 22
prints<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:19.260> your<00:03:19.440> right<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.280> original

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
prints and on your right is the original

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.160 
prints and on your right is the original
cartridge<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:22.050> made<00:03:22.560> 52<00:03:23.570> good<00:03:24.570> prints<00:03:25.020> and

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
cartridge it made 52 good prints and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.500 
cartridge it made 52 good prints and
actually<00:03:25.650> carried<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.130> printing<00:03:26.610> with<00:03:27.270> less

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
actually carried on printing with less

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.440 
actually carried on printing with less
and<00:03:27.720> less<00:03:27.810> ink<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:29.280> call<00:03:29.460> it<00:03:29.490> 52<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.090> think

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
and less ink so we call it 52 I think

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.220 
and less ink so we call it 52 I think
it's<00:03:30.630> our<00:03:30.900> conclusive<00:03:31.500> enough<00:03:32.060> test<00:03:33.060> for<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
it's our conclusive enough test for the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.130 
it's our conclusive enough test for the
purpose<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:35.370> exercise<00:03:35.810> just<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.930> show

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
purpose of this exercise just to show

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.400 
purpose of this exercise just to show
you

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.900 
you
very<00:03:38.100> roughly<00:03:38.570> as<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.630> game<00:03:39.990> as<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> little<00:03:40.620> play

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
very roughly as a game as a little play

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.460 
very roughly as a game as a little play
what<00:03:41.910> happens<00:03:42.330> what's<00:03:42.660> good<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.050> it's<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
what happens what's good but it's the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.830 
what happens what's good but it's the
difference<00:03:43.620> between<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.910> compatible<00:03:45.600> and

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
difference between the compatible and

difference between the compatible and
the<00:03:45.930> original<00:03:46.410> inks<00:03:46.710> will<00:03:47.160> do<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> close-up

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
the original inks will do a close-up

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.860 
the original inks will do a close-up
show<00:03:48.030> shots

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
show shots

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.160 
show shots
shortly<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.209> show<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.420> quality<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.930> well

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
shortly and show you the quality as well

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.600 
shortly and show you the quality as well
but<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.720> another<00:03:55.320> little<00:03:55.680> X<00:03:55.950> just

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
but that's just another little X just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.360 
but that's just another little X just
another<00:03:56.940> feature<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.370> comparison

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
another feature of the comparison

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.880 
another feature of the comparison
between<00:03:59.580> the<00:04:00.060> compatible<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.230> original

between the compatible and the original
cartridges<00:04:02.370> if<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.209> look<00:04:03.420> from<00:04:03.990> this

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
cartridges if you have a look from this

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.680 
cartridges if you have a look from this
area<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:05.220> can<00:04:05.370> see<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.760> banding<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.660> a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
area you can see the banding this is a

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.470 
area you can see the banding this is a
