this is the 1959 austin-healey 106 but I
just<00:00:14.549> bought<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.330> I'm<00:00:15.780> starting<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.890> strip<00:00:17.670> it

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
just bought and I'm starting to strip it

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.330 
just bought and I'm starting to strip it
down<00:00:18.890> it's<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.150> it's<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.270> complete<00:00:22.340> complete

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
down it's not it's a complete complete

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.050 
down it's not it's a complete complete
restoration<00:00:23.880> job<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.590> but<00:00:26.060> it's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
restoration job really but it's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.720 
restoration job really but it's
basically<00:00:27.570> complete<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.859> body<00:00:29.189> panels

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
basically complete the body panels

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.720 
basically complete the body panels
appear<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:31.080> very<00:00:31.349> straight<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.949> then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
appear to be very very straight but then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
appear to be very very straight but then
I<00:00:32.820> thought<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.180> mga<00:00:33.540> panels<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.620> very

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
I thought my mga panels are very

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
I thought my mga panels are very
straight<00:00:35.160> as<00:00:35.340> well<00:00:37.010> it's<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> say

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
straight as well it's all as I say

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
straight as well it's all as I say
complete<00:00:40.110> I've<00:00:40.770> started<00:00:41.219> removing<00:00:43.010> some<00:00:44.010> trim

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
complete I've started removing some trim

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
complete I've started removing some trim
pieces<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> inside<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> doors

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
pieces from the inside of the doors

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
pieces from the inside of the doors
there's<00:00:46.289> some<00:00:46.440> rust<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there's some rust in there in there in

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.660 
there's some rust in there in there in
the<00:00:48.719> usual<00:00:49.079> spots<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.500> course<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.520> you're

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the usual spots of course but you're

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.619 
the usual spots of course but you're
going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> dealt<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:53.390> I've<00:00:54.390> had

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
going to have to be dealt with I've had

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.830 
going to have to be dealt with I've had
the<00:00:54.750> motor<00:00:55.140> running<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:56.550> actually<00:00:56.969> runs<00:00:57.410> well

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
the motor running it actually runs well

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.280 
the motor running it actually runs well
it's<00:01:03.110> reasonably<00:01:04.110> tidy<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:06.110> think<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
it's reasonably tidy and I think the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.609 
it's reasonably tidy and I think the
numbers<00:01:07.619> match<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.360> time<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.510> tell<00:01:09.780> it's

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
numbers match but time will tell it's

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.460 
numbers match but time will tell it's
still<00:01:10.890> running<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.310> original<00:01:11.610> radiator

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
still running on the original radiator

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
still running on the original radiator
and<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> had<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> recall<00:01:14.280> its<00:01:14.490> dated<00:01:14.880> 1959

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and this is had a recall its dated 1959

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.560 
and this is had a recall its dated 1959

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
existent no it's all the little bits and
pieces<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> inside<00:01:33.659> panels<00:01:34.140> things

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pieces are here the inside panels things

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.280 
pieces are here the inside panels things
like<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.520> sorts<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.970> screws<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> things

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
like these sorts of screws and things

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.090 
like these sorts of screws and things
that<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.500> holding<00:01:37.590> everything<00:01:37.950> together

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
that are holding everything together

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.120 
that are holding everything together
appear<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.880> original<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.740> don't<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:41.009> it's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
appear to be original I don't think it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670 
appear to be original I don't think it's
all<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.960> molested

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
all that molested

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.929 
all that molested
it<00:01:44.430> came<00:01:44.729> with<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> new<00:01:45.210> fuel<00:01:45.930> tank<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.939> think

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it came with a new fuel tank I think

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.480 
it came with a new fuel tank I think
it's<00:01:48.060> probably<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.390> Moss<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> crime

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
it's probably a Moss one and the crime

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.660 
it's probably a Moss one and the crime
is<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.390> bad<00:01:51.630> I've<00:01:52.530> polished<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:53.189> very<00:01:53.430> quickly

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
is not bad I've polished up very quickly

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.240 
is not bad I've polished up very quickly
with<00:01:53.939> brass<00:01:54.149> oh<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.100> actually

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
with brass oh but you know it's actually

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.859 
with brass oh but you know it's actually
not<00:01:56.460> bad<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.939> most<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> crime<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.719> it's

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
not bad and most of the crime on it's

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.410 
not bad and most of the crime on it's
probably<00:01:58.049> okay<00:01:58.850> certainly<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.969> radiator

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
probably okay certainly the radiator

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.630 
probably okay certainly the radiator
grille<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.829> very<00:02:02.490> good<00:02:02.700> condition

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.639 

first<00:02:05.940> rate<00:02:06.800> and<00:02:07.800> as<00:02:08.280> either<00:02:08.490> bumpers<00:02:08.970> really

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
first rate and as either bumpers really

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.520 
first rate and as either bumpers really
you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.930> at<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> 14th<00:02:13.410> of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you know it's the at the 14th of

you know it's the at the 14th of
December<00:02:13.970> 2012<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.500> I've<00:02:16.620> got<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.130> guess

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
December 2012 and I've got a I guess

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.320 
December 2012 and I've got a I guess
that<00:02:17.760> I'm<00:02:17.880> doing<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.330> some<00:02:18.570> serious<00:02:20.330> pulling

that I'm doing do some serious pulling

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.890 
that I'm doing do some serious pulling
apart<00:02:24.170> its<00:02:25.170> 27th<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.330> January<00:02:27.920> 2012<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.900> I've

taken off all the major panels from the
car<00:02:33.560> plus<00:02:34.560> some<00:02:35.100> other<00:02:35.280> bits<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.090> pieces<00:02:36.300> off

car plus some other bits and pieces off
the<00:02:37.050> engine<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.890> really<00:02:38.340> coming<00:02:38.940> on

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the engine so it's really coming on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.590 
the engine so it's really coming on
quite<00:02:39.209> well<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:40.110> wasn't<00:02:40.290> too<00:02:40.650> difficult<00:02:40.680> and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
quite well it wasn't too difficult and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.120 
quite well it wasn't too difficult and
we<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.780> some<00:02:43.020> rust<00:02:43.520> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.910> front<00:02:46.070> in<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
we have some rust in the front in the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.010 
we have some rust in the front in the
sills<00:02:47.760> there<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.690> should<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:48.900> to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
sills there which I should have to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.490 
sills there which I should have to
attend<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> on<00:02:49.770> both<00:02:49.980> sides<00:02:51.020> usual<00:02:52.020> places<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
attend to on both sides usual places I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.840 
attend to on both sides usual places I
guess<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.430> also<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.950> b-pillar<00:02:55.950> there<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
guess and also in the b-pillar there and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.840 
guess and also in the b-pillar there and
the<00:02:57.450> bottom<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.370> reinforcing<00:02:59.370> filler

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
the bottom of this reinforcing filler

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.450 
the bottom of this reinforcing filler
here

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.730 

tunnels<00:03:06.240> themselves<00:03:06.860> pretty<00:03:07.860> straight<00:03:08.400> but

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
tunnels themselves pretty straight but

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.700 
tunnels themselves pretty straight but
this<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> boot<00:03:11.190> floor<00:03:11.370> which<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.810> dead<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
this is the boot floor which is dead and

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.220 
this is the boot floor which is dead and
will<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:13.980> replaced<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.790> knew<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.660> when<00:03:16.200> I

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
will be replaced I knew that when I

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.630 
will be replaced I knew that when I
bought<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.330> floor<00:03:18.920> doesn't<00:03:19.920> seem<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.430> bad

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
bought the floor doesn't seem to be bad

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.360 
bought the floor doesn't seem to be bad
but<00:03:21.000> we'll<00:03:21.210> see<00:03:21.450> we<00:03:22.380> have<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> same<00:03:25.130> rust<00:03:26.130> in

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
but we'll see we have the same rust in

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.780 
but we'll see we have the same rust in
here<00:03:26.760> inner<00:03:27.750> seal<00:03:28.050> runs<00:03:28.890> right<00:03:29.160> along<00:03:29.370> of

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
here inner seal runs right along of

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.120 
here inner seal runs right along of
course<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.450> then<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:33.630> same<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.230> same

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
course and then that same there same

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.970 
course and then that same there same
problem<00:03:35.520> there<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.760> all<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.330> will<00:03:36.540> be

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
problem there so all that will be

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.840 
problem there so all that will be
replaced<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:39.920> panels<00:03:40.920> themselves<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
replaced but panels themselves the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.880 
replaced but panels themselves the
aluminium<00:03:42.300> panels<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.990> dog<00:03:43.200> house<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
aluminium panels in the dog house and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.770 
aluminium panels in the dog house and
very<00:03:44.370> straight<00:03:46.940> it's<00:03:47.940> all<00:03:48.060> been<00:03:48.270> stashed<00:03:48.600> away

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
very straight it's all been stashed away

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
very straight it's all been stashed away
over<00:03:49.200> here<00:03:50.060> but<00:03:51.500> there<00:03:52.500> are<00:03:52.530> hardly<00:03:52.920> any<00:03:53.190> dents

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
over here but there are hardly any dents

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.580 
over here but there are hardly any dents
in<00:03:53.970> them<00:03:54.060> at<00:03:54.210> all<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.990> couple<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.440> very

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
in them at all and a couple of very

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280 
in them at all and a couple of very
minor<00:03:55.920> ones<00:03:56.250> there's<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.330> right<00:03:57.600> up<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.140> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
minor ones there's one right up in that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.410 
minor ones there's one right up in that
little<00:03:58.530> area<00:03:58.800> there<00:04:01.100> this<00:04:02.100> headlight<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.210> this

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
little area there this headlight on this

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.130 
little area there this headlight on this
side<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:04.320> here<00:04:05.330> has<00:04:06.330> been<00:04:06.570> knocked<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:07.020> at

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
side just here has been knocked in at

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.690 
side just here has been knocked in at
some<00:04:07.380> point<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:07.980> I'll<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> knock<00:04:08.520> that

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
some point so I'll have to knock that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.730 
some point so I'll have to knock that
back<00:04:08.910> out<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.450> there's<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.380> bit<00:04:10.710> of

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
back out and there's a little bit of

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.820 
back out and there's a little bit of
filler<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.460> area<00:04:11.880> here<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:13.650> is

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
filler in this area here but that is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.810 
filler in this area here but that is
about<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:16.590> doesn't<00:04:16.830> look<00:04:16.980> like<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.549> cars

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
about it it doesn't look like the cars

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.380 
about it it doesn't look like the cars
ever<00:04:18.390> had<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> front<00:04:19.110> end<00:04:19.350> shunt<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.520> certainly

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
ever had a front end shunt and certainly

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.540 
ever had a front end shunt and certainly
not<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.080> shunt<00:04:22.440> because<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:25.550> these

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
not a back in shunt because the these

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
not a back in shunt because the these
back<00:04:26.880> panels<00:04:27.330> here<00:04:27.540> these<00:04:27.780> back<00:04:28.020> sections

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
back panels here these back sections

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.120 
back panels here these back sections
here<00:04:29.810> support<00:04:30.810> pieces<00:04:31.230> which<00:04:31.380> were<00:04:31.590> very

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
here support pieces which were very

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.700 
here support pieces which were very
easily<00:04:32.310> damaged<00:04:32.790> are<00:04:32.970> very<00:04:33.300> straight<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
easily damaged are very straight and

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.710 
easily damaged are very straight and
that's<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:35.010> dead<00:04:35.220> giveaway<00:04:35.250> if<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.180> car<00:04:36.390> is<00:04:36.420> had<00:04:36.690> a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
that's a dead giveaway if a car is had a

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.290 
that's a dead giveaway if a car is had a
bang<00:04:37.020> there<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.250> few<00:04:38.400> little<00:04:38.760> dings<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:39.210> it

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
bang there are a few little dings in it

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.370 
bang there are a few little dings in it
but<00:04:39.510> nothing<00:04:39.930> serious

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
but nothing serious

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.590 
but nothing serious
certainly<00:04:41.100> compared<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:42.560> this<00:04:43.560> car<00:04:44.180> this<00:04:45.180> mga

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
certainly compared to this car this mga

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.220 
certainly compared to this car this mga
which<00:04:45.990> was<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:48.030> very<00:04:48.240> poor<00:04:48.360> state<00:04:49.020> of<00:04:49.080> repair

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
which was in a very poor state of repair

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.570 
which was in a very poor state of repair
when<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.800> came<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.190> restore<00:04:50.370> it<00:04:50.700> so<00:04:51.050> um<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.580> think

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
when I came to restore it so um I think

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.680 
when I came to restore it so um I think
I've<00:04:54.000> made<00:04:54.180> some<00:04:54.360> headway

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
I've made some headway

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.030 
I've made some headway
I<00:04:57.020> just<00:04:58.020> hasn't<00:04:58.230> have<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.410> little<00:04:58.680> extra<00:04:58.860> to

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
I just hasn't have a little extra to

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.210 
I just hasn't have a little extra to
that<00:04:59.190> it's<00:04:59.490> quite<00:04:59.760> plain<00:05:00.210> here<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.990> see<00:05:01.260> where

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
that it's quite plain here to see where

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.500 
that it's quite plain here to see where
all<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.550> original<00:05:03.800> filler<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.300> pieces<00:05:06.300> sort

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
all the original filler and pieces sort

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.610 
all the original filler and pieces sort
of<00:05:06.600> mastic<00:05:07.020> has<00:05:07.230> been<00:05:07.470> on<00:05:08.120> and<00:05:09.320> I'm<00:05:10.320> quite

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
of mastic has been on and I'm quite

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.850 
of mastic has been on and I'm quite
convinced<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.100> car<00:05:11.280> has<00:05:11.430> never<00:05:11.550> been<00:05:11.820> apart

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
convinced the car has never been apart

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.450 
convinced the car has never been apart
and<00:05:13.040> this<00:05:13.850> is<00:05:14.030> all<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.360> original<00:05:14.680> mastic<00:05:15.680> seam

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
and this is all the original mastic seam

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.120 
and this is all the original mastic seam
sealer<00:05:16.790> along<00:05:17.150> here<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:18.800> metal

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
sealer along here and the metal

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.550 
sealer along here and the metal
underneath<00:05:19.400> isn't<00:05:20.000> rusty<00:05:20.510> at<00:05:20.660> all<00:05:20.870> it's<00:05:21.350> like

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
underneath isn't rusty at all it's like

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.140 
underneath isn't rusty at all it's like
new<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:22.750> think<00:05:23.750> really<00:05:24.170> the<00:05:24.530> overall<00:05:25.150> finish

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
new so I think really the overall finish

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.610 
new so I think really the overall finish
of<00:05:26.480> the<00:05:26.600> car<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.380> condition<00:05:28.190> of<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.400> car<00:05:29.620> is

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
of the car the condition of the car is

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.970 
of the car the condition of the car is
is<00:05:31.430> excellent<00:05:32.420> really<00:05:33.380> compared<00:05:33.770> to<00:05:33.860> what

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
is excellent really compared to what

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.530 
is excellent really compared to what
some<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.220> them<00:05:34.370> are<00:05:34.400> like<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:35.060> course<00:05:35.120> once<00:05:35.450> I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
some of them are like of course once I

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.450 
some of them are like of course once I
heard<00:05:35.750> it<00:05:35.870> all<00:05:35.930> shot<00:05:36.290> blasted<00:05:38.950> well<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:40.190> few

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
heard it all shot blasted well a few

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.890 
heard it all shot blasted well a few
more<00:05:40.670> things<00:05:40.940> that<00:05:41.120> probably<00:05:41.300> come<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.690> light

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
more things that probably come to light

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.470 
more things that probably come to light
that<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.410> won't<00:05:42.620> like<00:05:42.830> but<00:05:43.670> there<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:44.360> go

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
that I won't like but there you go

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.130 
that I won't like but there you go
that's<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.320> Hobby<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.680> suppose
