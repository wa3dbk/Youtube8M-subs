00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to be a bolt-action you can get a good

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.109 
to be a bolt-action you can get a good
break<00:01:17.369> barrel<00:01:17.820> 243<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.990> under<00:01:19.259> 300<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.159> this

break barrel 243 for under 300 and this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.370 
break barrel 243 for under 300 and this
is<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.659> over<00:01:21.930> three<00:01:22.409> hundred<00:01:22.650> dollars<00:01:23.250> still

is just over three hundred dollars still
but<00:01:25.490> 243<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.450> back<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.140> day<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.650> came

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
but 243 is what back in the day I came

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.580 
but 243 is what back in the day I came
up<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.299> best<00:01:30.540> caliber<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.409> fur

up with as the best caliber for fur
hunting<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.750> case<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.229> ever<00:01:34.259> went<00:01:34.650> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
hunting and for in case I ever went out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.520 
hunting and for in case I ever went out
of<00:01:34.979> state<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.250> deer<00:01:35.729> hunting<00:01:36.409> because<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
of state for deer hunting because the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.450 
of state for deer hunting because the
243<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.420> slower<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.470> 223

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
243 is a little bit slower than a 223

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.700 
243 is a little bit slower than a 223
and<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:42.229> lot<00:01:43.229> slower<00:01:43.590> than<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.920> 22<00:01:44.250> 250<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.710> with

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and a lot slower than a 22 250 and with

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.789 
and a lot slower than a 22 250 and with
soft<00:01:47.340> point<00:01:47.729> ammunition<00:01:48.509> they're<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> lot<00:01:49.530> less

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
soft point ammunition they're a lot less

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.990 
soft point ammunition they're a lot less
likely<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.399> tear<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.119> fur<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> 243<00:01:53.000> but

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
likely to tear up a fur with a 243 but

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.139 
likely to tear up a fur with a 243 but
it's<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.689> multi-purpose<00:01:55.380> rifle<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.909> if<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's a multi-purpose rifle so if you

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's a multi-purpose rifle so if you
wanted<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> deer<00:01:58.049> hunting<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.619> well<00:01:58.890> as

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
wanted to take a deer hunting as well as

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.109 
wanted to take a deer hunting as well as
coyote<00:02:00.000> hunting<00:02:00.680> well<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.040> can<00:02:02.310> when

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
coyote hunting well then you can when

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
coyote hunting well then you can when
you've<00:02:03.299> only<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> finite<00:02:04.350> supply<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.979> cash

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you've only got a finite supply of cash

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.180 
you've only got a finite supply of cash
on<00:02:05.579> hand<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.450> save<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.829> need<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
on hand that you can save up you need to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.740 
on hand that you can save up you need to
maximize<00:02:08.399> your<00:02:09.060> option

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
maximize your option

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.559 
maximize your option
now<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.050> mentioned<00:02:10.679> soft<00:02:10.979> point<00:02:11.370> ammunition

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
now I mentioned soft point ammunition

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.800 
now I mentioned soft point ammunition
I<00:02:12.629> would<00:02:13.499> use<00:02:13.739> a<00:02:13.769> soft<00:02:14.219> point<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.909> my<00:02:15.150> fur<00:02:15.390> round

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I would use a soft point as my fur round

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.149 
I would use a soft point as my fur round
that<00:02:16.799> way<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.129> get<00:02:17.670> good<00:02:17.939> penetration<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.769> if<00:02:19.980> I

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
that way I get good penetration and if I

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.970 
that way I get good penetration and if I
take<00:02:20.519> out<00:02:20.760> both<00:02:21.150> lungs<00:02:21.569> with<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> good<00:02:22.469> ethical

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
take out both lungs with a good ethical

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.470 
take out both lungs with a good ethical
shot<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:24.629> bullet<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.200> more<00:02:25.620> than<00:02:25.829> likely
