00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.860 

well<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.560> interested<00:00:02.159> in<00:00:02.250> capturing<00:00:02.870> marks

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
well I'm interested in capturing marks

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.470 
well I'm interested in capturing marks
on<00:00:04.140> surfaces<00:00:04.799> is<00:00:05.190> the<00:00:05.460> sort<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.790> evidence<00:00:06.029> of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
on surfaces is the sort of evidence of

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.270 
on surfaces is the sort of evidence of
somebody<00:00:06.899> moving<00:00:07.259> through<00:00:07.529> space<00:00:07.740> basic

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 
somebody moving through space basic

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.169 
somebody moving through space basic
so<00:00:09.849> with<00:00:10.540> parkour<00:00:11.080> my<00:00:11.889> fascination<00:00:12.760> is<00:00:13.030> the

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
so with parkour my fascination is the

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.040 
so with parkour my fascination is the
fact<00:00:13.389> that<00:00:13.510> they<00:00:13.719> move<00:00:13.930> so<00:00:14.139> quickly<00:00:14.440> and<00:00:14.889> so

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.050 
fact that they move so quickly and so

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.380 
fact that they move so quickly and so
gracefully<00:00:17.050> and<00:00:17.199> rapidly<00:00:17.590> through<00:00:17.919> space

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
gracefully and rapidly through space

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.640 
gracefully and rapidly through space
that<00:00:19.390> actually<00:00:19.750> I<00:00:19.810> find<00:00:20.110> it<00:00:20.259> quite<00:00:20.380> difficult

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
that actually I find it quite difficult

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.440 
that actually I find it quite difficult
to<00:00:21.009> remember<00:00:21.279> what<00:00:21.550> they've<00:00:21.700> just<00:00:21.880> just<00:00:22.240> done

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
to remember what they've just just done

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.430 
to remember what they've just just done
because<00:00:22.660> I'm<00:00:22.810> always<00:00:22.930> quite

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
because I'm always quite

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.620 
because I'm always quite
sidetracked<00:00:25.400> by<00:00:25.610> what<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:25.940> do<00:00:26.060> next<00:00:26.360> and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
sidetracked by what to do next and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.660 
sidetracked by what to do next and
impressed<00:00:27.170> by<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.440> next<00:00:27.800> movement<00:00:28.010> I<00:00:28.310> almost

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
impressed by the next movement I almost

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.970 
impressed by the next movement I almost
don't<00:00:28.970> have<00:00:29.330> a<00:00:29.360> full<00:00:30.080> understanding<00:00:30.110> of<00:00:30.800> that

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
don't have a full understanding of that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.010 
don't have a full understanding of that
that<00:00:31.400> ripped<00:00:31.640> them<00:00:31.880> in<00:00:32.060> what<00:00:32.780> I'm<00:00:32.930> interested

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
that ripped them in what I'm interested

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.530 
that ripped them in what I'm interested
in<00:00:33.470> is<00:00:33.590> trying<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:34.220> track<00:00:34.520> trace<00:00:35.000> that<00:00:35.240> route

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
in is trying to track trace that route

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.229 
in is trying to track trace that route
and<00:00:35.680> record<00:00:36.680> evidence<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.670> that<00:00:37.940> week<00:00:38.210> that

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
and record evidence of that week that

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.020 
and record evidence of that week that
lasts<00:00:38.810> just<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.140> little<00:00:39.380> bit<00:00:39.530> longer<00:00:39.800> than<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
lasts just a little bit longer than the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.479 
lasts just a little bit longer than the
fast<00:00:41.270> sort<00:00:41.600> of<00:00:41.660> movement<00:00:41.930> that<00:00:42.260> they<00:00:42.489> that

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
fast sort of movement that they that

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.400 
fast sort of movement that they that
they<00:00:43.550> do<00:00:43.700> so<00:00:44.480> with<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.750> thermal<00:00:45.050> imaging

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
they do so with the thermal imaging

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.100 
they do so with the thermal imaging
camera<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:45.920> can<00:00:45.950> pick<00:00:46.430> up<00:00:46.640> these<00:00:46.850> marks<00:00:47.390> that

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
camera you can pick up these marks that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.810 
camera you can pick up these marks that
they<00:00:48.260> leave<00:00:48.410> behind<00:00:48.440> these<00:00:49.010> thermal<00:00:49.309> prints

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
they leave behind these thermal prints

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.890 
they leave behind these thermal prints
so<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.600> project<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.920> temporary<00:00:52.730> piece<00:00:53.570> of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
so the project is a temporary piece of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.799 
so the project is a temporary piece of
public<00:00:54.140> art<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:55.610> references<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.330> area<00:00:56.750> of

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
public art that references the area of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.380 
public art that references the area of
Mayfair<00:00:57.260> in<00:00:57.379> some<00:00:57.620> way<00:00:57.830> we<00:00:58.640> commissioned<00:00:59.239> an

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
Mayfair in some way we commissioned an

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.890 
Mayfair in some way we commissioned an
artist<00:00:59.680> to<00:01:00.680> work<00:01:01.610> on<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:01.909> project<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:02.600> would

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
artist to work on a project that would

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.170 
artist to work on a project that would
involve<00:01:03.409> Westminster<00:01:04.370> residents<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:04.940> some

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
involve Westminster residents in some

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.170 
involve Westminster residents in some
way<00:01:05.470> in<00:01:06.470> PAP<00:01:07.040> singh<00:01:07.340> as<00:01:07.550> part<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:07.970> process

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
public art thermal image camera was

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.600 
public art thermal image camera was
quite<00:01:13.550> actually<00:01:13.729> is<00:01:13.909> quite<00:01:14.090> um<00:01:14.360> I'd<00:01:15.200> see

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
quite actually is quite um I'd see

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.090 
quite actually is quite um I'd see
amazing<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:19.120> was<00:01:20.120> very<00:01:20.330> very<00:01:20.450> arms<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.140> so

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
amazing in was very very arms I so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.430 
amazing in was very very arms I so
following<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.729> research<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.659> development<00:01:24.170> I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
following the research and development I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.380 
following the research and development I
then<00:01:24.799> started<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:26.060> think<00:01:26.330> about<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.740> local

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
then started to think about the local

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.800 
then started to think about the local
the<00:01:28.780> knowledge<00:01:29.080> actually<00:01:29.500> go<00:01:29.830> ahead<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:31.600> can

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
the knowledge actually go ahead we can

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.219 
the knowledge actually go ahead we can
do<00:01:31.990> everything<00:01:32.460> everywhere<00:01:33.460> with<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.540> number

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
do everything everywhere with the number

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.050 
do everything everywhere with the number
of<00:01:35.260> people<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.740> want<00:01:35.950> people<00:01:36.460> who<00:01:36.520> do<00:01:36.880> this

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
of people you want people who do this

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.690 
of people you want people who do this
all<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.330> time<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.900> sir<00:01:38.229> it's<00:01:39.159> all<00:01:39.250> accepting

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
all the time it sir it's all accepting

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.160 
all the time it sir it's all accepting
the<00:01:39.760> risk<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.119> nest<00:01:40.330> and<00:01:40.540> your<00:01:40.690> specialist

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
the risk is a nest and your specialist

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.719 
the risk is a nest and your specialist
in<00:01:41.290> it<00:01:41.380> anyway<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.250> let's<00:01:43.240> see<00:01:43.450> how<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.570> goes

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
in it anyway so let's see how it goes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.910 
in it anyway so let's see how it goes
it's<00:01:45.729> all<00:01:45.880> almost<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.780> when<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> see<00:01:47.770> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
it's all almost like when you see the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.400 
it's all almost like when you see the
marks<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.340> each<00:01:48.520> person<00:01:48.550> makes<00:01:49.390> it's<00:01:50.080> almost

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
marks that each person makes it's almost

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.260 
marks that each person makes it's almost
like<00:01:50.650> their<00:01:50.860> signature<00:01:51.040> is<00:01:51.700> being<00:01:51.940> made<00:01:52.090> on

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
like their signature is being made on

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.480 
like their signature is being made on
that<00:01:52.440> surface

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:16.880 

technical<00:01:58.490> problem

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.950 

you
