three<00:00:12.900> other<00:00:13.170> fractals<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.580> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
three other fractals and this is the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.660 
three other fractals and this is the
sort<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.120> final<00:00:15.960> boss<00:00:16.170> encounter<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.369> usually

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
get this when you go up a scheme of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.519 
get this when you go up a scheme of
difficulty<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:21.029> believe<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.080> only<00:00:22.289> have

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
difficulty I believe we can only have

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.450 
difficulty I believe we can only have
this<00:00:22.680> once<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.279> day<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.840> anyways<00:00:25.189> you<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.340> be

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
and because those crystal fragments make

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.420 
and because those crystal fragments make
a<00:02:16.060> shield<00:02:16.450> here's<00:02:17.140> my<00:02:17.350> turn<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.920> pick<00:02:18.310> up

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
a shield here's my turn I pick up

a shield here's my turn I pick up
crystal<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> add<00:02:19.210> laser<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.900> fired<00:02:20.140> at<00:02:20.320> me<00:02:20.440> as

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
crystal and add laser is fired at me as

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.320 
crystal and add laser is fired at me as
you<00:02:20.980> can<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.490> was<00:02:21.640> shielded<00:02:22.120> by<00:02:22.270> the

you can see I was shielded by the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.470 
you can see I was shielded by the
crystal<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.190> he's<00:02:24.400> starting<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.910> fire<00:02:25.150> at<00:02:25.330> me

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
crystal and he's starting to fire at me

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.800 
crystal and he's starting to fire at me
once<00:02:26.440> again<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> shield<00:02:28.300> pops<00:02:28.540> up<00:02:28.720> again

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
once again so the shield pops up again

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
once again so the shield pops up again
once<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.680> shield<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.070> up<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.430> are<00:02:30.520> allowed<00:02:30.790> to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
once the shield is up you are allowed to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.080 
once the shield is up you are allowed to
throw<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.260> thing<00:02:32.470> back<00:02:32.680> at<00:02:32.920> him<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.580> course<00:02:33.880> I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
throw the thing back at him of course I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.690 
throw the thing back at him of course I
threw<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.290> some<00:02:35.530> tentacle<00:02:36.130> which<00:02:36.340> was<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
threw it at some tentacle which was a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.970 
threw it at some tentacle which was a
mess<00:02:37.450> of<00:02:37.630> film<00:02:37.959> because<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.740> throw

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
mess of film because you have to throw

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.949 
mess of film because you have to throw
it<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.190> his<00:02:39.370> head<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.570> only<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:40.900> to

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
it at his head that's the only way to

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.470 
it at his head that's the only way to
damage<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.440> boss<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.370> pick<00:02:42.640> up<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.270> those

fragments when you get a skull over yet

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.490 
fragments when you get a skull over yet
you<00:02:45.730> wait<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.270> laser<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.930> hit<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.320> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
the shield to to absorb the hit and then

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.550 
the shield to to absorb the hit and then
the<00:02:51.040> charge<00:02:51.430> crystal<00:02:52.090> as<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.420> were<00:02:52.600> has<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.530> be

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the charge crystal as it were has to be

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.340 
the charge crystal as it were has to be
hurled<00:02:54.010> back<00:02:54.310> at<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.940> boss's<00:02:55.390> head<00:02:55.660> so<00:02:56.020> not<00:02:56.170> at

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
hurled back at the boss's head so not at

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.610 
hurled back at the boss's head so not at
his<00:02:56.500> tentacles<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.580> his<00:02:57.820> head<00:02:58.350> when<00:02:59.350> he<00:02:59.380> is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
his tentacles but at his head when he is

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.740 
his tentacles but at his head when he is
almost<00:02:59.920> down<00:03:00.430> he<00:03:00.730> will<00:03:00.880> do<00:03:01.030> something<00:03:01.330> special

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
almost down he will do something special

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.220 
almost down he will do something special
which<00:03:02.200> gives<00:03:03.040> everyone<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.940> skull<00:03:04.600> above<00:03:04.780> their

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
which gives everyone a skull above their

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.530 
which gives everyone a skull above their
head<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:06.010> everyone<00:03:06.580> needs<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.880> pick<00:03:07.180> up<00:03:07.390> their

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
head so everyone needs to pick up their

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.750 
head so everyone needs to pick up their
own<00:03:07.720> crystal<00:03:08.260> here<00:03:08.440> here<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.040> everyone<00:03:09.610> has

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
own crystal here here it is everyone has

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.810 
own crystal here here it is everyone has
a<00:03:09.790> skull<00:03:10.090> above<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:11.140> fail<00:03:11.980> miserably<00:03:12.430> on

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
a skull above that we fail miserably on

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.340 
a skull above that we fail miserably on
this<00:03:13.060> because<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.390> was<00:03:13.630> our<00:03:13.810> first<00:03:13.840> try

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
this because this was our first try

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.140 
this because this was our first try
actually<00:03:14.739> so<00:03:14.950> we<00:03:15.160> pretty<00:03:15.370> much<00:03:15.489> all<00:03:15.730> diet<00:03:15.940> you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
actually so we pretty much all diet you

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.000 
actually so we pretty much all diet you
only<00:03:16.300> have<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.600> have<00:03:16.630> one<00:03:16.750> team<00:03:17.380> member<00:03:17.650> that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
only have to have one team member that

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.370 
only have to have one team member that
survives<00:03:18.880> it<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:19.330> we<00:03:19.420> have<00:03:19.540> one<00:03:19.750> he<00:03:19.930> arrested

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
survives it so we have one he arrested

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.009 
survives it so we have one he arrested
up<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.830> we<00:03:21.310> got<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.700> chest<00:03:22.360> which<00:03:22.600> gives<00:03:22.870> you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
20 fractal relics and of course the big

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.050 
20 fractal relics and of course the big
chest<00:03:26.530> which<00:03:26.830> just<00:03:27.160> gives<00:03:27.310> used<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.700> normal
