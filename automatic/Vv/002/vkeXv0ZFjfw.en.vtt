you'll<00:01:50.289> know<00:01:50.439> why<00:01:50.789> but<00:01:51.789> um<00:01:51.969> this<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.049> pretty

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
you'll know why but um this is pretty

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.639 
you'll know why but um this is pretty
much<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.439> server<00:01:53.799> i'm<00:01:53.979> new<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.310> spawn<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.500> what

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
much the server i'm new to spawn so what

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.429 
much the server i'm new to spawn so what
I<00:01:56.679> did<00:01:56.799> is<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.189> made<00:01:57.399> this<00:01:57.579> spawn<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.259> guess

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
I did is I made this spawn and I guess

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.740 
I did is I made this spawn and I guess
that<00:01:59.619> doesn't<00:01:59.799> need<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.039> be<00:02:00.130> there<00:02:00.399> anymore

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that doesn't need to be there anymore

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.999 
that doesn't need to be there anymore
