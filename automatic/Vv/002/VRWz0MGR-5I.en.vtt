00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
to squeeze out a bit so I didn't get a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.200 
to squeeze out a bit so I didn't get a
huge<00:04:37.870> blob<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.500> ruin<00:04:38.889> my<00:04:39.340> main<00:04:39.520> image<00:04:39.730> and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
then just DAP it on really lightly so

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.310 
then just DAP it on really lightly so
that<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.830> dries<00:04:42.040> really<00:04:42.250> quickly<00:04:42.400> just<00:04:43.320> like

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
that it dries really quickly just like

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.190
