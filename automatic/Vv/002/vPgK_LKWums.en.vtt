00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
surprised that I transferred what the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.939 
surprised that I transferred what the
reason<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.100> did<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.579> because<00:00:53.840> Arsenal<00:00:54.840> were<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
reason I did was because Arsenal were so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
reason I did was because Arsenal were so
far<00:00:56.280> behind<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.820> league<00:00:57.000> or<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.629> night

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
far behind the league or in like night

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.709 
far behind the league or in like night
position<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.910> I<00:00:59.910> really<00:01:00.329> didn't<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
position and I really didn't have a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
position and I really didn't have a
chance<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> winning<00:01:01.260> any<00:01:01.649> trophies<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.940> year

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
chance of winning any trophies this year

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
chance of winning any trophies this year
so<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.379> want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.769> move<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.159> see<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.650> like<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so I just want to move to see and like I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.770 
so I just want to move to see and like I
wasn't<00:01:08.189> getting<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.880> game<00:01:09.150> time<00:01:09.180> at

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
wasn't getting that much game time at

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.520 
wasn't getting that much game time at
Arsenal<00:01:10.409> anyway<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.720> decided<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.350> see

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
Arsenal anyway so I just decided to see

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
Arsenal anyway so I just decided to see
how<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:14.010> work<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:15.270> hitting

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
how this would work out and I'm hitting

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
how this would work out and I'm hitting
the<00:01:15.900> post<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.500> causing<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.610> sorts<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

the post there causing all sorts of
trouble<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.920> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.610> another<00:01:20.820> shot

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
trouble and I think I get another shot
way<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.990> score<00:01:22.380> another<00:01:22.590> goal<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.280> is

take the lead again so I was looking to

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.890 
take the lead again so I was looking to
score<00:02:22.769> another<00:02:22.920> goal<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.610> one<00:02:24.329> of<00:02:24.480> my<00:02:24.569> first

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
