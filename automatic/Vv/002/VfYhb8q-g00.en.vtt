00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.260 
see if there are other items on here I
don't<00:04:35.560> think<00:04:35.710> we<00:04:35.800> put<00:04:35.979> any<00:04:36.129> mkb<00:04:36.819> but<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.180> will

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
don't think we put any mkb but it will

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.659 
don't think we put any mkb but it will
play<00:04:37.479> mkv<00:04:38.050> files<00:04:38.289> which<00:04:39.099> is<00:04:39.250> one<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.460> them<00:04:39.639> that

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
be very aboveboard and not do anything

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
okay perhaps we're still in discussion

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.970 
okay perhaps we're still in discussion
whether<00:06:17.650> or<00:06:17.800> not<00:06:17.890> we'll<00:06:18.130> include<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.520> passage

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
whether or not we'll include a passage

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.940 
whether or not we'll include a passage
in<00:06:20.980> this<00:06:21.100> more<00:06:21.310> storage<00:06:21.580> it<00:06:22.240> has<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.540> be<00:06:22.630> bigger

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:22.950 
in this more storage it has to be bigger

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.830 
in this more storage it has to be bigger
that's<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.100> problem<00:06:24.310> right<00:06:24.490> so<00:06:25.150> it<00:06:25.570> makes<00:06:25.750> a

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
that's the problem right so it makes a

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.200 
that's the problem right so it makes a
larger<00:06:26.230> it<00:06:26.860> will<00:06:26.980> be<00:06:27.130> warmer<00:06:27.490> also<00:06:27.850> I<00:06:27.940> think

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
larger it will be warmer also I think

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:48.680 
larger it will be warmer also I think
yes<00:06:42.870> there<00:06:43.870> may<00:06:44.020> be<00:06:44.050> some<00:06:44.410> legal

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.629 

maybe<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.900> people<00:06:50.110> can<00:06:50.410> take<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.650> so<00:06:51.100> it's<00:06:51.520> not

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 
maybe the people can take it so it's not

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:54.120 
maybe the people can take it so it's not
