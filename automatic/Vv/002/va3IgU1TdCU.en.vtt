00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 then obviously it is very variable 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.910
 it penalizes the kilometers for the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.430
 driver of a sports car and who 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.990
 is going to be the part of strong compelling when 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.180
 his driving techno until the 60 789 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.640
 guy the average upped on their rate 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.730
 40 thousand kilometers but to arrive 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.230
 at this score it will be necessary to monitor at 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.739
 monitor these pressures very 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.739
 regularly 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.140
 65% of people or the results are the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.199
 reflection of security 10 ' consumption 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.679
 to create measures that nathalie rykiel 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.219
 so pressure approves the advice to 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.740
 to follow 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:10.830
 apply regularly once a 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.830
 month this one very very good for me 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.960
 so the pressure of a tire she is 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.689
 measuring with a pressure gauge 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.030
 are devices that are 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.130
 regularly calibrate it just 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:30.280
 put the loop end on laval puts to 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.929
 the task and measure the pressure 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.130
 residual in this case of a kilo 7 and 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:41.679
 squeeze to fill hours until 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.929
 we get to the required pressure and 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.440
 especially what is very important is 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.259
 to always put a plug or a 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.140
 cap on the valve because that's what 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.479
 cap that will guarantee the tightness of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.890
 the valve in the long run to find out 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.659
 that a valve that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.550
 is not covered by a plug is going to get 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.440
 dirtying the humidity will go back she goes 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.840
 rusty and finally there will be some 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.149
 pressure losses due to the wave is 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.869
 so a pair of longevity security 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.869
 for tires 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.510
 so in fact a tire we will be able to see 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.360
 that it is worn when small shadows 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.790
 who are still on the band of 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 rolling and that are either indicated by 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.430
 an arrow its part the logo of the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 manufacturer be not miss wii2 this 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.330
 bridge does not flush with the blocks of 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.090
 eraser so here we clearly see who 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.500
 is still a residual depth if 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.520
 I measure it we are at a depth of 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.230
 5 mm and the tire can still roll 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.410
 up to the little bridge that's still 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.160
 located at 1 mm 6 to note that for a tire 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.030
 was a millimeter 6 it's legality 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.370
 for a winter tire 1 mm if it is also 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.330
 legality just for security 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.430
 for motor skills 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.470
 it's better to change that night to 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.760
 crises reach a depth of 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.760
 3 to 4 mm 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 I deep risk where the victim had 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.450
 fact that since the depth of destiny 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.100
 with animal when we play bowling and 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.580
 the movie on May 12 to apply 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.780
 some bumps so it will be a moment 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.360
 the water pressure at 6.9 to raise the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.480
 half 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.860
 it is lamentable it is especially akingbola 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.520
 that we will come out 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.520
 difference 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.130
