by placing the beads on the head pin

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.520 
by placing the beads on the head pin
we'll<00:00:56.329> start<00:00:56.570> our<00:00:56.720> design<00:00:57.050> with<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.290> two

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530

we'll start our design with the two
millimeter<00:00:57.920> bead<00:00:58.159> and<00:00:58.399> then<00:00:58.600> we'll<00:00:59.600> add<00:00:59.780> a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
millimeter bead and then we'll add a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.229 
millimeter bead and then we'll add a
