5 of the leaderboard most games that I
played<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.289> I<00:01:21.500> was<00:01:22.039> pretty<00:01:22.220> happy<00:01:22.340> with<00:01:22.729> that

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
result but on the other hand I did find

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:27.880 
result but on the other hand I did find
it<00:01:25.670> really<00:01:26.209> hard<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.810> string<00:01:27.200> together<00:01:27.380> kills

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890

it really hard to string together kills
and<00:01:28.220> as<00:01:28.729> such<00:01:29.000> I've<00:01:29.209> done<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.660> best<00:01:29.959> that<00:01:30.229> I

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
and as such I've done the best that I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.699 
and as such I've done the best that I
can

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
can

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.040 
can
to<00:01:30.979> extract<00:01:31.429> the<00:01:31.640> clips<00:01:31.910> that<00:01:32.149> I<00:01:32.179> think<00:01:32.569> are

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
to extract the clips that I think are

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.960

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
destruction makes you really go out with

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.710 
destruction makes you really go out with
in<00:02:10.190> hardline<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.819> can<00:02:11.000> rip<00:02:11.239> through<00:02:11.420> walls

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
in hardline you can rip through walls

in hardline you can rip through walls
with<00:02:11.959> bullets

you can explode them with m320 s and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.900 
you can explode them with m320 s and
grenades<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.739> throw<00:02:15.980> c4<00:02:16.520> through<00:02:16.819> the

windows run back hit the button and the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.370 
windows run back hit the button and the
whole<00:02:19.400> ground<00:02:19.760> floor<00:02:20.150> will<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.690> ripped<00:02:20.989> to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
whole ground floor will get ripped to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.280 
whole ground floor will get ripped to
shreds<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.120> much<00:02:23.420> destruction<00:02:23.840> here

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
shreds there is so much destruction here

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.070 
shreds there is so much destruction here
and<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.650> all<00:02:24.830> changes<00:02:25.580> how<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.090> map<00:02:26.420> plays<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
and it all changes how the map plays and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.229 
and it all changes how the map plays and
you<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.709> actually<00:02:27.860> bring<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.430> four<00:02:28.939> sections

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
you can actually bring all four sections

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.809 
you can actually bring all four sections
of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.409> apartment<00:02:30.920> building<00:02:31.219> crashing<00:02:31.700> to

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
of the apartment building crashing to

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.729 
of the apartment building crashing to
the<00:02:31.849> ground<00:02:31.939> you<00:02:32.750> have<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.079> destroy<00:02:33.500> all

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the ground you have to it destroy all

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:34.390 
the ground you have to it destroy all
the<00:02:33.920> walls

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
the walls

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.830 
the walls
everything<00:02:34.610> inside<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.299> doesn't<00:02:35.510> just

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
everything inside it but it doesn't just

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.679 
everything inside it but it doesn't just
fall<00:02:36.200> as<00:02:36.470> one<00:02:36.620> object<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.610> splits<00:02:38.090> into<00:02:38.329> four

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
fall as one object it splits into four

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.960 
fall as one object it splits into four
sections<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.439> well<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.370> you've<00:02:40.519> destroyed

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
sections as well so if you've destroyed

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.880 
sections as well so if you've destroyed
let's<00:02:41.239> say<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.569> left<00:02:41.810> bottom<00:02:42.200> hand<00:02:42.439> corner

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
let's say the left bottom hand corner

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.979 
let's say the left bottom hand corner
section<00:02:43.159> that<00:02:43.819> bit<00:02:44.120> will<00:02:44.269> fall<00:02:44.510> down<00:02:44.750> before

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
section that bit will fall down before

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.319 
section that bit will fall down before
the<00:02:45.260> top<00:02:45.470> right<00:02:45.709> section<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.909> it<00:02:47.030> can<00:02:47.150> change

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
the top right section so it can change

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.449 
the top right section so it can change
gameplay<00:02:47.870> quite<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> lot<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.769> don't<00:02:49.280> really

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
gameplay quite a lot you don't really

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.800 
gameplay quite a lot you don't really
know<00:02:49.670> which<00:02:49.849> bits<00:02:50.150> going<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.390> come<00:02:50.569> down

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
know which bits going to come down

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.420 
know which bits going to come down
because<00:02:51.019> where's<00:02:51.439> all<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> action<00:02:51.709> happening

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
because where's all the action happening

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.780 
because where's all the action happening
it<00:02:52.790> changes<00:02:53.329> every<00:02:53.569> time<00:02:54.189> outside<00:02:55.189> of<00:02:55.519> that

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
it changes every time outside of that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.699 
it changes every time outside of that
motel<00:02:56.299> complex<00:02:56.810> though<00:02:56.989> there<00:02:57.230> are<00:02:57.379> two

motel complex though there are two

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.399 
motel complex though there are two
larger<00:02:58.430> alleyways<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.299> sit<00:02:59.569> either<00:02:59.840> side<00:03:00.379> of

larger alleyways that sit either side of

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.220 
larger alleyways that sit either side of
it<00:03:00.769> and<00:03:01.000> they've<00:03:02.000> got<00:03:02.209> really<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:03.049> long

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
it and they've got really really long

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.470 
it and they've got really really long
lines<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.680> sight<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.159> they<00:03:04.519> make<00:03:04.760> for<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.180> great

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
lines of sight and they make for a great

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.379 
lines of sight and they make for a great
sniper<00:03:06.079> location<00:03:06.799> on<00:03:06.889> this<00:03:07.040> map<00:03:07.310> being<00:03:08.209> how

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
small it actually is you wouldn't think

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.949 
small it actually is you wouldn't think

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
that the lines of sight would be all

that the lines of sight would be all
that<00:03:12.260> brilliant<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.250> you'd<00:03:13.549> be<00:03:13.700> wrong

not but totally in my opinion I don't

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.640 
not but totally in my opinion I don't
think<00:04:39.919> that's<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.340> case<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.849> use<00:04:41.659> the<00:04:41.840> acw-r<00:04:42.409> in

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
with this thing with a 4-time scope

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.770 
with this thing with a 4-time scope
which<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.770> did<00:05:30.979> to<00:05:31.159> start<00:05:31.400> with<00:05:31.639> it<00:05:32.210> doesn't<00:05:32.509> go

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
which I did to start with it doesn't go

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.540 
which I did to start with it doesn't go
down<00:05:33.050> too<00:05:33.319> well<00:05:33.349> this<00:05:33.770> thing<00:05:33.979> only<00:05:34.310> really

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
down too well this thing only really

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.390 
down too well this thing only really
works<00:05:34.759> at<00:05:35.090> longer<00:05:35.419> ranges<00:05:35.960> and<00:05:36.199> the<00:05:36.979> car<00:05:37.159> five

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
works at longer ranges and the car five

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.339 
works at longer ranges and the car five
five<00:05:37.610> six<00:05:37.849> well<00:05:38.569> that<00:05:38.720> thing<00:05:38.960> just<00:05:39.139> has<00:05:39.319> a

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
five six well that thing just has a

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.350 
five six well that thing just has a
really<00:05:39.770> large<00:05:39.889> magazine<00:05:40.460> and<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:40.969> found<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:41.330> to

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
really large magazine and I found it to

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360 
really large magazine and I found it to
be<00:05:41.449> really<00:05:41.840> useful<00:05:42.289> because<00:05:42.590> I<00:05:42.740> suck<00:05:43.219> at

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
be really useful because I suck at

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.249 
be really useful because I suck at
aiming<00:05:43.490> with<00:05:43.849> a<00:05:43.880> controller<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.599> I<00:05:44.990> needed

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
aiming with a controller and I needed

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.409 
aiming with a controller and I needed
those<00:05:45.500> extra<00:05:45.919> bullets<00:05:46.219> but<00:05:46.729> apart<00:05:47.060> from<00:05:47.120> that

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
those extra bullets but apart from that

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.540 
those extra bullets but apart from that
it's<00:05:47.750> just<00:05:47.930> another<00:05:48.349> standard<00:05:48.800> assault<00:05:49.159> rifle

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
it's just another standard assault rifle

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.790 
it's just another standard assault rifle
and<00:05:50.419> what<00:05:50.690> I'm<00:05:50.780> really<00:05:51.020> trying<00:05:51.289> to<00:05:51.440> say<00:05:51.590> is

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
and what I'm really trying to say is

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.379 
and what I'm really trying to say is
that<00:05:51.979> these<00:05:52.159> weapons<00:05:52.639> may<00:05:52.880> have<00:05:53.030> been<00:05:53.180> made<00:05:53.360> a

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
that these weapons may have been made a

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:54.999 
that these weapons may have been made a
pre-order<00:05:53.719> bonus<00:05:53.990> but<00:05:54.500> that<00:05:54.620> doesn't

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
pre-order bonus but that doesn't

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.010 
pre-order bonus but that doesn't
automatically<00:05:55.759> mean<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.330> they're<00:05:56.840> going<00:05:56.960> to

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
automatically mean that they're going to

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.209 
automatically mean that they're going to
be<00:05:57.139> better<00:05:57.319> than<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.740> rest

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
be better than the rest

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.580 
be better than the rest
they<00:05:58.819> all<00:05:58.969> have<00:05:59.150> rivals<00:05:59.659> in<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.139> main<00:06:00.319> base

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
they all have rivals in the main base

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.709 
they all have rivals in the main base
game<00:06:00.860> anyway<00:06:01.280> they're<00:06:01.759> just<00:06:01.969> three<00:06:02.300> extra

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:02.719 
game anyway they're just three extra

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.839 
game anyway they're just three extra
weapons<00:06:03.139> yeah<00:06:03.860> two<00:06:04.130> of<00:06:04.159> them<00:06:04.310> were<00:06:04.639> in

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
weapons yeah two of them were in

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.730 
weapons yeah two of them were in
battlefield<00:06:05.389> 4<00:06:05.449> but<00:06:05.810> but<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.199> what

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
battlefield 4 but but so what

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.129 
battlefield 4 but but so what
the<00:06:07.099> l85<00:06:07.699> behaves<00:06:08.090> differently<00:06:08.360> in<00:06:08.779> hardline

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
the l85 behaves differently in hardline

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.200 
the l85 behaves differently in hardline
than<00:06:09.319> it<00:06:09.409> did<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.650> bf4<00:06:10.130> think<00:06:10.759> of<00:06:10.880> it<00:06:10.969> more<00:06:11.150> as

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
than it did to bf4 think of it more as

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.120 
than it did to bf4 think of it more as
like<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.659> battlefield<00:06:12.169> 3<00:06:12.500> version<00:06:12.949> of<00:06:13.039> the

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
like the battlefield 3 version of the

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.279 
like the battlefield 3 version of the
l85<00:06:13.819> the<00:06:14.539> acw-r

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
l85 the acw-r

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.320 
l85 the acw-r
is<00:06:15.500> a<00:06:15.770> great<00:06:16.039> versatile<00:06:16.639> weapon<00:06:17.060> but<00:06:17.240> it

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
is a great versatile weapon but it

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.050 
is a great versatile weapon but it
suffers<00:06:17.779> at<00:06:17.900> long-range<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:19.159> car<00:06:19.340> 556

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
suffers at long-range and the car 556

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.939 
suffers at long-range and the car 556
just<00:06:20.330> rewards<00:06:20.870> players<00:06:21.050> with<00:06:21.349> extra<00:06:21.650> bullets

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
just rewards players with extra bullets

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:24.370 
just rewards players with extra bullets
just<00:06:22.099> like<00:06:22.460> the<00:06:22.669> AR<00:06:23.029> em<00:06:23.240> does<00:06:23.509> which<00:06:24.229> is

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
just like the AR em does which is

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.459 
just like the AR em does which is
already<00:06:24.770> included<00:06:25.669> in<00:06:25.849> the<00:06:26.000> base<00:06:26.150> game<00:06:26.469> but

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:27.469 
already included in the base game but

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.559 
already included in the base game but
there<00:06:27.620> we<00:06:27.710> are<00:06:27.860> done<00:06:28.250> and<00:06:28.490> dusted<00:06:28.940> I<00:06:29.270> managed

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
there we are done and dusted I managed

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:32.019 
there we are done and dusted I managed
to<00:06:29.599> educate<00:06:30.139> you<00:06:30.349> on<00:06:30.529> the<00:06:31.130> block<00:06:31.400> told<00:06:31.759> you<00:06:31.880> how

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
it worked and showed off some gameplay

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.320 
it worked and showed off some gameplay
and<00:06:33.650> I<00:06:34.219> managed<00:06:34.460> to<00:06:34.550> tell<00:06:34.759> you<00:06:34.880> the<00:06:35.090> three

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
and I managed to tell you the three

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.909 
and I managed to tell you the three
pre-order<00:06:35.779> weapons<00:06:36.080> really<00:06:36.710> aren't

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
pre-order weapons really aren't

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.860 
pre-order weapons really aren't
something<00:06:37.250> that<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.639> have<00:06:37.849> to<00:06:38.000> worry<00:06:38.240> about<00:06:38.419> I
