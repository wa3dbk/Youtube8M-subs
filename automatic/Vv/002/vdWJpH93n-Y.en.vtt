it<00:05:14.220> once<00:05:14.400> actually<00:05:14.610> unlock<00:05:15.090> jellyfish<00:05:15.630> fields

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
it once actually unlock jellyfish fields

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.060 
it once actually unlock jellyfish fields
or<00:05:16.110> maybe<00:05:16.260> there's<00:05:16.500> gonna<00:05:16.560> be<00:05:16.710> some<00:05:16.949> other

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070
