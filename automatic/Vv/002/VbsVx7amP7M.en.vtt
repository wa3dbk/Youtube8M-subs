something like this and I like to blow

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.730 
something like this and I like to blow
on<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.300> little<00:03:49.450> bit<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.020> so<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.290> dries<00:03:50.560> out

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
on it a little bit just so it dries out

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.950 
on it a little bit just so it dries out
and<00:03:50.980> gets<00:03:51.160> tacky<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.820> know<00:03:52.180> by<00:03:52.450> this<00:03:52.510> time<00:03:52.660> you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
and gets tacky I know by this time you

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.900 
and gets tacky I know by this time you
might<00:03:53.110> think<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.530> already<00:03:53.950> dry<00:03:54.190> but<00:03:54.610> no<00:03:54.730> it's

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
might think it's already dry but no it's

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.640 
might think it's already dry but no it's
not<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:55.360> actually<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.720> little<00:03:55.870> bit<00:03:55.990> watery<00:03:56.380> so

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
not it's actually a little bit watery so

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.750 
not it's actually a little bit watery so
I<00:03:56.680> don't<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.160> watery<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.120> tacky

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
I don't like it watery I like it tacky

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.250 
I don't like it watery I like it tacky
then<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.790> go<00:04:01.030> ahead<00:04:01.150> and<00:04:01.300> get<00:04:01.540> as<00:04:01.750> close<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
then I go ahead and get as close to the

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:25.860 
then I go ahead and get as close to the
lash<00:04:02.440> line<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.920> possible

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.450 

and<00:04:26.870> they're<00:04:27.140> gonna<00:04:27.260> place<00:04:27.560> another<00:04:27.860> dot<00:04:28.190> of

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
and they're gonna place another dot of

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.540 
and they're gonna place another dot of
glue<00:04:29.120> here<00:04:29.510> just<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.560> little<00:04:30.800> bit<00:04:30.980> now<00:04:31.250> for<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
glue here just a little bit now for the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.010 
glue here just a little bit now for the
bottom<00:04:31.820> lashes<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.510> a<00:04:32.540> little<00:04:32.870> bit

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
bottom lashes it is a little bit

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.620 
bottom lashes it is a little bit
trickier<00:04:33.560> but<00:04:33.800> just<00:04:34.250> have<00:04:34.550> patience<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.570> I'm

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
trickier but just have patience so I'm

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.940 
trickier but just have patience so I'm
going<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:35.810> go<00:04:35.900> ahead<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.230> just<00:04:36.380> do<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.650> exact

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
going to go ahead and just do the exact

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.380 
going to go ahead and just do the exact
same<00:04:36.980> thing<00:04:37.400> by<00:04:37.520> applying<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:38.000> little<00:04:38.030> bit<00:04:38.270> of

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
same thing by applying a little bit of

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.890 
same thing by applying a little bit of
glue<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:40.070> now<00:04:40.220> I'm<00:04:40.340> going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.640> just<00:04:41.000> go<00:04:41.180> under

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
glue so now I'm going to just go under

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:58.900 
glue so now I'm going to just go under
my<00:04:42.170> natural<00:04:42.650> lashes<00:04:56.560> don't<00:04:57.560> allow<00:04:58.160> any<00:04:58.580> water

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
my natural lashes don't allow any water

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.290 
my natural lashes don't allow any water
to<00:04:59.570> get<00:04:59.810> on<00:05:00.080> your<00:05:00.440> glue<00:05:01.070> because<00:05:01.670> any<00:05:01.940> of<00:05:02.060> your

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
to get on your glue because any of your

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.480 
to get on your glue because any of your
own<00:05:02.480> natural<00:05:03.020> eye<00:05:03.260> water<00:05:03.740> because<00:05:04.160> then<00:05:04.370> it

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
own natural eye water because then it

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.110 
own natural eye water because then it
will<00:05:04.670> not<00:05:04.940> stick<00:05:06.220> perfect<00:05:07.220> I<00:05:07.400> go<00:05:07.670> back<00:05:07.910> and

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
will not stick perfect I go back and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.360 
will not stick perfect I go back and
apply<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:08.450> little<00:05:08.810> bit<00:05:08.960> more<00:05:09.140> pressure<00:05:09.440> and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
apply a little bit more pressure and

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.220 
apply a little bit more pressure and
again<00:05:10.790> you<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:11.420> with<00:05:11.600> your<00:05:11.720> fingers

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
again you can do this with your fingers

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.200 
again you can do this with your fingers

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
for the upper lashes I'm just using an

of<00:05:44.510> that<00:05:44.750> glue<00:05:45.170> although<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.130> does<00:05:46.460> dry<00:05:46.880> clear

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
of that glue although it does dry clear

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.670 
of that glue although it does dry clear
it<00:05:48.440> gives<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:48.860> a<00:05:48.920> little<00:05:49.040> bit<00:05:49.190> of<00:05:49.430> shine<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:51.020> I

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
it gives it a little bit of shine so I

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.460

a little bit dramatic

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.630 
a little bit dramatic
having<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:27.990> bottom<00:06:28.320> lashes<00:06:28.560> but<00:06:29.130> even<00:06:29.430> if<00:06:29.550> you
