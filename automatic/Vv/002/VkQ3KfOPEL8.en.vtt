00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:10.049
 you are the fire team you are the atas team you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.980
 team volcano hurricane and tsunami not 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:17.039
 real power is better than you in the world is not about 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.580
 I only ask you to not pierce the ball 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.580
 horns 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.000
 hello dear tank lovers 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.950
 football you watch the championship diary 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.400
 himmelsdorf and so what are the memorable 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.340
 the first 10 days of this holiday land mines 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.890
 beaten tracks before release i 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.320
 asked not to poke the ball with the horns and this 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.500
 it is no coincidence that some players desire 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.350
 destroy the ball goes over all the boundaries 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.410
 For example, a player under the name Lego 2007 decided 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.750
 ball crush new br could not stand such 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.170
 insolence and sent a guy to a long 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.020
 flight 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.690
 as popular wisdom says ah beliv ah 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.450
 ken fly mare lighter it's that rare 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.430
 case of friends when the caterpillars of the tank are a little 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.470
 didn't turn into butterflies but 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.190
 the only result of the flight is 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.110
 lost 72 hp came to our mail 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.330
 a huge number of beautiful and 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.060
 interesting goals and here's one of them 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.240
 At first our hero is calm and casual. 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.680
 sends the ball on target by 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.780
 high-explosive shells but the enemy 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.789
 manages to repel as an attack 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.340
 continues the player throws the ball itself 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.940
 aft and literally brings it to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.819
 goal 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.940
 this is called dragged in 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.920
 the true sense of the word in the previous 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.170
 football video I said something there 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.149
 about the futility of the bulb but now 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.700
 friends I take my words back because 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.520
 what a light bulb it turned out to be a signal 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.890
 before a beautiful moment and so the battle began 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.929
 the tank commander lights the lamp and this 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.390
 It means that you need to score without 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.700
 delay by the way you can repeat 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.280
 notice that it was an own goal 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.039
 here so friends none of the players have not yet 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.290
 managed to charge the gun prisoners of fascists 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.950
 have not had time to take a seat in the stands 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.720
 and the Reds have already scored themselves not many 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.250
 know that first in the championship 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.790
 himmelsdorf should have been involved 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.069
 elsi mx tanks but test match and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.069
 showed that when you hit the ball tree 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.680
 loses half the strength points therefore 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.660
 Christmas trees were given a new building and a new tower 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.480
 taught the crew commander to speak 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.290
 in Russian but French refinement 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.840
 nowhere 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.879
 do just look how neat 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.859
 the commander stuck his foot out of the tank and 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.019
 threw the ball into the nine 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.480
 also very happy that the players 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.540
 constantly coming up and borrowing from 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.170
 other sports new tricks now 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.510
 you will see 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.319
 famous find from american football 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.950
 this trick is called i'm your brain i'm fed up and 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.109
 trampled 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.569
 after such an opponent cannot 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.760
 recover from shock and lets you score 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.450
 yourself $ and now on your screens 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.970
 veteran tank football x dragon 95 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.790
 This guy played in the days when 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.659
 the field was on the robin and in the role of the sword was 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.780
 tank ms-1 this most experienced tank ballist 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.090
 the harp is clean in general this athlete 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.099
 the player scores the first two goals 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.620
 the opposing team recalls 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.470
 communist rule no man 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.579
 no problem and just pushes x 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.590
 Dragana from the field 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.139
 by the way similar cases occur 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.290
 a lot of guys decided to roll a platoon 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:41.229
 but the squad was missing a fighter now in my 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.209
 vanilla quote her head is hard 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.379
 find and easy to lose and impossible 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.019
 forget 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.919
 ask a hole in the fence on the map 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.650
 himmelsdorf 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.419
 well and for dessert a glaring case all of you 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.370
 remember the joke when the Russian guy 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.319
 one iron ball broke and the other 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.870
 Lost here and in our game 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.540
 all were given non-killable tanks but how 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.669
 it turned out there are no unkillable tanks 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.699
 difficult to kill the most amazing 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.250
 the barrel was aimed at the ball but at the moment 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:12.280
 shot at vrazhin flew 12 points 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.250
 strength is easy to calculate that if 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.859
 at each shot shoot 12 pc top 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.070
 to destroy the t-62a sport us 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.560
 It needs 163 successful hits and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.930
 by the way my friends if you have anything 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.150
