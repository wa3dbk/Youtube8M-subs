00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.240
 Welcome to Vsauce Channel, I'm Jack. If you've played injustice: God among us you know how amazing it is 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 To be superman and to throw people into space. But what if he punched you into real life !! 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.590
 What could happen if someone could raise 200 quintillion tons with one hand! 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 Power of the sun !! Or my favorite, the punch with dimensions if this person Pllkk ?! 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.369
 This brings an interesting idea: Superman or any other fictional character 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 Determined by the author. So his ability stretches from jumping on tall buildings 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.780
 To walk faster than the speed of light. So according to this theory, no doubt 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 Superman is very strong. There is one law in physics that can not be broken, 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.949
 No block can reach the speed of light. So we will give it a speed less than the speed of light by 1 percent 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.949
 At 299,792,458 meters per second at 99 percent of the speed of light 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.070
 So you will be unlucky in your life with this man who will not 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.170
 Stop himself beating you! If the grip rate is 300 grams 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 And it is running at 99% of the speed of light, the resulting energy will be 190 Quadrillion Gul! 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 Which equals 45 microns of TNT or more 2,800 times than 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 The power of the twin bomb thrown at Horashima. During the punch one is approaching its speed 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.740
 Of the speed of light, the energy consumed will be 45 trillion kcal 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.210
 Or about 82 billion large hamburgers slices! 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.060
 Now you have the most powerful bomb in one fist directed towards your face 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.610
 What will happen when Superman hits you by ^ O ^ 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.400
 This happens when it cools or heats incredibly while releasing this energy 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.550
 By the grip and the temperature of the atmosphere around 80 trillion Kelvin !! Which is more than 5 million times warmed 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.240
 From the nucleus of the sun 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.350
 It takes the light to reach the retina of your eye for about 1 nano to be processed 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.590
 By your brain, so during the speed of the punch approaching the speed of light 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.810
 The punch speed will be 3.4 nanoseconds so you will not be able to recognize them 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 But what can we see from this grip ?? Where it moves fast 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.990
 Amazing 296 million meters per second. Where time stops. Molecules like 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.280
 Oxygen and nitrogen remain time-related. And Superman's fist shocked them 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 A card similar to nuclear fusion power. As the Kama rays are produced with each collision 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.430
 Producing an unexploded explosion. A giant fireball surrounds 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.000
 The area and waves of sparks fly, breaking windows and plowing trees from the ground 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.590
 There may be characters with more powerful punches, but in this case 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.200
 But when you have one, it does not matter. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.490
 Superman will not only beat the wind around you but also atoms! 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.960
 Then its grip becomes largely a molecular beam of 7 billion electron volts 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.620
 This is stronger than the particle accelerator at Jefferson Laboratories in Virginia. Atoms which 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.750
 You consist of them that will disintegrate and fuse your body into atoms 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.069
 Or return your body to its basic particles and to the quark plasma produced after 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.850
 The Great Cosmic Explosion. After all this will produce new molecules and their antiviral molecules (material and antimatter) 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.010
 After your unfortunate destruction, something new will be something you have never seen before 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.650
 Will create 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.670
 To visualize the intensity of the blast, we will use the nuclear weapon map to see how a 45-megaton bomb will look 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.590
 In terms of the damage it will cause. But the truth is the damage 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.680
 A Superman punch will be like a burst of fire from his grip 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.040
 Destroying everything in its way and an updated explosion around it 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.680
 And will leave a nozzle with a diameter of 1 km and a depth of 221 meters 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.069
 So how do I approach you or are you from the power of Superman? My friends in the channel Asapscience 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.880
 What is the strength of muscle growth? (We explain it in the next translated video) and how the power of supernatural beings becomes more accessible 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.900
 From before 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.590
 So do not abuse Superman and as every time .. Thanks for your follow up
