00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
like using darker shades of foundation

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.689 
like using darker shades of foundation
like<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.510> bit<00:00:27.930> darker<00:00:28.380> than<00:00:28.680> my<00:00:28.859> original<00:00:29.189> skin

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
tone because I think it blends well with

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.720 
tone because I think it blends well with
my<00:00:33.660> neck<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.950> have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.399> consider

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
my neck because you have to consider

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
have a white face and then you're going

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.910 
have a white face and then you're going
to<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.660> uneven<00:00:42.660> colors<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.410> your<00:00:43.530> face<00:00:43.770> and

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
though we apply two or three layers it

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.940 
though we apply two or three layers it

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
I really really love that and the best

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.820 
I really really love that and the best
part<00:05:29.600> of<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.810> like<00:05:30.320> what<00:05:30.470> I've<00:05:30.560> said<00:05:30.710> earlier

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
part of this like what I've said earlier

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.270 
part of this like what I've said earlier
it<00:05:31.220> doesn't<00:05:31.490> feel<00:05:31.880> her

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
it doesn't feel her

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.230 
it doesn't feel her
your<00:05:32.610> skin<00:05:32.970> but<00:05:33.660> for<00:05:34.520> coverage<00:05:35.520> wise<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.970> think

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
your skin but for coverage wise I think

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.410 
your skin but for coverage wise I think
it's<00:05:36.420> just<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.930> same<00:05:37.230> with<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.950> reven<00:05:38.550> color

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
it's just the same with the reven color

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.930 
it's just the same with the reven color
stay<00:05:39.750> liquid<00:05:40.320> foundations<00:05:41.100> but<00:05:41.310> I<00:05:41.370> like<00:05:41.639> this

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
stay liquid foundations but I like this

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.940 
stay liquid foundations but I like this
better<00:05:42.210> I<00:05:42.360> think<00:05:42.810> because<00:05:43.320> it<00:05:43.440> doesn't<00:05:43.740> feel

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
better I think because it doesn't feel

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.010 
better I think because it doesn't feel
