tell you a little bit about a new
amplifier<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.340> Carvin<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.059> releasing<00:00:33.960> it's

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
amplifier that Carvin is releasing it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
amplifier that Carvin is releasing it's
the<00:00:34.710> legacy<00:00:34.920> 3<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.699> I've<00:00:36.539> been<00:00:36.690> working<00:00:36.870> with

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the legacy 3 and I've been working with

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.669 
the legacy 3 and I've been working with
Carvin<00:00:37.670> for<00:00:38.670> many<00:00:39.239> years<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.870> but<00:00:40.559> we

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
Carvin for many years actually but we

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.770 
Carvin for many years actually but we
came<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.249> a<00:00:41.309> custom<00:00:42.059> amp<00:00:42.269> a<00:00:42.480> signature

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
came out with a custom amp a signature

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.189 
came out with a custom amp a signature
amp<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.260> 1999<00:00:44.039> called<00:00:44.249> the<00:00:44.399> legacy<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.089> it<00:00:46.050> was

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
amp in 1999 called the legacy and it was

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.630 
amp in 1999 called the legacy and it was
pretty<00:00:46.499> much<00:00:46.589> based<00:00:46.769> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.069> kinds<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> things

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
pretty much based on the kinds of things

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.579 
pretty much based on the kinds of things
that<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.510> hear<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:48.929> see<00:00:49.109> in<00:00:49.199> an<00:00:49.319> amp

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
that I like to hear and see in an amp

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.149 
that I like to hear and see in an amp
and<00:00:50.719> it<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.929> lot<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> success<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.649> working

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
and it had a lot of success but working

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.009 
and it had a lot of success but working
with<00:00:53.429> a<00:00:53.460> company<00:00:53.909> like<00:00:54.030> Carbon<00:00:54.569> I<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
with a company like Carbon I have the

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.009 
with a company like Carbon I have the
opportunity<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> evolve<00:00:57.389> the<00:00:57.690> amps

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
opportunity to kind of evolve the amps

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.520 
opportunity to kind of evolve the amps
through<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.409> years<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.819> lot<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
through the years and a lot of the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.649 
through the years and a lot of the
changes<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.679> an<00:01:01.799> amplifier<00:01:02.039> come<00:01:02.819> from<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
changes in an amplifier come from you

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.570 
changes in an amplifier come from you
know<00:01:03.780> personal<00:01:04.409> taste<00:01:04.680> changes<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
know personal taste changes and and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.390 
know personal taste changes and and

feedback that we get from people and we
like<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> continue<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.990> try<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.620> advance<00:01:10.800> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
like to continue to try to advance the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
like to continue to try to advance the
functionality<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.290> tone<00:01:13.500> quality<00:01:13.800> and

functionality and the tone quality and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.360 
functionality and the tone quality and
I'm<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.090> happy<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> present<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.680> legacy<00:01:17.100> 3

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
I'm very happy to present the legacy 3

I'm very happy to present the legacy 3
amplifier<00:01:17.940> which<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> probably<00:01:19.500> my<00:01:19.620> favorite

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
amplifier which is probably my favorite

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.930 
amplifier which is probably my favorite
and<00:01:21.080> it's<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.290> three<00:01:22.560> channels<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.790> can

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
and it's got three channels and they can

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.480 
and it's got three channels and they can
all<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.380> very<00:01:25.380> different<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:25.830> each<00:01:26.010> other<00:01:26.190> in

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
all be very different from each other in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.900 
all be very different from each other in
the<00:01:26.910> sense<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.420> tone<00:01:27.630> quality<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.910> you

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
the sense of their tone quality and you

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.460 
the sense of their tone quality and you
can<00:01:29.940> see<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.660> stylish<00:01:31.200> looking

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
can see that it's a very stylish looking

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.300 
can see that it's a very stylish looking
amp<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.630> packs<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.780> hundred<00:01:34.110> watts<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:35.220> of

amp and packs a hundred watts and one of
the<00:01:35.370> smallest<00:01:35.700> packages<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.660> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.930> find

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
the smallest packages that you can find

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.590 
the smallest packages that you can find
a<00:01:37.320> hundred<00:01:37.590> watt<00:01:37.740> amp<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:39.120> also<00:01:39.270> rack

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
a hundred watt amp in and it's also rack

a hundred watt amp in and it's also rack
mountable<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.530> means<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> stack<00:01:41.640> ten

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mountable which means you can stack ten

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.830 
mountable which means you can stack ten
of<00:01:42.330> them<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.200> rack<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.710> take<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.310> tour

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
of them in a rack and take them on tour

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
of them in a rack and take them on tour
and<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.990> far<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.470> weight<00:01:46.620> goes<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.190> still

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and as far as the weight goes they still

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.440 
and as far as the weight goes they still
are<00:01:48.120> you<00:01:48.480> know<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:50.070> good<00:01:50.670> size<00:01:50.970> because

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
are you know a good good size because

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
are you know a good good size because
they<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.750> nice<00:01:51.930> heavy<00:01:52.230> transformers<00:01:53.010> in

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
they have nice heavy transformers in

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.350 
they have nice heavy transformers in
them<00:01:53.250> but<00:01:53.340> they're<00:01:53.490> still<00:01:53.520> lighter<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.210> most

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
them but they're still lighter than most

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.590 
them but they're still lighter than most
hundred<00:01:54.750> watt<00:01:54.900> amplifiers<00:01:55.910> so<00:01:56.910> these<00:01:57.360> three

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
hundred watt amplifiers so these three

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.270 
hundred watt amplifiers so these three
channels<00:01:57.810> are<00:01:58.110> beautiful<00:01:58.470> because<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.070> can

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
channels are beautiful because you can

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
channels are beautiful because you can
set<00:01:59.580> each<00:01:59.790> channel<00:02:00.300> differently<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.840> they're

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
set each channel differently and they're

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.950 
set each channel differently and they're
very<00:02:01.260> simple<00:02:01.560> controls<00:02:02.100> bass<00:02:02.580> mid<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.390> treble

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
very simple controls bass mid and treble

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.100 
very simple controls bass mid and treble
which<00:02:04.850> although<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.120> accused<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.750> being<00:02:06.930> very

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
which although I'm accused of being very

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.339 
which although I'm accused of being very
complex<00:02:07.650> at<00:02:07.860> times<00:02:08.330> these<00:02:09.330> amps<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.110> very

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
complex at times these amps I like very

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.450 
complex at times these amps I like very
simple<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> nice<00:02:13.560> thing<00:02:13.800> is<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.069> has<00:02:14.190> this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
simple and the nice thing is it has this

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.730 
simple and the nice thing is it has this
master<00:02:15.090> section<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.110> master<00:02:16.500> section

master section and the master section

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.480 
master section and the master section
effects

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
effects

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.370 
effects
all<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.820> three<00:02:18.030> channels<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:19.140> instance

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
all of the three channels for instance

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.050 
all of the three channels for instance
you<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> master<00:02:19.980> volume<00:02:20.010> control<00:02:20.850> which

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you have a master volume control which

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
you have a master volume control which
is<00:02:21.090> wonderful<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> ever

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
is wonderful because you know you ever

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.550 
is wonderful because you know you ever
like<00:02:23.310> get<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> really<00:02:23.880> nice<00:02:24.060> sound<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.440> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
like get a really nice sound that you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.920 
like get a really nice sound that you
like<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.340> fooling<00:02:27.240> around<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.690> gain

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
like out of fooling around with the gain

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.970 
like out of fooling around with the gain
and<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.620> volume<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.630> too<00:02:30.870> loud<00:02:31.110> so

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
and the volume and then it's too loud so

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.860 
and the volume and then it's too loud so
you<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.850> bring<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> volume<00:02:33.420> down<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you have to bring the volume down but it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.290 
you have to bring the volume down but it
changes<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> tone<00:02:34.530> completely<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.910> really

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
changes the tone completely so really

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.330 
changes the tone completely so really
what<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.570> get<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> sound<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.040> like

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
what you get is the sound that you like

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.140 
what you get is the sound that you like
at<00:02:38.610> any<00:02:39.000> volume<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:41.150> that's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
at any volume you like and that's

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.530 
at any volume you like and that's
relatively<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.990> unique<00:02:43.410> feature<00:02:44.150> it<00:02:45.150> also<00:02:45.240> has

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
relatively a unique feature it also has

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.230 
relatively a unique feature it also has
a<00:02:45.570> boost<00:02:46.050> control<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:47.070> gives<00:02:47.340> each<00:02:47.550> channel

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
a boost control that gives each channel

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.900 
a boost control that gives each channel
sort<00:02:48.870> of<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> 6<00:02:49.350> DB<00:02:49.560> boost<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.580> doesn't

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
sort of like a 6 DB boost but it doesn't

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.690 
sort of like a 6 DB boost but it doesn't
affect<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.570> distortion<00:02:52.380> or<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.190> overdrive

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
affect the distortion or the overdrive

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.990 
affect the distortion or the overdrive
it's<00:02:53.940> just<00:02:54.210> sort<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> like<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:56.610> puts<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.970> on

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
it's just sort of like it puts you on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
it's just sort of like it puts you on
top<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.480> band<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:57.960> is<00:02:57.990> where<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.320> guitar

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
top of the band which is where a guitar

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.210 
top of the band which is where a guitar
player<00:02:58.830> belongs<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.440> has<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> reverb

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
player belongs and then it has a reverb

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180 
player belongs and then it has a reverb
which<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> signature<00:03:03.750> reverb<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.230> that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
which is a signature reverb that that

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.550 
which is a signature reverb that that
Carvin<00:03:05.580> uses<00:03:05.880> that's<00:03:06.030> very<00:03:06.270> nice<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.750> this

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
Carvin uses that's very nice and this

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.170 
Carvin uses that's very nice and this
can<00:03:07.740> affect<00:03:07.830> all<00:03:08.190> channels<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.820> you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.030> turn

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
can affect all channels and you can turn

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.820 
can affect all channels and you can turn
it<00:03:09.240> on<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.480> often<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.990> footswitch<00:03:10.440> allows

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
it on and often the footswitch allows

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.220 
it on and often the footswitch allows
you<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.250> go<00:03:11.550> between<00:03:11.700> channels<00:03:12.120> give<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you to go between channels give you the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.230 
you to go between channels give you the
reverb<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.770> also<00:03:14.430> give<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> boost<00:03:15.000> up

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
reverb and also give you the boost up

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.770 
reverb and also give you the boost up
and<00:03:15.390> down

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and down

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.310 
and down
so<00:03:17.090> this<00:03:18.090> first<00:03:18.330> channel<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.750> very<00:03:18.930> nice<00:03:19.140> I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
so this first channel is very nice I

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.870 
so this first channel is very nice I
like<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> clean<00:03:19.920> quality<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.550> got<00:03:20.700> that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
like the clean quality it's got that

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:34.980 
like the clean quality it's got that
kind<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.240> bell

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.020 

and<00:03:35.990> if<00:03:36.530> you're<00:03:36.680> doing<00:03:37.430> something<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:37.910> that

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
and if you're doing something like that

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.580 
and if you're doing something like that
you<00:03:38.300> just<00:03:38.360> want<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.720> throw<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.900> little<00:03:39.170> riff<00:03:39.380> in

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
you just want to throw a little riff in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:51.160 
you just want to throw a little riff in
it's<00:03:39.800> got<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.220> boost<00:03:40.910> control<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.510> know<00:03:50.170> and

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
it's got the boost control you know and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.140 
it's got the boost control you know and
then<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.380> second<00:03:51.770> channel<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.250> your<00:03:52.850> crunch

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
then the second channel is your crunch

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.150 
then the second channel is your crunch
channel<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.750> gives<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.140> sort<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.860> nice

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
channel it gives you sort of a nice

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.240 
channel it gives you sort of a nice
rhythm<00:03:55.940> kind<00:03:56.300> of<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.480> sound<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:57.620> not<00:03:57.890> too

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
rhythm kind of a sound that's not too

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.490 
rhythm kind of a sound that's not too
distorted<00:03:58.580> although<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.180> can<00:03:59.510> with<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.380> use

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
distorted although you can with the use

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.680 
distorted although you can with the use
of<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.739> drive<00:04:00.980> control<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:02.209> know<00:04:02.330> take<00:04:02.570> it

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
of the drive control you know take it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.229 
of the drive control you know take it
into<00:04:02.900> some<00:04:03.110> hairy<00:04:03.560> directions<00:04:04.130> but<00:04:04.880> for<00:04:05.180> the

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
into some hairy directions but for the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:30.990 
into some hairy directions but for the
most<00:04:05.390> part<00:04:05.630> it's<00:04:05.780> kind<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:06.020> a<00:04:06.080> nice<00:04:06.230> simple

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.600 

kind<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.030> not<00:04:32.210> too<00:04:32.240> distorted<00:04:33.370> but<00:04:34.370> then<00:04:34.490> if

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
kind of not too distorted but then if

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.330 
kind of not too distorted but then if
you<00:04:34.700> really<00:04:35.030> want<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.360> know<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.570> solo<00:04:35.810> tone

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
you really want you know the solo tone

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:55.510 
you really want you know the solo tone
channel<00:04:37.340> 3<00:04:37.580> has<00:04:38.180> got<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> lot<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.510> hair<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:38.780> it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.230 

and<00:04:56.539> each<00:04:57.539> one<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.810> these<00:04:58.580> channels<00:04:59.580> as<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.060> say

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
and each one of these channels as I say

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.689 
and each one of these channels as I say
has<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.389> drive<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> presence<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.250> can<00:05:02.460> set

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
has a drive a presence so you can set

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.900 
has a drive a presence so you can set
these<00:05:03.270> controls<00:05:03.810> different<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.759> switch<00:05:05.759> in

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
these controls different and switch in

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.550 
these controls different and switch in
between<00:05:06.210> all<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.449> amps<00:05:06.750> and<00:05:06.930> it's<00:05:07.380> really

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
between all the amps and it's really

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.230 
between all the amps and it's really
nice<00:05:07.740> because<00:05:07.979> now<00:05:08.819> I<00:05:08.849> don't<00:05:09.090> need<00:05:09.210> a

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
nice because now I don't need a

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.480 
nice because now I don't need a
distortion<00:05:09.720> pedal<00:05:09.990> because<00:05:10.259> this<00:05:10.740> amp<00:05:10.979> has<00:05:11.069> a

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
distortion pedal because this amp has a

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.300 
distortion pedal because this amp has a
lot<00:05:12.300> of<00:05:12.330> gain<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.169> a<00:05:13.259> really<00:05:13.710> organic

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
lot of gain and it's a really organic

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.400 
lot of gain and it's a really organic
