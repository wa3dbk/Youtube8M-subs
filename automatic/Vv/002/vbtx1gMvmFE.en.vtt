00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
front and we'll start taking a look at

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.139 
front and we'll start taking a look at
everything<00:02:06.130> know<00:02:07.130> one<00:02:07.340> thing<00:02:07.580> that<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:07.909> thought

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
everything know one thing that I thought

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.090 
everything know one thing that I thought
was<00:02:08.300> really<00:02:08.330> cool<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:09.019> these<00:02:09.590> are<00:02:09.890> the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
was really cool is these are the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.460 
was really cool is these are the
jellyfish<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.390> have<00:02:11.570> four<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:11.959> them<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.350> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
jellyfish you have four of them in the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.370 
jellyfish you have four of them in the
set<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.180> instead<00:02:14.180> of<00:02:14.330> being<00:02:14.600> like<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.140> regular

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
set and instead of being like a regular

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.470 
set and instead of being like a regular
piece<00:02:15.890> they're<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.269> really<00:02:18.019> soft<00:02:18.470> rubbery

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
piece they're just really soft rubbery

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.290 
piece they're just really soft rubbery
kind<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.630> almost<00:02:20.840> slimy<00:02:21.470> feel<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.310> them<00:02:22.489> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
kind of almost slimy feel to them and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.320 
kind of almost slimy feel to them and
the<00:02:24.290> only<00:02:24.440> downside<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.760> this

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
the only downside to them is this

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.830 
the only downside to them is this
material<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.709> really<00:02:28.250> collects<00:02:28.760> dust<00:02:29.450> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
material really really collects dust and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.740 
material really really collects dust and
fur<00:02:30.320> things<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.700> it<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.390> really

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
fur things like that so it is really

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.229 
fur things like that so it is really
impossible<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.709> keep<00:02:33.860> all<00:02:34.070> the<00:02:34.310> fuzz<00:02:34.760> off<00:02:35.060> of

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
impossible to keep all the fuzz off of

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:35.590 
impossible to keep all the fuzz off of
them

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
them

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.620 
them
but<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.380> do<00:02:36.440> look<00:02:37.070> really<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:38.120> cool<00:02:38.360> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
but they do look really really cool I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.620 
but they do look really really cool I
like<00:02:38.989> them<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.320> lot<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.519> like<00:02:40.850> I<00:02:40.910> said<00:02:41.060> there's

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
like them a lot and like I said there's

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.820 
like them a lot and like I said there's
four<00:02:41.989> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> set<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.239> this<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.989> the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
four in the set and so this is the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370 
four in the set and so this is the
vehicle<00:02:46.250> plankton<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.000> using<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.959> throw

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
vehicle plankton is using to throw

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.789 
vehicle plankton is using to throw
jellyfish<00:02:49.220> everywhere<00:02:49.790> kind<00:02:50.570> of<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.840> catapult

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
jellyfish everywhere kind of a catapult

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.009 
jellyfish everywhere kind of a catapult
thing<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.940> push<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.239> down<00:02:53.390> on<00:02:53.840> this

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
thing and you just push it down on this

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.710 
thing and you just push it down on this
side<00:02:54.290> for<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.010> part<00:02:55.280> right<00:02:55.430> here<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.910> it

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
side for this part right here and it

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960 
side for this part right here and it
just<00:02:56.750> launches<00:02:57.560> them<00:02:57.739> like<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.820> can

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
just launches them like that and you can

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.670 
just launches them like that and you can
launch<00:02:59.120> them<00:02:59.450> obviously<00:02:59.780> anywhere<00:03:00.530> behind

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
launch them obviously anywhere behind

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.790 
launch them obviously anywhere behind
you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
you

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.440 
you
and<00:03:02.980> she'd<00:03:03.520> say<00:03:03.700> there's<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.060> friend<00:03:04.360> a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
and she'd say there's the friend a

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.140 
and she'd say there's the friend a
vehicle<00:03:05.730> pretty<00:03:06.730> cool<00:03:07.030> little<00:03:07.210> vehicle<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.990> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
vehicle pretty cool little vehicle and I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.140 
vehicle pretty cool little vehicle and I
like<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:11.920> losing<00:03:12.400> jellyfish<00:03:12.880> in<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
like it I'm losing jellyfish in the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.560 
like it I'm losing jellyfish in the
front<00:03:13.390> now<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:13.840> anyway<00:03:14.760> still<00:03:15.760> really<00:03:16.360> cool

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
front now but anyway still really cool

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.360 
front now but anyway still really cool
little<00:03:16.720> vehicle<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.440> think<00:03:17.740> this<00:03:18.130> is<00:03:18.250> an

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
little vehicle I think this is an

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.760 
little vehicle I think this is an
awesome<00:03:18.490> little<00:03:18.820> set<00:03:19.150> but<00:03:19.960> not<00:03:20.350> because<00:03:20.590> of

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
awesome little set but not because of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
awesome little set but not because of
that<00:03:21.130> vehicle<00:03:21.460> obviously<00:03:23.400> everybody<00:03:24.400> wants

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
that vehicle obviously everybody wants

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.990 
that vehicle obviously everybody wants
to<00:03:24.880> see<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.210> invisible<00:03:26.170> boatmobile<00:03:27.000> because

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
to see the invisible boatmobile because

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.120 
to see the invisible boatmobile because
this<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.980> awesome

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
this is awesome

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.850 
this is awesome
every<00:03:30.910> piece<00:03:31.240> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.140> invisible<00:03:32.650> boatmobile

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
every piece on the invisible boatmobile

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.930 
every piece on the invisible boatmobile
is<00:03:33.570> translucent<00:03:34.570> every<00:03:35.380> single<00:03:35.650> piece<00:03:35.940> even

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
is translucent every single piece even

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.850 
is translucent every single piece even
down<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.390> tires<00:03:37.810> which<00:03:38.320> I<00:03:38.470> thought<00:03:38.680> was

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
down to the tires which I thought was

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.490 
down to the tires which I thought was
really<00:03:39.250> fantastic<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.960> only<00:03:41.170> thing<00:03:41.320> not

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
really fantastic the only thing not

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.620 
really fantastic the only thing not
translucent<00:03:42.160> obviously<00:03:42.700> are<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:42.970> pieces

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
translucent obviously are the pieces

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.100 
translucent obviously are the pieces
used<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.980> make<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.580> net<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.600> capture<00:03:46.780> the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
used to make the net to capture the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.430 
used to make the net to capture the
jellyfish<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.300> net<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.750> also<00:03:50.080> made<00:03:50.290> of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
jellyfish so and the net is also made of

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.700 
jellyfish so and the net is also made of
that<00:03:50.530> same<00:03:50.860> material<00:03:51.600> that<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.840> jellyfish<00:03:53.440> is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:53.710 
that same material that the jellyfish is

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.820 
that same material that the jellyfish is
made<00:03:54.010> out<00:03:54.190> of<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.360> that's<00:03:55.840> kind<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.320> cool<00:03:56.500> and

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
made out of so that's kind of cool and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.790 
made out of so that's kind of cool and
as<00:03:57.640> you<00:03:57.850> can<00:03:57.970> see<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.330> can<00:03:58.540> turn<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.960> any<00:03:59.620> way

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
as you can see you can turn it any way

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.310 
as you can see you can turn it any way
you<00:03:59.830> want<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.370> can<00:04:00.520> also<00:04:00.610> turn<00:04:01.030> in<00:04:01.780> that<00:04:02.020> up

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
you want you can also turn in that up

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.410 
you want you can also turn in that up
here<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:04.620> try<00:04:05.620> not<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.040> lose<00:04:06.160> jellyfish<00:04:06.760> you

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
here and try not to lose jellyfish you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.090 
here and try not to lose jellyfish you
can<00:04:07.540> also<00:04:07.690> lift<00:04:08.020> it<00:04:08.200> up<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.500> down<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:08.920> that

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
can also lift it up and down like that

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.830 
can also lift it up and down like that
so<00:04:09.370> you<00:04:09.670> have<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> lot<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.209> control<00:04:10.570> over<00:04:10.600> the

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
so you have a lot of control over the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.970 
so you have a lot of control over the
net<00:04:11.110> which<00:04:11.410> i<00:04:11.530> think<00:04:11.590> is<00:04:11.860> very<00:04:11.890> cool<00:04:12.400> it's<00:04:13.120> also

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
net which i think is very cool it's also

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.460 
net which i think is very cool it's also
clean<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.880> glass<00:04:16.150> part<00:04:16.510> right<00:04:16.690> here<00:04:16.900> back<00:04:17.200> if

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
clean the glass part right here back if

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.750 
clean the glass part right here back if
you<00:04:17.530> want<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.980> you've<00:04:18.730> got<00:04:18.940> patrick<00:04:19.810> driving<00:04:20.350> I

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
you want to you've got patrick driving I

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.090 
you want to you've got patrick driving I
just<00:04:21.760> think<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.360> really<00:04:23.290> really<00:04:23.470> awesome

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
just think this is really really awesome

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.610 
just think this is really really awesome
he<00:04:24.310> did<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.520> great<00:04:24.760> job<00:04:24.790> designing<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.900> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
he did a great job designing it and the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.680 
he did a great job designing it and the
fact<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.890> it's<00:04:27.070> all<00:04:27.250> translucent<00:04:28.120> was

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
fact that it's all translucent was

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.320 
fact that it's all translucent was
awesome<00:04:29.650> now<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.550> does<00:04:30.730> make<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.120> little

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
awesome now it does make it a little

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.000 
awesome now it does make it a little
difficult<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.020> build<00:04:32.230> because<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.800> pieces

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
difficult to build because the pieces

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.510 
difficult to build because the pieces
are<00:04:33.190> so<00:04:33.640> similar<00:04:35.040> finding<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> correct

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
are so similar finding to a correct

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.850 
are so similar finding to a correct
piece<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.300> start<00:04:37.510> with<00:04:37.780> can<00:04:38.470> be<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.620> little

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
piece to start with can be a little

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.510 
piece to start with can be a little
difficult

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
difficult

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.720 
difficult
but<00:04:40.420> is<00:04:40.660> definitely<00:04:40.930> worth<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.770> when<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.430> do

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
but is definitely worth it when you do

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.510 
but is definitely worth it when you do
finish<00:04:43.000> building<00:04:43.330> it<00:04:43.680> because<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.980> think<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.370> is

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
finish building it because I think it is

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.500 
finish building it because I think it is
just<00:04:46.300> awesome<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:48.730> do<00:04:48.850> have<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.030> couple<00:04:49.300> of
