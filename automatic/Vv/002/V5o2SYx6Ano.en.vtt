00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
now there's been a lot of videos about

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.700 
now there's been a lot of videos about
how<00:00:27.610> make<00:00:28.030> guitars<00:00:28.210> on<00:00:28.630> youtube<00:00:29.080> and<00:00:29.350> I<00:00:29.500> just

how make guitars on youtube and I just

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.470 
how make guitars on youtube and I just
really<00:00:29.890> want<00:00:30.190> to<00:00:30.310> show<00:00:30.490> mon<00:00:30.730> off<00:00:30.910> because<00:00:31.330> I

really want to show mon off because I

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.650 
really want to show mon off because I
think<00:00:31.540> I<00:00:32.050> think<00:00:32.770> it's<00:00:32.980> pretty<00:00:33.130> good<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
think I think it's pretty good the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.830 
think I think it's pretty good the
design<00:00:35.080> I<00:00:35.110> created<00:00:35.710> myself

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.560 

using<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.920> sheet<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.670> paper<00:00:41.000> like<00:00:41.570> so

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.990 

and<00:00:45.110> tracing<00:00:45.620> an<00:00:45.710> epiphone<00:00:46.190> strat<00:00:46.520> replica

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
and tracing an epiphone strat replica

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.620 
and tracing an epiphone strat replica
onto<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:47.680> which<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.940> one<00:00:50.180> right<00:00:50.360> here<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
onto it which was this one right here I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.850 
onto it which was this one right here I
sure

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.380 

and<00:00:56.920> tweaked<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.070> around<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:58.760> made<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.060> final

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
and tweaked it around and made the final

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.370 
and tweaked it around and made the final
shape<00:01:00.310> which<00:01:01.310> ended<00:01:01.730> up<00:01:01.910> to<00:01:02.540> be<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:03.050> right

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
shape which ended up to be this right

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.649 
shape which ended up to be this right
here

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
see the wood and the final shape right

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.480 
see the wood and the final shape right
here<00:01:27.819> of<00:01:28.359> my<00:01:28.810> body<00:01:29.140> guitar

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
here of my body guitar

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.139 
here of my body guitar
I<00:01:31.579> also<00:01:32.150> routed<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:32.810> insides<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.130> go<00:01:34.430> v8<00:01:34.790> so

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
I also routed the insides so to go v8 so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.550 
I also routed the insides so to go v8 so
I'll<00:01:35.360> be<00:01:35.540> able<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.869> fit<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.320> whammy<00:01:37.280> bar<00:01:38.560> so

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
I'll be able to fit the whammy bar so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.760 
I'll be able to fit the whammy bar so
and<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.610> whammy<00:01:40.939> bar<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.600> pickups<00:01:42.590> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and the whammy bar and the pickups and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.120 
and the whammy bar and the pickups and
everything<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.110> you<00:01:45.110> can<00:01:45.320> see<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
everything and you can see it on the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.820 
everything and you can see it on the
back<00:01:46.399> as<00:01:46.700> well<00:01:46.729> sort<00:01:47.479> of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.770 

the<00:01:51.400> neck<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:52.780> off<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.230> strat<00:01:53.500> replica<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
the neck was off the strat replica this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.680 
the neck was off the strat replica this
is<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.260> epiphone<00:01:56.800> logo<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.730> I<00:01:57.970> didn't

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
is the epiphone logo on it I didn't

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.160 
is the epiphone logo on it I didn't
really<00:01:58.810> tweak<00:01:59.500> with<00:01:59.740> it<00:02:00.010> or<00:02:00.390> make<00:02:01.390> my<00:02:01.660> own<00:02:01.690> egg

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
really tweak with it or make my own egg

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.340 
really tweak with it or make my own egg
because<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.620> would<00:02:02.860> have<00:02:02.980> tooken<00:02:04.050> really<00:02:05.050> it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
because I would have tooken really it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.389 
because I would have tooken really it
would<00:02:05.500> have<00:02:05.620> taken<00:02:05.770> very<00:02:06.370> very<00:02:06.550> long<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:08.399> like

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
would have taken very very long and like

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.150 
would have taken very very long and like
I<00:02:09.790> just<00:02:10.240> didn't<00:02:10.840> have<00:02:11.020> enough<00:02:11.050> time<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.620> work

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
I just didn't have enough time to work

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.300 
I just didn't have enough time to work
with<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.990> but<00:02:13.990> what<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> really<00:02:14.650> wanted<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> do

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
with that but what I really wanted to do

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.770 
with that but what I really wanted to do
was<00:02:15.610> put<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> stripe<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.800> lace<00:02:17.800> would<00:02:18.540> write<00:02:19.540> on

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
was put a stripe of lace would write on

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
was put a stripe of lace would write on
the<00:02:19.960> bottom<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.580> then<00:02:22.420> maybe<00:02:22.660> for<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the bottom of it and then maybe for the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.800 
the bottom of it and then maybe for the
for<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.700> rod<00:02:25.000> cover<00:02:25.330> put<00:02:25.870> lace<00:02:26.200> wood<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.860> made

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
for the rod cover put lace wood and made

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.240 
for the rod cover put lace wood and made
tweaked<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.680> shape<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.400> head<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
tweaked the shape of the head of the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.330 
tweaked the shape of the head of the
I'll<00:02:31.580> probably<00:02:31.820> do<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.210> later<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.130> um

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
I'll probably do that later on but um

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.420 
I'll probably do that later on but um
I've<00:02:35.030> actually<00:02:35.900> got<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.710> jig's<00:02:37.010> i<00:02:37.160> use<00:02:37.400> when

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
I've actually got the jig's i use when

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.820 
I've actually got the jig's i use when
grabbing<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.480> guitar

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.260 

this<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.640> for<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.880> front

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this was for the front

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.360 
this was for the front
you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.840> see<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
