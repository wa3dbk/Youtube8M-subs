00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
first started out wearing makeup I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.020 
first started out wearing makeup I
didn't<00:02:44.709> put<00:02:44.920> anything<00:02:45.190> it<00:02:45.850> was<00:02:46.000> just

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
didn't put anything it was just

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.539 
didn't put anything it was just
foundation<00:02:46.660> it<00:02:46.780> was<00:02:46.870> flat<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.470> didn't<00:02:47.950> create

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
foundation it was flat I didn't create

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.330 
foundation it was flat I didn't create
any<00:02:48.760> dimension<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.450> my<00:02:49.480> face<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.260> at<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.190> time

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
any dimension to my face and at the time

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.520 
any dimension to my face and at the time
I<00:02:51.400> thought<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.730> was<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.060> gorgeous<00:02:53.049> but<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.410> was

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
I thought I was just gorgeous but it was

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.600 
I thought I was just gorgeous but it was
probably<00:02:53.769> because<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.980> was<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.489> know<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
probably because I was you know a

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.880 
probably because I was you know a
teenager<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.360> teens<00:02:56.230> don't<00:02:56.470> really<00:02:56.739> need

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
teenager and teens don't really need

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.789 
teenager and teens don't really need
that<00:02:56.950> much<00:02:57.310> but<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:58.599> once<00:02:58.900> i<00:02:59.140> started<00:02:59.620> using

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
that much but so once i started using

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.740 
that much but so once i started using
the<00:03:00.040> strobe<00:03:00.310> cream<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:03.180> really<00:03:04.180> realized<00:03:04.330> how

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the strobe cream I really realized how

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.170 
the strobe cream I really realized how
to<00:03:05.410> use<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.920> plane<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.160> face<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.849> create<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
to use the plane to face and create the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.930 
to use the plane to face and create the
high<00:03:07.330> points<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.870> low<00:03:08.019> points<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.280> this<00:03:09.790> is

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
high points and low points so this is

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.270 
high points and low points so this is
great<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.299> highlight<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.049> where<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.920> like<00:03:12.250> to

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
great to highlight and where I like to

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.710 
great to highlight and where I like to
highlight<00:03:12.610> as<00:03:12.940> well<00:03:13.090> as<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:13.269> lot<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.569> other

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
little bit but it also somehow creates

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.920 
little bit but it also somehow creates

and body and that means that it's not

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.910 
and body and that means that it's not
going<00:05:24.790> to<00:05:24.910> give<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.300> lot<00:05:25.660> of<00:05:25.780> coverage<00:05:26.140> with

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:26.920 
going to give you a lot of coverage with

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.710 
going to give you a lot of coverage with
just<00:05:27.340> your<00:05:27.640> one<00:05:27.850> layer<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.360> you're<00:05:28.540> putting

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
just your one layer that you're putting

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.250 
just your one layer that you're putting
on<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.280> I<00:05:30.640> don't<00:05:31.150> need<00:05:31.330> that<00:05:31.510> much<00:05:31.750> coverage

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
on so I I don't need that much coverage

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.330 
on so I I don't need that much coverage
I<00:05:32.500> just<00:05:32.890> want<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:34.260> good<00:05:35.260> effect<00:05:35.590> and<00:05:35.830> evenness

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
but the more coverage you want you just

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.740 
but the more coverage you want you just
let<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.130> dry<00:05:39.430> put<00:05:39.730> on<00:05:39.850> another<00:05:40.090> layer<00:05:40.360> it's

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
let it dry put on another layer it's

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.900 
let it dry put on another layer it's
just<00:05:40.900> kind<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.080> like<00:05:41.140> painting<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.520> it's

it's good for a lot of things for

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.840 
it's good for a lot of things for
getting<00:06:10.210> into<00:06:10.540> the<00:06:10.660> crease<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.640> also<00:06:12.640> for

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
getting into the crease and also for

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.240 
getting into the crease and also for
just<00:06:13.060> blending<00:06:13.570> this<00:06:14.110> is<00:06:14.320> this<00:06:14.620> is<00:06:14.830> what<00:06:14.980> got

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
just blending this is this is what got

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.720 
just blending this is this is what got
me<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:15.820> create<00:06:16.630> more<00:06:17.230> flawless<00:06:17.530> blending<00:06:18.250> was

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
me to create more flawless blending was

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.770 
me to create more flawless blending was
with<00:06:18.970> this<00:06:19.240> brush<00:06:19.570> so<00:06:20.560> I<00:06:21.390> should<00:06:22.390> probably<00:06:22.419> buy

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
with this brush so I should probably buy

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.870 
with this brush so I should probably buy
more<00:06:23.080> I<00:06:23.350> should<00:06:23.919> probably<00:06:24.010> buy<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.370> lot<00:06:24.610> of<00:06:24.760> them

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
more I should probably buy a lot of them

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.860 
more I should probably buy a lot of them
because<00:06:25.480> i<00:06:25.600> use<00:06:25.840> it<00:06:26.020> over<00:06:26.290> and<00:06:26.590> over<00:06:26.740> again<00:06:26.980> so

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
because i use it over and over again so

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.409 
because i use it over and over again so
this<00:06:28.870> is<00:06:29.380> worth<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.520> money<00:06:30.669> which<00:06:31.240> i<00:06:31.360> don't

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
this is worth the money which i don't

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.770 
this is worth the money which i don't
know<00:06:31.660> how<00:06:31.810> much<00:06:32.020> it<00:06:32.169> is

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.600 

and<00:06:35.050> then<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.800> guess<00:06:35.950> we'll<00:06:36.070> just<00:06:36.130> do<00:06:36.490> an

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
and then I guess we'll just do an

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.640 
and then I guess we'll just do an
eyeshadow<00:06:37.030> because<00:06:37.650> um<00:06:39.360> I'm<00:06:40.360> kind<00:06:40.570> of<00:06:40.720> I<00:06:41.110> don't

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
eyeshadow because um I'm kind of I don't

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.270 
eyeshadow because um I'm kind of I don't
want<00:06:41.800> same<00:06:42.240> notorious<00:06:43.240> but<00:06:43.710> oftentimes<00:06:44.710> I<00:06:45.220> do

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
want same notorious but oftentimes I do

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.390 
want same notorious but oftentimes I do
