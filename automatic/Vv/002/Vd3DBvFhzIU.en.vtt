back of the transfer paper I think that

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.400 
back of the transfer paper I think that
most<00:01:41.819> transfer<00:01:42.209> papers<00:01:42.539> do<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> same<00:01:43.080> thing

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
most transfer papers do the same thing

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.900 
most transfer papers do the same thing
but<00:01:43.649> some<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.009> different<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
but some are different so not really

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.910 
but some are different so not really
explain<00:01:45.300> what<00:01:45.390> I'm<00:01:45.479> doing<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.619> mean

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
explain what I'm doing because I mean

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.300 
explain what I'm doing because I mean
your<00:01:47.160> directions<00:01:47.580> could<00:01:47.789> be<00:01:47.940> different<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
your directions could be different so

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:02.210 
your directions could be different so

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.740 
taking off the backings for the bottom
one<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.300> sticking<00:02:25.690> onto<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.200> felt<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.750> by

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
one and sticking onto the felt and by

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.570 
one and sticking onto the felt and by
the<00:02:28.810> way<00:02:29.050> I'm<00:02:29.260> probably<00:02:29.890> explaining<00:02:30.489> this

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
the way I'm probably explaining this

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.820 
the way I'm probably explaining this
really<00:02:31.150> horribly<00:02:31.540> switched<00:02:31.840> excuse<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.590> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
really horribly switched excuse that and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.590 
really horribly switched excuse that and
try<00:02:33.519> understand<00:02:33.970> what<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:34.180> saying

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
try understand what I'm saying

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.630 
try understand what I'm saying
so<00:02:35.260> then<00:02:35.470> I'm<00:02:35.590> measuring<00:02:36.010> up<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> other

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
so then I'm measuring up with the other

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.160 
so then I'm measuring up with the other
side<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.150> putting<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> other<00:02:37.570> side<00:02:37.780> on<00:02:37.930> top

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
side and putting the other side on top

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.160 
side and putting the other side on top
of<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.590> see<00:02:38.800> if<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.250> will<00:02:39.370> fit<00:02:39.430> down<00:02:40.170> taking

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
of it to see if it will fit down taking

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.320 
of it to see if it will fit down taking
off<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.500> top<00:02:41.769> sticky<00:02:42.190> thing<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:43.090> was

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
off the top sticky thing and that was

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.309 
off the top sticky thing and that was
help<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.720> felt<00:02:44.530> stick<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.730> other<00:02:46.030> side<00:02:46.450> so

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
help the felt stick to the other side so

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.770 
help the felt stick to the other side so
I<00:02:47.560> mean<00:02:47.830> I'm<00:02:47.980> just<00:02:48.010> doing<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> it's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
I mean I'm just doing that and it's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.540 
I mean I'm just doing that and it's
really<00:02:50.230> hard<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.709> get<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.069> sticky<00:02:51.519> stuff

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
really hard to get that sticky stuff

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.430 
really hard to get that sticky stuff
long<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.269> don't<00:02:52.300> judge<00:02:52.840> me<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.050> really<00:02:53.319> could

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
long so don't judge me I really could

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.290 
long so don't judge me I really could
not<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.860> then<00:02:54.220> I'm<00:02:54.370> taking<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.819> other<00:02:54.970> side

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
not do it then I'm taking the other side

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240 
not do it then I'm taking the other side
of<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> phone<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.050> pushing<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.769> down<00:02:56.830> on

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
of the phone and pushing that down on

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.670 
of the phone and pushing that down on
the<00:02:57.370> top<00:02:57.580> velcro<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:59.200> I'm<00:02:59.319> peeling<00:02:59.470> apart

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
the top velcro then I'm peeling apart

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.650 
the top velcro then I'm peeling apart
the<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.220> velcro's<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.030> once<00:03:01.209> I've<00:03:01.390> done<00:03:01.420> that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the two velcro's and once I've done that

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.140 
the two velcro's and once I've done that
there<00:03:02.170> should<00:03:02.319> be<00:03:02.350> three<00:03:02.980> velcro<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.550> one<00:03:03.850> side

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
there should be three velcro on one side

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.310 
there should be three velcro on one side
if<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:04.420> focus<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.989> other<00:03:05.170> side

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.130 

and<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:09.460> is<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.790> for<00:03:09.820> your<00:03:10.090> DIY<00:03:10.390> giant

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
and that is it for your DIY giant

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.760 
and that is it for your DIY giant
Starbucks<00:03:11.560> leave

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.860 

so<00:03:16.490> step<00:03:16.850> number<00:03:17.000> three<00:03:17.300> is<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> make<00:03:17.720> your

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
coffee Trick or Treat basket I've

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.180 
coffee Trick or Treat basket I've
started<00:03:20.150> off<00:03:20.330> by<00:03:20.570> taking<00:03:20.780> either<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.920> paper

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
started off by taking either a paper

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.400 
started off by taking either a paper
towel<00:03:22.550> or<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.240> wrapping<00:03:23.690> paper<00:03:23.870> roll<00:03:24.200> and

towel or a wrapping paper roll and

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.260 
towel or a wrapping paper roll and
painting<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.280> dark<00:03:25.730> green<00:03:25.940> like<00:03:26.150> a

Starbucks straw would be and I'm using
acrylic<00:03:29.390> paint<00:03:29.660> but<00:03:29.960> I<00:03:30.020> think<00:03:30.290> any<00:03:30.590> paint

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
acrylic paint but I think any paint

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.130

would<00:03:31.130> work<00:03:31.340> I'm<00:03:32.030> not<00:03:32.360> paying<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.660> means<00:03:32.870> higher

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
would work I'm not paying a means higher

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.870 
would work I'm not paying a means higher
to<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.680> color<00:03:33.950> because<00:03:34.100> that'd<00:03:34.400> be<00:03:34.490> a<00:03:34.520> really

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
to this color because that'd be a really

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.970 
to this color because that'd be a really
large<00:03:35.120> straw<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.140> I'm<00:03:36.290> painting<00:03:36.560> about
