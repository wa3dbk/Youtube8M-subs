 and with it the spring season on this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.000
 a warm sunny day awaits us 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 weather 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.439
 however , rain is possible at times 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 warming faster 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.240
 aquatic vegetation covers but also 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.250
 makes the aquatic fauna move 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.060
 most active fish already 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 spawn 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 however, carp is just beginning to spawn 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.440
 in this issue we will tell you how and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.730
 what to catch bleak u wash 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.230
 case and guster but first things first 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.719
 mercury thermometer bright pair 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.440
 days will range from 20 to 32 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.520
 degrees 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.289
 and at night from 13 to 20 small rains 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.489
 possible monday and wednesday at 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.210
 the rest of the days 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 the sky promises to be solar pressure 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.340
 air will be slightly reduced reaching 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.920
 seven hundred and fifty reset 55 millimeters 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.600
 mercury column 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 the moon this week will continue its journey 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.180
 from the second quarter to the full moon that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.490
 promises anglers a great bite 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.680
 fish will be more active to eat much 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.160
 more often go out of hiding and will be more 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.990
 to travel around the reservoir should 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.660
 remember that the phase of the moon is not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.910
 decisive factor however in quiet warm 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.130
 and calm weather like what's expected 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.080
 this week and we play an important 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.790
 role 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.830
 First of all it should be recalled that all 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 there is still a ban on catching more than 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.410
 one rod and also several 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 hooks 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.840
 carp spawning therefore catching it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 allowed only on paid 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.860
 specialized reservoirs bleak and have 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.630
 washing 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.490
 despite its small size 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 are very valuable fish 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.820
 also they are great in quality 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.250
 bait for catching predators they are introduced 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 as a rule in clean waters and feed 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.910
 in the upper layers 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.630
 nibble is usually very active especially 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.580
 early morning and late afternoon fishing like 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.060
 the rule passes with the help of float 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 fishing rods 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.940
 float carrying capacity up to 0 point 5 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.220
 gram worth remembering that u have sticky 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 the wash is very shy so the thickness 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.890
 Main line should not exceed 0 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.500
 as many as 10 and a meter in May usually 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.390
 swims in the middle layers of reservoirs better 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.030
 just for her catching suitable feeder 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.030
 tackle before you go out for this fish 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.340
 should think about the bait basis for 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.489
 which will serve undercooked wheat 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.170
 croup also to attract and out 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.780
 long distance should be added 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.380
 the odorous component sees you 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.090
 hotel and coconut chips for fishing 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.299
 chekhon you need a feeder rod 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.190
 with dough 40 80 grams and 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.380
 Spinning Wicker Coil 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.260
 fishing line section to 0 as many as 14 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.739
 millimeters and feeding trough weighing about 60 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.320
 grams leash take up to 0 whole 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.570
 12 millimeters and about two meters bin 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.130
 a small hook clings to it 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.110
 polyfoam and two or three maggots 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.510
 nibble on a good carmine area 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.370
 usually very active so pledge 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.450
 successful fishing will be the right choice 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.010
 places and properly selected bait 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.590
 Huster should look first on 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.790
 areas of the reservoir with a relief bottom 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.270
 rich in natural for this fish 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.370
 shelters with abundant water growth 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.150
 vegetation and spawning is 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.800
 fish leads a very active lifestyle 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:38.000
 better clarity catching busters at the end of may 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.490
 feeder dough 90 120 grams of booster 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.290
 known for her caution so in 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.110
 as the main fishing line is better to take 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.610
 braided thinner as bait 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.360
 oatmeal will fit 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.590
 mix with maggot or chopped worm 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.530
 the density of the bait is regulated in 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.420
 depending on the strength of the flow in order 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.020
 leave in place catching only large 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.540
 instances 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.480
 but the hook is placed on the moldy worm or large 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.070
 steamed peas summarize this 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.770
 a warm sunny day awaits us 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.350
 the weather is sometimes slight 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.560
 carp precipitation began spawning 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.720
 therefore, you can only catch it 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.820
 commercial specialized pond at 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 sticky wash catch on the float in 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.799
 As a nozzle we use maggots or 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.970
 Motylya case catch on feeder with 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.720
 pre-feed 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.090
 but we put the hook on 2 3 maggots 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.610
 I will keep places of the reservoir with relief 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.800
 bottom also catch on the feeder as 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.590
 nozzles use steamed peas or 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.780
 do not forget what you can not yet 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.440
 catch more than one bait and on 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.440
 one hook 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.150
 also remember the catch rates I wish 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.200
 you have a good time fishing and 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.200
 see you in a week
