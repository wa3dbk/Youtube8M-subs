 Thanks for their matches, Wood says this almost occurs 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.179
 forget No Dr many hours of work 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.880
 be 1 1 1 80 percent 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.069
 Oct Oct 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:33.069
 Med dismantle St 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.770
 apn to the right St he taps 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.230
 I'm always on the boards Franz is 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 St 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.680
 he says he means cheers 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 St Jab Carinthia 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.609
 1 1 Cham today flows 3 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.910
 there is a prof 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:17.130
 think exactly out further but so far there are also St truths on 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.260
 today while the equipment in training various tours under 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.120
 Suspense set the argument for this it usually pays someone 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.510
 but is it really or was there other ways a horse solid and 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.960
 swift apprentices I myself have the value of different instructors 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 Methods for me to try my progress and the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.910
 Differences were elemental now the question is whether it is also a training system 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.090
 The missed one is especially effective and here Buschi comes into play 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.140
 Weidenhausen II 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.330
 it is subsequently able to Lausanne equal with three horses dogs 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.680
 to end the mess 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.170
 where is actually better than a laptop I do not get trained 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.049
 think so it is 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049
 the project is project prizes 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.509
 the key of the cavalry after the bombardment of the 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.829
 Balance and keeping the resulting when off 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.209
 The rider must be able to control the weight of the money in the mold 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.930
 Four-legged friends to parties that drives the lesson we want 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.359
 can perform at all and the two big ones of this balance 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.729
 Distribution holds 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.889
 and reaching for the balloons, Buschi introduced a few basic rules 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.549
 pr-training on this principle of each exercise is initially slow 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.509
 to learn before the tempo has to be raised while it is going to be raffled 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.729
 stopped and restored the balance again 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.589
 To influence a horse in this form began to exist with the 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.610
 Mobilization of the money at hand 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.770
 Light through the sheer chest at the chest, pedaling forward and through 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.719
 Buy are pausing on the sample 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.899
 This prevented when working in front of the horse that drives at Positions 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:08.349
 Loss after the war smells you could correct that at any time 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.540
 At the end it goes up to 40 to hide the position 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 switch 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.290
 and sideways missing but hold 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 this is the moment where you can start to activate the hindquarters 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.629
 this is about equal treatment 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.629
 and has later been able to develop from it 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.409
 for inner and outer relaxation when driving with 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.199
 achieve announced infection 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.799
 This was by threatening 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.249
 that is missing in the musculature and in the jaw so far to solve that is not 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:00.599
 Negative voltage build up the resistances in the drive cause 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.949
 can 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:02.859
 by 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.609
 Giving in the side in the heating report chewing in the mouth by giving in the neck 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.790
 controls the muscle tension and looks where necessary tension 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.769
 can occur in this region and eliminates them through targeted exercises 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.769
 Here you can see some of them 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.449
 in the further film is missing because of fever after the system of Bushehr 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.240
 were trained and operating errors came to us in the pre-project after the system 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.539
 i wish him a fun look 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.270
 to the system of Busch i is still to say 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.039
 that he has often been recognized and condemned for lack of understanding and in 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.270
 In fact, it is not easy to read the system of the Buschi times just because 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.949
 Buschi engaged in another time to another was candidate can his 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.580
 You had to work typefaces rather than a structured one 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.969
 implemented educational system 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.810
 One should also make no secret of the fact that every translation of a font 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.889
 at the same time an interpretation is spoken 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.970
 the Buschi figuratively meant we can not ask him anymore but 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.379
 must be based on our experience and knowledge of modern medicine in the 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.440
 right path of riding education on the basics Campus Pacher himself 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.439
 to inscribe 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.509
 That's why we chose Buschi as the basis because his system is from today's 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.349
 From a medical point of view many principles undoubtedly include the goal 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.680
 to spread a fake healthy and to get close to it 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.080
 Of course, many principles apply to any AIDS teaching just as well 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.490
 many ways to the summit 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.400
 I describe casting work 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.419
 therefore i go the system of i happen as my own but 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.699
 Attempts to fathom what he actually with his statements and the 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.990
 Kerngemeinde has and is working on transferring its concept into the new age 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.400
 at the end the planned project will show if 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.380
 and under what conditions Bussche systems in use in the 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.369
 has existed today 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:15.809
 the results so far are very promising 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.950
 if I were to shoot down to a core thought should reduce 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.270
 I would say that the understanding of the rider reflects on it quickly 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.110
 According to his circumstances, his body weight is right on the four 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.149
 support the limbs and distribute this weight distribution to the 

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.819
 Is able to maintain movement 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.629
 that is the key of all riding is reduced only to it 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:18.259
 Do you want to know more about the buschehr project? 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:22.030
 Training and the path they do not shy away from us 

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.349
 put
