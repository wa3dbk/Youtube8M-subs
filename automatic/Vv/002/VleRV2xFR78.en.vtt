you guys think all right so the trailer

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.920 
you guys think all right so the trailer
itself<00:01:30.340> taken<00:01:30.880> objectively<00:01:31.360> actually<00:01:31.780> looked

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.010 
itself taken objectively actually looked
pretty<00:01:31.990> cool<00:01:32.350> i<00:01:32.380> think<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:34.300> overall<00:01:34.750> press

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
pretty cool i think the overall press

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.100 
pretty cool i think the overall press
conference<00:01:35.500> was<00:01:35.770> kind<00:01:36.009> of<00:01:36.040> boring<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.750> I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
conference was kind of boring and so I

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.870 
conference was kind of boring and so I
wasn't<00:01:38.440> in<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.740> very<00:01:38.920> good<00:01:39.070> mood<00:01:39.130> going<00:01:39.610> into

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
wasn't in a very good mood going into

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.700 
wasn't in a very good mood going into
the<00:01:40.000> trailer<00:01:40.210> mm-hmm<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.380> kind<00:01:41.500> of

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
the trailer mm-hmm and so that kind of

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.440 
the trailer mm-hmm and so that kind of
has<00:01:41.890> me<00:01:42.159> down<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.759> trailer<00:01:43.060> what<00:01:43.240> more

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
has me down on the trailer what more

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.880 
has me down on the trailer what more
than<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.630> think<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:43.899> should<00:01:43.960> because<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.649> looks

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
