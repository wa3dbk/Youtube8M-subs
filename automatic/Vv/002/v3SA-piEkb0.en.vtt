00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 hello and welcome to reuters bound 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.109
 dot com 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.930
 what happens when we have in light room a 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.830
 catalog and we want to divide it into two or 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.809
 upside down 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.660
 what happens if we have two catalogs and 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.040
 we want to merge what in not only this what 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.169
 let's discover in this third 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.169
 ivm tutorial we go there 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.530
 here we have our interface 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.450
 lightroom as you see are the photos of 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.030
 the participants in the radio development 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.630
 that until now have been to line 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.010
 manjarrez víctor rodríguez fernández and 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.010
 to the former world that will be next 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.630
 There may be many occasions where 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.870
 We want from the same catalog 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.809
 lightroom take out another or export a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.300
 full catalog to another device by 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.309
 example if we're going on a trip and we're going 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.800
 with laptop the most logical thing is that 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.800
 come back if we want to manipulate it in another 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.540
 computer for example desktop 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.970
 let's export the catalog from the laptop 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.430
 to the desktop taking all the photos 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.009
 and the adjustments we have already made in the 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.470
 case of wanting some photos 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.750
 of a catalog export it to another site 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.729
 can be useful if for example we are 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.350
 with a client or with a friend and only 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.710
 we want to show you a part of our 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.320
 catalog but how this is done is very 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.979
 easy let's suppose we just want 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.480
 Export the selected photo 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.550
 let's select this photo 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.910
 If we want to create a catalog with these 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.120
 four photographs and splicing 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.420
 files and we will put and click on 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.340
 export as catalog 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.130
 in the box that appears to us we will have 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.409
 to choose first a name we are going to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.409
 put test catalog 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.850
 and second they do not have three options 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.230
 leaving aside in the options 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.770
 typical of looking for a folder where 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.680
 save the test on the desktop as 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.530
 we see there are three options 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.840
 the first would be to export only the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.719
 Selected photographs in this case 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.390
 I have selected 5 I do not know if before 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:25.450
 they have 4 good but in 4 here they look 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.170
 clearly they are 5 and here lightroom 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.139
 warn us 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.450
 exporting a catalog with 5 photographs 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:33.010
 if we left this option unchecked we 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.780
 would export all the photographs that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.609
 have in our database or in 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.889
 the catalog of the year then we have 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.319
 export negative files this is 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.150
 very important especially if we 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.970
 move the catalog of a device 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 to another means that he is going to catch us 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.549
 the associated photograph remember that the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 Lightroom catalog works as an envelope 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.140
 a virtual copy of the photograph 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.990
 Well this what he does is take the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.150
 original photograph of the negative and what 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.810
 move in a folder next to 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.090
 catalog now we will see it show 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.210
 it is very important is I repeat if we are going to 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.030
 change device 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.800
 have this option marked inside 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.990
 device is not so critical because 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.510
 we can look for the photograph and the last 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.950
 option is to include previews 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.750
 available without more 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.510
 I have the options I want 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.209
 selected and I put export catalog 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.030
 I have selected little photography so that 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.680
 go fast but do not be alarmed if you 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.200
 they do with a very large catalog because 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.620
 it can last a long time if we now go 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.790
 to our test catalog folder 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 Although we have created in the catalog 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.560
 we will see the lightroom's own catalog 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.069
 itself and this folder where with the 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.409
 revealed road includes 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.180
 and all the files associated with these 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.120
 Photographs 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.420
 we have the files of the negative 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.420
 digital 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.819
 and the jpg that could have there 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.770
 lost in that catalog in this way 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.260
 we have got a single catalog 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.060
 take a part 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.700
 but in the original catalog will follow 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.990
 being not erased when exporting it as 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.480
 a catalog 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.580
 now we go with the second part as 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.770
 we put this new catalog or a 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.770
 catalog that we already have created in another 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.320
 a catalog with six photos we are going to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.849
 import the catalog that interests us 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.310
 we go to the file menu 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:40.350
 and now we click where it says 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.350
 import from another catalog 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.190
 a search engine will open and we have to 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.940
 find the catalog that interests us 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.940
 to import 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.360
 this I had kept it under the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:59.629
 catalog folder test 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.629
 and here we have simply choose it 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.030
 and lightroom ask us inside this 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.849
 catalog that we want to import into my 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.219
 case will be everything 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.889
 an important option is that we 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:18.009
 question file management 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.960
 it gives us the options are to add new 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.150
 photographs to the catalog without moving it 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.930
 or copy the new photographs to a 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.710
 new location and import 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.940
 and the last does not matter new photography 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.150
 normally we are interested in one of the two 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.480
 first 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.060
 if we have the photograph in a site of 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.830
 computer where we do not want to move it 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.290
 we will choose to add new photographs to 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.050
 catalog without moving it if for example 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.030
 we are using a pendrive as 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.950
 has an external disk to move 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.130
 from a laptop to a 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.849
 after dinner and at the moment of exporting the 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.219
 Photography 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.740
 I put it in a folder as I already 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:06:01.559
 we saw a few minutes ago we will choose 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 Copy the new photograph to a new one 

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:07.199
 location and just import us 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.569
 an option will come out and we will choose inside 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.689
 of the computer where or in what folder 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:15.059
 we were we want to import the 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:16.949
 I for comfort I am simply going to 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:19.580
 add new photographs to the catalog 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.580
 without moving it 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.949
 as we see finally we had the 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:32.099
 complete catalog 1 our catalog 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.560
 main and which we have imported and 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.060
 the most important and the most useful thing is that 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.060
 if we have done well marking the 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.949
 options that we want lightroom us 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.229
 they will keep all the adjustments that 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:45.030
 we have done in the other catalog I hope 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.530
 have expressed myself well because you are 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.659
 catalogs ideas are usually a 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.789
 little complicated if they have any 

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:52.259
 doubt you already know that you can write to us 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:55.169
 ace 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.690
 road to the bone puntocom I wait for your 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:07:00.720
 questions and if not soon 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.180
 we'll have more tutorials I'm tomás what 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.250
 that strauss or romeo and this is road to 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.250
 the bone dotcom we are
