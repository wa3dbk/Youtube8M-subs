00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.640 
opinions after I've been using it for
quite<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> while<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.330> obviously<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> didn't<00:00:19.470> have

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
quite a while I obviously I didn't have

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
quite a while I obviously I didn't have
this<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> iphone<00:00:20.279> 5<00:00:20.580> came<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:21.029> I've<00:00:21.300> i

this when the iphone 5 came out I've i

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
this when the iphone 5 came out I've i
bought<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.680> off<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> finest<00:00:23.490> came

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
bought this just off of the finest came

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
bought this just off of the finest came
out<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> got<00:00:24.060> very<00:00:24.210> good<00:00:24.300> deal<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.260> I

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
out and got very good deal on it but I

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
out and got very good deal on it but I
throughout<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:25.980> time<00:00:26.039> I've<00:00:26.460> sort<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.760> really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
throughout that time I've sort of really

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
throughout that time I've sort of really
used<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.449> lot<00:00:27.660> obviously<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.109> my<00:00:28.199> daily<00:00:28.410> phone

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
used a lot obviously as my daily phone

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
used a lot obviously as my daily phone
so<00:00:29.189> I've<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> good<00:00:29.550> idea<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.179> i

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so I've got a good idea of what i

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.120 
so I've got a good idea of what i
believe<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> good<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.099> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
believe is good about it and what I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.250 
believe is good about it and what I
think<00:00:32.340> Apple<00:00:32.940> should<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.270> obviously<00:00:34.050> made<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
think Apple should have obviously made a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.080 
think Apple should have obviously made a
bit<00:00:34.410> better<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:35.760> need<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.969> make

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
bit better and what they need to make

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
bit better and what they need to make
better<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.960> released<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> iphone<00:00:37.500> 6

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
better when they released the iphone 6

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.280 
better when they released the iphone 6
i'm<00:00:38.430> typically<00:00:39.090> i<00:00:39.329> don't<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.870> every

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
i'm typically i don't go for every

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.840 
i'm typically i don't go for every
single<00:00:40.530> generation<00:00:40.950> iphone<00:00:41.460> i<00:00:41.610> had<00:00:41.760> just

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
single generation iphone i had just

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
single generation iphone i had just
finally<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.600> mythical<00:00:43.050> changes<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.649> enough

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
finally the mythical changes on enough

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.700 
finally the mythical changes on enough
away<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:45.149> went<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> 4<00:00:45.809> s<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> 5<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
away i went from a 4 s to the 5 and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
away i went from a 4 s to the 5 and
there's<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.789> lot<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> changes<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
there's not really a lot of changes I

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
there's not really a lot of changes I
didn't<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> 5s<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.219> said

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
didn't get the 5s because as I said

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
didn't get the 5s because as I said
there's<00:00:50.640> minuscule<00:00:51.030> changes<00:00:51.449> probably

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
there's minuscule changes probably

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
there's minuscule changes probably
hopefully<00:00:52.649> will<00:00:53.039> be<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> oven<00:00:53.640> six<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
hopefully will be in the oven six at it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.389 
hopefully will be in the oven six at it
obviously<00:00:55.110> does<00:00:55.440> depend<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.039> they've<00:00:56.190> made

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
obviously does depend on if they've made

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
obviously does depend on if they've made
enough<00:00:56.640> changes<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.239> how<00:00:58.020> much<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.500> if

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
enough changes and how much it is and if

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.470 
enough changes and how much it is and if
I<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> decent<00:00:59.219> price<00:00:59.460> by<00:00:59.670> five<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I can get a decent price by five so I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.060 
I can get a decent price by five so I
can<00:01:00.660> sort<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.870> make<00:01:00.930> enough<00:01:01.320> money<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.920> buy

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
can sort of make enough money up to buy

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
can sort of make enough money up to buy
the<00:01:02.129> oven<00:01:02.460> 65<00:01:03.090> ever<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.930> head<00:01:04.170> straight

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the oven 65 ever do this head straight

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.810 
the oven 65 ever do this head straight
into<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.680> video<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.280> I'm<00:01:05.339> still<00:01:05.580> gonna<00:01:05.729> be

into this video so I'm still gonna be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.820 
into this video so I'm still gonna be
splitting<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.869> into<00:01:07.049> sections<00:01:07.439> I've

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
splitting up this up into sections I've

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
splitting up this up into sections I've
got<00:01:08.130> five<00:01:08.640> different<00:01:09.119> sections<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.780> sort<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
obviously improved when the Apple is

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.610 
obviously improved when the Apple is
their<00:02:51.549> next<00:02:51.700> phone<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:52.660> oven<00:02:52.930> 5s<00:02:53.379> has

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
their next phone because the oven 5s has

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.470 
their next phone because the oven 5s has
the<00:02:53.890> same<00:02:54.129> camera<00:02:54.519> it's<00:02:54.700> ever<00:02:55.000> so<00:02:55.060> slightly

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the same camera it's ever so slightly

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.630 
the same camera it's ever so slightly
improved<00:02:55.930> however<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.709> gets<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> job<00:02:57.069> done<00:02:57.250> it

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
improved however it gets the job done it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
improved however it gets the job done it
takes<00:02:57.849> some<00:02:58.000> okay<00:02:58.390> snaps<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:58.989> if<00:02:59.319> you're<00:02:59.500> a

just got whilst i was filming you can
see<00:03:18.849> they're<00:03:19.000> okay<00:03:19.359> and<00:03:19.569> I'll<00:03:20.200> see<00:03:20.349> it<00:03:20.440> does

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
see they're okay and I'll see it does

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.289 
see they're okay and I'll see it does
compress<00:03:20.950> them<00:03:21.099> down<00:03:21.340> when<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.790> swapped<00:03:22.120> him

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
compress them down when I swapped him

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.120 
compress them down when I swapped him
across<00:03:22.480> my<00:03:22.690> computer<00:03:23.139> well<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.799> is<00:03:23.829> just

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
across my computer well this is just

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.470 
across my computer well this is just
basically<00:03:24.639> talked<00:03:24.819> about<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.090> camera<00:03:25.419> I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
basically talked about the camera I

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.240 
basically talked about the camera I
think<00:03:25.690> it's<00:03:25.810> okay<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.739> definitely<00:03:26.919> has

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
think it's okay but it definitely has

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.949 
think it's okay but it definitely has
got<00:03:27.430> room<00:03:27.639> for<00:03:27.849> improvement<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.419> definitely

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
got room for improvement and definitely

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.059 
got room for improvement and definitely
Apple<00:03:29.230> could<00:03:29.349> do<00:03:29.500> something<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.799> make<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.040> a

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
Apple could do something to make it a

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.009 
Apple could do something to make it a
bit<00:03:30.220> better<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:31.329> next<00:03:31.510> hole<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.780> talk<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.959> you

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
bit better so next hole and talk to you

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.390 
bit better so next hole and talk to you
about<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.290> performance<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.950> how<00:03:33.069> it<00:03:33.190> shaped

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
about the performance and how it shaped

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.759 
about the performance and how it shaped

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
that I could stick with iowa / iphones

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.080 
that I could stick with iowa / iphones
and<00:05:36.780> iOS<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.500> because<00:05:37.830> it's<00:05:38.250> just<00:05:38.310> a<00:05:38.520> very<00:05:38.790> nice

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
and iOS is because it's just a very nice

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.760 
and iOS is because it's just a very nice
operating<00:05:39.720> system<00:05:39.750> especially<00:05:40.260> when<00:05:40.650> you

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
operating system especially when you

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.680 
operating system especially when you
jailbreak<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.460> in<00:05:41.610> my<00:05:42.000> opinion<00:05:42.240> it<00:05:42.510> works

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
jailbreak it in my opinion it works

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.180 
jailbreak it in my opinion it works
better<00:05:42.960> than<00:05:43.110> jailbroken<00:05:43.560> as<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.890> can<00:05:44.010> just

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
better than jailbroken as you can just

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.040 
better than jailbroken as you can just
tweak<00:05:44.340> it<00:05:44.550> how<00:05:44.820> you<00:05:44.880> like<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.180> but<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.900> just

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
tweak it how you like it but it just

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.540 
tweak it how you like it but it just
works<00:05:46.230> very<00:05:46.470> well<00:05:46.530> for<00:05:46.650> example<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:47.220> music

thing<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.210> would<00:06:15.270> say<00:06:15.390> is<00:06:15.570> battery<00:06:16.170> life

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
thing I would say is battery life

battery<00:06:16.920> life<00:06:17.040> could<00:06:17.250> definitely<00:06:17.490> be

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
battery life could definitely be

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.280 
battery life could definitely be
improved<00:06:18.030> but<00:06:18.420> considering<00:06:18.900> it's<00:06:19.020> only<00:06:19.260> a

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
improved but considering it's only a
