00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 HallÃ¶chen and a warm welcome 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
 back to the -zins 2 and the 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.200
 probably last episode of this 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.110
 great let's play so now wondering 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 determined some wait what aprilschool 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.570
 haha shit on april is is a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 fucking april joke I'm really 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.220
 pissed right now and maybe 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.560
 maybe some know 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.539
 of you actually out of it and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 have a clue of two so much 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 I know that you are saving my family 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.830
 can 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 following scenario that happens to me 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
 The family had it all down here 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 individually in this household have great 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.649
 they put together up here in one 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.750
 this shit where the good sultan 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.180
 thus lived was when my four sims 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.829
 plus sultan reunited and then 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 I really wanted the neighborhood 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.390
 change and I really wanted to loud 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 your comments after strange homes 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 pull there because I was never and yes 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 then I'm even more for you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 gone live the problem is but 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.160
 here at this point that one interest 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.539
 apparently not from one 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 neighborhood to the next 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.280
 can let in the sims 2 anyway 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.810
 not so easy because in this family 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.090
 Ton here in strange homes are the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.590
 just in style just for this neighborhood 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.180
 here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.159
 were chosen and not the me 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.439
 somehow also speak here is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.810
 No interest in it I somehow 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.479
 I've created or somehow I'm in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.729
 a ton in bella donna bay 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.810
 they are simply not available here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.790
 accordingly, I'm in the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 made internet smart and have read 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.479
 that you just then quite 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.340
 You can do it simply by doing that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.810
 complete plot simply in one 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.350
 new neighborhood shifts for that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.570
 going 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.270
 Funnily, ironically, that works 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.860
 of course one speaks here looking for oneself 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.329
 a house expresses here in the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 Put the catalog then put it in the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.990
 catalog and then placed it over there 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.189
 in the other world and accordingly 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.840
 stand you should just get the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.770
 family then accordingly in one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.899
 let the house go 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 take the house along with the family 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.479
 and then just go to the new world and 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.159
 I did that and while I did that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.780
 house has placed there is mainz ins 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.560
 game completely frozen and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.060
 crashed that means it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.800
 just made nothing that has it 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.300
 loaded and load-learned and after 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.890
 it is then ten minutes 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.569
 really just completely packaged 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.880
 So in the task manager it was synonymous 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.380
 inactive and then I closed it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.230
 and I thought okay can actually 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.300
 nothing has happened because I would not be 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 saved or so should yes 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.209
 do nothing and like you 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.160
 So look here in this constellation 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.610
 I returned to the game again 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.080
 no family singer here no family 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.519
 Singer in this house I have 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.019
 By the way, now extra then again 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.950
 So I placed it here like that 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.350
 said in the ton 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 there was also that whales so 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.480
 or the singers in there 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.040
 live 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.650
 that's why I came back here 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.840
 placed and barely has placed 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.709
 already the whole building was easy 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.590
 empty 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.840
 so now I do not know where mine 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.880
 family is there is somehow 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.099
 not more 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.440
 so i have on the on the 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.319
 college looked there's no 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.940
 chance more in the student house i 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.440
 i've looked in underneath maria i got in 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.540
 Blue since I stop looking I have 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.220
 I stared in strange home 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.269
 Everywhere looked after and the shit of 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.180
 I do not exist anymore 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.920
 I'm straight I 've got it neck 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.470
 because now the fuck is first april 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.989
 unlikely but only a chat 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.690
 that's no joke that's so shit 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.910
 without joke we have 30 40 follow on the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.560
 stupid university spent and now 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.530
 I come here and am happy again 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.510
 normal life start to run 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.709
 and now this team does not exist 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.670
 more and I do not know why that is 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.019
 no idea maybe the ones are in the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.790
 nirvana disappeared is called the game 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.510
 but it can crash 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.310
 Not be 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.530
 that can not be serious now 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.239
 be that these are easy now 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.980
 completely change though I'm not anymore 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.880
 saved but or something made 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.130
 I'm so sorry for me 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.690
 just upset it just upset me 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.970
 that I spend so much time with it now 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.920
 I have spent the game and now it is 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.480
 Everything just over because that's stupid 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.450
 game crashed in between 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.239
 is frozen 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.769
 no idea I would have known that 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.180
 I would not be able to move like that 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.769
 probably never suggested though 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.470
 I thought hey man location change 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.359
 It would be nice but that 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.049
 that is so next that somehow move 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.100
 allow 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.410
 no idea so yes I hope that 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.550
 one of you comes up with an idea how to 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.460
 that can save 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.500
 I have to be honest 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.970
 no one as i said i play sims 2 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.979
 just not long enough for that 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.919
 knowledge 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:40.169
 and yes the sims now after create that 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:45.120
 would be just an idea but quite honest 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.900
 So I know that I have no idea that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.940
 is totally stupid sorry but is really like that 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.040
 and I could be really in the ray right now 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.450
 short really so I say something like that 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.889
 Not often, and I'm not often 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.150
 somehow pissed on mega but 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.050
 just the moment is just reached 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:04.020
 where I'm so mad, really mad 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.940
 Maybe yes they are not only 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.919
 somehow saved here or something 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.050
 So also I no longer believe so 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.130
 wait a minute maybe present in the 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.570
 right, they are here again 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.340
 even there they are not in there I want 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.190
 in this zone they are in it 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.110
 no idea yes I have no plan 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.510
 if you have the idea how to do that 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.139
 repairing it would be great if 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.180
 not yes no idea there I have that 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.840
 now in two let's play here for the first time 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.720
 Really quit because I will now 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.039
 certainly not the whole again 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.360
 given to play so that is 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.950
 me too stupid I have to 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.470
 honestly say again to college 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.300
 to go and then again and again 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.590
 to create the whole people fall 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.450
 They do not look like them then 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.450
 actually originally looked 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.490
 no idea so I'm really kind of 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.650
 more and more the feeling that this whole 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.570
 last play somehow to fail 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.790
 So, in fact, if I am doomed 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 Think about it with the family singer 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.750
 At the beginning that they died yes 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.250
 still somehow okay but that's it 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.940
 storytelling times interesting though 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:14.870
 now that they are completely gone 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.729
 I just think do not understand it real 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.930
 not and i think it shit and me 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.100
 think it's really shit and I 'm 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.229
 pissed off properly 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.150
 and that's no april fooling us yet 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:30.290
 talk to make clear what I 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:31.729
 I do not know what I do not think so 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.320
 do not know how to do it now 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.479
 I want to continue doing two now 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.210
 if I should stop now completely 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:39.560
 I have no plan because I can 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.630
 understand if some want it 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.330
 but goes on honestly after that 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.740
 debacle here I'm really just with 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.669
 two at war foot and a little bit 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.340
 think so nee you can me yes 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.960
 no idea so I'm waiting for yours 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.270
 comments may then stand 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.280
 helpful tip maybe he is 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.139
 They still have to be somewhere 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.729
 that it's what makes me so exist 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.289
 irritated because they can not 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.330
 Just go for a run 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.220
 completely that is actually possible 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.450
 not somewhere they have to do any 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.010
 file maybe the one again 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.849
 I can or can produce 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.740
 I have no plan 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:20.759
 in any case yes 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:23.699
 I wish you no idea 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:27.030
 I do not know no idea I am 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:28.800
 really just just frustrated 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.150
 that this is not working here 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.039
 All because I was really happy 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.870
 to be able to play normally again house 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.910
