the last bit of time finishing up these
battery<00:00:13.200> boxes<00:00:13.700> or<00:00:14.700> covers<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.299> told<00:00:15.599> you

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
battery boxes or covers that I told you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.970 
battery boxes or covers that I told you
guys<00:00:15.809> about<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.710> just

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
guys about so basically I just

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.120 
guys about so basically I just
constructed<00:00:17.730> some<00:00:17.910> styrene<00:00:18.330> enclosures

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
constructed some styrene enclosures

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.480 
constructed some styrene enclosures
painted<00:00:20.130> them<00:00:20.250> black<00:00:20.960> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.310> covered<00:00:23.310> them

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
painted them black and then covered them

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.849 
painted them black and then covered them
in<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:25.160> vinyl<00:00:26.160> carbon<00:00:26.760> fiber<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:28.590> heart's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
in some vinyl carbon fiber so my heart's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
in some vinyl carbon fiber so my heart's
excited<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> custom<00:00:29.880> build<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.269> him<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
excited it was a custom build for him so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.650 
excited it was a custom build for him so
that's<00:00:31.410> hence<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.250> pink<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> black<00:00:32.910> theme<00:00:33.270> so

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that's hence the pink and black theme so

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
that's hence the pink and black theme so
he's<00:00:33.870> excited<00:00:34.079> let<00:00:34.559> me<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.770> him<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
he's excited let me get him out of the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.770 
he's excited let me get him out of the
way<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.700> show<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.630> guys<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.469> car<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> if

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
way so I can show you guys the car so if

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.970 
way so I can show you guys the car so if
you<00:00:39.960> watch<00:00:40.140> any<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> my<00:00:40.440> other<00:00:40.649> videos<00:00:40.710> you

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you watch any of my other videos you

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310 
you watch any of my other videos you
have<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.370> idea<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> expect<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
have an idea of what to expect but the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
have an idea of what to expect but the
biggest<00:00:43.530> part<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.280> build<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:45.090> just

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
biggest part of this build was just

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.100 
biggest part of this build was just
making<00:00:46.379> sure<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.100> super<00:00:47.280> tidy<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
making sure that it was super tidy and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.760 
making sure that it was super tidy and
everything<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.350> enclosed<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.930> stock

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
everything was enclosed in the stock

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.150 
everything was enclosed in the stock
battery<00:00:53.280> tray<00:00:53.879> location<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.910> behind<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:58.160> you

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
battery tray location so behind here you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.439 
battery tray location so behind here you
guys<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> enclosures

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
guys can see that one of the enclosures

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.450 
guys can see that one of the enclosures
on<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.870> under<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> enclosure<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> ESC

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
on so under that enclosure is the ESC

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.020 
on so under that enclosure is the ESC
and<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.960> receiver<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.799> all<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> wires<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and the receiver and all the wires and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
and the receiver and all the wires and
then<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> battery<00:01:09.900> pack<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.380> slides<00:01:10.650> in

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
then the battery pack just slides in

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.999 
then the battery pack just slides in
there<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.500> let<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.920> button<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
there so let me just button this up and

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
there so let me just button this up and
uh<00:01:17.009> I'll<00:01:17.729> power<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.900> stuff

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
uh I'll power it up and all that stuff

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
uh I'll power it up and all that stuff
so<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.439> bear<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.100> me<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.400> you'll<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.790> what

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so just bear with me and you'll see what

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.700 
so just bear with me and you'll see what
it<00:01:21.000> looks<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:22.140> everything's<00:01:22.500> powered

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it looks like when everything's powered

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:35.530 
it looks like when everything's powered
up<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.540> hidden<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.900> sight

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.570 

so<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.630> see<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.740> completely<00:01:38.160> enclosed

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
so you see it's all completely enclosed

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.670 
so you see it's all completely enclosed
you<00:01:38.880> see<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.300> minimal<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.050> anything<00:01:40.500> else

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you see very minimal of anything else

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.410 
you see very minimal of anything else
that's<00:01:40.890> under<00:01:41.160> there<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> goal<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
that's under there which was the goal to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's under there which was the goal to
make<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.810> look<00:01:43.280> sort<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.430> semi<00:01:44.850> scale<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
make it look sort of semi scale when the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
make it look sort of semi scale when the
body<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.030> minimize

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
body is on and all that and to minimize

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.140 
body is on and all that and to minimize
the<00:01:48.960> amount<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.160> electronics<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
the amount of you know electronics that

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.080 
the amount of you know electronics that
you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.330> see<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.750> stuff<00:01:51.900> like<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.090> there

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you can see and stuff like that so there

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.590 
you can see and stuff like that so there
it<00:01:54.210> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.120 
it is
I<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.050> switch<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.380> front<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.830> for<00:01:56.010> easy

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
I put the switch up front here for easy

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.480 
I put the switch up front here for easy
access<00:01:56.400> let<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:56.910> power<00:01:57.119> my<00:01:57.540> radio<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> then

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
access let me power my radio on and then

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
access let me power my radio on and then
I'll<00:01:59.580> power<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.030> car<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.200> very<00:02:04.350> quiet

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I'll power the car on so it's very quiet

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
I'll power the car on so it's very quiet
um<00:02:05.720> but<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:07.020> Reventon<00:02:07.800> s<00:02:07.950> esc<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.060> doesn't

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
um but the Reventon s esc it doesn't

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.270 
um but the Reventon s esc it doesn't
make<00:02:09.540> any<00:02:09.660> trip<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.050> anything<00:02:10.080> like<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.530> but

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
make any trip or anything like that but

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.320 
make any trip or anything like that but
it<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> good<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.940> go

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
it is good to go

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.960 
it is good to go
I<00:02:12.950> did<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.130> programming<00:02:14.280> with<00:02:14.700> via<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I did some programming with via the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.780 
I did some programming with via the
programming<00:02:15.510> blocks<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:17.070> sort<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.400> set<00:02:17.550> light

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
programming blocks to sort of set light

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.690

bulbs and all that but everything is

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
bulbs and all that but everything is
good<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.030> go

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
effect that that creates on this car the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.720 
effect that that creates on this car the
wheels<00:02:38.760> were<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> nice<00:02:39.420> touch<00:02:39.890> which<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.550> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
wheels were a nice touch which was you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.340 
wheels were a nice touch which was you
know<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> color<00:02:42.300> scheme<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.690> chose<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.319> I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
know like the color scheme I chose and I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.800 
know like the color scheme I chose and I
just<00:02:44.340> looked<00:02:44.520> really<00:02:44.640> cool<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.330> way<00:02:45.360> it's<00:02:45.600> set

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
just looked really cool the way it's set

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.190 
just looked really cool the way it's set
up<00:02:45.840> right<00:02:46.140> now<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:46.610> let<00:02:47.610> me<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.900> throw<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
up right now so let me just throw the

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.780 
up right now so let me just throw the
body<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.590> real<00:02:49.770> quick<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> get<00:02:50.280> an<00:02:50.400> idea<00:02:50.730> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
body on real quick you get an idea of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.990 
body on real quick you get an idea of
what<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.090> looks<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.420> all<00:02:51.630> put<00:02:51.840> together<00:02:51.959> so

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
what it looks like all put together so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.190 
what it looks like all put together so
there's<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> look<00:02:54.240> at<00:02:54.330> what<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> body<00:02:54.750> put<00:02:55.050> on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
there's a look at what the body put on

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.830 
there's a look at what the body put on
and<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.800> that<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.700> see<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.570> seats

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and all that as you can see the seats

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
and all that as you can see the seats
are<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.170> there<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:58.890> semi<00:02:59.130> roll

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
are in there you can see the semi roll

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.580 
are in there you can see the semi roll
cage<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.630> see<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.810> lot<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.020> wires<00:03:01.319> or

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
cage you don't see a lot of wires or

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.040 
cage you don't see a lot of wires or
anything<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.330> same<00:03:03.330> with<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.810> this

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
anything like that same with it on this

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.740 
anything like that same with it on this
side<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.670> only<00:03:05.730> thing<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.209> see<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.570> is

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
side the only thing that you see that is

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.110 
side the only thing that you see that is
electronics<00:03:07.620> is<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:09.030> servo<00:03:10.880> but<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:11.970> don't

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
electronics is the servo but you don't

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.729 
electronics is the servo but you don't
see<00:03:12.269> any<00:03:12.390> wires<00:03:12.600> or<00:03:12.810> anything<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.110> which<00:03:13.530> is

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
see any wires or anything that which is

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.430 
see any wires or anything that which is
pretty<00:03:13.920> cool

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
pretty cool

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:36.210 
pretty cool
so<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.709> is

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.460
