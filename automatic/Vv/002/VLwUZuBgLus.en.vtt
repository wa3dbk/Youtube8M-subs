00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.320
 to draw a started tyrannosaur 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.759
 by making a circle for the head makes a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 second circle of the same size 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.080
 slightly lower makes a third 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.580
 circles four times bigger glued to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.140
 second to make the basin the top of the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.990
 body is smaller than the bottom of his 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.230
 body makes a rectangle to make the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 above his mouth makes a rectangle 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 to make the top of his jaw then 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 does three very for the bottom of his 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.969
 jaw connect the greenhouses to make the 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.969
 blow and body like this 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.329
 draw the hind leg of the dinosaur 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.329
 respecting the sense of the joints 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.219
 then made his feet that possesses three 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:12.219
 big fingers each 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 then queued the tyrannosaurus to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.940
 this level then makes his arms that are 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:47.940
 very small proportionally to his 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:49.320
 body her brow bone feels 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.229
 slightly upward as for a 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.970
 crocodile makes the joints that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.619
 connects the two parts of his jaw the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.550
 t-rex at a very great match marc who 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550
 goes back far back 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.590
 then I take a pencil with a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.360
 more line thanks to him six berries for 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 finalize contours and contrasts 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.840
 for the feet of the t-rex think well 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.090
 bring out the claws like those 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.879
 here there is a relief on the skin around 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.370
 claws the t-rex and a jaw 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.239
 very square jaw road is no longer 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.239
 big than the bottom part 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.360
 the t-rex has only two claws on its 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:10.360
 two arms his two arms are very 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:24.730
 close to his body makes his nostrils 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 here his left wing then yielding to 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.150
 the back of his jaw behind the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.830
 last in is the muscles of 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.660
 the jaw that is apparent when 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:38.220
 open all there is more to do 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.220
 shades and finishes 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 1 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 1 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.560
 here I erase the teeth on the part 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.080
 back of his jaw 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.980
 because the t-rex is not there at this level 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.980
 t-rex is over
