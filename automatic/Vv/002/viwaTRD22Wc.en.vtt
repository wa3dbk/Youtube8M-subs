00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.620 

pick<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:54.280> example<00:03:54.850> let<00:03:55.030> me<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.390> one

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
pick it so for example let me get one

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.720 
pick it so for example let me get one
that<00:03:56.020> does<00:03:56.920> really<00:03:57.160> have<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.430> lot<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.730> volume

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
that does really have a lot of volume

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.330 
that does really have a lot of volume
so<00:04:01.140> let's<00:04:02.140> see<00:04:02.290> this<00:04:02.740> one<00:04:02.980> doesn't<00:04:03.100> really

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
so let's see this one doesn't really

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.890 
so let's see this one doesn't really
have<00:04:03.490> a<00:04:03.550> lot<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.820> volume<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:06.600> what<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.690> don't
