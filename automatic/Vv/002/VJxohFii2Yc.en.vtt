was<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.800> Monday<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.430> also<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.850> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
was kind of Monday and also in one

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
was kind of Monday and also in one
warfare<00:00:42.510> 3<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> map<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
warfare 3 there was the map which is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.350 
warfare 3 there was the map which is
also<00:00:44.040> Monday<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.550> maybe<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.059> something

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
also Monday so maybe it's just something

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910 
also Monday so maybe it's just something
to<00:00:45.450> go<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.660> theme<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.170> still<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:46.770> not

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
to go with that theme I still I'm not

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.200 
to go with that theme I still I'm not
really<00:00:47.039> sure<00:00:47.129> why<00:00:47.430> Denis<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.789> say<00:00:47.910> there<00:00:48.120> was

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
really sure why Denis just say there was

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
really sure why Denis just say there was
going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> nuke<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.649> he

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
going to be a nuke and it really is he

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to be a nuke and it really is he
actually<00:00:50.010> talking<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.430> multiplayer<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
actually talking about multiplayer you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.610 
actually talking about multiplayer you
might<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.809> talking<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.289> single

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
might actually just be talking a single

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
might actually just be talking a single
player<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:52.949> there's<00:00:53.129> definitely<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.610> lot<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
player but there's definitely a lot of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
player but there's definitely a lot of
speculation<00:00:54.449> surrounding<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.140> there

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
speculation surrounding this and there

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
speculation surrounding this and there
was<00:00:55.379> something<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.460> kind

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
was something you know will it be kind

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.889 
was something you know will it be kind
of<00:00:56.789> stackable<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> modern

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of stackable like it was a modern

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
of stackable like it was a modern
warfare<00:00:58.050> 2<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:58.770> gun<00:00:59.129> kills

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
warfare 2 or will it be all gun kills

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
warfare 2 or will it be all gun kills
like<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.760> wasn't<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.120> more<00:01:00.270> fair<00:01:00.420> 3<00:01:00.750> because

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like it wasn't one more fair 3 because

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.510 
like it wasn't one more fair 3 because
basically<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.250> swaying

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
basically I really would be swaying

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
basically I really would be swaying

of new kill streak and it's in the
future<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> feel<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
future do you think it's going to feel a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.859

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
warfare series as opposed to kind of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950 
warfare series as opposed to kind of
like<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.579> sequel<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> black<00:01:45.450> ops<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:45.869> be
