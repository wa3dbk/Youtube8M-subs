leave like just a G sharp and F sharp so
it's<00:02:25.630> going<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.900> sound<00:02:26.019> like

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:52.280 

they<00:02:40.989> just<00:02:41.260> play<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.620> till<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.310> course

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.400 

and<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.770> course<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:56.040> me<00:02:57.750> but<00:02:58.750> yeah<00:02:59.230> it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
and the course is just me but yeah it's

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.170 
and the course is just me but yeah it's
it's<00:02:59.860> really<00:03:00.040> simple<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.490> still<00:03:00.700> faster<00:03:01.090> on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
it's really simple it's still faster on

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's really simple it's still faster on
Lego<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:10.000> go<00:03:10.150> back<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.450> course<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:11.050> mean<00:03:11.770> first

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:42.860 

and<00:03:29.730> then<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.450> solo<00:03:30.689> sounds<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.110> guess<00:03:41.870> so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
and then the solo sounds I guess so

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.539 
and then the solo sounds I guess so
