00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.120
 hi to all bad video today 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.460
 of failures 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.370
 this time alone not close promoted 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.719
 because usually few are rejected 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.839
 there are many more promoted 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.490
 since this time I have several of them 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.840
 rejected products wanted to make a video 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.510
 only for them then it started immediately with 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.529
 alas the make-up remover wipes of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.779
 viviverde coop 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.529
 as you see the almost finished e 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.620
 I will surely finish it but it does not come to me 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.200
 absolutely want to buy them back 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.050
 because even if they exploit enough 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.270
 well and it's a product that I don't use 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.450
 I usually just so frequently 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.270
 I prefer to remove make-up with make-up remover 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.039
 for the eyes cleansing milk the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.559
 liquid detergent and so on 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.079
 so all the die so no 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.730
 very often but all the times 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.699
 I used these wipes shortly after 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 having finished using them, the rice began 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.189
 to pinch and languages became me 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 red and so it seems enough 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.369
 evident that among the ingredients of 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.549
 these climbs there is something to mine 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.330
 skin annoys me when I'd veil 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.950
 many of you told me in advance 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.850
 also to me it makes the same effect then 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.509
 an annoying effect certainly not 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.670
 nice then I will finish them off 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.710
 Sooner or later short when then not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 I'll finish but I won't buy them back 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 another product rejected bocciatissimo 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.189
 very thin is this palette of eye shadows 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.770
 beautiful zipper ella of the manhattan brand 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.159
 I don't remember receiving it in a movebox 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.680
 as the only one, perhaps the penultimate a 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.840
 these four eyeshadows are very nice 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.280
 very spring pity that the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.979
 writing is practically non-existent 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.119
 they are eye shadows 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.910
 absolutely useless 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.610
 that is, now I show you I am pressing a lot 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.790
 strong finger on this violin 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.710
 practically on the hand 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.910
 you can see just a shadow but neither 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.620
 so much that is the seal for all this 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.880
 time just to make the video of the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.090
 rejected 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.310
 now I will throw it because it does not serve a purpose 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.200
 tube and then eye shadows is not me 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920
 for him this mine alone is lacking 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.050
 very bad place for another product 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.690
 overflowed as far as I'm concerned is 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.850
 also here if you have some uses 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.490
 alternative for a hand cream well 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.380
 because this year it's me 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.600
 luckily not at all fortunately it is one 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.180
 mini size because they are only 30 ml but 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.070
 I'm still struggling to finish it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.670
 I found this hot one in a 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:02.910
 never a beauty box that was a single-brand store 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.430
 queue we say that more or less the others 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.570
 products apart from the bathroom shower which 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.880
 I had also shown those in 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.780
 that they had a horrible time for 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.060
 luck with two showers were released 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.030
 the other products of the queue more or 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.440
 the less I liked this one here I didn't 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.989
 he is liking for nothing because of 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.470
 charity as a hand cream to moisturize 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.989
 hydrata can't say anything else but it has a 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.280
 smell that to me from the first time that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.200
 I used it remembers the most pd cat 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.910
 sorry to say and it's not very pleasant 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.120
 definitely but if you know that 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.720
 very pungent hour very unpleasant 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.700
 here you can understand that you put 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.709
 use this product to me not 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.630
 like it so bo now I will give away not short 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.489
 I know the fact that I don't like it but 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.220
 just there is no way I can 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:03.030
 pleasure then prodottino farlocco fu 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.060
 bought on the Chinese site bai in coins 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.610
 then I saw this here I had 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.100
 saw the photos on facebook as I had 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.870
 seen the photos said this product must 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.140
 absolutely be mine 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.739
 what they are are stupid pins 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.340
 slices that have this patellina that 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.150
 goes up and down and should 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.020
 with many if it should protect the 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:33.280
 nails when driving enamel not for 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.350
 make your fingernail be 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.120
 protected and therefore the enamel and is not 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.300
 ruined ok 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.229
 pity that if you have if you have on your hands 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.690
 ten of these hairpins I want 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.740
 just understand how you do it 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.870
 something else 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.110
 because you look like Edward scissor hands 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.150
 they are very uncomfortable and so it's not going to be 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.270
 well I put this on and do something else 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.340
 until I protect my nails and until 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.400
 the enamel sugar and meanwhile I do 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.700
 of the other not here what the hell you do and 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.470
 then among other things I don't know if we see then 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.889
 if I can do it with one finger 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:21.330
 see this stuff often here there is the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.199
 poorly designed because often the nail 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.860
 however, it risks going bump 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:31.389
 against a flap over I do not know if I 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:35.080
 I am explained that is the distance and see 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.050
 that is, I can manage with my fingernail 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.760
 crash into the surface of the 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.419
 patellina that should protect it 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.419
 enamel for which in the end they do not serve to the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.039
 cabbage so much or you want so much not 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.500
 I'm using them fortunately they are 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.440
 cost little and nothing because you don't need it 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.349
 substantially tube and other product 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.690
 for nails that I have so desired and that 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.729
 I didn't like it that much at all 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.260
 the bud are these maps for the 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.300
 essence nail art 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.510
 I bought these I had them 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.419
 shown in the video with the news ex 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.400
 sense of last fall is enthusiastic 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.289
 I couldn't wait to try them done 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.450
 that I also bought them all 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.940
 those that were available then 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.800
 you buy all the nets all 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.639
 fantasies that were there I bought them 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.780
 here they were once there was in 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.669
 I was able to transfer 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.469
 the image of these maps on mine 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.849
 nails then these came here 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.009
 sold together 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:37.029
 to them transfer that was this thing 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.919
 there was no alcohol- based one here 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:41.229
 time I was able to 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.779
 transfer the image to my nails 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:44.649
 now it may well be that I am 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:50.139
 prevented 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:52.179
 ok i accept it but of all the times that 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.919
 I tried but not even half an image 

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:56.860
 but he remained on the nails then when 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.979
 it was bad i was also pulling behind it 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.279
 nail polish that was on the nail and that was it 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:08.379
 there dry from damo so for quite a while 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:12.309
 it was already dry and when it was okay 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:14.769
 enamel remained there but there was no shade of 

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:18.789
 these shit pictures on mine 

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:21.699
 nails for which you buy with a lot 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:23.919
 enthusiasm used and tried more and more 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.479
 times but there was no way that I was 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.179
 once managed to get the 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.969
 result that was to come and that is how 

00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:32.830
 see here in the instructions that 

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:34.509
 the image that is present on the maps 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.079
 he had to move to his nails but 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:38.169
 when ever 

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:40.449
 I have never been sorry I have 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.419
 also saw some video tutorials in which 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:46.779
 someone was good for them 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:49.899
 I still this product the bud and 

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:54.099
 so for today for the bad video of the 

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:57.899
 his failures were everything and I greet you and
