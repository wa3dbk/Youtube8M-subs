 vacation time on the spot 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 tragedies lie toys and a poster with 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.310
 the inscription I want officers who 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 I will remind drugs the day before in staff 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 nevada another tragedy occurred there 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.149
 12 year old teenager killed a teacher

 mathematics and shot himself in brazil 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 problem with toy weapons decided 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.390
 radically banned him 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.730
 selling copies of their automatic pistol and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 country in this country is now impossible but 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.860
 will crime help in this fight? 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 figured out my colleagues Sergey Gordeev 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.230
 tired of fighting armed 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.180
 crime brazilian government 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 decided to try to look deep into 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 problems come from 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 epidemics of armed violence politics 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.320
 consulted psychologists and 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.159
 concluded it all starts in childhood 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.409
 friends stimulates the manifestation 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 aggressiveness in the child and in others 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 I watched it in practice I rested 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.100
 with his grandson and he started playing with 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 a water gun is the same aroused 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.229
 the whole group of his friends and I noticed how 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 increased level of aggressiveness 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.740
 However, the question is whether there is one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.470
 upbringing blame many push 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.750
 another more prosaic version of the fault 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 all rampant poverty for its line 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.570
 Paula lives 625 thousand people 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.280
 almost 10 percent of the total population 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.170
 the poverty rate in the country is even higher 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.710
 the result is one of the highest 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.170
 crime rates in the world 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.299
 we are in the Croc Wande Trojans where they live 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.680
 homeless addicts here are so dangerous that 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.570
 even the police themselves do not like here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.500
 they were going to appear today for the good in 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 we have a rare opportunity 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.810
 join 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.860
 the problem of brazil possible laws a in 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.750
 their performance 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.670
 for example a law prohibiting the sale 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.890
 exact copies of pistols already exist 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.840
 for a long time but it does not provide any 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.759
 sanctions for those who violate it 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.700
 it is not only the police who suffer 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.890
 but also judges theoretical laws dyed 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.050
 papers in practice work with them 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 just impossible but with that of good in 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.160
 Russian laws paradox how can 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.350
 maintain ban out there is 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 his violators did not go in this country 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.640
 think that you can change reality 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.620
 law you canâ€™t do this January 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.239
 next year for the sale of toy 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.730
 weapons baby stores will beat 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.350
 a ruble worth up to 100 thousand Brazilian 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.140
 reais is 52500 73 usd or 1 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.940
 700 million rubles will help 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.160
 new law to grow less aggressive and 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.870
 generation of children well only time will tell 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 for now, lawmakers are desperate to 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.310
 take control of adults 18 percent 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 all armed attacks are used 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.540
 fake weapons at gunpoint 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
 toy gun last year myself 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.829
 Paul were robbed forty-two thousand
