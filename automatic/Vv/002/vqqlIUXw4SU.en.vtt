once that's in you are on so let's take

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.139 
once that's in you are on so let's take
a<00:01:48.930> look<00:01:49.110> again<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.920> top<00:01:50.280> we've<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:51.030> our

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a look again at the top we've got our

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.600 
a look again at the top we've got our
lining<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:53.340> fine<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.360> covers<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
lining up here just fine it covers the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.580 
lining up here just fine it covers the
sleep<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.790> wake<00:01:56.939> button<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.869> has<00:01:58.110> you're<00:01:58.380> cut

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
sleep and wake button it has you're cut

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
sleep and wake button it has you're cut
out<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:59.040> headphone<00:01:59.369> jack<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.329> noise

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
out for your headphone jack the noise

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
out for your headphone jack the noise
cancelling<00:02:01.409> mic<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.829> open<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.759> no

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
cancelling mic is open so there is no

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.560 
cancelling mic is open so there is no
interference<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:05.640> side<00:02:05.909> we've<00:02:06.540> got

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
interference there on the side we've got

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
interference there on the side we've got
our<00:02:06.869> cutout<00:02:07.110> which<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.649> nice<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> big<00:02:08.160> for

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
our cutout which is nice and big for

our cutout which is nice and big for
your<00:02:08.849> mute<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.050> silent<00:02:10.500> switch<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.979> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
your mute or your silent switch and you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
your mute or your silent switch and you
can<00:02:11.190> reach<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.849> easily<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.690> not

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
can reach that very easily so that's not

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.360 
can reach that very easily so that's not
a<00:02:12.930> difficult

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
a difficult

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.160

buttons<00:02:15.709> here<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.129> then<00:02:16.610> on<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.879> bottom<00:02:17.060> when

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
buttons here and then on the bottom when

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.270 
buttons here and then on the bottom when
we<00:02:17.750> take<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:17.959> look<00:02:18.140> at<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.319> there's<00:02:18.890> your

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
we take a look at that there's your

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.479 
we take a look at that there's your
cutouts<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:19.909> your<00:02:20.299> speakers<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.110> for<00:02:22.099> your

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
dock and something to note is that it is

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.789 
dock and something to note is that it is
possible<00:02:26.569> not<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:27.049> the<00:02:27.200> docs<00:02:27.409> are<00:02:27.590> going<00:02:27.739> to

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
possible not all the docs are going to

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.930 
possible not all the docs are going to
work<00:02:27.950> with<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.220> because<00:02:28.549> of<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> design

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
work with this because of the design

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.000 
work with this because of the design
that<00:02:29.330> they've<00:02:29.450> gone<00:02:29.659> with<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.500> very<00:02:30.890> very

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that they've gone with it is very very

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.580 
that they've gone with it is very very
similar<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.879> the<00:02:32.180> apple<00:02:32.540> bumper<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.349> if<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
similar to the apple bumper so if you

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.509 
similar to the apple bumper so if you
take<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.829> look<00:02:34.129> here<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:36.220> they're<00:02:37.220> really

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
take a look here it is they're really

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.089 
take a look here it is they're really
similar<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.390> actually<00:02:38.870> if<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:39.200> if<00:02:39.709> we<00:02:39.799> take<00:02:40.040> a

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
similar and actually if we if we take a

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.250 
similar and actually if we if we take a
look<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.579> color<00:02:40.879> even<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.480> color<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.049> very

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
look in color even the color is very

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.649 
look in color even the color is very
very<00:02:42.500> similar<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.430> big<00:02:43.610> difference<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.150> here

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
very similar the big difference is here

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.479 
very similar the big difference is here
when<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.290> look<00:02:45.410> at<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> apple<00:02:45.859> bumper<00:02:46.010> versus

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
when you look at the apple bumper versus

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.449 
when you look at the apple bumper versus
the<00:02:46.609> scosche<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.329> buttons<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:49.310> of

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
the scosche is the buttons and then of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.220 
the scosche is the buttons and then of
course<00:02:49.489> on<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:49.940> top<00:02:50.239> your<00:02:50.569> cutouts<00:02:51.019> are<00:02:51.200> a

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
course on the top your cutouts are a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.930 
course on the top your cutouts are a
little<00:02:51.410> bit<00:02:51.590> different<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.069> well<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.609> then<00:02:52.849> of

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
little bit different as well and then of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.430 
little bit different as well and then of
course<00:02:52.970> you've<00:02:53.299> got<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.629> scosche<00:02:53.900> branding

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
course you've got the scosche branding

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.069 
course you've got the scosche branding
here<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.910> other<00:02:56.090> than<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.359> they<00:02:56.629> are<00:02:56.690> very

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
here but other than that they are very

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.099 
here but other than that they are very
very<00:02:57.319> similar<00:02:57.590> in<00:02:57.980> design<00:02:58.420> now<00:02:59.420> button

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
very similar in design now button

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.069 
very similar in design now button
responsiveness<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.310> top<00:03:01.579> it<00:03:02.420> does<00:03:02.690> require<00:03:02.870> a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
responsiveness the top it does require a

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.720 
responsiveness the top it does require a
little<00:03:03.290> bit<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.650> pressure<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.549> not

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
little bit of pressure it is not

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.210 
little bit of pressure it is not
terribly<00:03:05.150> bad<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:05.599> do<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.349> expect<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.069> be

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
terribly bad but do not expect it to be

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.050 
terribly bad but do not expect it to be
as<00:03:07.390> responsible<00:03:08.390> or<00:03:08.629> as<00:03:08.900> responsive<00:03:09.739> as<00:03:10.060> the

as responsible or as responsive as the
apple<00:03:11.450> bumper<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.440> there's<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.920> little<00:03:13.069> bit<00:03:13.310> of

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
apple bumper so there's a little bit of

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.890 
apple bumper so there's a little bit of
pressure<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.900> you've<00:03:15.109> got<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.349> apply<00:03:15.590> there

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
pressure that you've got to apply there

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.780 
pressure that you've got to apply there
when<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:17.989> talk<00:03:18.139> about<00:03:18.169> volume<00:03:18.590> volume<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.760> a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
when we talk about volume volume is a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.699 
when we talk about volume volume is a
little<00:03:19.849> bit<00:03:20.060> tougher<00:03:20.239> so<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:21.530> going<00:03:21.650> to

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
little bit tougher so it's going to

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.069 
little bit tougher so it's going to
require<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:22.040> little<00:03:22.250> bit<00:03:22.370> of<00:03:22.519> force<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:23.419> deal

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
require a little bit of force to deal

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.650 
require a little bit of force to deal
with<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.440> volume<00:03:24.859> here<00:03:25.220> not<00:03:25.700> terribly<00:03:26.180> bad<00:03:26.419> it

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
with the volume here not terribly bad it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
with the volume here not terribly bad it
reminds<00:03:26.930> me<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.200> Vulcan<00:03:27.530> grip<00:03:27.560> vue<00:03:27.769> case

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
reminds me of the Vulcan grip vue case

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.960 
reminds me of the Vulcan grip vue case
but<00:03:28.790> it's<00:03:29.000> something<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.389> be<00:03:29.599> aware<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:31.489> all

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
but it's something to be aware of so all

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.659 
but it's something to be aware of so all
in<00:03:32.269> all<00:03:32.389> I<00:03:32.629> think<00:03:32.840> it's<00:03:33.169> a<00:03:33.290> good<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.639> good

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669
