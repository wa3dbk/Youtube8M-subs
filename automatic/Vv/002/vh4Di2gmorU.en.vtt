duty<00:04:30.440> as<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.740> avatari<00:04:31.280> make<00:04:31.520> sure<00:04:31.669> things<00:04:32.000> are

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
duty as the avatari make sure things are

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.640 
duty as the avatari make sure things are
still<00:04:32.270> okay<00:04:32.629> it's<00:04:32.960> possible<00:04:33.139> if<00:04:33.379> you<00:04:33.410> think

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
still okay it's possible if you think

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.140 
still okay it's possible if you think
she's<00:04:33.680> not<00:04:33.949> really<00:04:34.129> needed<00:04:34.610> because<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:34.909> mean

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
she's not really needed because I mean

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.029 
she's not really needed because I mean
the<00:04:35.240> airbenders<00:04:35.629> are<00:04:35.870> pretty<00:04:36.560> much<00:04:36.650> doing<00:04:36.830> her

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
the airbenders are pretty much doing her

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.800 
the airbenders are pretty much doing her
job<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.490> trying<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.849> maintain<00:04:38.000> order<00:04:38.389> and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
job and trying to maintain order and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.510 
job and trying to maintain order and
helping<00:04:39.199> people<00:04:39.229> out<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.710> stuff<00:04:39.949> so<00:04:40.190> it's

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
helping people out and stuff so it's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:41.740 
helping people out and stuff so it's
possible<00:04:40.699> she's<00:04:41.000> thinking<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.419> she<00:04:41.629> isn't

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
possible she's thinking that she isn't

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.140 
possible she's thinking that she isn't
shown<00:04:42.020> even<00:04:42.169> eat<00:04:42.470> anymore<00:04:42.710> or<00:04:43.129> she<00:04:43.909> could<00:04:44.090> just

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
shown even eat anymore or she could just

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.850 
shown even eat anymore or she could just
be<00:04:44.419> running<00:04:44.629> away<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.020> mean<00:04:45.259> she<00:04:45.500> did<00:04:45.650> have<00:04:45.800> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
be running away I mean she did have a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.469 
be running away I mean she did have a
near-death<00:04:46.490> experience<00:04:46.490> when<00:04:47.180> she<00:04:47.389> was

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
near-death experience when she was

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.689 
near-death experience when she was
visiting<00:04:47.780> against<00:04:48.139> sit<00:04:48.650> here<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.280> maybe<00:04:49.460> she's

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
visiting against sit here so maybe she's

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.430 
visiting against sit here so maybe she's
just<00:04:49.819> kind<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.120> scared<00:04:50.419> me<00:04:50.509> just<00:04:51.169> want<00:04:51.289> to<00:04:51.349> go

confused there's one more she has long
hair<00:05:06.169> there's<00:05:06.650> other<00:05:06.800> modes<00:05:06.979> where<00:05:07.130> she<00:05:07.280> isn't

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
hair there's other modes where she isn't

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.059 
hair there's other modes where she isn't
and<00:05:07.970> then<00:05:08.150> finding<00:05:08.750> somewhere<00:05:08.990> else<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.560> it's

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
and then finding somewhere else and it's

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.760 
and then finding somewhere else and it's
all<00:05:10.250> really<00:05:11.199> interesting<00:05:12.199> so<00:05:12.349> seems<00:05:12.560> like<00:05:12.620> an

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
all really interesting so seems like an

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.170 
all really interesting so seems like an
planning<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.099> get<00:05:13.190> some<00:05:13.310> kind<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.490> flashbacks

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
planning to get some kind of flashbacks

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.700 
planning to get some kind of flashbacks
going<00:05:14.840> on<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.169> the<00:05:15.229> next<00:05:15.289> couple<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.620> episodes

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
going on in the next couple of episodes

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.730 
going on in the next couple of episodes
maybe<00:05:16.250> tell<00:05:16.789> us<00:05:17.020> what<00:05:18.020> she's<00:05:18.169> been<00:05:18.289> doing<00:05:18.349> for

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
maybe tell us what she's been doing for

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.050 
maybe tell us what she's been doing for
the<00:05:18.770> last<00:05:18.830> four<00:05:19.159> years<00:05:19.190> and<00:05:19.669> maybe<00:05:19.849> her

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
the last four years and maybe her

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.939 
the last four years and maybe her
journeys<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:20.750> maybe<00:05:21.229> try<00:05:21.409> to<00:05:21.440> find<00:05:21.740> herself

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
journeys and maybe try to find herself

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.800 
journeys and maybe try to find herself
because<00:05:22.310> she<00:05:22.430> still<00:05:22.639> seems<00:05:22.880> lost<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.629> this

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
because she still seems lost to this

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.540 
because she still seems lost to this
point<00:05:23.990> right<00:05:24.110> now<00:05:24.229> also<00:05:24.979> there's<00:05:25.250> nothing

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
point right now also there's nothing

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.709 
point right now also there's nothing
else<00:05:25.639> we<00:05:25.729> want<00:05:25.879> to<00:05:26.000> see<00:05:26.120> in<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.389> season

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
else we want to see in the season

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.629 
else we want to see in the season
because<00:05:26.810> we<00:05:27.139> can't<00:05:27.349> just<00:05:27.590> kind<00:05:27.800> of<00:05:27.919> push<00:05:28.460> that

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
because we can't just kind of push that

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.370 
because we can't just kind of push that
to<00:05:28.789> the<00:05:28.879> side<00:05:29.060> they're<00:05:29.479> still<00:05:29.750> there<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:30.199> that

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
to the side they're still there and that

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.740 
to the side they're still there and that
is<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:30.650> Red<00:05:30.830> Lotus<00:05:31.009> so<00:05:31.909> hoping<00:05:32.300> they<00:05:32.479> make<00:05:32.719> a

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
is the Red Lotus so hoping they make a

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.050 
is the Red Lotus so hoping they make a
return<00:05:33.080> or<00:05:33.349> do<00:05:33.680> something<00:05:34.069> well<00:05:34.610> i<00:05:34.639> mean<00:05:34.819> i<00:05:34.909> was

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
return or do something well i mean i was

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.580 
return or do something well i mean i was
thinking<00:05:35.419> act<00:05:35.599> i'm<00:05:35.810> not<00:05:35.900> all<00:05:36.080> right<00:05:36.349> so<00:05:36.469> i<00:05:36.500> was

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
thinking act i'm not all right so i was

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.659 
thinking act i'm not all right so i was
thinking<00:05:36.800> that<00:05:36.889> kuvira<00:05:37.190> was<00:05:37.280> probably<00:05:37.550> part

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
thinking that kuvira was probably part

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.219 
thinking that kuvira was probably part
of<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:37.849> Red<00:05:38.000> Lotus<00:05:38.120> but<00:05:38.419> it<00:05:38.539> doesn't<00:05:38.840> seem<00:05:38.990> to

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
of the Red Lotus but it doesn't seem to

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.019 
of the Red Lotus but it doesn't seem to
be<00:05:39.380> that<00:05:39.409> way<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.250> overall<00:05:40.430> this<00:05:40.580> is<00:05:40.639> a<00:05:40.759> really

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
be that way so overall this is a really

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:42.790 
be that way so overall this is a really
good<00:05:41.120> episode<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.539> really<00:05:42.020> enjoyed<00:05:42.259> this<00:05:42.440> this
