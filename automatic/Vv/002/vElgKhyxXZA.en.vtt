 incentive in xbox live gold phil spencer 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.129
 Well, one of the most executives 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.320
 prolific not in terms of their relationship 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.409
 with the press with the web pages 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 and especially with the fans 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.880
 has spoken precisely with these 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.729
 last to refer to criticism 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 by the fact that these without types of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.000
 incentives of free games because of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.180
 moment they are only for xbox 360 and has 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.940
 said well attention 2 the answer to everything 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.000
 this will come soon this is what has 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.220
 declared briefly phil spencer at 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 be consulted about when 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.660
 I would start offering free products 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.230
 of this type also in xbox one my 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.800
 personal opinion about it 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.360
 and we will comment but I think 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.140
 microsoft is waiting for the next 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.600
 e3 of which only four are left 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.930
 months and I think they are waiting 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.200
 to the next three to announce this as 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.930
 one of his letters to say look apart 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.420
 what I 'm going to present 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.670
 with gold for xbox world and I have something 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.440
 to present in the e3 is worth I think that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.300
 they are waiting it has turned out 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.300
 the catalog of games is not yet 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.630
 too extensive when June arrives or 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.700
 July, they will have a catalog of the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.340
 games that have come out now because they no longer 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.160
 they will be so much new and they can 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.290
 stretch a little and give away games 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.090
 quality although they are really and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.940
 they exist now they are not going to give you a 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.400
 battle feel 4 a fat tivo join for 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.710
 rival speed because it is what there is no longer 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.270
 there's more still there's no we're in a 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.820
 generation principle and the games are 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.010
 super limited so you know how to 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.460
 always informing the last like and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.460
 favorites
