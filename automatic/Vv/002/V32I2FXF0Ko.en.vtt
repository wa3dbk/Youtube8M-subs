I<00:00:00.149> wanted<00:00:00.570> to<00:00:00.630> show<00:00:00.900> another<00:00:01.350> example<00:00:01.469> of<00:00:02.250> the

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
I wanted to show another example of the

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.990 
I wanted to show another example of the
use<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.449> single<00:00:04.020> rotation<00:00:04.430> in<00:00:05.430> all<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> music

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
use of single rotation in all the music

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.379 
use of single rotation in all the music
that<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.270> play<00:00:06.710> shopping<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.830> $2.00<00:00:08.309> $25<00:00:09.090> that

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
that we play shopping a $2.00 $25 that

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.089 
that we play shopping a $2.00 $25 that
another<00:00:09.719> number<00:00:10.349> 11<00:00:10.800> in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> start<00:00:12.290> on<00:00:13.290> like<00:00:14.070> a

another number 11 in a start on like a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:24.140 
another number 11 in a start on like a
trip<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.820> showed<00:00:15.150> trails<00:00:22.369> attention<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
trip I showed trails attention that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:38.869 
trip I showed trails attention that
finger<00:00:24.779> alone<00:00:25.789> bring<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:28.050> right<00:00:37.760> for<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the form have to move together as a unit

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.700 
the form have to move together as a unit
without<00:00:45.239> any<00:00:45.600> tension<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.350> no<00:00:46.829> breaks

without any tension just no breaks

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
without any tension just no breaks
that's<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> deform<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.110> do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's when you see the deform as I do

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
that's when you see the deform as I do
that<00:00:52.350> before<00:00:54.050> moving<00:01:07.549> along<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.909> what

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that before moving along with that what

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.940 
that before moving along with that what
they<00:01:09.630> should<00:01:09.810> never<00:01:09.990> ask<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.470> long<00:01:10.650> they're

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
they should never ask so long they're

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
they should never ask so long they're
always<00:01:11.070> seen<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.490> knots<00:01:11.700> those<00:01:12.000> shapes<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
always seen two knots those shapes the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.330 
always seen two knots those shapes the
lateral<00:01:13.979> shift

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.090 

I<00:01:21.370> have<00:01:22.090> my<00:01:22.240> forms<00:01:22.720> together<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.440> rotation<00:01:23.980> is

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I have my forms together the rotation is

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.180 
I have my forms together the rotation is
also<00:01:25.470> adjusting<00:01:26.470> to<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.710> fact<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.980> there's

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
also adjusting to the fact that there's

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.390 
also adjusting to the fact that there's
a<00:01:27.310> blood<00:01:27.550> came<00:01:27.790> out<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.510> another<00:01:28.740> finger<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
a blood came out in another finger and

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.690 
a blood came out in another finger and
gets<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.820> little<00:01:31.150> bit<00:01:31.680> moving<00:01:32.680> over<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.400> can<00:01:33.550> be

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
gets a little bit moving over it can be

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.960 
gets a little bit moving over it can be
right<00:01:33.970> over<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.690> if<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.020> just<00:01:35.080> only<00:01:35.970> sideways

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
right over it if it's just only sideways

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.660 
right over it if it's just only sideways
it<00:01:37.270> doesn't<00:01:37.630> feel<00:01:37.750> like<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.050> gets<00:01:38.260> there<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
it doesn't feel like it gets there the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.360 
it doesn't feel like it gets there the
sideways<00:01:40.330> is<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.840> be<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.990> sideways<00:01:41.650> but<00:01:42.130> then

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
sideways is to be the sideways but then

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.980 
sideways is to be the sideways but then
we<00:01:42.520> have<00:01:42.670> normal<00:01:42.970> short<00:01:43.180> fingers<00:01:43.660> we<00:01:43.840> have

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
we have normal short fingers we have

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.600 
we have normal short fingers we have
black<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.440> white<00:01:44.920> keys

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
black and white keys

00:01:45.610 --> 00:02:15.200 
black and white keys
so<00:01:46.000> there<00:01:46.240> are<00:01:46.270> other<00:01:47.130> adjustments

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:36.559 

my<00:02:16.210> dorsal<00:02:16.630> shifts<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.470> make<00:02:17.500> room

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 

and<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.349> course<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.829> notice<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.459> all

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and of course you notice that with all

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.899 
and of course you notice that with all
the<00:02:38.879> talk<00:02:39.120> about<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.840> forearm<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.730> see

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
the talk about the forearm that you see

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.599 
the talk about the forearm that you see
fingers<00:02:42.299> moving<00:02:42.599> all<00:02:43.290> these<00:02:43.680> movements<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
fingers moving all these movements that

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.429 
fingers moving all these movements that
take<00:02:44.790> away<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.329> strain<00:02:45.719> from<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.109> fingers

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
take away the strain from the fingers

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.679 
take away the strain from the fingers
having<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.829> reach<00:02:47.010> sideways<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.939> to<00:02:48.090> curl<00:02:48.359> and

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
having to reach sideways and to curl and

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.470 
having to reach sideways and to curl and
to<00:02:48.840> pole<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:49.290> makes<00:02:50.219> it<00:02:50.370> possible<00:02:50.579> for<00:02:50.879> them<00:02:51.239> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
to pole in makes it possible for them to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.420 
to pole in makes it possible for them to
really<00:02:51.989> move<00:02:52.200> freely<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.859> they<00:02:53.010> need<00:02:53.159> to<00:02:53.280> move

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
really move freely and they need to move

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.199 
really move freely and they need to move
freely<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.060> create<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> right<00:02:54.750> balance<00:02:55.019> of

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
freely to create the right balance of

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.110 
freely to create the right balance of
work<00:02:57.470> between<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.069> finger<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.609> the<00:02:59.700> forearm

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
work between the finger and the forearm

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.069 
work between the finger and the forearm
so<00:03:00.510> they're<00:03:00.689> not<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.739> they<00:03:02.159> are<00:03:02.459> moving

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
so they're not that that they are moving

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.149 
so they're not that that they are moving
together<00:03:04.079> they're<00:03:04.470> moving<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> different

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
together they're moving in a different

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:19.000 
together they're moving in a different
way

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:57.949 
music they'll put a number 5 shogunate
you'd<00:03:54.109> notice<00:03:55.109> when<00:03:55.379> I<00:03:55.409> do<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.950> my<00:03:56.609> hands<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
you'd notice when I do that my hands and

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.420 
you'd notice when I do that my hands and
fingers<00:03:58.169> don't<00:03:58.530> have<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.889> open

fingers don't have to open
they<00:03:59.579> never<00:03:59.849> are<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.720> a<00:04:00.840> position<00:04:01.169> that<00:04:01.680> is

they never are in a position that is
stretchy

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.789 

and<00:04:18.570> it's<00:04:18.720> not<00:04:18.900> enough<00:04:19.170> to<00:04:19.290> think<00:04:19.560> they're

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and it's not enough to think they're

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.800 
and it's not enough to think they're
taken<00:04:20.100> by<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.280> forum<00:04:20.700> but<00:04:21.060> they've<00:04:21.209> taken<00:04:21.420> by

taken by the forum but they've taken by
