so it's just right footed all the way

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.800 
so it's just right footed all the way
through<00:02:33.220> trying<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.000> stay<00:02:34.180> balanced<00:02:34.630> right

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
through trying to stay balanced right

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.410 
through trying to stay balanced right
between<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.230> cones<00:02:35.470> up<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.730> into<00:02:37.210> shape

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
between the cones up and in into shape

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.570 
between the cones up and in into shape
so<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:37.990> make<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> save<00:02:38.440> alright<00:02:39.070> here<00:02:39.550> we

so you can make a save alright here we

00:02:39.580 --> 00:03:04.860 
so you can make a save alright here we
go

now<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.590> we're<00:03:05.709> going<00:03:05.739> to<00:03:05.860> do<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.099> can<00:03:06.250> be

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
now what we're going to do is can be

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.830 
now what we're going to do is can be
very<00:03:06.640> similar<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.420> you're<00:03:07.569> going<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> go

very similar but you're going to go

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.350 
very similar but you're going to go

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:53.590 

very<00:03:33.010> good

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.210 

so<00:03:54.600> we'll<00:03:54.750> start<00:03:55.020> with<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.680> our<00:03:55.770> right<00:03:55.980> leg

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
so we'll start with on our right leg

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.280 
so we'll start with on our right leg
we're<00:03:57.180> going<00:03:57.210> to<00:03:57.330> go<00:03:57.420> one<00:03:57.630> forward<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.140> over

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
we're going to go one forward and over

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.800 
we're going to go one forward and over
same<00:03:58.710> as<00:03:58.860> we<00:03:59.010> did<00:03:59.190> last<00:03:59.220> time<00:03:59.580> but<00:04:00.150> now<00:04:00.360> every

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
same as we did last time but now every

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.320 
same as we did last time but now every
time<00:04:00.960> that<00:04:01.110> we<00:04:01.260> switch<00:04:02.070> across<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.820> cones<00:04:03.060> we

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
time that we switch across the cones we

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.170 
time that we switch across the cones we
change<00:04:03.630> feet<00:04:03.990> okay<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.010> you're<00:04:05.280> going<00:04:05.430> one

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
change feet okay so you're going one

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.870 
change feet okay so you're going one
forward<00:04:07.460> I'm<00:04:08.460> always<00:04:08.610> changing<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.240> front<00:04:10.880> so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
forward I'm always changing in front so

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.699 
forward I'm always changing in front so
that<00:04:11.910> there's<00:04:12.270> no<00:04:12.750> crossing<00:04:13.200> over<00:04:13.320> behind

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
that there's no crossing over behind

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.440 
that there's no crossing over behind
which<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.190> going<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.490> cause<00:04:14.640> us<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:15.000> trip<00:04:15.270> and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
which is going to cause us to trip and

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.270 
which is going to cause us to trip and
then<00:04:15.540> around<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.810> goal<00:04:16.019> area<00:04:16.230> all<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
then around the goal area all the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.069 
then around the goal area all the
crossovers<00:04:18.209> are<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.420> front<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:18.810> this<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:18.989> your

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
crossovers are in front so this is your

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.630 
crossovers are in front so this is your
first<00:04:19.260> time<00:04:19.440> trying<00:04:19.890> it<00:04:20.070> let's<00:04:20.250> see<00:04:20.370> how<00:04:20.519> it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
first time trying it let's see how it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.050 
first time trying it let's see how it
looks

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
looks

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.850 
looks

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
I brought scout so you can do an example

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:45.879 
I brought scout so you can do an example
for<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.589 

the<00:04:46.430> last<00:04:46.639> footwork<00:04:46.970> exercise<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.449> we're

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
the last footwork exercise that we're

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.540 
the last footwork exercise that we're
going<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> do<00:04:47.870> today<00:04:48.020> we're<00:04:48.919> going<00:04:49.129> to<00:04:49.280> bring

in<00:04:49.819> a<00:04:50.090> little<00:04:50.840> bit<00:04:50.990> more<00:04:51.259> strength<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.740> little

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
in a little bit more strength a little

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.350 
in a little bit more strength a little
bit<00:04:52.039> more<00:04:52.190> power<00:04:52.370> but<00:04:52.639> then<00:04:52.819> we're<00:04:52.909> also<00:04:53.060> going

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
bit more power but then we're also going

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.730 
bit more power but then we're also going
to<00:04:53.419> continue<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.139> make<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:54.409> think<00:04:54.620> a<00:04:54.710> little

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
to continue to make you think a little

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.439 
to continue to make you think a little
bit<00:04:54.949> okay<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.699> you'll<00:04:56.030> start<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.300> your<00:04:56.389> right

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
bit okay so you'll start on your right

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.200 
bit okay so you'll start on your right
foot<00:04:56.870> you're<00:04:57.259> going<00:04:57.440> to<00:04:57.500> go<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.650> forward<00:04:58.310> one

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
foot you're going to go to forward one

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.029 
foot you're going to go to forward one
back<00:04:59.479> and<00:05:00.169> then<00:05:00.560> you're<00:05:00.650> going<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.800> switch

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
back and then you're going to switch

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.409 
back and then you're going to switch
over<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.370> other<00:05:01.490> side<00:05:01.759> and<00:05:02.000> as<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.240> switch

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
over the other side and as you switch

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.879 
over the other side and as you switch
over<00:05:02.569> to<00:05:02.629> the<00:05:02.690> other<00:05:02.780> side<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.199> switch<00:05:03.319> feet

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
over to the other side and switch feet

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.610 
over to the other side and switch feet
right<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:04.729> it's<00:05:04.909> two<00:05:05.090> forward<00:05:05.479> one<00:05:06.409> back

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
right so it's two forward one back

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.020 
right so it's two forward one back
switch<00:05:10.509> alright<00:05:12.460> it's<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.550> little<00:05:13.759> bit<00:05:13.879> more

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
switch alright it's a little bit more

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.180 
switch alright it's a little bit more
confusing<00:05:14.530> all<00:05:15.530> right<00:05:15.680> here<00:05:15.830> we<00:05:15.889> go<00:05:15.919> two

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
confusing all right here we go two

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:31.129 
confusing all right here we go two
forward<00:05:16.520> one<00:05:16.669> back<00:05:16.849> over

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:55.920 

very<00:05:31.710> good

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.070 

I<00:05:56.340> think<00:05:57.340> that<00:05:57.460> you<00:05:57.550> guys<00:05:57.669> all<00:05:58.060> realize<00:05:58.600> that

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
I think that you guys all realize that

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.110 
I think that you guys all realize that
there<00:05:59.229> are<00:05:59.259> certain<00:05:59.620> things<00:05:59.770> that<00:06:00.000> that<00:06:01.000> you

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
there are certain things that that you

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.760 
there are certain things that that you
were<00:06:01.240> very<00:06:01.570> very<00:06:01.810> effective<00:06:02.259> at<00:06:02.380> the<00:06:02.620> one

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
were very very effective at the one

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.740 
were very very effective at the one
thing<00:06:02.949> I<00:06:03.009> would<00:06:03.130> say<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.340> once<00:06:03.580> you<00:06:03.940> get<00:06:04.240> a<00:06:04.449> hold

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
thing I would say is once you get a hold

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.050 
thing I would say is once you get a hold
of<00:06:04.960> what<00:06:05.169> it<00:06:05.289> is<00:06:05.320> the<00:06:05.650> technique<00:06:06.100> then<00:06:06.910> you're

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
of what it is the technique then you're

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.820 
of what it is the technique then you're
always<00:06:07.270> pressing<00:06:07.539> yourself<00:06:07.750> in<00:06:08.259> terms<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.740> how

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
always pressing yourself in terms of how

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.700 
always pressing yourself in terms of how
fast<00:06:09.160> you're<00:06:09.460> going<00:06:10.199> one<00:06:11.199> of<00:06:11.289> the<00:06:11.380> things<00:06:11.560> when

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
fast you're going one of the things when

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.499 
fast you're going one of the things when
we<00:06:11.740> go<00:06:11.919> sideways<00:06:12.490> you'll<00:06:12.699> notice<00:06:13.060> there<00:06:13.360> was<00:06:13.479> a

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
we go sideways you'll notice there was a

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.270 
we go sideways you'll notice there was a
few<00:06:13.750> of<00:06:13.870> us<00:06:13.960> that<00:06:14.020> we<00:06:14.229> would<00:06:14.410> break<00:06:14.680> down<00:06:14.740> going

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
few of us that we would break down going

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.159 
few of us that we would break down going
sideways<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:16.000> a<00:06:16.090> lot<00:06:16.240> of<00:06:16.360> that<00:06:16.479> is<00:06:16.630> abdominal

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
sideways and a lot of that is abdominal

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.020 
sideways and a lot of that is abdominal
core<00:06:17.410> strength<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.160> your<00:06:18.280> ability<00:06:18.669> to<00:06:18.820> really

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
core strength and your ability to really

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.830 
core strength and your ability to really
just<00:06:19.449> kind<00:06:19.690> of<00:06:19.780> shift<00:06:20.410> over<00:06:20.979> and<00:06:21.840> stay

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
just kind of shift over and stay

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.450 
just kind of shift over and stay
balanced<00:06:23.259> okay<00:06:23.560> so<00:06:23.740> if<00:06:23.979> you<00:06:24.070> found<00:06:24.250> yourself

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
balanced okay so if you found yourself

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.400 
balanced okay so if you found yourself
when<00:06:25.270> you<00:06:25.360> were<00:06:25.389> going<00:06:25.690> across<00:06:25.780> or<00:06:26.259> rather

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
when you were going across or rather

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.379 
when you were going across or rather
than<00:06:26.620> being<00:06:26.800> straight<00:06:27.130> across<00:06:27.400> and<00:06:27.820> being

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
than being straight across and being

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.710 
than being straight across and being
more<00:06:28.660> up<00:06:28.900> here<00:06:29.710> I<00:06:29.830> mean<00:06:30.759> that's<00:06:31.150> core<00:06:31.419> strength

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
more up here I mean that's core strength

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.150 
more up here I mean that's core strength
that's<00:06:31.870> balance<00:06:32.320> that's<00:06:32.440> understanding<00:06:33.009> what

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
that's balance that's understanding what

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.430 
that's balance that's understanding what
exactly<00:06:33.580> the<00:06:33.759> drill<00:06:34.000> is<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:34.389> the<00:06:34.780> exercise<00:06:35.229> is

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
exactly the drill is and the exercise is

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.639 
exactly the drill is and the exercise is
and<00:06:35.620> how<00:06:35.680> it's<00:06:35.860> able<00:06:36.009> to<00:06:36.160> translate
