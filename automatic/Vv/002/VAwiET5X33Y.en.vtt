00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
nice and warm so and I've done that I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.649 
nice and warm so and I've done that I
put<00:01:11.789> it's<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.539> a<00:01:12.570> pig<00:01:12.930> low<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.860> would<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
put it's just like a pig low but would I

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.139 
put it's just like a pig low but would I
think<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.869> keeps<00:01:16.200> them<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.560> lot<00:01:16.770> warmer<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> as

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
think this keeps them a lot warmer so as

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.660 
think this keeps them a lot warmer so as
you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.330> see<00:01:18.659> that's<00:01:18.840> less<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.340> this

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you can see that's less it's like this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
you can see that's less it's like this
just<00:01:20.909> keep<00:01:21.149> them<00:01:21.330> warmer<00:01:21.690> than<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.899> big<00:01:22.049> loose

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
