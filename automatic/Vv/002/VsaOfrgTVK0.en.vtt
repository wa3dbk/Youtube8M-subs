 application you can find it in the search 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.720

 click the button or the party I threw all 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.300
 For now, click on it twice and 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.670
 the emulator becomes i already i shazam in 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.020

 [music] 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.270
 there is no label doped 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.880
 who as if by quantity listens with 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.120
 the program is all colored coincidence 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.120
 to give 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:54.139
 [music] 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.530
 the program works but look for your songs 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.310
 or listen to existing ones 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.620
