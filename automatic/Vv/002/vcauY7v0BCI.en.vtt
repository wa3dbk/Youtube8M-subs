one<00:01:48.460> thing<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.759> found<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.659> with<00:01:50.110> these

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
one thing I found with with these

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.810 
one thing I found with with these
guitars<00:01:50.799> playing<00:01:51.189> them<00:01:51.340> over<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.610> years

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
guitars playing them over the years

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.090 
guitars playing them over the years
since<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.149> they<00:01:52.960> tended<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.409> wire<00:01:53.740> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
since that they tended to wire the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.950 
since that they tended to wire the
volume<00:01:54.820> pots<00:01:55.060> backwards<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.899> where<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
volume pots backwards to where the the

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.260 
volume pots backwards to where the the
pickup<00:01:59.320> lead<00:01:59.560> was<00:01:59.860> soldered<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.670> wiper<00:02:01.060> of

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
pickup lead was soldered to the wiper of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.969 
pickup lead was soldered to the wiper of
the<00:02:01.600> pot<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:05.409> lead<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.860> the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the pot and and the the lead to the

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.150 
the pot and and the the lead to the
switch<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.610> soldered<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.210> other<00:02:07.479> look

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
switch was soldered to the other look

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.430 
switch was soldered to the other look
what<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.369> did<00:02:09.610> was<00:02:09.640> cause<00:02:10.269> your<00:02:10.630> guitar<00:02:11.110> to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
what that did was cause your guitar to

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920 
what that did was cause your guitar to
lose<00:02:11.650> lose<00:02:12.610> high<00:02:12.910> end<00:02:13.180> as<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.569> turn<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
lose lose high end as you turn the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.289 
lose lose high end as you turn the
volume<00:02:14.110> down<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.799> it<00:02:15.370> got<00:02:15.489> really<00:02:15.880> muffled

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
volume down so it got really muffled

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.479 
volume down so it got really muffled
which<00:02:17.200> sounds<00:02:17.590> really<00:02:17.799> cool<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.250> want<00:02:18.430> to

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
which sounds really cool if you want to

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.250 
which sounds really cool if you want to
sound<00:02:18.670> like<00:02:18.760> Freddie<00:02:19.060> green<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.870> something

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
sound like Freddie green or something

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.420

in<00:05:42.189> subway<00:05:42.699> guitars<00:05:44.310> facto<00:05:45.310> I<00:05:45.339> came<00:05:45.669> upon<00:05:45.939> the

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.089 
in subway guitars facto I came upon the

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:50.269 
in subway guitars facto I came upon the
idea<00:05:46.180> of<00:05:46.539> putting<00:05:46.779> these<00:05:47.310> these<00:05:48.810> reproduction

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
idea of putting these these reproduction

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.670 
idea of putting these these reproduction
Rickenbacker<00:05:51.279> to<00:05:51.849> pneumatics<00:05:52.360> on<00:05:52.539> there<00:05:52.779> as

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
Rickenbacker to pneumatics on there as

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.549 
Rickenbacker to pneumatics on there as
opposed<00:05:54.159> to<00:05:54.310> like<00:05:54.580> regular<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:56.050> Domanick<00:05:56.469> I

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:56.559 
opposed to like regular to Domanick I

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:00.959 
opposed to like regular to Domanick I
think<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.399> reasoning<00:05:57.909> was<00:05:58.319> the<00:05:59.319> the<00:06:00.189> taper<00:06:00.490> of

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
think the reasoning was the the taper of

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:04.639 
think the reasoning was the the taper of
this<00:06:01.240> neck<00:06:01.509> gets<00:06:01.779> a<00:06:01.960> little<00:06:02.229> thinner<00:06:02.499> up<00:06:03.240> top

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:04.649 
this neck gets a little thinner up top

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:07.829 
this neck gets a little thinner up top
which<00:06:05.649> is<00:06:05.680> interesting<00:06:06.399> concept<00:06:07.029> harmony

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:07.839 
which is interesting concept harmony
