all the volume I don't know what

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.719 
all the volume I don't know what
happened

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
happened

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.100 
happened
enough<00:05:33.660> is<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.830> is<00:05:35.099> how<00:05:35.250> suppose<00:05:35.669> it<00:05:36.210> works

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.400 

but<00:05:40.110> man<00:05:40.470> that's<00:05:40.949> horrible

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
but man that's horrible

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:52.129 
but man that's horrible
check<00:05:43.410> it<00:05:43.500> out<00:05:43.849> green<00:05:44.849> not<00:05:45.569> blue

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.850 

now

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:05.050 

volume<00:05:55.759> control<00:05:58.689> microphone<00:06:02.379> 100k<00:06:03.699> it<00:06:04.699> is<00:06:04.849> in

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
volume control microphone 100k it is in

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.610 
volume control microphone 100k it is in
the<00:06:05.180> volume

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.909 

I<00:06:09.650> think<00:06:10.430> it<00:06:11.000> should<00:06:11.270> be<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:11.630> driver<00:06:11.930> but<00:06:12.710> also

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
I think it should be the driver but also

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.040
