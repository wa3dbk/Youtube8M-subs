00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
higher versions of hardware like they

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.999 
higher versions of hardware like they
added<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.630> two<00:01:57.810> hundred<00:01:58.049> fifty<00:01:58.170> gigabytes<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
they upgrade like from 2.0 2.2 22.4 it's

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.940 
they upgrade like from 2.0 2.2 22.4 it's
just<00:02:05.880> super<00:02:06.600> expensive<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.380> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
