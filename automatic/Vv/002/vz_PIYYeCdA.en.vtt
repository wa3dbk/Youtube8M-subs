i can tell though everything seems
pretty<00:00:18.690> credible<00:00:19.670> the<00:00:20.670> range<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> wands

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
pretty credible the range of the wands

pretty credible the range of the wands
do<00:00:21.869> seem<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.380> around<00:00:22.590> 20<00:00:23.130> blocks<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.730> you

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
do seem to be around 20 blocks as you

do seem to be around 20 blocks as you
can<00:00:24.180> kind<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.170> test<00:00:26.449> there<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
can kind of see in this test there is a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.929 
can kind of see in this test there is a
noticeable<00:00:27.900> cool<00:00:28.320> down<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.699> does

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
noticeable cool down on them it does

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.939 
noticeable cool down on them it does
seem<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.810> 10<00:00:31.080> seconds<00:00:31.529> maybe<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
seem to be about 10 seconds maybe a

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
seem to be about 10 seconds maybe a
little<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.309> more<00:00:32.550> actually<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> master

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
little bit more actually for the master

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.790 
little bit more actually for the master
wand<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> apprentice<00:00:36.719> wand<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.590> seem

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
wand and the apprentice wand only seem

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
wand and the apprentice wand only seem
to<00:00:37.829> take<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.160> eight<00:00:38.520> seconds<00:00:39.020> before<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
to take about eight seconds before I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
to take about eight seconds before I
could<00:00:40.410> use<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.680> again<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.090> might<00:00:42.300> vary

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
could use it again now this might vary

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.600 
could use it again now this might vary
depending<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> range<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.100> use<00:00:44.399> them

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
depending on the range that you use them

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.260 
depending on the range that you use them
at<00:00:44.760> I'm<00:00:44.910> not<00:00:45.059> exactly<00:00:45.510> sure<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:47.059> when<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> was

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
at I'm not exactly sure but when I was

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
at I'm not exactly sure but when I was
just<00:00:48.360> standing<00:00:48.539> next<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.020> someone<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> just

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
just standing next to someone and just

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
just standing next to someone and just
right<00:00:50.399> clicking<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.969> did<00:00:51.180> come<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.809> about

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
right clicking it did come out to about

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.740 
right clicking it did come out to about
8<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.289> 10<00:00:52.410> seconds<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.180> either<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.480> there's

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
8 and 10 seconds on either way there's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.810 
8 and 10 seconds on either way there's
no<00:00:54.809> wand<00:00:55.230> spamming<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.370> you're<00:00:56.489> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> want

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
no wand spamming so you're going to want

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
no wand spamming so you're going to want
to<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.149> an<00:00:57.300> alternate<00:00:57.719> weapon<00:00:58.020> not<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to have an alternate weapon not just the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.849 
to have an alternate weapon not just the
wand<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.480> wands<00:01:00.480> seem<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> share<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> cool<00:01:01.620> down

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
wand the wands seem to share a cool down

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.100 
wand the wands seem to share a cool down
so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> apprentice<00:01:03.719> wand<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so if you use the apprentice wand and

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
so if you use the apprentice wand and
switch<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.559> master<00:01:04.920> wand<00:01:05.100> you're<00:01:05.400> still

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
switch the master wand you're still

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
switch the master wand you're still
gonna<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> wait<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> cool<00:01:06.810> down<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
gonna have to wait for the cool down to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.820 
gonna have to wait for the cool down to
finish<00:01:07.260> before<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.770> use<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:09.049> now<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.380> confirms

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
finish before you use it now it confirms

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.500 
finish before you use it now it confirms
that<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.310> no<00:01:11.460> ammunition<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.150> fuel

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
that there's no ammunition or fuel
needed<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> wands<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> true<00:01:14.159> and

the prices it displays are correct 32
golden<00:01:18.540> gets<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> master<00:01:19.409> wand<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> 16

information is correct and pretty easy
to<00:01:25.560> access<00:01:26.060> why<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.540> bother<00:01:27.750> making<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
to access why would I bother making a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
to access why would I bother making a
video<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> might<00:01:28.799> ask<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.420> wanted<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
video you might ask well I wanted to

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
video you might ask well I wanted to
make<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> video<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.130> wanted<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> do

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
make the video because I wanted to do

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.940 
make the video because I wanted to do
the<00:01:32.850> research<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.450> fix<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> page<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
the research to fix this page and you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.920 
the research to fix this page and you
know<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> wiki<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.610> whatever<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.869> figured

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
know the wiki and whatever so I figured

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.690 
know the wiki and whatever so I figured
if<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.890> testing<00:01:38.490> everything

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
if I'm going to be testing everything

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
if I'm going to be testing everything
out<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> might<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.329> well<00:01:39.360> take<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> footage<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
out I might as well take the footage of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.039 
out I might as well take the footage of
it<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.920> put<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> video<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.780> people

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it and put it in a video so that people

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.039 
it and put it in a video so that people
can<00:01:43.290> see<00:01:43.439> firsthand<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:44.840> everything<00:01:45.840> works

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
can see firsthand how everything works

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
can see firsthand how everything works
and<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.890> other<00:01:47.100> reason<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> wanted<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and the other reason that I wanted to

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.910 
and the other reason that I wanted to
make<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.960> larger<00:01:49.409> reason<00:01:49.770> is

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
make it and this is the larger reason is

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.280 
make it and this is the larger reason is
just<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.149> people<00:01:51.479> learn<00:01:51.990> better

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just because some people learn better

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.710 
just because some people learn better
from<00:01:52.439> seeing<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.460> wands<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.970> action<00:01:54.450> than

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
from seeing the wands in action than

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.620 
from seeing the wands in action than
they<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.130> by<00:01:56.130> reading<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> text<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
they would by reading the text on the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.630 
they would by reading the text on the
page<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.710> hopefully<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.280> will<00:01:59.460> inspire

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
page and so hopefully this will inspire

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.429 
page and so hopefully this will inspire
more<00:02:00.000> people<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.329> use<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> ones<00:02:00.869> because<00:02:01.320> they

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
more people to use the ones because they

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.649 
more people to use the ones because they
really<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.950> very<00:02:02.790> useful<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.270> Minecraft

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
really are very useful in Minecraft

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.930 
really are very useful in Minecraft

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
then about one and a half hearts to

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.350

someone<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.170> full<00:03:37.380> iron<00:03:37.680> now<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:39.150> damage

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
someone in full iron now the damage

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.450 
someone in full iron now the damage
might<00:03:39.690> change<00:03:39.990> based<00:03:40.320> off<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> range<00:03:41.040> or<00:03:41.310> how

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
might change based off of range or how

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.490 
might change based off of range or how
soon<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.910> use<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.180> off<00:03:42.270> cooldown<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.990> really

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
soon you use it off cooldown I really

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.070 
soon you use it off cooldown I really
could<00:03:43.680> not<00:03:43.890> tell<00:03:44.130> from<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.460> test<00:03:44.700> cited<00:03:45.180> but

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
could not tell from the test cited but

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.860 
could not tell from the test cited but
the<00:03:46.830> damage<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.820> dealt<00:03:48.030> bounced

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the damage I actually dealt bounced

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.280 
the damage I actually dealt bounced
around<00:03:48.990> a<00:03:49.350> little<00:03:49.740> bit<00:03:50.630> feel<00:03:51.630> safe<00:03:51.990> knowing

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
around a little bit feel safe knowing

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.050 
around a little bit feel safe knowing
that<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:52.890> use<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.130> wand<00:03:53.460> first<00:03:53.760> though

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
that if you use the wand first though

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.610 
that if you use the wand first though
it's<00:03:54.330> like<00:03:54.600> getting<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.960> free<00:03:55.260> hidden

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
it's like getting a free hidden

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.950 
it's like getting a free hidden
especially<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.520> use<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.820> master<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.360> which

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
especially if use the master on which

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.650 
especially if use the master on which
sets<00:03:58.290> your<00:03:58.440> enemy<00:03:58.710> on<00:03:58.800> fire<00:03:59.330> now<00:04:00.330> without

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
sets your enemy on fire now without

sets your enemy on fire now without
having<00:04:01.200> the<00:04:01.290> fire<00:04:01.560> included<00:04:02.160> at<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:03.330> can

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
having the fire included at all you can

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.120 
having the fire included at all you can
still<00:04:03.720> hurt<00:04:04.050> people<00:04:04.440> while<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.710> in<00:04:04.860> water

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
still hurt people while they're in water

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.460 
still hurt people while they're in water
or<00:04:05.340> while<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:06.180> raining<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:06.990> won't<00:04:07.170> set

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
or while it's raining it just won't set

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.300 
or while it's raining it just won't set
them<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.680> fire<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.930> still<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.350> about<00:04:10.680> two

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
them on fire so you still do about two

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.040 
them on fire so you still do about two
to<00:04:11.610> three<00:04:11.640> hearts<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.300> damage<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.600> someone<00:04:12.960> in

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
to three hearts of damage to someone in

to three hearts of damage to someone in
leather<00:04:13.260> armor<00:04:13.790> while<00:04:14.790> they're<00:04:14.970> submerged<00:04:15.360> in

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
leather armor while they're submerged in

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.750 
leather armor while they're submerged in
the<00:04:15.810> water<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.290> now<00:04:16.470> factor<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.310> that<00:04:17.459> fire

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
the water and now factor in that fire

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.570 
the water and now factor in that fire
damage<00:04:17.970> again<00:04:18.420> and<00:04:19.190> you're<00:04:20.190> actually<00:04:20.340> doing

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
damage again and you're actually doing

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.180 
damage again and you're actually doing
quite<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:21.180> bit<00:04:21.420> over<00:04:21.600> time<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.290> fire<00:04:22.680> isn't

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
quite a bit over time because fire isn't

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:34.130 
quite a bit over time because fire isn't
affected<00:04:23.640> by<00:04:23.790> their<00:04:24.030> armor<00:04:24.390> value

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.540 

well<00:04:35.140> that<00:04:35.530> just<00:04:35.650> about<00:04:35.800> sums<00:04:35.950> up<00:04:36.400> everything

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
well that just about sums up everything

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.630 
well that just about sums up everything
about<00:04:37.090> these<00:04:37.300> wands<00:04:38.040> their<00:04:39.040> damage<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.610> a

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
about these wands their damage is a

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.020 
about these wands their damage is a
little<00:04:40.000> shaky<00:04:40.450> their<00:04:41.230> range<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.760> about

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
little shaky their range is just about

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.380 
little shaky their range is just about
20<00:04:43.690> blocks<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:45.340> seems<00:04:45.640> like<00:04:45.820> once<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.180> use

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
20 blocks and it seems like once you use

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.450 
20 blocks and it seems like once you use
it<00:04:46.540> you<00:04:47.110> have<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.350> wait<00:04:47.500> more<00:04:47.890> than<00:04:47.950> just<00:04:48.340> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
it you have to wait more than just the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.130 
it you have to wait more than just the
cooldown<00:04:48.880> time<00:04:49.120> before<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.480> can<00:04:49.630> hit<00:04:49.750> someone

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
cooldown time before you can hit someone

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.950 
cooldown time before you can hit someone
from<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.560> range<00:04:50.800> again<00:04:51.220> other<00:04:52.150> than<00:04:52.510> that<00:04:52.750> I

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
from that range again other than that I

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.110 
from that range again other than that I
cannot<00:04:53.530> think<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.920> anything<00:04:54.520> else<00:04:54.790> about

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
cannot think of anything else about

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.330 
cannot think of anything else about
these<00:04:55.660> ones<00:04:55.930> that<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.140> could<00:04:56.410> do<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.830> test

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
these ones that I could do and test

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.420 
these ones that I could do and test
easily<00:04:57.940> enough<00:04:58.180> I've<00:04:58.750> spent<00:04:59.110> two<00:04:59.470> days<00:04:59.680> just

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
easily enough I've spent two days just

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.240 
easily enough I've spent two days just
testing<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.030> wands<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.980> this<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.130> the

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
testing the wands and this is the

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.620 
testing the wands and this is the
information<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.790> I've<00:05:03.880> gathered<00:05:04.240> hopefully

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
information that I've gathered hopefully

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.780 
information that I've gathered hopefully
it's<00:05:04.750> accurate<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.550> want<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.610> give<00:05:06.700> a<00:05:06.730> special

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:20.880 
me to test the wands on it was really
tough<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.840> get<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.050> information<00:05:20.170> for<00:05:20.830> the

a hundred percent accurate but it's a
