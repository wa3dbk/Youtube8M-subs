00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:08.260
 good and we are here with this puzzle 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.260
 but with the forms 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.130
 we are to see you 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.660
 he comes in this plastic comes even 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:23.400
 with a with a spare tail of 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 spare and let's see 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.980
 d 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.720
 I do not know 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.660
 and since this is an apple is 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.750
 pretty good we can cheap and really 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 it was everywhere 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 a stage 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.430
 for the intermediate stage and capacity 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.430
 together for 3 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.110
 right the left front back good 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.280
 Well, we can not have any 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:59.170
 mystery apart from this we can see what 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 this has several positions solved 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.000
 you see 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.930
 this is already solved like this is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.630
 solved like this is solved 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.830
 and by with the bottom part the layer of 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.100
 down 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.220
 and with the intermediate layer that passes then 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.880
 that these pieces are and these are 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.390
 same 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 others are the same 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 four of these four are equal 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.840
 others are the same and the centers are also 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.590
 in the world shadings almost almost 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.840
 it could resemble 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.150
 to this one here 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.430
 when we saw it 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.790
 it's worth a lot of pieces 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.790
 same 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.560
 like any position 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 it's a determined position 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.740
 OK 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.649
 then this could be put 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.210
 considered to be the resolution 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.450
 the resolution of this puzzle is very 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.299
 simple very simple because why not 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.469
 because it has no mystery 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.460
 it's a three by three if we know 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.530
 solve 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.450
 this is easy 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.190
 everything is something and we do it in a moment 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.069
 because we already have it here mixed 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.500
 we will have the reference the ass of the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.680
 fruit and the top part with the tail and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.220
 we go 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.190
 have a lot because it is that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.630
 the truth does not deserve the penalty number 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.630
 make our cross 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.850
 magazine here 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.850
 we already have the first 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.700
 I'm going to say that it's very easy 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.239
 here the second are all the same 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.080
 one two three we are missing this one edge 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.080
 that is sunken 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.459
 and it 's all up 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.930
 all these artists like here 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.450
 I can not find the other list 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.150
 and here are the stands 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.569
 to see 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.900
 they are we have the four lists 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:37.340
 now we put the vertices these two already 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.340
 They are by 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.120
 not here 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.560
 here is well put we put the other 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.120
 it's already like everything is fine 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.040
 all the centers coincide towards 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.739
 cheated this center does not match before 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.360
 to continue the layers for down 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.890
 you have to orient the center well and this 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.140
 is well oriented this is fine 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.300
 oriented this is misguided but 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.980
 this does not have any mystery we go down 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.720
 by the capo below we put it well 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.500
 and we already have to be oriented to what 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500
 same with you 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.250
 we already need it 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.099
 and we almost have it done we put this 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.560
 here we take it out the will put in its 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.560
 good site you see that it does not have 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.639
 no way 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.639
 is here 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.509
 I would say here you see 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.070
 we put the usual way 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.600
 not to be confused 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.600
 and it's almost done 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:04.530
 if by any chance we have any 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.930
 piece that was not right here we do 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.310
 as always we will remove a lateral 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.960
 joke because we have many pieces 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.160
 same we can get out especially 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.210
 the one way is to get it out of 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.069
 others 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.889
 but that is that it has no mystery 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.889
 then you are seeing we are now 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:30.780
 we already have two oriented we would be missing 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.780
 these 2 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.270
 these two also oriented 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.710
 once they are all well oriented 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:58.320
 the beings that we lack 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.790
 the vertices here always put 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.040
 we consider how they are all the same 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.580
 they're all fine then you just have to 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.580
 guide them 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.950
 of the 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.310
 or no mystery deals 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.259
 for you to see 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:38.290
 no mystery the cool punch of the cheap 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.290
 and you can buy us we oriented well 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.250
 but good 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.370
 more for the collection than to try 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:53.610
 solve it because 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:57.150
 has no king is already 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.860
 a lot of pieces like this 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.689
 that was also fine but has not 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.229
 no grace 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.860
 I hope you liked it and thanks 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:06.860
 for him
