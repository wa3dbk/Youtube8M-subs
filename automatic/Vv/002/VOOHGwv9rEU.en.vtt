 you as 150 million users in all 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 the safe world that they already use 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.230
 instagram the instagram problem is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.390
 that you can see your photographs from the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 computer but you can not upload them 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.290
 that in this video we're going to show you a 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 tool to upload photographs 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.720
 directly from your computer and without 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.400
 need to have to go through the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 mobile that tool that we're going to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.289
 to teach you today is called great to see is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 difficult to pronounce and you access 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.570
 through the big url see dotcom 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.220
 bloggers in any way we'll leave it at 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 the description of the video is a small 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.309
 program that you have to download but 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.589
 does not require registration or anything by 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.460
 style and it's very simple let's start 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.750
 with the installation process 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.580
 we just put this address 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.080
 and when we access this page this is 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.640
 just a demo we have to go to 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.920
 the bottom left and download 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.540
 the version of the program that we want or 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.090
 either the windows version or the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.010
 version for marc we give you to download and 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.320
 directly we are going to lower the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.100
 program we see how the process begins 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.510
 download the installation is very simple 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 we have it here in the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.560
 desktop is a compressed file 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.380
 they decompress it and you will create this 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.000
 small file and once you have it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.640
 you have the installer you only have 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.890
 double click and go to 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.119
 next and install the program in 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.390
 our case we have installed it in 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.050
 gander and the final result will be this 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.940
 little icon that you have here 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.530
 which is the one that will start the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.110
 application now let's see how 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.640
 the gameplay works let's see that the 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 procedure is very simple we are going to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.940
 start the program we see that it opens 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.440
 this white box and the first thing he does 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.750
 is to ask for our name and our 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.730
 say account account user 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.120
 where we want the photo to be uploaded 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.490
 put your usual password and he 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.350
 it will automatically connect with 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.550
 your account to upload that photograph 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.960
 and we see that the procedure is very 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.930
 simple you just have to choose the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.090
 picture and upload it but it does tell us that 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.730
 instagram needs images that are 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.590
 squares of 650 by 650 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.360
 as a maximum or any other measure but 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.880
 as long as it is square and gives us a 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.380
 small web that very useful to adapt the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.570
 size of our images us 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.090
 we are going to approve it we are going to raise the 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.780
 photography that we want we see that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.340
 our photography is vertical is not 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.590
 square then simply the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.660
 we select the upload and now we are going to 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.820
 give it a square size so that it 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.100
 in instagram we give you to cut image 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.050
 crop image and we will give it a size 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.820
 square for example 400 x 400 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.580
 whenever it is square it will serve us 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.330
 to install us the preview 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.370
 we select what we want 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.349
 appear 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 and once we have it just what 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.760
 let's give it to apply changes 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.620
 we already have here our image will be the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.430
 previous and this larry has stayed and not 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.430
 we are going to download it 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.920
 let's go with our square image 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.959
 let's take the desk so that it 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.579
 see more clearly we will have the original and 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.260
 here we have the square and now we only 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.939
 missing the last step is to upload it to 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.819
 instagram so we re-open 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:17.239
 our program we will choose the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.239
 image 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.569
 and now we are going to look for the photo that we have 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.209
 remembered in this case optimal dogs and 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.260
 let's upload it directly what 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.970
 next that will ask us what 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.530
 next more bay is the text that goes to 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:38.480
 accompany that image 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.480
 for example , awareness campaign 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.220
 for the canine option 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.500
 this is a very curious campaign that 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.730
 we have launched to favor adoption 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:59.180
 canine through codes qr the user 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.640
 scan the qr and if you guess your mobile that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.720
 you will guess it, you can adopt the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.460
 dog because he is very intelligent os 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.480
 we invite you to try it on the web 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.950
 well once we have it written 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.120
 you can use hashtag what you do 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.120
 We always give you to save 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.900
 and directly tells us good this is the 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.750
 link if we want to see the picture 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.660
 or if we want to insert it as code 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.460
 html but the photographs as such already 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.560
 we have rise you want to raise another one 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.210
 you give here that no, you have finished 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.510
 the process and we just need to 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.740
 check that the photo has already been uploaded 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.920
 so we go to our account 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.920
 instagram 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.500
 and the last picture we see as 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.480
 is this with the code that we 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
 we had written by the way I take advantage and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.560
 I invite you to have this code qr 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.580
 so I guess your phone I hope 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.990
 that this tool serves you and that 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.990
 save a lot of time greetings
