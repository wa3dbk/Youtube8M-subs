00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
Tommy Wommack sweet crop is pretty good

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.180 
Tommy Wommack sweet crop is pretty good
this<00:00:03.360> year<00:00:03.419> we<00:00:04.290> started<00:00:04.680> cutting<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.160> a

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
this year we started cutting about a

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.740 
this year we started cutting about a
week<00:00:05.430> ago<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:08.069> crop<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.639> fantastic<00:00:09.540> it's

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
week ago and the crop is fantastic it's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.629 
week ago and the crop is fantastic it's
making<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.410> lot<00:00:10.530> more<00:00:10.559> than<00:00:10.920> he<00:00:11.010> usually<00:00:11.219> does

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
making a lot more than he usually does

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.720 
making a lot more than he usually does
the<00:00:12.450> protein<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.139> high<00:00:13.460> right<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the protein is high right now the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.700 
the protein is high right now the
moisture<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.480> 11<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.230> that's<00:00:16.440> really

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
moisture is about 11 so that's really

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.450 
moisture is about 11 so that's really
dry<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> test<00:00:19.500> weight<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.039> good<00:00:20.279> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
dry and the test weight is good it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.269 
dry and the test weight is good it's
about<00:00:20.580> 60<00:00:21.060> 61<00:00:21.539> pounds<00:00:21.990> per<00:00:22.140> bushel<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:23.010> it

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
about 60 61 pounds per bushel so it

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.490 
about 60 61 pounds per bushel so it
makes<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> high<00:00:23.760> quality<00:00:24.240> wheat<00:00:24.480> yields<00:00:25.380> are

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
makes it high quality wheat yields are

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
makes it high quality wheat yields are

Jay<00:00:42.570> Yates<00:00:42.870> explains<00:00:43.440> why<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.430> had<00:00:44.610> good

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
Jay Yates explains why we had good

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.790 
Jay Yates explains why we had good
weather<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.960> much<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.379> wheat<00:00:46.559> was

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
weather so not much of the wheat was

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.910 
weather so not much of the wheat was
grazed<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.899> abandoned<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.649> that's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
grazed out or or abandoned and so that's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.229 
grazed out or or abandoned and so that's
just<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> mean<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> weight

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just going to mean a lot of weight

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
just going to mean a lot of weight
coming<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.110> started<00:00:52.500> with<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> lot<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.850 
coming in and we started with a lot of
wheat<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> storage<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.789> already<00:00:54.149> had<00:00:54.329> a
