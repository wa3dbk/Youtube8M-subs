about<00:01:42.540> protein<00:01:42.990> powder<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.190> 25

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
about protein powder here is it has 25

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.850 
about protein powder here is it has 25
grams<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.120> protein<00:01:45.479> per<00:01:45.510> serving<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.620> it<00:01:46.710> also

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
grams of protein per serving and it also

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.680 
grams of protein per serving and it also
has<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.640> high<00:01:47.820> amount<00:01:48.120> of<00:01:48.240> branched

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
chain amino acids and glutamine so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.000 
chain amino acids and glutamine so
glutamine<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.140> naturally<00:01:52.860> boost

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010

two<00:03:38.370> grams<00:03:38.609> of<00:03:38.730> fat<00:03:39.000> no<00:03:39.299> grams<00:03:39.600> or<00:03:39.780> sugar<00:03:39.989> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
two grams of fat no grams or sugar is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.660 
two grams of fat no grams or sugar is
seven<00:03:40.530> carbs<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.130> most<00:03:41.370> of

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
seven carbs and most of

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.490 
seven carbs and most of
really<00:03:41.910> it's<00:03:42.480> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> give<00:03:42.870> your<00:03:42.990> body<00:03:43.170> in

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
really it's going to give your body in

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.390 
really it's going to give your body in
abundance<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:44.190> quality<00:03:44.610> amino<00:03:44.849> acids<00:03:45.330> so<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
abundance of quality amino acids so you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.979 
abundance of quality amino acids so you
know<00:03:47.489> when<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.150> buy<00:03:48.360> stuff<00:03:48.630> like<00:03:48.660> this

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
know when you got we buy stuff like this

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.380 
know when you got we buy stuff like this
you<00:03:49.590> can<00:03:49.739> take<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> post-workout<00:03:50.970> it's<00:03:51.239> got

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
you can take a post-workout it's got

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.059 
you can take a post-workout it's got
some<00:03:51.660> class<00:03:51.900> adjusting<00:03:52.440> proteins<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:52.950> can

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
some class adjusting proteins you can

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.140 
some class adjusting proteins you can
take<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.370> even<00:03:53.459> before<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:53.910> go<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> bed

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
take it even before you go to bed

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.580 
take it even before you go to bed
because<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.690> going<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.870> slowly<00:03:55.200> release

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
because it's going to slowly release

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
because it's going to slowly release
these<00:03:56.430> amino<00:03:56.700> acids<00:03:57.209> into<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.540> bloodstream

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
these amino acids into your bloodstream

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.050 
these amino acids into your bloodstream
so<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.860> can<00:03:59.010> really<00:03:59.310> kill<00:03:59.520> two<00:03:59.760> birds<00:03:59.940> with

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
so you can really kill two birds with

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.940 
so you can really kill two birds with
one<00:04:00.270> stone<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.720> use<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.200> post-workout

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
one stone and use just a post-workout

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.380 
one stone and use just a post-workout
and<00:04:02.250> even<00:04:02.430> before<00:04:02.580> we<00:04:02.760> go<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> bed<00:04:03.060> being<00:04:03.360> a

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
and even before we go to bed being a

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.260 
and even before we go to bed being a
naturally<00:04:03.810> skinny<00:04:03.840> guy<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:05.370> MuscleTech<00:04:05.850> phase

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
naturally skinny guy so MuscleTech phase

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.220 
naturally skinny guy so MuscleTech phase
i<00:04:06.480> another<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:07.200> high-quality<00:04:07.410> ingredient

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
i another really high-quality ingredient

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.650 
i another really high-quality ingredient
and<00:04:10.640> last<00:04:11.640> but<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:12.030> least<00:04:12.950> syntha-6<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.880> this

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
butter cookie I mean I've had this stuff

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.790 
butter cookie I mean I've had this stuff
before<00:04:21.450> it<00:04:21.780> literally<00:04:22.049> tastes<00:04:22.470> like<00:04:22.770> a

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
before it literally tastes like a

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.180 
before it literally tastes like a
milkshake<00:04:23.100> so<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:25.380> thing<00:04:25.560> about<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.889> stuff

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
milkshake so the thing about this stuff

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.700 
milkshake so the thing about this stuff
I<00:04:27.090> would<00:04:27.540> only<00:04:27.720> recommend<00:04:27.840> it's<00:04:28.410> like<00:04:28.590> the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
I would only recommend it's like the

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.350 
I would only recommend it's like the
really<00:04:29.100> serious<00:04:29.400> hard<00:04:29.760> gainer<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.180> got<00:04:30.330> a

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
really serious hard gainer it's got a

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.330 
really serious hard gainer it's got a
ton<00:04:30.690> of<00:04:30.720> carbs<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.680> only<00:04:31.770> has<00:04:31.950> two<00:04:32.100> grams

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
ton of carbs in it it only has two grams

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.850 
ton of carbs in it it only has two grams
of<00:04:32.430> sugar<00:04:32.669> but<00:04:33.600> you're<00:04:33.780> looking<00:04:33.990> at<00:04:34.110> about<00:04:34.229> 15

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
of sugar but you're looking at about 15

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.310 
of sugar but you're looking at about 15
carbohydrates<00:04:35.639> per<00:04:35.940> serving<00:04:36.389> so<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:37.169> got<00:04:37.290> a

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
carbohydrates per serving so it's got a

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.440 
carbohydrates per serving so it's got a
lot<00:04:37.530> more<00:04:37.560> carbs<00:04:38.190> but<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.820> know<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> combat

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
lot more carbs but you know the combat

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.090 
lot more carbs but you know the combat
protein<00:04:39.900> powder<00:04:40.139> and<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.440> phase<00:04:40.650> aid<00:04:40.860> whether

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
protein powder and the phase aid whether

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.560 
protein powder and the phase aid whether
it<00:04:41.220> be<00:04:41.370> oh<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.729> guys<00:04:41.820> just<00:04:41.880> started<00:04:42.389> working
