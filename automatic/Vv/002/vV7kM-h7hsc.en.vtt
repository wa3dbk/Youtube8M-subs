00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.590
 I'm in the perfect place 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.180
 Near my position they spend almost 50 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.180
 trails that end right in front 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.480
 among the thickets the antlers are seen 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.190
 shovel shape of the fallow deer that go through 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.190
 here to eat in the green meadows 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.860
 they have a lovely speckled coat and their 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.290
 antlers are unique 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.080
 the deer are incredibly scary 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 if you hunt them with bows a great challenge 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.740
 while they eat in the meadow I see marks 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 huge red deer that with their 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 antlers have destroyed the manu houses that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.370
 there are everywhere in the distance 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.239
 I heard a bellow and I feel the magic that 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.239
 flood this place 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.730
 I'm all miranda 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.570
 and this time I'm hunting with an arc 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 in new zealand 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.050
 it's full of deer tracks and look 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.220
 this 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.220
 these marks start here up 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.600
 it's shattered look up how high 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.060
 around here too 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.420
 and there are more brands in this grove of 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 manu cas 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.430
 that's the way hunting is here 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.200
 there are green meadows where they are going to eat 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.720
 the deer and then the trails lead 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.210
 up to this grove of manu house 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.150
 there are holes marks in the trees like 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 these and my position is located in the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.740
 epicenter in the middle of everything 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.840
 with its reddish fur and its huge antlers 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.870
 the red deer is an animal 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.190
 Awesome 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.130
 slightly smaller than the wapiti of 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.070
 the rocky red deer mates in 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.940
 March is early autumn 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.940
 south of the equator 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.000
 the raucous bellowing of the deer 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.910
 can hear in several kilometers to the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.830
 round when the males call the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.190
 females and try to intimidate their 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190
 opponents 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.090
 I love adventure hunting that guy 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.850
 hunting with bow is the main reason 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.680
 why I'm doing this because I can 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.390
 go to new places to meet people and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.510
 hunt animals that never before had 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.100
 seen the lands of shinkin are close 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.840
 of the river run gitic and where they are fished 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.260
 some of the best new trout 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.760
 zealand not to mention the world if you can 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.560
 go hunting a red deer to new 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.569
 zeland especially in March during the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.630
 will be a unique experience in the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.630
 lifetime 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.390
 bent grew near the river rangeet 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.750
