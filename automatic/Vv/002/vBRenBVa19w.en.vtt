00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
flash tube it is just a workhorse of had

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.529 
flash tube it is just a workhorse of had
it<00:00:45.750> since<00:00:45.899> its<00:00:46.050> new<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.879> I'm<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.300> including

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it since its new and I'm not including

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.119 
it since its new and I'm not including
the<00:00:48.780> transmitter<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.649> doing<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the transmitter I'm just doing that so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
the transmitter I'm just doing that so
you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.340> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.539> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you can kind of you know see that it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.130 
you can kind of you know see that it
does<00:00:51.780> take<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> transmitter<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
does take a transmitter and it's really

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
does take a transmitter and it's really
bright<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.739> it'll<00:00:56.309> really<00:00:56.670> fire<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> off<00:00:57.329> fast

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
bright and it'll really fire it off fast

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
bright and it'll really fire it off fast
so<00:00:59.420> that's<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> lower<00:01:01.020> mode<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> can

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so that's in the lower mode and you can

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.870 
so that's in the lower mode and you can
do<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> model<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.690> without<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> model<00:01:04.500> light<00:01:04.880> up

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
do a model or without the model light up

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
do a model or without the model light up
to<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> I'll<00:01:07.409> show<00:01:07.590> some

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to you so that's that I'll show some

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
to you so that's that I'll show some
close-ups<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.280> both<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> minute<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
close-ups of both these a minute this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.820 
close-ups of both these a minute this
here<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.740> if

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
here is that this would go with it if

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140 
here is that this would go with it if
you<00:01:10.920> wanted<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.850> provide

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
you wanted to you or you provide

you wanted to you or you provide
separate<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> Larsson<00:01:13.740> 4x6<00:01:14.549> softbox

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
separate this is the Larsson 4x6 softbox

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
separate this is the Larsson 4x6 softbox
believe<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.710> would<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:17.330> $827<00:01:18.330> new

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
believe it or not this would be $827 new

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
believe it or not this would be $827 new
if<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.869> bought<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> bracket<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.520> box

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
if you bought the bracket and the box

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.620 
if you bought the bracket and the box
and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.600> speed<00:01:21.869> ring<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> box<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and the speed ring so just the box is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.410 
and the speed ring so just the box is
700<00:01:25.140> normally<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.070> works<00:01:26.280> great<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.060> fill

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
700 normally so it works great as a fill

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
700 normally so it works great as a fill
light<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:27.869> main<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:29.070> can<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> vignette

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
light or main you can kind of vignette

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
light or main you can kind of vignette
it<00:01:30.000> off<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.509> I'll<00:01:31.079> try<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.680> images<00:01:32.009> we've

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it off and I'll try so some images we've

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
it off and I'll try so some images we've
done<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.750> also<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.350> sitting

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
done with that this also is just sitting

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.880 
done with that this also is just sitting
around<00:01:34.829> I'm<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.880> oh<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.650> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
around I'm not using it oh but it is it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.830 
around I'm not using it oh but it is it
is<00:01:38.040> great<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.700> creating<00:01:38.880> window<00:01:39.390> light<00:01:39.600> on

remember how I got that on there but I
must<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.460> rubbed<00:02:59.610> against<00:02:59.910> something<00:03:00.120> we

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
must have rubbed against something we

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.210 
must have rubbed against something we
were<00:03:00.480> painting<00:03:01.050> our<00:03:01.200> studio<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.980> while

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
were painting our studio I think a while

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
were painting our studio I think a while
back<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.970> has<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> little<00:03:03.630> hole<00:03:03.840> here<00:03:03.870> where

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
back and it has a little hole here where

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.190 
back and it has a little hole here where
it<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.590> of<00:03:04.740> alignment<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.610> time<00:03:05.900> but<00:03:06.900> it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
it got out of alignment one time but it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.480 
it got out of alignment one time but it
is<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.590> correct<00:03:07.770> hole<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.190> everything's

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
is in the correct hole and everything's

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.850 
is in the correct hole and everything's
holding<00:03:08.730> on<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.300> again<00:03:10.200> there<00:03:10.410> was<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> speed

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
holding on that again there was a speed

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.030 
holding on that again there was a speed
ring<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.220> everything<00:03:11.460> to<00:03:11.550> turn<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.850> around

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
ring and everything to turn it around

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.310 
ring and everything to turn it around
and<00:03:14.040> everything<00:03:14.430> works<00:03:14.610> fine<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:19.200> is

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and everything works fine and it is

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.900 
and everything works fine and it is
fairly<00:03:19.590> easy<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:20.040> put<00:03:20.220> together<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.760> take

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
fairly easy to put together and take

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.690 
fairly easy to put together and take
apart<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:22.709> just<00:03:22.890> have<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.130> know<00:03:23.250> how<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.430> do<00:03:23.610> it

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
apart you just have to know how to do it

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.760 
apart you just have to know how to do it
correctly<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.810> put<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> two<00:03:25.680> of

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
correctly and you just put the two of

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.440 
correctly and you just put the two of
the<00:03:25.860> top<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> two<00:03:27.330> at<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
the top up and then the two at the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.630 
the top up and then the two at the
bottom<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:28.680> box<00:03:28.920> itself<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:31.340> $700<00:03:32.340> from

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
bottom the box itself is is $700 from

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.130 
bottom the box itself is is $700 from
Larson<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:35.840> large<00:03:36.840> bracket<00:03:37.650> is<00:03:39.140> 80
