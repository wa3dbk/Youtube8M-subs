pieces of news in one video so first of

pieces of news in one video so first of
all<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.580> more<00:00:11.730> obvious<00:00:11.880> piece<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> fact

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
all the more obvious piece is the fact

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.450 
all the more obvious piece is the fact
that<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.840> Greek<00:00:13.170> mythology<00:00:13.349> Masha<00:00:13.950> pack<00:00:14.190> has

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
that the Greek mythology Masha pack has

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.980 
that the Greek mythology Masha pack has
now<00:00:14.730> released<00:00:14.969> that's<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.870> me

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
now released that's where you see me

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.300 
now released that's where you see me
play<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> background<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.100> I'll<00:00:17.220> be

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
play in the background and I'll be

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.230 
play in the background and I'll be
showing<00:00:17.430> off<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> lot<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> cool<00:00:18.060> things

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
showing off a lot of the cool things

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880 
showing off a lot of the cool things
about<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.600> but<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.170> opinion<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
about it but in my opinion this is

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.620 
about it but in my opinion this is
probably<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> best<00:00:20.760> masher<00:00:21.150> pack<00:00:21.330> we've<00:00:21.480> had

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
probably the best masher pack we've had

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.849 
probably the best masher pack we've had
yet<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.080> only<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.830> know

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
yet not only because it's you know

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.109 
yet not only because it's you know
slightly<00:00:23.310> cheaper<00:00:23.490> than<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> other<00:00:23.850> ones<00:00:24.000> but

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
slightly cheaper than the other ones but

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.609 
slightly cheaper than the other ones but
also<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> fact<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.380> it's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
also because of the fact that it's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
also because of the fact that it's
probably<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.099> biggest<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> best<00:00:26.970> masher

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
probably the biggest and best masher

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
probably the biggest and best masher
plank<00:00:27.570> well<00:00:27.750> combined<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> an<00:00:28.619> amazing<00:00:29.039> thing

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
plank well combined of an amazing thing

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.589

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
something good to see but as well as

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
something good to see but as well as
that<00:00:35.670> we<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.660> fact<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that we also have the fact that the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.440 
that we also have the fact that the
Tyler<00:00:38.129> blade<00:00:38.309> 27<00:00:38.820> released<00:00:39.059> wither<00:00:39.270> and

Tyler blade 27 released wither and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.790 
Tyler blade 27 released wither and
usually<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> release<00:00:40.770> the

usually this is just to release the
trial<00:00:41.160> content<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> new<00:00:41.879> piece<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> DLC<00:00:42.360> but

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

sorts of things which i think is they're
pretty<00:01:21.840> interesting<00:01:22.080> em<00:01:22.380> pretty<00:01:22.650> cool<00:01:22.770> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
pretty interesting em pretty cool so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
pretty interesting em pretty cool so
obviously<00:01:23.310> half<00:01:23.490> slabs<00:01:23.759> anything<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> can

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
obviously half slabs anything you can

make<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> wood<00:01:24.960> basically<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.560> have

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
make from the wood basically you have

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.730

new<00:02:30.040> features<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.550> creative<00:02:30.880> only<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.450> they

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
new features but creative only but they

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.300 
new features but creative only but they
make<00:02:31.810> very<00:02:32.170> strong<00:02:32.260> hints<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.890> new<00:02:33.040> biomes

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
make very strong hints to new biomes

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.620 
make very strong hints to new biomes
coming<00:02:33.610> because<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.970> course<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.360> anyway<00:02:34.570> to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
coming because of course the anyway to

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.480 
coming because of course the anyway to
get<00:02:34.840> these<00:02:34.960> new<00:02:35.140> biomes<00:02:35.440> would<00:02:35.620> be<00:02:35.830> with<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
get these new biomes would be with the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.700 
get these new biomes would be with the
thing<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.000> yeah<00:02:37.420> that's<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.690> but<00:02:37.990> moving<00:02:38.590> on

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
thing so yeah that's that but moving on

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.650 
thing so yeah that's that but moving on
to<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> Greek<00:02:39.130> mythology<00:02:39.610> mashup<00:02:39.940> pack<00:02:40.150> which

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
by the way it's out but uh from what I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.040 
by the way it's out but uh from what I
can<00:02:42.790> tell<00:02:42.850> it's<00:02:43.120> having<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.840> can't

that's I'm playing the world just in

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.240 
that's I'm playing the world just in
case<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.870> can't<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:56.620> yeah<00:02:56.740> so<00:02:56.890> let's<00:02:57.070> talk

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
about what's going on here so you might

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.630 
about what's going on here so you might
have<00:02:58.870> noticed<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.100> big<00:03:00.370> big

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
have noticed this is like a big big

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400 
have noticed this is like a big big
world<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.030> old-school<00:03:01.270> stuff<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:02.230> is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
world of old-school stuff this is

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.960 
world of old-school stuff this is
probably<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.770> coolest<00:03:02.980> mashup<00:03:03.430> a<00:03:03.550> cure<00:03:03.790> and

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
probably the coolest mashup a cure and

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.990 
probably the coolest mashup a cure and
the<00:03:04.090> reason<00:03:04.480> I'm<00:03:04.660> saying<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.290> because<00:03:05.320> uh

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the reason I'm saying this is because uh

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.250 
the reason I'm saying this is because uh
basically<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.480> know<00:03:07.600> they<00:03:07.720> spent<00:03:07.990> a<00:03:08.050> lot<00:03:08.230> of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
basically you know they spent a lot of

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.930 
basically you know they spent a lot of
time<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.070> whole<00:03:09.250> map<00:03:09.490> is<00:03:09.670> covered

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
time it's just the whole map is covered

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.130 
time it's just the whole map is covered
in<00:03:10.000> builds<00:03:10.270> because<00:03:10.360> what<00:03:10.570> they<00:03:10.660> did<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:10.960> they

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
in builds because what they did is they

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720 
in builds because what they did is they
took<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.470> map<00:03:11.740> of<00:03:11.860> Athens<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:12.610> they

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
took a map of Athens and then they

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.550 
took a map of Athens and then they
conversed<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> Minecraft<00:03:13.900> Xbox<00:03:14.020> 60

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
conversed it for a Minecraft Xbox 60

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.380 
conversed it for a Minecraft Xbox 60
world<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.460> they<00:03:15.640> filled<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> things

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
world and then they filled the things

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.300 
world and then they filled the things
with<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.720> cool<00:03:17.170> Greek<00:03:17.500> stuff<00:03:17.770> so<00:03:17.980> you<00:03:18.250> know

liked Spode any v myself so I might do a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.479 
liked Spode any v myself so I might do a
stream<00:03:41.620> if<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.830> later<00:03:42.010> if<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.190> want<00:03:42.370> but

pretty cool tech pack in general because

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.540 
pretty cool tech pack in general because
if<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> know<00:04:08.590> all<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.860> new<00:04:08.980> texture<00:04:09.340> blocks

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
if you know all the new texture blocks

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.130 
if you know all the new texture blocks
it<00:04:09.670> brings<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:10.000> including<00:04:10.600> like<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.930> fact

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
it brings in including like the fact

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.750 
it brings in including like the fact
that<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.380> extend<00:04:11.739> clay<00:04:11.950> looks<00:04:12.190> a<00:04:12.310> lot<00:04:12.580> like

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
that the extend clay looks a lot like

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.190 
that the extend clay looks a lot like
Chris<00:04:13.060> Murray<00:04:13.269> so<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.690> make<00:04:13.780> cool<00:04:13.959> stuff

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
Chris Murray so you can make cool stuff

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.009 
Chris Murray so you can make cool stuff
like<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.560> I<00:04:14.950> think<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.810> measure

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
like this I think it's a it's a measure

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.229 
like this I think it's a it's a measure
pack<00:04:17.290> worth<00:04:17.500> remembering<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:18.760> far<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
pack worth remembering and so far the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.969 
pack worth remembering and so far the
best<00:04:19.390> one<00:04:19.510> yet<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.900> assuming<00:04:20.530> they<00:04:20.620> mentioned

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
best one yet but assuming they mentioned

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.529 
best one yet but assuming they mentioned
Minecon<00:04:21.669> is<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:21.970> they've<00:04:22.240> always<00:04:22.419> been

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
Minecon is like they've always been

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.150 
Minecon is like they've always been
trying<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:22.960> make<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.350> most<00:04:23.710> recent<00:04:23.979> one<00:04:24.070> the

I'll<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> full<00:04:28.479> review<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.169> texture

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
I'll have a full review of this texture

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.350 
I'll have a full review of this texture
pack<00:04:29.500> coming<00:04:29.919> out<00:04:30.009> at<00:04:30.099> some<00:04:30.340> point<00:04:30.639> after<00:04:30.819> the

what I've seen step off my few critter

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.640 
what I've seen step off my few critter
overs<00:04:40.360> there's<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.780> lot<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.080> pretty<00:04:41.259> cool<00:04:41.440> stuff

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
overs there's a lot of pretty cool stuff

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.260 
overs there's a lot of pretty cool stuff
I<00:04:41.770> did<00:04:41.919> play<00:04:42.069> this<00:04:42.220> map<00:04:42.610> for<00:04:42.729> about<00:04:42.879> half<00:04:43.120> an

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
I did play this map for about half an

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.790 
I did play this map for about half an
hour<00:04:43.389> again<00:04:43.659> no<00:04:43.840> spoiling<00:04:44.139> with<00:04:44.229> music<00:04:44.560> at

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
hour again no spoiling with music at

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.129 
hour again no spoiling with music at
Minecon<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:46.569> seems<00:04:46.900> like<00:04:47.020> they've

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
Minecon and it seems like they've

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.240 
Minecon and it seems like they've
actually<00:04:47.259> added<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.650> couple<00:04:47.860> things<00:04:48.009> since

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
actually added a couple things since

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.219 
actually added a couple things since
then<00:04:48.460> which<00:04:48.610> is<00:04:48.639> really<00:04:48.970> cool<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.300> as<00:04:49.840> well<00:04:50.139> as

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
then which is really cool and as well as

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.170 
then which is really cool and as well as
that<00:04:50.440> there's<00:04:50.710> just<00:04:51.220> some<00:04:51.520> mind-blowing

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
that there's just some mind-blowing

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.999 
that there's just some mind-blowing
things<00:04:52.389> discovering<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.349> I<00:04:53.530> think

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
things discovering this that I think

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.559 
things discovering this that I think
it's<00:04:54.250> definitely<00:04:54.490> worth<00:04:54.699> checking<00:04:55.000> out<00:04:55.389> so

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
it's definitely worth checking out so

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.719 
it's definitely worth checking out so
yeah<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.199> great<00:04:56.620> survival<00:04:56.979> time<00:04:57.280> exploration

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
yeah a great survival time exploration

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.760 
yeah a great survival time exploration
like<00:04:57.879> what's<00:04:58.030> down<00:04:58.180> here<00:04:58.449> oh<00:04:58.599> it's<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.620> secret
