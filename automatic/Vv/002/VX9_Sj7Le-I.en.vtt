shadows<00:00:44.230> random<00:00:44.920> colors<00:00:45.250> didn't<00:00:45.610> really<00:00:45.790> even

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
shadows random colors didn't really even

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.540 
shadows random colors didn't really even
color-coded<00:00:48.610> or<00:00:49.059> anything<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.190> can<00:00:51.280> see

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
color-coded or anything as you can see

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.580 
color-coded or anything as you can see
they<00:00:52.480> do<00:00:52.540> stay<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:54.430> use<00:00:55.059> magnets<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:56.050> glue

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
they do stay and I use magnets and glue

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.140 
they do stay and I use magnets and glue
because<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.070> magnets<00:00:57.460> weren't<00:00:57.700> holding<00:00:57.910> onto

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
because the magnets weren't holding onto

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.049 
because the magnets weren't holding onto
the<00:00:58.330> pans<00:00:58.540> very<00:00:58.809> well<00:00:59.190> but<00:01:00.190> anyway<00:01:00.550> that<00:01:01.030> was

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
the pans very well but anyway that was

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.070 
the pans very well but anyway that was
the<00:01:01.210> idea<00:01:01.330> from<00:01:02.820> YouTube<00:01:04.560> ok<00:01:05.560> after<00:01:05.860> that<00:01:06.310> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the idea from YouTube ok after that I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130 
the idea from YouTube ok after that I
had<00:01:09.090> seen<00:01:10.090> this<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.540> kind<00:01:10.659> of<00:01:10.810> thought<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.080> a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
had seen this and kind of thought of a

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.200 
had seen this and kind of thought of a
palette<00:01:11.500> it's<00:01:11.680> really<00:01:12.130> small<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:12.940> don't

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
palette it's really small so I don't

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.850 
palette it's really small so I don't
know<00:01:13.330> if<00:01:13.450> you'll<00:01:13.630> think<00:01:14.050> it'll<00:01:14.290> work<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:14.680> you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
know if you'll think it'll work for you

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.880 
know if you'll think it'll work for you
it's<00:01:15.100> not<00:01:15.280> as<00:01:15.430> big<00:01:15.460> as<00:01:15.790> those<00:01:16.030> shadows<00:01:16.890> but

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
it's not as big as those shadows but

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.140 
it's not as big as those shadows but
it's<00:01:18.040> really<00:01:18.250> good<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.520> put<00:01:18.730> your<00:01:18.850> purse<00:01:19.120> and
