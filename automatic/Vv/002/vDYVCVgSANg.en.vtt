00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
in the late 60s officials had developed

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.740 
in the late 60s officials had developed
a<00:01:22.920> technique<00:01:23.280> called<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> pod<00:01:23.939> mark<00:01:24.240> census

a technique called the pod mark census

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.429 
a technique called the pod mark census
which<00:01:25.380> involved<00:01:25.820> tracing<00:01:26.820> tracks<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.810> Tigers

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
which involved tracing tracks of Tigers

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.640 
which involved tracing tracks of Tigers
and<00:01:28.680> trying<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.720> recognize<00:01:30.720> each<00:01:31.170> track

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and trying to recognize each track

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.179 
and trying to recognize each track
uniquely<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> doing<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.720> total<00:01:34.140> count<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
uniquely and doing it total count I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.090 
uniquely and doing it total count I
tested<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.780> field<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.590> zoos<00:01:37.829> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
tested this in the field and in zoos it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
tested this in the field and in zoos it
didn't<00:01:38.400> work<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:40.020> critical<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
didn't work so I was very critical of it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.190 
didn't work so I was very critical of it
and<00:01:41.189> they<00:01:41.340> were<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.850> very<00:01:42.329> unhappy<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.990> my

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and they were one very unhappy with my

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
and they were one very unhappy with my
criticism<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> pugmark<00:01:44.610> sensors<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
criticism of the pugmark sensors but I

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
criticism of the pugmark sensors but I
also<00:01:45.869> said<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> need<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.770> develop<00:01:47.189> something

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
also said I need to develop something

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.380 
also said I need to develop something
that's<00:01:47.670> better

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's better

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
that's better
criticizing<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.320> bad<00:01:49.500> method<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.070> okay<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.579> how

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
criticizing a bad method is okay but how

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
criticizing a bad method is okay but how
about<00:01:50.790> coming<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:55.219> the

about coming up with a good one the

as samples from a population and using
some<00:02:35.730> statistical<00:02:36.660> modeling<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.010> cannot

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
some statistical modeling you cannot

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.430 
some statistical modeling you cannot
just<00:02:38.700> say<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.970> got<00:02:39.120> 10<00:02:39.600> Tigers<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.290> say<00:02:40.410> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
just say I got 10 Tigers you can say I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.290 
just say I got 10 Tigers you can say I
got<00:02:40.530> 50<00:02:41.010> percent<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.610> Tigers<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.120> are

got 50 percent of the Tigers that are
out<00:02:42.450> there<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.870> suddenly<00:02:43.320> you<00:02:43.440> had<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.620> method

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
out there so suddenly you had a method

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.740 
out there so suddenly you had a method
