00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 however, my name is jannik 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.029
 porsche i am state runner out 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.770
 bonn and this video is about the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.770
 length of the single stroke 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.750
 table tennis helmet donka miteva how long 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.790
 should be our movement at all 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.700
 there is actually a basic rule 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.790
 you on all our punching techniques 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:32.210
 table tennis can reflect first 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:34.370
 rule short wave means over at the table 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.170
 Cases are mainly from the 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.220
 this is for example played 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:44.049
 when the flip or the head of the case 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.610
 comes from the attack second rule 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:49.129
 Offer to come to the baseline 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.290
 you'll use the wrist and the 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.979
 forearm, for example, plays in 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.150
 block or easy topspin 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:01:00.140
 number three you can already 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.869
 Think wave behind the table 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.990
 with the wrist the forearm the 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.880
 whole arm and the necessary use of the body 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.010
 played for example at the top spin 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.549
 Let's throw ourselves right is one 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.979
 move very long or even forehand 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.040
 Supporters of a long move that 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.050
 Can I be such a movement if you 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 that compares times we all go 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.360
 balls that are close to the net become shorter 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.110
 and as soon as you are further away from the table 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.240
 I will make the movement longer 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.710
 synonymous already made another video there 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.960
 I go to all the individual 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.060
 Also suggest and compare the 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.440
 together and the length of it there 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.030
 I have a nice graphic for you 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.980
 made that if I have you one here 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 yes, here we now see about the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.040
 addressed graphic and that is about 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.840
 the movement on the circumference of the individual 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.170
 Beat Techniques Number one is the trip 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 and the pushed front of the net is one 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.030
 very short movement nevertheless longer than 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.280
 the passive block was number two here 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.050
 because with the passive blog we balm 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 actually do very little and only 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.569
 the incoming energy record number 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.250
 Three is a bit longer then 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.379
 Although this is the counter or the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.040
 spin block the case of the gem already active 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.620
 in the forearm rhine and on the wrist 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.569
 since followed by topspin or 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.060
 cut defense 4.4 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.650
 So we use already the hip 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.099
 the shoulder joint and use it so 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 also the energy of the body number five 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.849
 is now off the table the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.829
 long balloon defense or the lady 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.959
 derogatory where we definitely have one 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.989
 very long movement have because we also 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.480
 have the necessary time because far 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 but behind the table is you see 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 the perpetrators of this rule the closer you get 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 At the table comes that movement 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.769
 get shorter and farther away from the table 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.139
 be longer displays this graph on 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.329
 Of course there is always room for maneuver 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.639
 individuality but it is one 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.150
 principle that should help you 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.620
 this is a general rule that does not apply 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 just for the ones I have put forward more 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.750
 raich shown but also in the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.879
 Back of the Belgian at the table wrist 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.120
 at the baseline wrist and 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.840
 forearm and behind the behind the table 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.879
 from the whole body 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.489
 if ye these brisk so more the 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.769
 the closer to the net since that the 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.879
 then you need to be able to get shorter 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.459
 you too that in your own 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.799
 include error correction with me 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.120
 many players know for example the 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.400
 are far behind the table 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.049
 and then make a very short movement 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.750
 find the really effective the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.440
 whole body success or the other 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.709
 extreme 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.780
 There are players here who wave to the 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.049
 want to go over the table and at the same time 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.230
 how to look out from behind and the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.360
 whole body with 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.760
 want to stop that's all nice and 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.099
 good and if you are early enough works 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.900
 but also by the fact that you the 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.360
 whole body lust and also the whole 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.310
 poor also that very much time and what 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.890
 which happens soon in this time 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.290
 and probably plays the ball 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.480
 too late and the errors produced 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.120
 but that is due to that 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.639
 simply not this principle 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.709
 that was applied just at the table 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.049
 must be more short and mainly 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.370
 from the hand luggage 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.199
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.449
