00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.469
 we are going there caruso grivko winning 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:16.880
 tenors at all his effort in this little 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.880
 game of wedding rings and she will return 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.650
 and at the loire between it would have to see 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.520
 where is the body that was in contract 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.689
 behind her something 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.470
 radioshack training because he 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.230
 can put everyone in agreement 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.970
 you are right kreuziger hesjedal this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.930
 are gaps are very small even 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.230
 very weak 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.580
 I think a snowdrifts and do not forget 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 after cover there are still 10 800 m 1 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.000
 yeah but I prefer to be in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 situation for the moment chosen for a 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.909
 gilbert maybe it's not better 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.400
 to have guys in front of them to leave them to 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.900
 15.1 earnings of our rigor and ch'ti 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.299
 in the skies of al wahda hesjedal 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.159
 yes but it's not so gilbert can 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.449
 take 15 or 20 m to its range 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.710
 it may be better to have guys 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.239
 there guys who can beat him in sprint 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.129
 before I count I understand what 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.510
 come but if you put in hollow 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.799
 of yesterday who knows how to climb in national which 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.000
 come on a huge effort but who 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.670
 knows how to climb that rolls pretty well against the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.900
 chrono that in the 1800 m they are 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.900
 able to agree 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 and 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.860
 after chess party for the moment for 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.860
 everyone and c max no it's benign 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.300
 it's good for the bnrm years like that in 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.870
 rub shoulders with this is very encouraging for 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.810
 the next classical classic 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:43.510
 Wednesday and Sunday Walloon 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.140
 so here's valerian trapping at the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.090
 tension we will not be able too much 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.350
 look at the favorites so it's 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 rigor was created sensation 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
 if it was the arrival last year I 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.010
 think he practiced to win nothing 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:07.300
 but that's not the case then 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.220
 columnist alone in front of five riders 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.840
 second 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.160
 it seems to you me I think that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.930
 trezeguet distributed to fetch 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.490
 the victory has el balah and marne 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.680
 does 30 seconds 28 seconds for 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.689
 hermans 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.000
 the tone will arrive but with 35 40 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.129
 seconds here is the pack 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.900
 you really have to blow everything 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.209
 a rubio alarm clock can not wait until 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.530
 can wait it's obvious so where 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.969
 are the leaders where are the favorites 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.099
 are there they were taking away I think that 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.730
 it is a Gilbert crewman who launched 13 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.139
 iyer ahead of the race that falters 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.260
 I do not think it's for a few 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.769
 have put a layer behind but 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.290
 the gap is important 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:51.219
 the gap is important and it's caruso 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.329
 what was caruso out and now and 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:59.049
 then ortho qu with axle dal vivo 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.530
 are there and it comes out gilbert released 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.419
 jerks 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.040
 he dropped his catch father went away all 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:05.620
 alone and he returns well gilbert tidy up to 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.540
 bastia queyras and this four corners and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.829
 the four corners as she turkey 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.139
 I also went to the block 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.650
 valverde come back i'm going with sagan or 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.989
 there one that's 2011 and 2010 when jp2 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.639
 a world champion who accelerates who 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.049
 repeat everyone will speak to the crucible 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:22.329
 will fall off bouhlal almost knocked 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.560
 Gilbert and Erik Gerets and Valverde 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.000
 these are the two senses that can 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.650
 try to hang on at it will be able to say 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.060
 Referees sprint it goes fast we 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.430
 puts all three all three 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 worry managers there gilbert the most 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.449
 cowards and others at the championship of 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.019
 world but he will not let it cayrade 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.400
 it's valverde 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.360
 they are coming back now perhaps 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.310
 ya corner in front of enough 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.490
 cosyga so they'll have to agree to 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.170
 three- way the hive dig in the lead and 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.550
 then the trio gilbert guerin dit gerard 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.880
 his sales of both are limit breaking 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.320
 I do not describe too much 4 m us 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.460
 will take the time that we finish 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.680
 sites gilbert what does he have to do 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.790
 what he has to do he puts back 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.170
 another layer too much rigor then is 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.330
 the ideal would have been to gilbert 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.860
 can come back on dig eager is 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.209
 then to be able to roll both 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.950
 is not there three figures that holds 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.860
 and gilbert is going to have to stuff himself 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.680
 probably queyras and and valverde there 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.730
 ten seconds ago still a cairote 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.750
 would like me to make passes 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.790
 and since these bandits this same larded 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.959
 falls on haiti it's a gift on the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.959
 Somalia did not want the glass of water 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.520
 wandering desimone and he'll have to 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.040
 go search in the last 400 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.890
 meters dug girl the vendetta valverde 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.980
 value went from returning to the flame 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.980
 red 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.620
 the good it duck to the wind three 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.550
 quarter back a sagan was not able 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.550
 to do it no 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.340
 and I wonder if kruger will go 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.750
 win the amstel gold race 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.750
 in the manner of the suspect in the league 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.950
 of the world here it is gibert little shot 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.960
 look hoist not go get that 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.590
 the envied is not returned he can not 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.870
 get it back with valverde g 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.510
 that's the chance to dig there 10 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.070
 seconds 10 seconds 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:13.040
 their only chance is to collaborate 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:16.500
 rival wave annie kriegel he will win 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.430
 amazing we'll see the first 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.330
 victory in a classic for crazy 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.460
 heart we had the Russian ivan of console 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:31.680
 victory of a runner from the Eastern Bloc 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:35.600
 in 2009 we were waiting for a Slovak we are going 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.600
 see to cicc of his income 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.639
 romande digger hours which will have in 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.550
 it's years old on may 8th 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:49.210
 in the man who grew up in 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.889
 pilsen and this for an attempt are 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.509
 behind except sagan of el callao 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.379
 what mattered was a great first 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.110
 for this country 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:06:01.090
 for him for the contador team because 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:07.060
 that there the spin 4 is to come back for a 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:08.650
 podium maybe not come back gilbert 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.940
 who in this sprint to try when 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.690
 even to make applaud with valverde 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.830
 in the wheel the world champion to block 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:22.960
 gilbert built will not tell them 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:24.909
 name is to take away for him a statement 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.900
 Gilbert was the sturdiest in the 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:32.080
 trade that's obvious but 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.819
 anticipation where for example 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.620
 rolling is not successful in the tour 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:42.900
 anticipation fleas to pay and 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.900
 workers victory got bored
