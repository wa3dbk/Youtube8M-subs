00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
is very very well supported so it

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
is very very well supported so it
doesn't<00:01:16.470> matter<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:16.920> heavy<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.460> quilt<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
it's easy to move across the table but

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
it's easy to move across the table but
at<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.979> same<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:29.579> when<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.509> actually

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
the front edge you can put it all the
way<00:01:40.020> around<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.680> choose<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.520> don't

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
way around if you choose but I don't

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.450 
way around if you choose but I don't
find<00:01:42.060> any<00:01:42.299> need<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
find any need to do that so now that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.350 
find any need to do that so now that
once<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:46.759> it's<00:01:47.759> quite<00:01:48.000> difficult

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
once that's on it's it's quite difficult

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
once that's on it's it's quite difficult
to<00:01:48.689> move<00:01:48.930> across<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.829> had<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> around<00:01:50.430> all

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
to move across if you had it around all

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.670 
to move across if you had it around all
of<00:01:50.759> them<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.810> wouldn't<00:01:51.990> be<00:01:52.170> able<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> murder

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
of them you wouldn't be able to murder

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.550 
of them you wouldn't be able to murder
but<00:01:53.579> when<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> take<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.270> out<00:01:54.450> when<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> need

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
but when you take it out when you need

over<00:02:03.530> now<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.399> pattern<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.969> I've

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
over now is this pattern that I've

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.169 
over now is this pattern that I've
created<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:07.439> we

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
created there we

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.860 
created there we
moment<00:02:09.579> it<00:02:10.579> was<00:02:10.789> pattern<00:02:11.239> that<00:02:11.390> I've<00:02:11.540> created

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
moment it was pattern that I've created

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.699 
moment it was pattern that I've created
I<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:13.310> written<00:02:13.939> this<00:02:14.209> pattern<00:02:14.989> ebook<00:02:15.409> it

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
I have written this pattern ebook it

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.890 
I have written this pattern ebook it
tells<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.609> all<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.090> steps<00:02:17.329> of<00:02:17.569> all<00:02:17.719> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
tells you all the steps of all the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.319 
tells you all the steps of all the
things<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.409> need<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.829> do<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:20.060> talked

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
things that you need to do it I talked

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.390 
things that you need to do it I talked
about<00:02:20.359> the<00:02:20.689> size<00:02:20.930> screws<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.500> need<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:22.159> size

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
about the size screws you need the size

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.220 
about the size screws you need the size
timber<00:02:22.969> the<00:02:23.510> type<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:23.810> timber<00:02:24.469> how<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.400> get

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
timber the type of timber how to get

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.569 
timber the type of timber how to get
your<00:02:27.230> table<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.769> right<00:02:27.950> height

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
your table the right height

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.250 
your table the right height
I'll<00:02:28.969> just<00:02:29.150> call<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.359> machine<00:02:29.780> duck<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:29.989> bit

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
I'll just call that machine duck a bit

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.229 
I'll just call that machine duck a bit
how<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.769> get<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.189> table<00:02:31.639> the<00:02:31.939> right<00:02:32.150> height<00:02:32.709> so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
how to get the table the right height so

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.660 
how to get the table the right height so
so<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.389> extension<00:02:36.049> table<00:02:36.230> fits<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.459> right

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
so the extension table fits the right

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.659 
so the extension table fits the right
height<00:02:37.939> around<00:02:38.239> your<00:02:39.079> table<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.739> also<00:02:40.340> talked

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:40.669 
height around your table I also talked

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.509 
height around your table I also talked
about<00:02:40.939> how<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> get<00:02:41.569> this<00:02:42.019> table<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:43.099> fit<00:02:43.310> your

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
about how to get this table to fit your

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.119 
about how to get this table to fit your
particular<00:02:43.849> sewing<00:02:44.569> machine<00:02:44.930> because<00:02:45.799> as<00:02:45.950> we

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
particular sewing machine because as we

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.640 
particular sewing machine because as we
all<00:02:46.280> realize<00:02:46.790> every<00:02:47.510> machine<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:48.109> going<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.470> be

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
all realize every machine is going to be

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.789 
all realize every machine is going to be
very<00:02:48.889> different<00:02:49.220> here<00:02:49.669> I<00:02:50.109> also<00:02:51.109> talked<00:02:51.530> about

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
very different here I also talked about

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.069 
very different here I also talked about
what<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.010> need<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.430> do<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.879> edges<00:02:53.540> of<00:02:53.750> this

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
glide over that now when you print this

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.309 
glide over that now when you print this
pattern<00:03:08.900> out<00:03:10.419> obviously<00:03:11.419> it's<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:11.659> in<00:03:11.810> a4

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
pattern out obviously it's all in a4

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.399 
pattern out obviously it's all in a4
unless<00:03:13.010> you've<00:03:13.159> got<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.280> very<00:03:13.489> clever<00:03:13.790> computer

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
unless you've got a very clever computer

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.119 
unless you've got a very clever computer
now<00:03:15.409> these<00:03:16.340> are<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.639> actual<00:03:17.180> pattern<00:03:17.629> sheets

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
now these are the actual pattern sheets

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.300 
now these are the actual pattern sheets
so<00:03:19.129> these<00:03:20.090> are<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.419> same<00:03:20.629> size<00:03:21.019> that's<00:03:21.949> what

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
so these are the same size that's what

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.750 
so these are the same size that's what
this<00:03:22.489> particular<00:03:22.699> table<00:03:23.269> top<00:03:23.659> is<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.609> one

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
this particular table top is so that one

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.640 
this particular table top is so that one
there<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.209> for<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.540> face<00:03:26.750> and<00:03:27.049> shows<00:03:27.470> you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
there is for the face and shows you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.199 
there is for the face and shows you

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
supporting strips go this one is all at

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.509 
supporting strips go this one is all at
the<00:03:32.090> top<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.810> shows<00:03:33.169> you<00:03:33.379> where<00:03:33.560> all<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.769> screw

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
the top it shows you where all the screw

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.089 
the top it shows you where all the screw
holes<00:03:34.819> need<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.180> go<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:36.019> actual<00:03:36.379> size<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.979> the

light it's very easy for me to manage

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.809 
light it's very easy for me to manage
and<00:04:00.709> maneuver<00:04:01.129> it<00:04:01.280> around<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:03.009> show<00:04:04.009> you<00:04:04.069> how<00:04:04.489> I

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
and maneuver it around I show you how I

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.819 
and maneuver it around I show you how I
get<00:04:04.909> that<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.419> easily<00:04:05.870> move<00:04:06.139> around<00:04:06.470> on<00:04:06.709> the

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
get that to easily move around on the

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.899 
get that to easily move around on the
table<00:04:07.069> as<00:04:07.459> well<00:04:08.259> so<00:04:09.259> to<00:04:09.829> get<00:04:10.069> this<00:04:10.250> this
