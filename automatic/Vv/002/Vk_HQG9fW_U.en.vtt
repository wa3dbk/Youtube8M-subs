00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
in your face weapons in the game and I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.680 
in your face weapons in the game and I
have<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> agree<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.390> some

or<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.660> could<00:00:36.809> say<00:00:36.989> underused<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.210> think<00:00:39.210> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
or you could say underused I think it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.209 
or you could say underused I think it's
a<00:00:39.360> little<00:00:39.450> bit<00:00:39.570> too<00:00:39.809> early<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.320> start<00:00:40.920> doing

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
a little bit too early to start doing

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
a little bit too early to start doing
under<00:00:41.430> use<00:00:41.700> weapons<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.690> isn't<00:00:42.930> under

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
under use weapons but this isn't under

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
under use weapons but this isn't under
under<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> radar<00:00:43.980> weapon<00:00:44.520> how<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.850> call

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
under the radar weapon how about we call

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
under the radar weapon how about we call
it<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.510> way<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.690> cannot<00:00:46.200> i<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.890> decide

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it that that way i cannot i can decide

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
it that that way i cannot i can decide
later<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:47.940> truly<00:00:48.600> underused<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
later if it's truly underused but the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
with ia eks and AC WRs I needed

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.770 
with ia eks and AC WRs I needed
something<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.939> packed<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.600> more

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
something that packed a little bit more

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
something that packed a little bit more
punch<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.650> could<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.250> better<00:01:41.430> than<00:01:41.700> those

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
punch or could even do better than those

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
punch or could even do better than those
weapons<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> went<00:01:42.630> back<00:01:42.810> through<00:01:43.079> I'll<00:01:43.680> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
weapons and I went back through I'll as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
weapons and I went back through I'll as
a<00:01:44.130> lot<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> guys<00:01:44.790> suggestion<00:01:45.479> looked<00:01:46.140> at

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
a lot of you guys suggestion looked at

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.429 
a lot of you guys suggestion looked at
some<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> pw's<00:01:47.420> rediscovered<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.689> guess<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
some of the pw's rediscovered I guess is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.800 
some of the pw's rediscovered I guess is
the<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.619> word<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.280> cz<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:51.630> i<00:01:51.689> was

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the right word the cz because i was

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.120 
the right word the cz because i was
looking<00:01:52.020> at<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.380> man<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> thousand

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
looking at I was like man a thousand

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
looking at I was like man a thousand
rounds<00:01:53.520> per<00:01:53.790> minute<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.570> pretty<00:01:54.960> fast<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
rounds per minute that is pretty fast I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.959 
rounds per minute that is pretty fast I
mean<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.740> competes<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> famas<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
mean that competes with the famas it's

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
mean that competes with the famas it's
like<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> little<00:01:57.270> mini<00:01:57.630> pocket<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.290> moss<00:01:58.469> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like a little mini pocket for moss and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
like a little mini pocket for moss and
so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.430> tried<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.820> out<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.210> took<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> while<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so I tried it out it took me a while to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.859 
so I tried it out it took me a while to
get<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.399> mindset<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.000> using<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.659> weapon

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
get in the mindset of using this weapon

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
get in the mindset of using this weapon
it<00:02:04.380> took<00:02:04.560> me<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> while<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> discover<00:02:05.670> hey<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.180> I

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
it took me a while to discover hey if I

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
it took me a while to discover hey if I
see<00:02:06.479> someone<00:02:06.689> really<00:02:07.079> far<00:02:07.290> away<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
see someone really far away it is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.550 
see someone really far away it is
probably<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.179> best<00:02:09.450> interest<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.349> say

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
probably in my best interest to just say

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.830 
probably in my best interest to just say
nope<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.099> walk<00:02:11.160> away<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:12.000> try<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.390> flank<00:02:12.720> them

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
nope and walk away or try to flank them

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.490 
nope and walk away or try to flank them
at<00:02:13.020> least

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
at least

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
at least
because<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> long-range<00:02:15.120> weapon

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
because this is not a long-range weapon

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.470 
because this is not a long-range weapon
it<00:02:15.840> does<00:02:16.230> 25<00:02:16.590> damage<00:02:17.040> f+<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.700> that's<00:02:18.300> pretty

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it does 25 damage f+ and that's pretty

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
it does 25 damage f+ and that's pretty
cool<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.290> shoots<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.530> thousand<00:02:19.830> rounds

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
cool because it shoots a thousand rounds

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.100 
cool because it shoots a thousand rounds
minute<00:02:20.340> 25<00:02:20.700> damage<00:02:21.060> up<00:02:21.210> close<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.780> 8<00:02:21.900> meters

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
minute 25 damage up close up to 8 meters

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.320 
minute 25 damage up close up to 8 meters
that's<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:23.460> really<00:02:23.640> quick<00:02:23.940> time<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
that's a really really quick time to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.120 
that's a really really quick time to
kill<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.750> an<00:02:24.900> 8<00:02:25.050> meter<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:25.740> once<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> kind

you know 028 is the is the prime place

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.660 
you know 028 is the is the prime place
you<00:02:31.350> want<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.070> weapon<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.490> once

you get around 15 meters and more that's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.290 
you get around 15 meters and more that's
where<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.370> starts<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.730> get<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:35.970> bit

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
where it starts to get a little bit

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.850 
where it starts to get a little bit
hairy<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.870> you're<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.140> oh<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.320> don't<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.740> if

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
hairy and you're like oh I don't know if

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.500 
hairy and you're like oh I don't know if
I<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:37.980> actually<00:02:38.220> take<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.580> person<00:02:39.090> down<00:02:39.300> or

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I can actually take that person down or

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.300 
I can actually take that person down or
not<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.140> takes<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.500> very<00:02:40.650> accurate<00:02:40.890> shot

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
not it takes a very accurate shot

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.730 
not it takes a very accurate shot
because<00:02:41.520> this<00:02:41.850> thing<00:02:42.060> is<00:02:42.180> not<00:02:42.360> very<00:02:42.810> accurate

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
because this thing is not very accurate

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920 
because this thing is not very accurate
I<00:02:44.130> mean<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.400> not<00:02:44.610> made<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.150> be<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.300> precision

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
I mean it's not made to be a precision

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.140 
I mean it's not made to be a precision
rifle<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.500> isn't<00:02:46.770> up<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.190> your<00:02:47.489> face<00:02:47.730> kill

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
rifle it isn't up in your face kill

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.540 
rifle it isn't up in your face kill
people<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.630> quick<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.140> possibly<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.830> move

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
people as quick as you possibly can move

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.550 
people as quick as you possibly can move

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
on to the next target rinse and repeat

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.350 
on to the next target rinse and repeat
and<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.520> things<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.850> was<00:02:53.970> worried

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and one of the things that I was worried

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.360 
and one of the things that I was worried
about<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:54.750> i<00:02:54.780> saw<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.380> rifle<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.220> has

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
about when i saw this rifle was it has

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.100 
about when i saw this rifle was it has
all<00:02:56.580> those<00:02:56.730> characteristics<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:57.989> was

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
all those characteristics but what was

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.140 
all those characteristics but what was
the<00:02:58.140> reload<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:59.040> because<00:02:59.580> the<00:02:59.730> biggest

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the reload of like because the biggest

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.820 
the reload of like because the biggest
crippling<00:03:00.540> factor<00:03:00.959> of<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> weapon<00:03:01.380> like<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
crippling factor of a weapon like the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.310 
crippling factor of a weapon like the
famas<00:03:02.160> for<00:03:02.430> example<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.150> reload<00:03:03.870> time<00:03:03.900> now

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
famas for example is the reload time now

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.990 
famas for example is the reload time now

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
granted the famas is a bullpup rifle

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.120 
granted the famas is a bullpup rifle
which<00:03:06.450> typically<00:03:06.870> do<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.350> slower<00:03:07.650> reloads

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
which typically do have slower reloads

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.550 
which typically do have slower reloads
but<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.910> was<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.570> something<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:10.050> always

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
but that was just something they always

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.290 
but that was just something they always
bothered<00:03:10.980> me<00:03:11.010> about<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.400> famas<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
bothered me about the famas was that it

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.750 
bothered me about the famas was that it
only<00:03:12.450> had<00:03:12.630> 25<00:03:13.080> rounds<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.040> took<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.370> million

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
only had 25 rounds and it took a million

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.449 
only had 25 rounds and it took a million
years<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.150> reload<00:03:15.590> luckily<00:03:16.590> with<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.950> weapon

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
years to reload luckily with this weapon

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.259 
years to reload luckily with this weapon
you<00:03:18.180> only<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:18.959> wait<00:03:19.650> 2.4<00:03:20.610> seconds<00:03:21.060> to

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
you only have to wait 2.4 seconds to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.000 
you only have to wait 2.4 seconds to
reload<00:03:21.570> an<00:03:21.720> empty<00:03:21.959> magazine<00:03:22.170> pretty

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
reload an empty magazine pretty

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.830 
reload an empty magazine pretty
manageable<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.670> think<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> lot<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.180> us<00:03:24.420> can<00:03:24.630> deal

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
manageable I think a lot of us can deal

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.650 
manageable I think a lot of us can deal
with<00:03:25.080> 2.4<00:03:25.650> seconds<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> do<00:03:27.299> have<00:03:27.420> one<00:03:27.450> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
with 2.4 seconds if you do have one in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.240 
with 2.4 seconds if you do have one in
the<00:03:27.750> chamber<00:03:27.930> it<00:03:28.230> only<00:03:28.350> takes<00:03:28.590> one<00:03:28.650> point<00:03:29.190> nine

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
the chamber it only takes one point nine

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.610 
the chamber it only takes one point nine
seconds<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.330> is<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.480> pretty<00:03:30.780> Swift<00:03:31.200> reload

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
seconds so it is a pretty Swift reload

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.440 
seconds so it is a pretty Swift reload
when<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:31.950> think<00:03:32.130> about<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.700> not<00:03:33.180> going

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450

reason to not run the laser sight the

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.760 
reason to not run the laser sight the
only<00:05:08.550> area<00:05:09.150> that<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.419> would<00:05:09.689> maybe<00:05:09.990> change<00:05:10.469> is

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
only area that I would maybe change is

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.499 
only area that I would maybe change is
if<00:05:10.919> you<00:05:11.069> want<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.340> slap<00:05:11.550> a<00:05:11.580> suppressor<00:05:12.210> on<00:05:12.240> it

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
if you want to slap a suppressor on it

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.089 
if you want to slap a suppressor on it
because<00:05:12.960> suppressor<00:05:13.409> does<00:05:13.439> do<00:05:13.800> pretty<00:05:14.009> good

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
because suppressor does do pretty good

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.619 
because suppressor does do pretty good
on<00:05:14.340> this<00:05:14.430> weapon<00:05:14.669> and<00:05:14.909> you<00:05:14.969> guys<00:05:15.120> know<00:05:15.389> how

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
on this weapon and you guys know how

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.110 
on this weapon and you guys know how
much<00:05:15.689> I<00:05:15.990> do<00:05:16.050> enjoy<00:05:16.319> using<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.889> suppressor<00:05:17.430> but

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
much I do enjoy using the suppressor but

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.790 
much I do enjoy using the suppressor but
since<00:05:18.330> this<00:05:18.479> is<00:05:18.689> a<00:05:18.719> weapon<00:05:19.050> that<00:05:19.229> I<00:05:19.349> consider

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
since this is a weapon that I consider

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.619 
since this is a weapon that I consider
to<00:05:19.860> be<00:05:20.069> pretty<00:05:20.370> quick<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.729> reload<00:05:21.090> sometimes

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
to be pretty quick to reload sometimes

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:22.850 
to be pretty quick to reload sometimes
you<00:05:21.750> don't<00:05:21.810> really<00:05:21.990> need<00:05:22.169> a<00:05:22.229> suppressor<00:05:22.740> it's

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
you don't really need a suppressor it's

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.379 
you don't really need a suppressor it's
really<00:05:23.129> up<00:05:23.219> to<00:05:23.370> personal<00:05:23.759> preference<00:05:24.000> I've

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
really up to personal preference I've

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.869 
really up to personal preference I've
ran<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:24.960> with<00:05:24.990> both<00:05:25.349> I<00:05:25.680> don't<00:05:26.430> really<00:05:26.639> know<00:05:26.849> if

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
ran it with both I don't really know if

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.760 
ran it with both I don't really know if
I<00:05:27.060> have<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.360> true<00:05:27.840> preference<00:05:28.319> on<00:05:28.439> it<00:05:28.590> but<00:05:28.740> like

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
I have a true preference on it but like

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.010 
I have a true preference on it but like
I<00:05:29.039> said<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.250> typically<00:05:29.699> gravitate<00:05:30.000> towards<00:05:30.900> the

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
I said I typically gravitate towards the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.659 
I said I typically gravitate towards the
things<00:05:31.529> that<00:05:31.680> are<00:05:31.800> going<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:32.009> enhance<00:05:32.370> the

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
things that are going to enhance the

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.089 
things that are going to enhance the
hipfire<00:05:32.960> because<00:05:33.960> hipfire<00:05:34.379> is<00:05:34.560> king<00:05:34.860> when

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099

mp7<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.960> prime<00:05:43.409> example<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:44.159> a<00:05:44.250> weapon<00:05:44.490> that

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
mp7 is a prime example of a weapon that

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.149 
mp7 is a prime example of a weapon that
just<00:05:44.789> sells<00:05:45.659> and<00:05:45.960> hip<00:05:46.050> fire<00:05:46.289> and<00:05:46.589> this<00:05:46.889> is<00:05:47.039> no

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
just sells and hip fire and this is no

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.769 
just sells and hip fire and this is no
difference<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:47.759> want<00:05:48.120> to<00:05:48.210> be<00:05:48.330> out<00:05:48.539> there
