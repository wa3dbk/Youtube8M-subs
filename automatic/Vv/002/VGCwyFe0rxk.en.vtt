00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
this is a achievement for me but if we

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.719 
this is a achievement for me but if we
were<00:04:55.940> in<00:04:56.060> Canada<00:04:56.540> where<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:56.810> live<00:04:57.260> this<00:04:58.040> will<00:04:58.220> be

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
were in Canada where I live this will be

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.879 
were in Canada where I live this will be
happening<00:04:59.090> because<00:04:59.270> what<00:04:59.660> we<00:04:59.900> can<00:05:00.080> find<00:05:00.350> Abbas

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
happening because what we can find Abbas

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.129 
happening because what we can find Abbas
everywhere<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.760> anywhere<00:05:04.780> but<00:05:05.780> let's<00:05:05.960> move

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
everywhere and anywhere but let's move

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.270 
everywhere and anywhere but let's move
on<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.650> next<00:05:06.680> segment<00:05:07.340> it's<00:05:07.520> about<00:05:07.900> crops

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
on to the next segment it's about crops

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.030 
on to the next segment it's about crops
so<00:05:10.280> before<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:11.000> know<00:05:11.450> crops<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.260> this

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
so before you know crops and this

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.790 
so before you know crops and this
pearly's<00:05:13.880> got<00:05:13.910> some<00:05:14.330> move<00:05:14.510> up<00:05:14.690> in<00:05:14.870> but<00:05:15.440> anyways

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
pearly's got some move up in but anyways

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.370 
pearly's got some move up in but anyways
so<00:05:16.639> as<00:05:16.729> you<00:05:16.820> can<00:05:16.880> see<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.540> crops<00:05:17.960> when<00:05:18.260> you

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
so as you can see the crops when you

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.040 
so as you can see the crops when you
step<00:05:18.830> on<00:05:18.979> them<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.669> didn't<00:05:20.150> no<00:05:20.330> longer<00:05:20.750> get

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
step on them it didn't no longer get

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.700 
step on them it didn't no longer get
destroyed<00:05:21.530> when<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.919> step<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.430> them<00:05:22.610> so<00:05:23.320> you<00:05:24.320> I

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
destroyed when you step on them so you I

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.740 
destroyed when you step on them so you I
believe<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.160> didn't<00:05:25.340> know<00:05:25.370> who<00:05:26.210> are<00:05:26.539> they

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
believe you didn't know who are they

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.480 
believe you didn't know who are they
gonna<00:05:26.900> destroy<00:05:27.350> it<00:05:27.410> I'm<00:05:27.620> not<00:05:27.770> sure<00:05:27.979> I'm<00:05:28.310> a

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
gonna destroy it I'm not sure I'm a

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.909 
gonna destroy it I'm not sure I'm a
destroying<00:05:28.910> some<00:05:29.150> uh<00:05:30.490> nope<00:05:31.490> I'm<00:05:31.729> not<00:05:32.919> unless

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
destroying some uh nope I'm not unless

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.159 
destroying some uh nope I'm not unless
if<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.280> jump<00:05:34.760> on<00:05:34.910> them<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:35.539> when<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.810> walk<00:05:36.020> on

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
if you jump on them so when you walk on

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.260 
if you jump on them so when you walk on
the<00:05:36.260> crops<00:05:36.530> or<00:05:36.770> animals<00:05:37.310> walk<00:05:37.520> on<00:05:37.700> them<00:05:37.880> you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
the crops or animals walk on them you

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.300 
the crops or animals walk on them you
can<00:05:38.450> no<00:05:38.600> longer<00:05:38.810> destroy<00:05:39.169> crops<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.800> this<00:05:40.160> is

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
can no longer destroy crops so this is

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.890 
can no longer destroy crops so this is
really<00:05:40.550> neat<00:05:40.789> feature<00:05:41.030> but<00:05:41.300> I'm<00:05:41.419> just<00:05:41.510> not

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
really neat feature but I'm just not

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.219 
really neat feature but I'm just not
sure<00:05:41.960> if<00:05:42.350> I<00:05:42.440> like<00:05:42.650> it<00:05:42.830> not<00:05:43.190> as<00:05:43.340> realistic<00:05:44.090> as

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
sure if I like it not as realistic as

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.690 
sure if I like it not as realistic as
before<00:05:45.229> but<00:05:45.440> it's<00:05:45.710> the<00:05:45.889> less<00:05:46.070> annoying<00:05:46.400> that's

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
before but it's the less annoying that's

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.080 
before but it's the less annoying that's
for<00:05:46.880> sure<00:05:47.060> but<00:05:48.020> if<00:05:48.260> you<00:05:48.650> do<00:05:49.010> um<00:05:49.250> jump<00:05:49.760> on<00:05:49.910> them

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
for sure but if you do um jump on them

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:56.010 
for sure but if you do um jump on them
into<00:05:50.600> a<00:05:50.630> destroyed<00:05:51.080> crops<00:05:51.410> so<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.340> have<00:05:52.760> very

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.320 

gymnastic<00:05:57.020> beat<00:05:57.229> food<00:05:58.039> speeds<00:05:58.639> but<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.000> little

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
gymnastic beat food speeds but a little

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.290 
gymnastic beat food speeds but a little
a<00:05:59.360> little<00:05:59.450> whatever<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.789> i'm<00:06:01.789> not<00:06:01.970> sure<00:06:02.030> if

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
a little whatever and i'm not sure if

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.510 
a little whatever and i'm not sure if
your<00:06:02.510> sprint<00:06:03.200> on<00:06:03.410> them<00:06:03.650> i'm<00:06:03.889> not<00:06:04.070> sure<00:06:04.130> if<00:06:04.340> it's

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
your sprint on them i'm not sure if it's

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.879 
your sprint on them i'm not sure if it's
going<00:06:04.669> to<00:06:04.729> do<00:06:04.910> anything<00:06:05.150> i<00:06:05.710> fell<00:06:06.710> out

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
going to do anything i fell out

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.670 
going to do anything i fell out
sprinting<00:06:07.460> let's<00:06:07.880> try<00:06:08.030> that<00:06:08.210> again<00:06:08.680> boom

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
sprinting let's try that again boom

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.750 
sprinting let's try that again boom
where<00:06:10.479> boom<00:06:11.650> it<00:06:12.650> seems<00:06:13.100> that<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.460> doesn't

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
where boom it seems that it doesn't

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.909 
where boom it seems that it doesn't
affect<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.150> crops<00:06:14.450> either<00:06:14.720> so<00:06:15.110> only<00:06:15.350> jumping

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
affect the crops either so only jumping

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.670 
affect the crops either so only jumping
will<00:06:16.160> destroy<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.000> crops<00:06:17.270> if<00:06:17.720> you<00:06:18.320> walk<00:06:18.500> on

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
will destroy the crops if you walk on

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.770 
will destroy the crops if you walk on
them<00:06:18.860> it<00:06:19.100> will<00:06:19.340> not<00:06:19.850> destroy<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.389> crop<00:06:20.539> so

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
them it will not destroy the crop so

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.030 
them it will not destroy the crop so
that's<00:06:20.960> pretty<00:06:21.169> interesting<00:06:21.410> and

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.470 

I<00:06:24.100> think<00:06:24.520> that's<00:06:24.760> about<00:06:24.910> it<00:06:25.030> for<00:06:25.180> this

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
I think that's about it for this

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.210 
I think that's about it for this
pre-release<00:06:25.780> it's<00:06:26.140> very<00:06:26.380> short<00:06:26.770> pre-release

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
pre-release it's very short pre-release

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.160 
pre-release it's very short pre-release
