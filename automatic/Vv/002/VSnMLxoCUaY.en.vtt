00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
know basically is that there is

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.140 
know basically is that there is
something<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.980> production<00:02:53.400> by<00:02:53.550> Sony<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.060> is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
most likely a PlayStation 4 we know it's

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.090 
most likely a PlayStation 4 we know it's
in<00:02:57.570> production<00:02:57.990> no<00:02:58.350> more<00:02:58.560> details<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:59.040> that

video<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.230> me<00:03:01.320> once<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.650> get<00:03:01.770> some<00:03:01.920> more

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
video for me once we get some more

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.390 
video for me once we get some more
leaked<00:03:02.280> info<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:03.680> but<00:03:04.680> right<00:03:04.710> now<00:03:05.100> we<00:03:05.160> don't

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
leaked info on but right now we don't

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 
leaked info on but right now we don't
really<00:03:05.580> have<00:03:05.760> much<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.030> detail<00:03:06.630> sonic<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.200> I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
really have much a detail sonic but I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
really have much a detail sonic but I
