 Good morning guys 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.250
 I wanted you here talking and or 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.960
 making another video here 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 try to explain something that has 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 Confused in the previous video 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.650
 many steps then as I was 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.599
 recording that video because that's what I recorded 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.400

 Well, how I will not show it again? 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 How did I do to clear some doubts? 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.309
 nor did I first use that scheme of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.160
 connect and disconnect the internet as 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 connect and disconnect is really is has 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.850
 but I did so by provoking what I did 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 is choosing from the internet 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.449
