00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.759
 Joachim Loew before the draw they were very relaxed it is still 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.119
 I am still an exciting driving style 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.400
 We are looking forward to the tournament and I think I have an interesting group 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.059
 Conergy to each level first Australia 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.859
 We have played Australia in court not too long ago 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.869
 Time at the Confed Cup s 0 to 11 5 games we have today in the Australian 2 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.989
 won 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.000
 have their group also won last year a few times so 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.560
 that will be fine too 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.670
 an important game for us and games for us clearly under 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.900
 that clearly 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.590
 not to win 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.920
 the second opponent Serbia a team which is relatively easy by the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.850
 Qualification has gone 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 with the way the heaviest competition Â»in this group 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.220
 So what Serbia already have great respect 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.910
 that a country have seen the game on DVD in their qualification us 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.190
 France left behind and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.840
 It is easy to loose even this sample marches in the evening very good footballer 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.440
 on 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.269
 how does go wrong 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.860
 Manchester United Bank Ullrich 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.800
 played in Italy 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.960
 is a very strong team 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.159
 the last group opponent will be Kerner to the Africans altogether wants 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.380
 one very much too 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.700
 Garner is also considered a sack man by them 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.650
 Outsider but with a perspective upwards 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 As an outsider I do not want to say because Ghana is actually with Algeria 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.810
 For me, the strongest team might still be the Ivory Coast 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.520
 Canaries 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.500
 now also has become a class player 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.420
 which also in the tournaments Rittal is in Germany well played well me 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.500
 believe in Metz against the Brazilians eliminated 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.210
 at the 2006 World Cup 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.840
 Micheal Essien 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.950
 Michael Ballack in the best 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.950
 This is already from players who play from amorphous top level 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.000
 what does this draw mean for further preparation for the others 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.060
 Opponents on the way to the World Cup we know in March it goes against one 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.570
 Teen 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.800
 because they now put the future teams before the World Cup too 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.950
 give a little bit of attention to starting groups 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 So first we have to turn it on we serve ne I believe in the thirteenth 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 Juno start the races in 13 of 18 o'clock and on the 23 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.429
 know that at least once 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:16.959
 To date, we can match our bidding 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.869
 Align preparation 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.329
 and 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.340
 then, of course, it will be very important that we always think carefully 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.239
 today and tomorrow which teams can play as in the preparatory matches 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.569
 against Caen of these teams we set up 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.509
 that we have in the group that will be important and so on 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.299
 to adjust the culture to the mentality 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.519
 good luck with Finland the aid package
