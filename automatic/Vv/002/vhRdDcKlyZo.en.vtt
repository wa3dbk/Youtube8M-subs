00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
learn this is start with your grip hand

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.660 
learn this is start with your grip hand
at<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> joint<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> cue<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:26.040> back<00:01:26.280> here

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
at the joint on the cue not back here

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.310 
at the joint on the cue not back here
when<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.750> arm<00:01:27.900> tends<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
when you're back here your arm tends to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.399 
when you're back here your arm tends to
fly<00:01:28.560> around<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.220> error<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.320> we're

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
fly around and you get error so we're

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
fly around and you get error so we're
going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.920> our<00:01:32.100> grip<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to start with our grip at the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
going to start with our grip at the
joint<00:01:33.420> we're<00:01:34.409> gonna<00:01:34.560> warm<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.460> throwing

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
joint we're gonna warm up by throwing

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.760 
joint we're gonna warm up by throwing
some<00:01:36.240> darts<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> air<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
some darts out here in the air and the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
some darts out here in the air and the
idea<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> focus<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.090> letting<00:01:39.299> your<00:01:39.540> wrist

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
idea is to focus on letting your wrist

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
idea is to focus on letting your wrist
get<00:01:40.500> fluid<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.070> loose<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
get fluid and loose like this so it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.749 
get fluid and loose like this so it's
just<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> flopping<00:01:43.170> back<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.649> forth<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
just kind of flopping back and forth in

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.130 
just kind of flopping back and forth in
a<00:01:44.850> nice<00:01:45.030> straight<00:01:45.299> line<00:01:45.360> with<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> lot<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a nice straight line with a lot of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.280 
a nice straight line with a lot of
fluidity<00:01:46.729> when<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> get<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.149> feeling<00:01:48.509> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
fluidity when you get that feeling you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.590 
fluidity when you get that feeling you
can<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.619> lower<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> down<00:01:50.450> keeping<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
can just lower it down keeping that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
can just lower it down keeping that
feeling<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> pin<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.280> arm<00:01:53.490> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
feeling and you want to pin your arm to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.810 
feeling and you want to pin your arm to
your<00:01:54.119> body<00:01:54.409> that's<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> isolate<00:01:56.399> my

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
your body that's going to isolate my

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
your body that's going to isolate my
wrist<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.600> about<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.020> only<00:01:58.079> thing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
wrist so that's about the only thing

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510 
wrist so that's about the only thing
that's<00:01:58.560> moving<00:01:58.710> there's<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.430> of

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's moving there's a little bit of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.819 
that's moving there's a little bit of
forearm<00:01:59.729> but<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.210> mostly<00:02:00.540> mostly<00:02:01.229> wrist<00:02:01.560> and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
forearm but it's mostly mostly wrist and

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.010 
forearm but it's mostly mostly wrist and
it's<00:02:02.399> also<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> make<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.210> forearm<00:02:03.869> be

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
it's also going to make my forearm be

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
it's also going to make my forearm be
vertical<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> stick<00:02:05.460> goes<00:02:05.670> straight

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
vertical so the stick goes straight

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
vertical so the stick goes straight
instead<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.719> wobbling<00:02:07.439> around<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.840> so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
instead of wobbling around like this so

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.330 
instead of wobbling around like this so
we're<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.080> bring<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> bring<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> stick

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
we're going to bring the bring the stick

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.589 
we're going to bring the bring the stick
down<00:02:11.520> we're<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.819> pin<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> arm<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
down we're going to pin the arm to the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
down we're going to pin the arm to the
body

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
