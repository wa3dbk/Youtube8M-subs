the driving force behind developing the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
regard to a how can we burn less fuel as

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.890 
regard to a how can we burn less fuel as
a<00:02:13.050> conservation<00:02:13.830> effort<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.760> also<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> cost

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
a conservation effort and also as a cost

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.309 
a conservation effort and also as a cost
savings<00:02:16.380> effort<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> end-user

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
savings effort for the end-user

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.140 
savings effort for the end-user
secondly<00:02:19.319> there's<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> health<00:02:19.950> issue<00:02:20.250> our

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
secondly there's the health issue our

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.259 
secondly there's the health issue our
stove<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.989> very<00:02:22.920> cool<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> touch<00:02:23.910> even

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
stove is very cool to the touch even

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.240 
stove is very cool to the touch even
when<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> burner<00:02:25.050> level<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.800> thousand

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
when the burner level is at a thousand

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.720 
when the burner level is at a thousand
degrees<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:28.049> eliminates<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.340> lot<00:02:29.489> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
degrees so it eliminates a lot of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.990 
degrees so it eliminates a lot of
hazards<00:02:30.299> to<00:02:30.510> young<00:02:30.840> people<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.760> anyone<00:02:32.760> who's

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
using or cooking around the stove the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.080 
using or cooking around the stove the
stove<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.480> burn<00:02:36.690> any<00:02:37.140> combustible<00:02:38.100> material

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
stove can burn any combustible material

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.310 
stove can burn any combustible material
our<00:02:40.049> preference<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.610> use<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.420> coal

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
our preference is to use the coal

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.160 
our preference is to use the coal
briquettes<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.060> coal<00:02:45.269> pellets<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.049> we

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
briquettes or the coal pellets that we

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.280 
briquettes or the coal pellets that we
manufacture<00:02:46.850> because<00:02:47.850> they're<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.290> highest

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
manufacture because they're the highest

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.710 
manufacture because they're the highest
efficiency<00:02:50.000> burning<00:02:51.000> material<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
efficiency burning material and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.960 
efficiency burning material and
therefore<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.040> optimal<00:02:53.549> use<00:02:53.579> out<00:02:53.940> of

therefore you get the optimal use out of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:35.880 
therefore you get the optimal use out of
the<00:02:54.120> stove
