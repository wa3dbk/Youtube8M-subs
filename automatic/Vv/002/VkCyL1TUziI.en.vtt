switch<00:01:36.720> right<00:01:36.960> here<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.670> ahead

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
switch right here so let's just go ahead

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
switch right here so let's just go ahead
and<00:01:38.970> Mary<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.689> up<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.900> see<00:01:40.079> what's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and Mary just get up and see what's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.390 
and Mary just get up and see what's
going<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> mount

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
going on and look like you can mount

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
going on and look like you can mount
this<00:01:41.549> guy<00:01:41.729> into<00:01:41.880> any<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.299> position<00:01:42.780> here

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this guy into any of these position here

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
this guy into any of these position here
and<00:01:43.460> that's<00:01:44.460> basically<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.119> works

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and that's basically how it works

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560 
and that's basically how it works
so<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.229> stop<00:01:47.149> come<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
so you have this very stop come here and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
so you have this very stop come here and
this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.110> how<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.290> run<00:01:49.560> your<00:01:49.590> cable<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this is how you run your cable to it and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.490 
this is how you run your cable to it and
you'll<00:01:51.180> move<00:01:51.360> around<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> basically<00:01:52.290> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you'll move around and basically it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
you'll move around and basically it's
gonna<00:01:52.590> keep<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:52.950> mouse<00:01:53.610> cable<00:01:53.970> clean<00:01:54.180> when

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
gonna keep your mouse cable clean when

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
gonna keep your mouse cable clean when
you're<00:01:54.450> gaming<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.200> gonna<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
you're gaming so you're not gonna have a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
you're gaming so you're not gonna have a
cable<00:01:55.950> talking<00:01:56.280> around<00:01:56.399> give<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> all<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
cable talking around give it all so the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.359 
cable talking around give it all so the
cable<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:57.990> I'll<00:01:58.170> keep<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.649> here<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
cable that I'll keep over here is a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.730 
cable that I'll keep over here is a
strand<00:02:00.149> solution<00:02:00.540> plastic<00:02:01.140> cable<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
strand solution plastic cable and the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
strand solution plastic cable and the
cable<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.340> soft<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> should<00:02:03.299> see

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

it's very well designed it's really
thick<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.490> cable<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:05.969> four<00:02:06.329> feet<00:02:06.509> long

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
thick the cable is about four feet long

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.359 
thick the cable is about four feet long
let's<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:07.590> ahead<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.860> plug<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.280> see

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
to it here's my mouse Kip I'm using a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650 
to it here's my mouse Kip I'm using a
dead<00:02:37.380> adder<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.010> uses<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.880> operator<00:02:39.270> cable

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
dead adder and uses the operator cable

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.180 
dead adder and uses the operator cable
is<00:02:39.810> very<00:02:39.840> soft<00:02:40.380> sometimes<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.980> gets<00:02:41.130> stuck

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
is very soft sometimes it gets stuck

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.410 
is very soft sometimes it gets stuck
behind<00:02:41.400> something<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.940> does<00:02:42.060> get<00:02:42.240> into<00:02:42.360> a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
behind something it does get into a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940 
behind something it does get into a
problem<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.050> right<00:02:43.200> now<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.350> basically<00:02:43.590> have

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
problem but right now I basically have

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.560 
problem but right now I basically have
it<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.160> its<00:02:44.310> mouth<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.880> see<00:02:45.000> when<00:02:45.480> I'm

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
it on its mouth and you can see when I'm

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.330 
it on its mouth and you can see when I'm
moving<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.960> around<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.560> does<00:02:46.800> give<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.100> some

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
moving it around it does give it some

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.680 
moving it around it does give it some
freedom<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.820> move<00:02:47.940> around<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.480> just

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
freedom to move around because just

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.200 
freedom to move around because just
lower<00:02:49.410> arm<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:50.370> soft<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
lower arm here it's very soft you can

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.510 
lower arm here it's very soft you can
see<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.900> seem<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.320> works<00:02:52.470> pretty<00:02:52.650> well<00:02:52.740> I'm

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
see so you seem to works pretty well I'm

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.890 
see so you seem to works pretty well I'm
still<00:02:53.760> making<00:02:53.940> your<00:02:54.300> jump<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.630> trying<00:02:54.840> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
still making your jump and trying to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
still making your jump and trying to
figure<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.230> exactly<00:02:55.380> where<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.520> good

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
figure out exactly where it's a good

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.850 
figure out exactly where it's a good
spot<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.680> cable

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
spot for it you can see here the cable

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.400 
spot for it you can see here the cable
attached<00:02:59.430> into<00:02:59.640> spot<00:03:00.030> right<00:03:00.480> here<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.170> also

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
attached into spot right here and also

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.950 
attached into spot right here and also
right<00:03:01.860> down<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.910> basically<00:03:03.660> that's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
right down here and basically that's

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.350 
right down here and basically that's
basically<00:03:04.530> about<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.880> also<00:03:06.060> run<00:03:06.300> it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
basically about it you can also run it

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.550 
basically about it you can also run it
down<00:03:06.600> here<00:03:06.780> if<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.930> like<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> think

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
down here if you like to but I think

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.130 
down here if you like to but I think
they<00:03:07.830> intend<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.880> purposes<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.870> here

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
they intend the purposes here and here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.330 
they intend the purposes here and here
and<00:03:10.530> it'll<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.860> run<00:03:10.980> through<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> back

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
and it'll just run through the back

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.150 
and it'll just run through the back
behind<00:03:11.520> my<00:03:11.760> monitor<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:13.140> can<00:03:13.290> see<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.980> walks

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
behind my monitor you can see it walks

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.860 
behind my monitor you can see it walks
you<00:03:14.250> up<00:03:14.400> pretty<00:03:14.550> well<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.390> only<00:03:15.600> thing<00:03:15.750> is

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
you up pretty well the only thing is

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.500 
you up pretty well the only thing is
this<00:03:16.320> arm<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.920> make<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.730> soft<00:03:17.970> rubber

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
this arm is a make a really soft rubber

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.810 
this arm is a make a really soft rubber
or<00:03:18.720> silicone<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:20.040> does<00:03:20.190> attract<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.550> lot<00:03:20.790> of

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
or silicone and it does attract a lot of

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.160 
or silicone and it does attract a lot of
dust<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:21.570> I<00:03:21.600> have<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.900> here<00:03:22.140> for

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
dust as you can see I have it here for

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.199 
dust as you can see I have it here for
us<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.650> day<00:03:22.770> or<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.520> plenty<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.000> dust

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
us a day or so and this plenty of dust

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.790 
us a day or so and this plenty of dust
on<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.450> already<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.990> overall<00:03:25.290> I'm<00:03:25.620> pretty

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
on it already so overall I'm pretty

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.070 
on it already so overall I'm pretty
satisfied<00:03:26.130> with<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.730> alky<00:03:27.120> Manticore<00:03:27.750> this

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
satisfied with the alky Manticore this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.770 
satisfied with the alky Manticore this
is<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> pretty<00:03:28.620> good<00:03:28.830> Mouse<00:03:29.370> bungee<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> it

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
is a pretty good Mouse bungee and it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.570 
is a pretty good Mouse bungee and it
works<00:03:30.990> quite<00:03:31.140> well<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.650> think<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.190> arm<00:03:32.370> are

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
works quite well I think the arm are

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.520 
works quite well I think the arm are
soft<00:03:32.820> enough<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.660> does<00:03:33.840> give<00:03:34.080> it

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
soft enough so that it does give it

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.470 
soft enough so that it does give it
plenty<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.950> flexibility<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:35.640> that<00:03:35.820> your<00:03:36.120> cable

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
plenty of flexibility so that your cable

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.330 
plenty of flexibility so that your cable
will<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:37.050> free<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.680> not<00:03:37.800> gonna<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.160> in

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
will be free and it's not gonna get in

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.070 
will be free and it's not gonna get in
the<00:03:38.370> way<00:03:38.580> you<00:03:39.060> basically<00:03:39.390> put<00:03:39.690> your<00:03:39.840> cable

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
the way you basically put your cable

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.720 
the way you basically put your cable
into<00:03:40.260> these<00:03:40.680> two<00:03:40.890> different<00:03:40.920> lights<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.610> with

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
into these two different lights and with

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.490 
into these two different lights and with
my<00:03:41.850> prater<00:03:42.090> cable<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.570> works<00:03:42.750> perfectly<00:03:43.200> fine

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
my prater cable it works perfectly fine

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.920 
my prater cable it works perfectly fine
it<00:03:44.370> does<00:03:44.550> have<00:03:44.760> some<00:03:44.910> flexibility<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.720> can

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
it does have some flexibility so you can

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.720 
it does have some flexibility so you can
put<00:03:46.080> bigger<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.709> smaller<00:03:46.860> cable<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.520> think

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
put bigger and smaller cable but I think

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.040 
put bigger and smaller cable but I think
most<00:03:47.910> Mouse<00:03:48.150> cable<00:03:48.570> should<00:03:48.720> be<00:03:48.810> fine<00:03:49.020> with

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
most Mouse cable should be fine with

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.460 
most Mouse cable should be fine with
this

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.780 
this
my<00:03:49.590> only<00:03:49.709> gripe<00:03:49.860> when<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.130> tune<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> is<00:03:50.610> that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
my only gripe when you tune it is that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.449 
my only gripe when you tune it is that
this<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.120> 2015<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.020> I<00:03:52.410> expect<00:03:52.830> basically<00:03:53.280> all

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
this is 2015 and I expect basically all

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.240 
this is 2015 and I expect basically all
USB<00:03:53.880> hub<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.239> be<00:03:54.480> USB<00:03:54.870> 2.0<00:03:55.380> and<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:56.130> was

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
USB hub now to be USB 2.0 and it was

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.560 
USB hub now to be USB 2.0 and it was
disappoint<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.820> find<00:03:57.000> out<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.270> these<00:03:57.420> are

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
disappoint to find out that these are

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.990 
disappoint to find out that these are
only<00:03:57.690> USB<00:03:58.170> 2.0<00:03:58.620> just<00:03:59.010> plugging<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.459> device<00:03:59.760> and

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
only USB 2.0 just plugging in device and

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.430 
only USB 2.0 just plugging in device and
using<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.480> think<00:04:00.750> they<00:04:00.810> are<00:04:00.930> fine<00:04:01.110> but<00:04:01.320> if

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
using it I think they are fine but if

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.050 
using it I think they are fine but if
you<00:04:01.560> are<00:04:01.680> trying<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:02.040> copy<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.610> lot<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.910> big

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
you are trying to copy a lot of big

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.510 
you are trying to copy a lot of big
files<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:03.840> want<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.200> USB<00:04:04.590> 2.0<00:04:05.010> hub<00:04:05.040> because

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
files you want a USB 2.0 hub because

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.280 
files you want a USB 2.0 hub because
you're<00:04:05.670> trying<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.940> move<00:04:06.090> foul<00:04:06.330> quickly<00:04:06.930> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
you're trying to move foul quickly I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.780 
you're trying to move foul quickly I
have<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> hope<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.830> basically<00:04:08.250> connect<00:04:08.550> through

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
have a hope to basically connect through

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.520 
have a hope to basically connect through
my<00:04:08.880> card<00:04:09.090> will<00:04:09.239> need<00:04:09.330> to<00:04:09.570> transfer<00:04:09.840> video<00:04:10.290> that

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
my card will need to transfer video that

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.400 
my card will need to transfer video that
I<00:04:10.560> review<00:04:10.950> over<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.459> basically<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:13.020> know<00:04:13.140> it

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
I review over and basically you know it

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.229 
I review over and basically you know it
doesn't<00:04:13.650> replace<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.130> because<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.910> USB

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
doesn't replace it because it's the USB

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.880 
doesn't replace it because it's the USB
2.0<00:04:15.690> hub<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.020> it's<00:04:16.140> not<00:04:16.260> fast<00:04:16.470> enough<00:04:16.560> for<00:04:16.709> me

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
2.0 hub and it's not fast enough for me

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.409 
2.0 hub and it's not fast enough for me
I<00:04:17.100> still<00:04:17.459> like<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.730> design<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:18.060> it<00:04:18.209> it<00:04:18.390> should

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
I still like the design of it it should

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.090 
I still like the design of it it should
look<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:18.840> nice<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.380> at<00:04:19.470> night<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.799> colors

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
look really nice and at night the colors

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.250
