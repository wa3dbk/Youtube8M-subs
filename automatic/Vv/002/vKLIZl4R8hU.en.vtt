00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120 

rear<00:00:00.269> shock<00:00:01.070> it<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:03.350> setup<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.680> someone

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
rear shock it is a setup for someone

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.169 
rear shock it is a setup for someone
let's<00:00:05.339> pray<00:00:05.549> like<00:00:06.529> 150<00:00:07.529> pounds<00:00:07.890> I'd<00:00:08.010> say<00:00:08.250> just

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
let's pray like 150 pounds I'd say just

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.560 
let's pray like 150 pounds I'd say just
guessing<00:00:09.540> I'm<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:10.349> 170<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:12.120> was<00:00:12.240> pretty

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
guessing I'm about 170 and it was pretty

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870 
guessing I'm about 170 and it was pretty
soft<00:00:12.840> for<00:00:13.110> me<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:14.130> would<00:00:14.250> bottom<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.639> quite<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
soft for me it would bottom out quite a

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.490 
soft for me it would bottom out quite a
bit<00:00:15.560> so<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.920> tighten<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.670> up<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.539> big

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
bit so I tighten that up but a big

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
bit so I tighten that up but a big
disadvantage<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.670> bike<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.150> front

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
disadvantage to this bike is the front

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.779 
disadvantage to this bike is the front
forks<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.859> adjustable<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.580> there's

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
forks are not adjustable at all there's

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.109 
forks are not adjustable at all there's
no<00:00:23.850> clickers<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:25.010> it<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.490> soft<00:00:26.820> as

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
no clickers and it is really soft as

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
no clickers and it is really soft as
well<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.570> when<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.199> hit<00:00:28.380> big<00:00:28.650> jumps<00:00:28.980> it's

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
well so when you hit big jumps it's

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
well so when you hit big jumps it's
going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> bottom<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.309> really

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
going to bottom out or you know really

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.490 
going to bottom out or you know really
rocky<00:00:33.090> terrain<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.660> bottoms<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:34.350> really

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
rocky terrain it bottoms out it's really

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.180 
rocky terrain it bottoms out it's really
soft<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.270> guess<00:00:37.140> you'd<00:00:37.320> put<00:00:37.500> heavier<00:00:37.739> oil<00:00:38.040> in

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
soft so I guess you'd put heavier oil in

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.119 
soft so I guess you'd put heavier oil in
it<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.399> bigger<00:00:38.610> Springs<00:00:39.649> but<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.860> haven't

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it or bigger Springs but I haven't

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.790 
it or bigger Springs but I haven't
played<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.640> too<00:00:41.790> much<00:00:41.820> yet<00:00:42.149> uh<00:00:43.879> what<00:00:44.879> else

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
played with it too much yet uh what else

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.310 
played with it too much yet uh what else
kick<00:00:46.800> start<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.969> annoying<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> have

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
kick start really annoying when you have

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
kick start really annoying when you have
motocross<00:00:49.710> boots<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.960> when<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> lean<00:00:52.350> your

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
motocross boots on when you lean your

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.910 
motocross boots on when you lean your
foot<00:00:52.710> back<00:00:52.890> it'll<00:00:53.309> tend<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.760> push<00:00:54.710> back<00:00:55.710> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
foot back it'll tend to push back on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.270 
foot back it'll tend to push back on
this<00:00:56.930> just<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.350> set<00:00:58.530> up<00:00:58.559> here<00:00:58.890> like

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this just the way it's set up here like

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.349 
this just the way it's set up here like
with<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:01.170> pegs<00:01:01.879> you'll<00:01:02.879> kick<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.210> back

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
with the the pegs you'll kick it back

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
with the the pegs you'll kick it back
and<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:03.750> you'll<00:01:03.870> hear<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> gears

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and then you'll hear it like the gears

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
and then you'll hear it like the gears
inside<00:01:05.189> clicking<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.900> happens<00:01:07.170> all<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
inside clicking and that happens all the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
inside clicking and that happens all the
time<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.860> me<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.640> only<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.060> wearing

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
time with me it's only when I'm wearing

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.270 
time with me it's only when I'm wearing
the<00:01:09.390> motocross<00:01:09.750> boots<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.950> gonna<00:01:11.100> have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the motocross boots but I'm gonna have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.560 
the motocross boots but I'm gonna have
to<00:01:11.400> bend<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> difference

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to bend it in or get a difference

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
to bend it in or get a difference
kickstart<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.350> happens<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.580> lot<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
kickstart because happens a lot more

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.609 
kickstart because happens a lot more
than<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> should<00:01:16.790> um

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
than it should um

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.320 
than it should um
those<00:01:20.240> breaks<00:01:21.770> are<00:01:23.180> okay<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.200> mediocre

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
those breaks are okay kind of mediocre

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.990 
those breaks are okay kind of mediocre
they<00:01:27.710> don't<00:01:28.710> grip<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.759> hard

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
they don't grip that well like hard

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.399 
they don't grip that well like hard
braking<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> front<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
braking in the front you really got to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.969 
braking in the front you really got to
pull<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:33.450> nothing<00:01:33.869> like<00:01:34.549> Brembo<00:01:35.549> or

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
pull on them it's nothing like Brembo or

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.480 
pull on them it's nothing like Brembo or
any<00:01:37.979> major<00:01:38.400> brand<00:01:38.729> brakes<00:01:40.009> they<00:01:41.009> do<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> job

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
any major brand brakes they do the job

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
any major brand brakes they do the job
but<00:01:42.110> they're<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.310> typical

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
but they're not a you know it's typical

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.569 
but they're not a you know it's typical
what<00:01:44.850> you'd<00:01:45.000> expect<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> bike<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
what you'd expect on a bike like this

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:54.480 
what you'd expect on a bike like this
for<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> money

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.230 

see<00:01:55.490> it's<00:01:55.940> oh<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.070> frame<00:01:58.070> on<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:59.000> like

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
see it's oh the the frame on it is like

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.690 
see it's oh the the frame on it is like
a<00:01:59.420> tube<00:01:59.870> style<00:02:00.260> frame<00:02:00.530> with<00:02:00.770> these<00:02:00.920> cross

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
a tube style frame with these cross

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.210 
a tube style frame with these cross
members<00:02:03.400> it's<00:02:04.400> kind<00:02:04.610> of<00:02:04.640> strange<00:02:06.220> really

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
members it's kind of strange really

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.910 
members it's kind of strange really
solid<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.840> middle<00:02:09.080> there<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.440> it's<00:02:09.530> got<00:02:09.710> a

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
solid in the middle there and it's got a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.080 
solid in the middle there and it's got a
cradle<00:02:10.580> design<00:02:12.580> underneath<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.730> engine<00:02:13.970> as

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
cradle design underneath the engine as

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.420 
cradle design underneath the engine as
well<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:15.260> it's<00:02:15.380> not<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.590> bolted<00:02:16.040> at<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.220> top

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
well so it's not just bolted at the top

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.730 
well so it's not just bolted at the top
it's<00:02:16.670> bolted<00:02:17.300> into<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> bottom<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.050> then

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's bolted into the bottom and then

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's bolted into the bottom and then
there's<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.810> Bosch<00:02:20.810> pan<00:02:21.110> as<00:02:21.260> well<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.970> pipe

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
there's the Bosch pan as well the pipe

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.690 
there's the Bosch pan as well the pipe
isn't<00:02:23.720> really<00:02:23.990> protected<00:02:24.440> on<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.590> side<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:25.160> if

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
isn't really protected on the side so if

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.630 
isn't really protected on the side so if
you<00:02:25.820> crash<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.530> hit<00:02:27.710> probably

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.870 

that's<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.970> something<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.510> watch<00:02:32.660> out<00:02:33.020> for

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
that's just something to watch out for

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.310 
that's just something to watch out for
and<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:38.450> air<00:02:38.690> filter<00:02:40.300> gets<00:02:41.300> dirty<00:02:41.450> so<00:02:42.050> fast

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.470 
and the air filter gets dirty so fast
just<00:02:43.310> because<00:02:43.370> there's<00:02:43.700> no<00:02:43.820> mud<00:02:44.060> guard<00:02:44.270> in<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480

I<00:03:05.890> bought<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:07.070> mud<00:03:07.340> flap<00:03:07.550> from<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> TCR<00:03:08.209> 110<00:03:08.769> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
I bought a mud flap from a TCR 110 the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.550 
I bought a mud flap from a TCR 110 the
bolt<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:11.390> when<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.050> comes<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.440> I'm

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
bolt on here so when that comes in I'm

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.530 
bolt on here so when that comes in I'm
just<00:03:12.620> going<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.010> put<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.280> there<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:14.330> keep<00:03:14.420> it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
just going to put that there to keep it

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.460 
just going to put that there to keep it
clean<00:03:14.810> because<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.739> really<00:03:16.010> annoying<00:03:17.470> chain

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
clean because it's really annoying chain

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.410 
clean because it's really annoying chain
just<00:03:19.160> your<00:03:19.840> standard<00:03:20.840> chain<00:03:22.060> nothing<00:03:23.060> fancy

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
just your standard chain nothing fancy

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.979 
just your standard chain nothing fancy
about<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:24.010> same<00:03:25.010> thing<00:03:25.190> with<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.370> sprockets

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
about it same thing with the sprockets

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.470 
about it same thing with the sprockets
it's<00:03:26.989> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.200> chain<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.530> on<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.860> bottom

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
it's going to chain you on the bottom

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.360 
it's going to chain you on the bottom
chain<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.750> pre-stretched<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.800> think<00:03:31.040> because

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
chain is pre-stretched I think because

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.810 
chain is pre-stretched I think because
I've<00:03:31.970> ridden<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.980> probably<00:03:33.980> like<00:03:34.550> four<00:03:34.790> hours

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
I've ridden it probably like four hours

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.699 
I've ridden it probably like four hours
a<00:03:35.060> right<00:03:35.300> time<00:03:35.450> on<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.780> now<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:37.519> uh<00:03:37.580> it

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
a right time on it now and it uh it

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.610 
a right time on it now and it uh it
really<00:03:39.709> doesn't<00:03:39.950> stretch<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.400> much<00:03:40.580> so<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
really doesn't stretch that much so the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.940 
really doesn't stretch that much so the
SS<00:03:43.489> are<00:03:43.640> 125<00:03:44.150> a1<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.959> stretched<00:03:45.350> so<00:03:45.709> much

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
SS are 125 a1 it's stretched so much

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.810 
SS are 125 a1 it's stretched so much
like<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:47.120> owned<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.810> for<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:48.050> year<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.820> take

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
like I owned it for a year and I take

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.180 
like I owned it for a year and I take
two<00:03:50.000> links<00:03:50.330> out<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.900> adjust<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.739> constantly

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
two links out and adjust it constantly

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.650
