well<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.800> my<00:00:01.949> 1978<00:00:02.939> Ford<00:00:03.510> LTD<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:04.350> kind<00:00:05.250> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
well this is my 1978 Ford LTD I kind of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.099 
well this is my 1978 Ford LTD I kind of
had<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> weird<00:00:05.640> problem<00:00:05.879> with<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.330> couple

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
had a weird problem with it a couple

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.799 
had a weird problem with it a couple
months<00:00:07.319> back<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.919> would<00:00:08.610> run<00:00:08.910> an<00:00:09.179> idle<00:00:09.599> when<00:00:09.719> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
months back it would run an idle when it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.780 
months back it would run an idle when it
was<00:00:09.929> cold<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.469> then<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.340> would<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.460> shut<00:00:11.759> off

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
was cold and then it would just shut off

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.509 
was cold and then it would just shut off
after<00:00:12.450> about<00:00:12.660> 10<00:00:12.990> 15<00:00:13.170> minutes<00:00:13.679> after<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.190> warmed

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
after about 10 15 minutes after a warmed

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.189 
after about 10 15 minutes after a warmed
up<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> want<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> start<00:00:15.780> again<00:00:15.870> for<00:00:16.170> a

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
up and I want to start again for a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.010 
up and I want to start again for a
couple<00:00:16.289> hours<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.480> figured<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.900> was

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
couple hours I figured out that it was

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.620 
couple hours I figured out that it was
the<00:00:19.260> pickup<00:00:20.010> coil<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> distributor<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the pickup coil in the distributor and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
the pickup coil in the distributor and
I'm<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> show<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.590> how<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> did<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.100> now

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I'm going to show you how I did that now

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
I'm going to show you how I did that now
it's<00:00:24.330> cold<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.869> been<00:00:24.960> sitting<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.650> few

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
it's cold it's been sitting for a few

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.999 
it's cold it's been sitting for a few
hours<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.599> got<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.140> coil<00:00:28.349> wire<00:00:28.529> off<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:30.920> got<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
hours I got the coil wire off I got the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.590 
hours I got the coil wire off I got the
coil<00:00:32.189> wire<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.030> got<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> hooked<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
coil wire off and I got it hooked up to

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.630 
coil wire off and I got it hooked up to
a<00:00:33.780> spark<00:00:34.170> checker<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
a spark checker and I just got to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
a spark checker and I just got to
growing<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> cap<00:00:36.559> and<00:00:37.559> hopefully<00:00:38.100> if

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
growing it on the cap and hopefully if

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.389 
growing it on the cap and hopefully if
this<00:00:38.399> cameras<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.629> all<00:00:39.809> decent<00:00:40.379> it'll<00:00:40.620> work

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.360 

now<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.670> camera<00:00:44.879> works<00:00:45.180> right<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:46.890> should<00:00:47.129> see

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
now my camera works right you should see

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.260 
now my camera works right you should see
a<00:00:47.989> spark<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.309> in<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.520> little<00:00:50.730> glass<00:00:50.910> thing

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
a spark there in that little glass thing

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.869 
a spark there in that little glass thing
when<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> crank<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> over<00:00:52.730> hopefully<00:00:53.730> you'll<00:00:53.850> be

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
when I crank it over hopefully you'll be

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
when I crank it over hopefully you'll be
able<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> find<00:00:55.500> out

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
able to see it we're going to find out

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:08.780 
able to see it we're going to find out
real<00:00:55.829> quick<00:01:06.380> hope<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.590> saw<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.490> tells

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
real quick hope you saw that that tells

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
real quick hope you saw that that tells
me<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> everything's<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.049> now<00:01:10.310> when

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
me that everything's good right now when

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
me that everything's good right now when
it<00:01:11.400> warms<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.630> no<00:01:12.780> spark<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.490> took

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it warms up I get no spark and it took

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
it warms up I get no spark and it took
me<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> while<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> figure<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.600> threw<00:01:16.380> some

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
me a while to figure it out I threw some

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.640 
me a while to figure it out I threw some
parts<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> new<00:01:17.369> ignition<00:01:17.490> module<00:01:18.119> new<00:01:18.240> coil

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
parts at a new ignition module new coil

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
parts at a new ignition module new coil
you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.740> which<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.250> cheap<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you know which was cheap but not the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
you know which was cheap but not the
right<00:01:21.570> way<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.170> finally<00:01:22.500> diagnose

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
right way to do it and finally diagnose

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
right way to do it and finally diagnose
the<00:01:23.159> problem<00:01:23.580> when<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.600> gets<00:01:24.750> hot<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.470> get

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the problem when it gets hot I don't get

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.460 
the problem when it gets hot I don't get
no<00:01:25.740> spark<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> crank<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.470> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
no spark out of here when I crank it so

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
no spark out of here when I crank it so
what<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> did<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.640> hooked<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:29.909> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
what I did was I hooked up that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.740 
what I did was I hooked up that
distributor<00:01:30.890> sitting<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> chair<00:01:32.750> plugged

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
distributor sitting on the chair plugged

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.960 
distributor sitting on the chair plugged
her<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.049> didn't<00:01:34.380> take<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.640> I'll<00:01:35.790> show

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
her in didn't take it out and I'll show

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.510 
her in didn't take it out and I'll show
you<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> minute

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you that in a minute

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520 
you that in a minute
I've<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.390> this<00:01:39.510> whole<00:01:39.659> distributor<00:01:40.260> plugged

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I've got this whole distributor plugged

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.859 
I've got this whole distributor plugged
in<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.310> part<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.790> here<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> pickup

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
in this part right here is the pickup

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
in this part right here is the pickup
coil<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.409> got<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.490> old<00:01:44.580> distributor<00:01:44.790> plugged

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
coil I got the old distributor plugged

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
coil I got the old distributor plugged
in<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> gotta<00:01:46.770> make<00:01:46.860> sure<00:01:47.010> it's<00:01:47.040> grounded

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
in and I gotta make sure it's grounded

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.540 
in and I gotta make sure it's grounded
to<00:01:47.640> something<00:01:53.330> grow<00:01:54.330> into<00:01:54.630> something<00:01:54.840> good

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
to something grow into something good

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.690 
to something grow into something good
and<00:01:56.550> I<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.240> spin<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.580> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and I just spin it and you can see it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.180 
and I just spin it and you can see it
sparks<00:02:00.320> so<00:02:01.320> that's<00:02:01.440> how<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> figured<00:02:01.920> out<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
sparks so that's how I figured out the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.030 
sparks so that's how I figured out the
coil<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.670> bad<00:02:02.930> or<00:02:03.930> excuse<00:02:04.470> me<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.649> pickup

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
coil was bad or excuse me the pickup

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.430 
coil was bad or excuse me the pickup
coil<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.520> bad

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.750 

hey<00:02:15.040> oh<00:02:15.220> no<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.580> see<00:02:15.820> this<00:02:15.880> part

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.010 

so<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:19.879> I've<00:02:19.970> got<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.180> take<00:02:20.300> this<00:02:20.420> pickup<00:02:20.810> coil

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
so now I've got to take this pickup coil

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.040 
so now I've got to take this pickup coil
out<00:02:21.260> which<00:02:22.040> I'm<00:02:22.970> going<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.209> have<00:02:23.330> to<00:02:23.450> pry<00:02:23.720> up<00:02:23.750> on

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
out which I'm going to have to pry up on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.440 
out which I'm going to have to pry up on
this<00:02:24.170> reluctor<00:02:24.680> wheel<00:02:24.830> here<00:02:25.099> pull<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.239> off

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
this reluctor wheel here pull that off

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.220 
this reluctor wheel here pull that off
and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.379> loosen<00:02:28.099> screw<00:02:28.370> there<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.230> that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and then loosen screw there and that

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.880 
and then loosen screw there and that
little<00:02:30.349> Eclipse<00:02:31.180> down<00:02:32.180> there<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.560> should

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
little Eclipse down there and should

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.610 
little Eclipse down there and should
come<00:02:34.069> off<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.610> then<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:34.880> put<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.239> in<00:02:35.360> my

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
come off and then I can put it in my

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.330 
come off and then I can put it in my
other<00:02:36.620> distributor<00:02:38.950> well<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.069> got<00:02:40.220> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
other distributor well I got the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
other distributor well I got the
reluctor<00:02:40.760> wheel<00:02:40.940> off<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.830> took<00:02:43.450> two<00:02:44.450> pry

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
reluctor wheel off just took two pry

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.870 
reluctor wheel off just took two pry
bars<00:02:45.069> wedge<00:02:46.069> them<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.340> underneath<00:02:46.610> very

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
bars wedge them up underneath very

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.570 
bars wedge them up underneath very
carefully<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.110> pry<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.400> don't<00:02:49.489> want

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
carefully and pry it up you don't want

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.539 
carefully and pry it up you don't want
to<00:02:49.730> break<00:02:49.879> it<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.950> make<00:02:51.950> sure<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.160> don't<00:02:52.400> lose

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
to break it and make sure you don't lose

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.089 
to break it and make sure you don't lose
that<00:02:52.700> little<00:02:53.030> tiny<00:02:53.239> role<00:02:53.540> pen<00:02:53.810> goes<00:02:54.680> into<00:02:54.980> that

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
that little tiny role pen goes into that

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.600 
that little tiny role pen goes into that
slot<00:02:55.730> right<00:02:56.000> there<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:57.140> keep<00:02:57.319> it<00:02:57.530> centered<00:02:58.160> to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
slot right there to keep it centered to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.130 
slot right there to keep it centered to
where<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.819> needs<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.769> don't<00:03:00.769> lose<00:03:00.950> that

where it needs to be don't lose that

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.360 
where it needs to be don't lose that
well<00:03:03.140> it<00:03:03.290> took<00:03:03.410> some<00:03:03.470> doing<00:03:03.860> but<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:04.069> got<00:03:04.250> her

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
well it took some doing but I got her

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.180 
well it took some doing but I got her
off<00:03:04.549> been<00:03:05.299> on<00:03:05.420> there<00:03:05.660> for<00:03:05.930> damn<00:03:06.440> near<00:03:06.650> 30<00:03:06.829> years

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
off been on there for damn near 30 years

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.449 
off been on there for damn near 30 years
so<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.780> right<00:03:09.440> there<00:03:09.709> that's<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.160> pickup

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
so but right there that's the pickup

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.030 
so but right there that's the pickup
coil<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:10.940> whole<00:03:11.090> unit<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.620> took<00:03:12.620> off<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.829> couple

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
coil the whole unit I took off a couple

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.580 
coil the whole unit I took off a couple
of<00:03:13.370> screws<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:14.060> took<00:03:14.599> off<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.959> vacuum<00:03:15.140> advanced

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
of screws I took off the vacuum advanced

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
of screws I took off the vacuum advanced
unit<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.519> took<00:03:16.730> off<00:03:16.849> this<00:03:17.060> plate<00:03:17.299> here<00:03:17.510> to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
unit and I took off this plate here to

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.140 
unit and I took off this plate here to
make<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.900> easier<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.380> pry<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.650> out<00:03:19.150> but

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
make it easier to pry it out but

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.449 
make it easier to pry it out but
hopefully<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:21.260> one<00:03:21.440> that's<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.799> there<00:03:22.010> which

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
hopefully the one that's in there which

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.259 
hopefully the one that's in there which
is<00:03:22.609> only<00:03:22.819> a<00:03:22.940> year<00:03:23.209> old<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.870> whole<00:03:24.049> distributor

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
is only a year old the whole distributor

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.729 
is only a year old the whole distributor
should<00:03:26.269> come<00:03:26.480> out<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.660> little<00:03:27.079> bit<00:03:27.230> easier<00:03:27.560> than

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
should come out a little bit easier than

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.440 
should come out a little bit easier than
that<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:28.549> I<00:03:28.579> can<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:28.910> clean<00:03:29.120> up<00:03:29.269> that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
that and then I can just clean up that

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.069 
that and then I can just clean up that
old<00:03:29.660> one<00:03:30.489> put<00:03:31.489> it<00:03:31.579> in<00:03:31.670> there<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.690> hopefully

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
old one put it in there and hopefully

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.720 
old one put it in there and hopefully
over<00:03:35.440> now<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:36.680> didn't<00:03:37.040> show<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.250> before

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
is there's a tiny little snap ring that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.420 
is there's a tiny little snap ring that
fits<00:03:39.829> in<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.069> groove<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:42.650> right<00:03:43.010> there<00:03:43.250> now

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
fits in that groove it's right there now

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.030 
fits in that groove it's right there now
don't<00:03:43.730> forget<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.389> take<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.780> out<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.230> didn't

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.830 
together and see if she starts well I
guess<00:04:26.070> there's<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.340> moment<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.760> truth<00:04:27.000> we've

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
guess there's a moment of truth we've

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.270 
guess there's a moment of truth we've
got<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.050> all<00:04:28.140> back<00:04:28.290> together<00:04:28.500> hopefully<00:04:29.010> it's

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
got it all back together hopefully it's

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.720 
got it all back together hopefully it's
put<00:04:29.460> together<00:04:29.580> right<00:04:31.130> we'll<00:04:32.130> just<00:04:32.340> see<00:04:32.490> if<00:04:32.580> she

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
put together right we'll just see if she

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.390 
put together right we'll just see if she
runs<00:04:33.410> all<00:04:34.410> right<00:04:34.620> here<00:04:34.890> we<00:04:35.010> go

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
runs all right here we go

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.700 
runs all right here we go
moment<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:35.970> truth<00:04:36.270> Oh<00:04:39.020> runs<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.320> million

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
moment of truth Oh runs like a million

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.640 
moment of truth Oh runs like a million
bucks

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.030 

now<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.250> guess<00:04:46.699> I'll<00:04:46.880> just<00:04:47.680> let<00:04:48.680> her<00:04:48.800> run<00:04:48.979> for

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
now I guess I'll just let her run for

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.340 
now I guess I'll just let her run for
about<00:04:49.460> 10-15<00:04:49.850> minutes<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:50.630> see<00:04:50.960> if<00:04:50.990> she<00:04:51.229> dies

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
about 10-15 minutes and see if she dies

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.600 
about 10-15 minutes and see if she dies
well<00:04:54.350> it's<00:04:54.590> been<00:04:54.740> sitting<00:04:55.010> here<00:04:55.040> running<00:04:55.430> for

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
well it's been sitting here running for

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.120 
well it's been sitting here running for
about<00:04:55.699> a<00:04:55.820> half<00:04:56.060> hour<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.660> she's<00:04:57.199> still<00:04:57.530> going

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.830 

so<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.669> think<00:05:02.120> I<00:05:02.270> fixed<00:05:02.570> her<00:05:02.830> sweet
