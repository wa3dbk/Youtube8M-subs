00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.340
 the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.320
 87 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.439
 that's the way it is 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.979
 however, the viewer gets my name is Martin Kohler provide photographers 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:12.509
 today 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.749
 we will wander into the distance 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.509
 very far away and still be very close 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.699
 and how are we going to do that? 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.079
 to our present day objective, that would be the 300 to 800 millimeters they are Bobby deep 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.220
 at aperture of 5 6 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.920
 I have the objective just look at this is a very nice 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.030
 big part 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.950
 because that can be objective then I do not know what you are as deep 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.630
 where have you the son objectively ever seen clearly animal photographers 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.750
 Animal photography why 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.410
 Escape is then you see it here the keyword 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.360
 Many animals start to run away when they fly away 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 Photographer comes too close and now you need a wide and that 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.010
 this objectively 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.380
 I already had the photographic characteristics of this VTEC in the beginning 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.100
 Fear namely 300 to 8 5 millimeters 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.820
 at constant aperture of 5 times 6 and have a look at the statute 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.730
 Version 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.730
 300 to 800 millimeters at all means 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.079
 300 mm there are hundreds of end of the lens 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.140
 right up to the right care area at 8 5 millimeters 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.700
 that's pretty huge focal length range with one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 Objectively as I said at constant blind covered by five times six 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.710
 becomes 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.570
 if you photograph with such an objective then you have to forcibly 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.399
 actually work with a tripod 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.270
 First of all, the objective is simply a good deal of glass and therefore too 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.780
 rather heavy and secondly Lehmann Verwackler and in the high Venn at Eupen 

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:37.110
 Avoid area blurring 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 that 's why this way has a special feature and that' s because of the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.630
 City iv-site 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.180
 the tv market change 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.350
 I just grab it directly to show that live 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.230
 with Gaal in landscape format and I want to photograph both Tim Hofmann 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.930
 and it's easy 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.010
 I'm begging the stati site 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.440
 Delay the camera 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.320
 on the lens are still marks attached so I know what 90 ° 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 possible alliance and already I can continue to photograph in the other 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.499
 Format so again Steffen has 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.540
 Another handy features that would be the filter holder 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.630
 which is not like ordinary lenses here in front of the front in 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.610
 be built but he is here behind 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.559
 deep in the middle of the main deck 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.809
 This makes it easy to polfilter or other dads 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.929
 insert the left and especially in smaller version into the objective 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.449
 Of course, Colt Filder can also be used to roll over profiles 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.260
 here at the little thing 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.039
 the Lehmann 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.549
 without having to go deep in the Rhineland, which is not possible in this length 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.359
 with such van Buyten, of course, focusing is extremely important and that 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.079
 takes on this objective so called Anholt Rascal engine so 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.149
 noiseless and fast and the noiseless that would be in the 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.019
 Animal photography extremely important 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.569
 In doing so, you can objectively focus on the process at any time 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.000
 manual focusing with intervene 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.560
 because the prototype from the ultrasonic motor is not with the rain 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.800
 10 connected means that if you want to work creatively something 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 Manuel Cases then could not do that anytime that evening 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.579
 then you can also enjoy spectacular shots if you have one 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.939
 Converter to the lens inserts 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.419
 then, for example, one would have used a double value of Siegmar 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.649
 will lens up to a thousand sex-appeal eMeters 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.879
 In the end, the hard facts about this objectively it's an abrupt one 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.549
 Mata me the objective so the addition Aupeo this is of course the 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.479
 Siegmar's high-end line with such a deep, very clear 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.289
 and it is the idea of ​​Smart not synonymous with Summer deep again usually clear 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.459
 The motif is also available for all popular Cana formats and on the very 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.589
 Last but not least a little experienced to say I did not take it 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.619
 that the objective to pack and 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.669
 go to the zoo or go 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.569
 and sometimes to watch what's objectionable and I'm pretty 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.439
 impressed percent of the trend wide range knocked off in the Hip Hop 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.309
 Turn I could with an objective 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:59.799
 during a visit 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.510
 very different pictures make Noront away 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.180
 I had a deep Gaal only the respective animals had sat down 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.540
 the 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.849
 I just managed to get that perfect picture through this little twist 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:10.680
 find that for me 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.169
 I enjoy her van Staa a lot 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.499
 he uses the lens he has fun in any case 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 yes and 4 until then Euro made deer 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.999
 St
