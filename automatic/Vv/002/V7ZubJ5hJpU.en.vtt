spoken about this in other videos I like
what<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.810> doing<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.470> going<00:01:34.590> to

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
what you're doing what you're going to

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.740 
what you're doing what you're going to
do<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.040> going<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.190> add<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.850> drop<00:01:36.300> set

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
do is you're going to add one drop set

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.290 
do is you're going to add one drop set
to<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:36.990> end<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.770> each<00:01:38.039> one<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.520> exercises

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
to the end of each one of your exercises

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.540 
to the end of each one of your exercises
so<00:01:39.450> let's<00:01:39.690> say<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:39.990> doing<00:01:40.140> three<00:01:40.860> sets<00:01:41.190> of

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
so let's say you're doing three sets of

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.370 
so let's say you're doing three sets of
squats<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.270> you're<00:01:42.420> doing<00:01:42.600> because<00:01:43.080> you're

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
squats and you're doing because you're

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
squats and you're doing because you're
getting<00:01:43.890> stronger<00:01:44.190> you're<00:01:44.490> probably<00:01:44.700> doing

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
getting stronger you're probably doing

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
getting stronger you're probably doing
things<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.270> threes<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.929> fives

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
things like threes and fives

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.160 
things like threes and fives
that's<00:01:47.130> fine<00:01:47.399> continue<00:01:48.030> doing<00:01:48.300> that<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.990> on

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that's fine continue doing that but on

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.070 
that's fine continue doing that but on
that<00:01:49.320> last<00:01:49.710> set<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.179> many<00:01:51.479> reps<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
that last set do as many reps as you can

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.770 
that last set do as many reps as you can
then<00:01:52.590> immediately<00:01:53.340> lower<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> weight<00:01:54.479> by

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
then immediately lower the weight by

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.779 
then immediately lower the weight by
about<00:01:54.929> twenty<00:01:55.500> thirty<00:01:55.649> percent<00:01:56.190> so<00:01:56.610> maybe

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
about twenty thirty percent so maybe

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.850 
about twenty thirty percent so maybe
take<00:01:57.000> off<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:57.240> plate<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.440> many<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.740> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
take off a plate then do as many as you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.190 
take off a plate then do as many as you
