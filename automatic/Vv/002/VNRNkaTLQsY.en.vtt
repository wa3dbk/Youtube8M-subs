00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.070 
Diego today we're going to be
demonstrating<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.400> sacrilege

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.820 

in<00:00:09.200> this<00:00:09.530> instance<00:00:10.039> we

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
in this instance we

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.160 
in this instance we
successfully<00:00:11.760> to<00:00:12.000> treat<00:00:12.269> molasses<00:00:12.720> on<00:00:12.990> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
successfully to treat molasses on a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.020 
successfully to treat molasses on a
patient<00:00:13.680> there's<00:00:14.250> always<00:00:14.370> concern<00:00:14.879> with

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
patient there's always concern with

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.210 
patient there's always concern with
using<00:00:15.330> laces<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.870> darker<00:00:16.200> skin<00:00:16.410> types<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.920> is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
using laces of darker skin types this is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.360 
using laces of darker skin types this is
a<00:00:17.250> longer<00:00:17.520> wavelength<00:00:17.880> laser

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
a longer wavelength laser

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.280 
a longer wavelength laser
darker<00:00:20.330> skin<00:00:20.570> types

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.230 

so<00:00:25.770> we're<00:00:26.130> going<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.280> do<00:00:26.400> couple<00:00:26.730> things<00:00:26.910> on

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
so we're going to do couple things on

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.000 
so we're going to do couple things on
the<00:00:27.390> patient<00:00:27.690> has<00:00:27.780> a<00:00:27.810> carbon<00:00:28.260> lotion

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
the patient has a carbon lotion

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.830 
the patient has a carbon lotion
and<00:00:30.100> this<00:00:30.400> lights<00:00:30.700> our<00:00:30.940> first<00:00:31.210> copy

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
and this lights our first copy

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.819 
and this lights our first copy
we<00:00:31.900> allow<00:00:32.349> things

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
we allow things

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.959 
we allow things
take<00:00:33.980> that<00:00:34.160> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
take that on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.549 
take that on
for<00:00:36.090> generations<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.989> case

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
for generations the case

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.990 
for generations the case
and<00:00:38.920> then<00:00:39.039> I'm<00:00:39.129> going<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.309> do<00:00:39.430> some<00:00:39.820> quick

and then I'm going to do some quick

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.170 
and then I'm going to do some quick
