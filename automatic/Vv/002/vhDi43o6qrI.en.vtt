00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
just like grass does it has a root and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
just like grass does it has a root and
has<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> stem<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> drop<00:00:32.070> seeds<00:00:32.399> as

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
has a stem and then to drop seeds as

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.299 
has a stem and then to drop seeds as
well<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:34.110> get<00:00:34.260> rid<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.739> bamboo

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
well so to get rid of the bamboo

well so to get rid of the bamboo
you're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.149> rid<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> every

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you're going to have to get rid of every

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
you're going to have to get rid of every
single<00:00:37.950> piece<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> root<00:00:38.850> there's<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.750> no

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
single piece of root there's really no

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.380 
single piece of root there's really no
getting<00:00:40.290> out<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.030> couple

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
getting out of it so there's a couple

getting out of it so there's a couple
ways<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.989> accomplish<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.730> take

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ways to accomplish that you can take

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.450 
ways to accomplish that you can take
your<00:00:45.059> shovel<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> dig<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.860> deep<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.309> can

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
your shovel and dig as deep as you can

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.180 
your shovel and dig as deep as you can
and<00:00:47.730> dig<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.260> more<00:00:49.500> that's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and dig it out that's the more that's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
and dig it out that's the more that's
really<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:51.059> choice<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.719> rid<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
really your only choice to get rid of

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.010 
really your only choice to get rid of
all<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> roots<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:54.000> dig<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.629> dig<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
all the roots you just dig and dig and

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.770 
all the roots you just dig and dig and
dig<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> roots<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:56.030> another<00:00:57.030> easy<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.719> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
dig the roots out another easy way to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
dig the roots out another easy way to
get<00:00:57.989> rid<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.469> bamboo<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> becomes<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
get rid of that bamboo if it becomes a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.290 
get rid of that bamboo if it becomes a
problem<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> raised<00:01:01.710> bed<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> so

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
problem is make a raised bed over it so

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
problem is make a raised bed over it so
basically<00:01:03.600> there's<00:01:04.409> all<00:01:04.559> kinds<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.010> shade

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
basically there's all kinds of shade

basically there's all kinds of shade
cloth<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:06.650> vegetation<00:01:07.650> cloth<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.310> keeps

up if you can which is almost impossible
to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.979> when<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.850> thick<00:01:18.119> or

an easy trick just put some weed cloth
down<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.259> make<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> barrier<00:01:23.520> whether<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
down and make a barrier whether it's

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.320 
down and make a barrier whether it's
rocks<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> wood<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.159> fill<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.150> dirt

that way your bamboo is underneath that
cloth<00:01:30.860> eventually<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.220> try<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:32.640> its

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
like four feet of soil above that and

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
like four feet of soil above that and
for<00:01:59.009> years<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> years<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.700> years<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.180> should

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
for years and years and years you should

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.810 
for years and years and years you should
be<00:02:00.600> able<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.899> contain<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.670> good

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
be able to contain it and it's a good

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690 
be able to contain it and it's a good
way<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.750> deal<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.350> because<00:02:04.890> basically

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
way to deal with it because basically

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.670 
way to deal with it because basically
once<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.180> deep<00:02:06.360> into<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> ground<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.229> taken

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
once it's deep into the ground and taken

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.380 
once it's deep into the ground and taken
over<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.190> can't<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:08.940> deal<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.119> those

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
over you can't really deal with those

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.600 
over you can't really deal with those
areas<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.020> years<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.679> want<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.459> get

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
areas for years because you want to get

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.880 
areas for years because you want to get
those<00:02:11.849> roots<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.780> they<00:02:13.050> get<00:02:13.140> no<00:02:13.470> Sun

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
those roots so that they get no Sun

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.770 
those roots so that they get no Sun
for<00:02:14.220> years<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.580> years<00:02:14.640> eventually<00:02:15.180> they<00:02:15.540> will

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
for years and years eventually they will

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.040 
for years and years eventually they will
die<00:02:15.990> out<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.370> man<00:02:17.730> versus<00:02:18.270> bamboo<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.990> I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
die out so it is man versus bamboo and I

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.680 
die out so it is man versus bamboo and I
know<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.350> can<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.850> go<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
know you can do it so go out there and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.630 
know you can do it so go out there and
dig<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> up<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.920> still<00:02:23.190> don't<00:02:23.340> want<00:02:23.460> to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
dig it up and if you still don't want to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
dig it up and if you still don't want to
deal<00:02:23.820> with<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.150> cover<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.690> up<00:02:24.840> put<00:02:25.560> your<00:02:25.650> shed

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
deal with it cover it up put your shed

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.400 
deal with it cover it up put your shed
on<00:02:26.100> top<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.760> put<00:02:27.150> plastic<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.810> top<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.260> it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
on top of it put plastic on top of it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.870 
on top of it put plastic on top of it
put<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.710> swimming<00:02:29.070> pool<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.280> top<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.760> it
