00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 greet friends with you romance and in this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.670
 video i will show you how to play a little song in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.670
 a grasshopper sat on the grass 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.900
 [music] 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 [music] 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.740
 then 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.120
 something like this means what it is 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:36.020
 first you pinch it the first part 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:38.870
 and so we pinch 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.280
 release the first string on the fifth fret 5 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.820
 play on 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.470
 empty 1 1 on the fifth again 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 the plot is again empty 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.550
 you are 5 by 5 and the fourth two times 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.310
 now we do the same with the fourth 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:03.070
 fret that is 4 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:08.030
 empty 4 points 4 and here 5 goes 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:15.320
 twice it turns 5 lats empty 5 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.299
 empty 5 4 2 times 4 empty 4 to 2 4 5 2 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 times 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.950
 then repeats again 5 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 there is only one here 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.040
 ok i think that this is a problem 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:39.950
 will arise then you play 5 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:44.740
 7 and 3 times again repeated at 7 5 7 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.740
 8 3 times in the eighth 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:57.260
 then twice sought 1 8 7 5 4 5 2 times 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.260
 one more time 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:20.210
 [music] 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:22.280
 after 5 7 taking 8 8 times 8 7 5 4 5 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.430
 and repeat this thing only then one 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.430
 time 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 [music] 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.650
 that's basically all friends 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.400
 judging because you're looking for a song in the grass 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.760
 a grasshopper was sitting 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.250
 most likely you are a beginner guitarist and I 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.470
 I consider it my duty to share with you 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.690
 their understanding of what the main mistake 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.230
 beginner guitarists commit 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.820
 that is, very often we learn not to play 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.459
 what we really like is 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.570
 we start to teach we think that those 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.300
 songs that say 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.280
 we like them too complex and need 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.560
 start with something as simple as 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.239
 grass sitting grasshopper actually is 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.660
 very common mistake which 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.930
 significantly lengthens your development path 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.580
 playing your learning to play the guitar then 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.670

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.930
