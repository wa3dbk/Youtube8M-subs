00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 say that for me dance team 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.190
 it is about the same as it is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.930
 creative people and that's how they can't 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.089
 live without your creativity here that is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 she also probably has another one 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.500
 support naturally this decoration 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.960
 basketball is the result of our training 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 this is what we show viewers on 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.720
 games is just beyond words tom 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.059
 that emotions are going wild for joy 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.489
 happiness lurking in the image to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.489
 convey that you are energy to the viewer 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.210
 on 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.909
 but 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 but 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.229
 I like this energy which 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.280
 comes from fans I like 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:56.869
 film criticism that comes from the players 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.450
 this very power from playing these emotions and me 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.430
 like to be part of the help team 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.250
 I like the team more 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.170
 Of course to dance because in general 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.250
 I don't know how people can live without dancing 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.670
 we have a lot of dance schools where 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.250
 good quality dancers are preparing 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.260
 girls are also sportswomen 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.470
 gymnastics which is then just somewhere 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.959
 go away disappears they are not visible and not heard 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.780
 why dance team can't become one 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.820
 the place where you come where you get paid 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.209
 where you can earn go out 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.280
 decent playground in beautiful costumes with 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.650
 beautiful choreography us it all on 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.880
 really a whole world that can 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.830
 to dive at all with the head whether to live and 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.910
 evolve in this while showing 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.329
 my successes 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.820
 all its advantages and i think it is 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.390
 it should be interesting for everyone there I am 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.310
 I think that we are all the same it will be your 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.730
 slightly loud casino but I still 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.350
 in the female face of our team I think 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.350
 fans would be bored without us 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.660
 by 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.650
 I'm in sauce 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.120
 caisson either 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.120

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.819

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.819

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.410
