00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
difficult but I think the most important

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.170 
difficult but I think the most important
is<00:05:52.020> she<00:05:53.020> choose<00:05:53.290> what<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.860> expect<00:05:54.310> best<00:05:54.760> better

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
is she choose what to expect best better

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.120 
is she choose what to expect best better
for<00:05:55.510> her<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:56.950> course<00:05:57.040> you're<00:05:57.460> gonna<00:05:57.580> have

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.550 
for her and of course you're gonna have
our<00:05:58.340> supports<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.600> most<00:05:59.840> important<00:06:00.380> for<00:06:00.530> me

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
our supports the most important for me

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.420 
our supports the most important for me
is<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:00.950> they<00:06:01.160> are<00:06:01.250> good<00:06:01.580> persons<00:06:02.030> and

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
is that they are good persons and

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.550 
is that they are good persons and
responsible<00:06:04.430> is<00:06:04.520> what<00:06:05.450> they<00:06:05.630> do<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:06.170> the<00:06:06.320> rest

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560
