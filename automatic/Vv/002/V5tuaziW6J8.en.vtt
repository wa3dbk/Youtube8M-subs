00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
beneficial to think the tester will be

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.380 
beneficial to think the tester will be
for<00:00:53.769> you<00:00:53.829> guys<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.010> see<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.399> helps<00:00:55.030> that<00:00:55.180> goal

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
lot for seeing how we compare to other

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.540 
lot for seeing how we compare to other
teams<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.370> how<00:01:06.550> much<00:01:07.450> progress<00:01:07.780> we<00:01:08.230> make<00:01:08.800> we

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
teams and how much progress we make we

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.040 
teams and how much progress we make we
use<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.730> lot<00:01:09.970> of<00:01:10.000> spark<00:01:10.300> grading<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> lot<00:01:11.020> of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
use a lot of spark grading and a lot of

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.800 
use a lot of spark grading and a lot of
their<00:01:11.230> exercises<00:01:11.800> as<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.130> is<00:01:12.250> and<00:01:13.120> we<00:01:13.270> practice

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
their exercises as it is and we practice

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.720 
their exercises as it is and we practice
and<00:01:13.990> practice<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.650> practice<00:01:14.800> so<00:01:15.310> now<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.520> we

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
and practice and practice so now that we

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.540 
and practice and practice so now that we
have<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.060> scores<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:16.600> sort<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.870> find<00:01:17.140> out

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
have the scores and we sort of find out

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.149 
have the scores and we sort of find out
individually<00:01:18.550> which<00:01:18.730> kid<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.900> team<00:01:20.890> wise

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
individually which kid is and team wise

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.460 
individually which kid is and team wise
where<00:01:21.700> our<00:01:21.850> scores<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.420> will<00:01:23.020> probably<00:01:23.439> take

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
where our scores that will probably take

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.050 
where our scores that will probably take
these<00:01:23.770> scores<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.310> sort<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.549> attack<00:01:24.850> those

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
these scores and sort of attack those

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.969 
these scores and sort of attack those
exercises<00:01:25.570> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
exercises that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.279 
exercises that

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
Gaston so if you read about spark before

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.690 
Gaston so if you read about spark before
he<00:01:28.350> came<00:01:28.469> out<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.649> said<00:01:28.979> what'd<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.549> hear<00:01:29.640> about

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Berkeley has some hurdles probably for

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.830 
Berkeley has some hurdles probably for
those<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.189> investments<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.479> I've<00:01:36.689> seen
