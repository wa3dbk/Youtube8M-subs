00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.250 
sort of you know how you want to use it
but<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.820> straightforward<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.960> I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
but it was really straightforward so I

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440 
but it was really straightforward so I
mean<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.220> me<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.610> encouraging<00:02:26.820> if

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
mean that to me is really encouraging if

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
mean that to me is really encouraging if
that's<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.380> future<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.340> me<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.670> that's<00:02:29.820> what

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
that's the future to me if that's what

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.150 
that's the future to me if that's what
the<00:02:30.150> future<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.590> be<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the future is it's going to be and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.980 
the future is it's going to be and
that's<00:02:32.190> that'd<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.000> great<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.660> kind<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> like

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
that's that'd be great it's kind of like

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.930 
that's that'd be great it's kind of like
Super<00:02:34.290> Mario<00:02:34.350> Brothers<00:02:34.680> except<00:02:35.130> for<00:02:35.310> Linux<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
Super Mario Brothers except for Linux so

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.790 
Super Mario Brothers except for Linux so
you<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.330> flex<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.900> penguin<00:02:37.260> percent<00:02:37.709> of

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you have flex the penguin percent of

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.970 
you have flex the penguin percent of
that<00:02:37.830> scenario<00:02:38.520> Oh
