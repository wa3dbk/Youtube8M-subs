00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
want to highlight is that we have this

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.739 
want to highlight is that we have this
tipping<00:01:48.469> on<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.799> inside<00:01:49.189> of<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.789> zip<00:01:50.359> baffle

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
zip and what that allows for is a really

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.059 
zip and what that allows for is a really
easy<00:02:03.709> glade<00:02:04.520> zip<00:02:05.270> as<00:02:06.020> I've<00:02:06.740> just<00:02:06.859> mentioned

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:07.069 
easy glade zip as I've just mentioned

buffle<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:09.319> it<00:02:09.410> runs<00:02:09.560> all<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.800> way<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.369> the

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
buffle so it runs all the way for the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.340 
buffle so it runs all the way for the
length<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.030> zip<00:02:11.209> and<00:02:11.810> what<00:02:11.960> that's<00:02:12.140> there
