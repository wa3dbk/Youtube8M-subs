from a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle set

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
from a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle set
from<00:01:03.049> things<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.140> drag<00:01:04.710> attack<00:01:05.810> it's<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
from things like drag attack it's a it's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899 
from things like drag attack it's a it's
the<00:01:07.500> smallest<00:01:07.740> wonder<00:01:08.189> sets<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:08.700> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the smallest wonder sets that they have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.310 
the smallest wonder sets that they have
and<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.659> has<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.290> things<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.030> um

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
and he has to these things that um

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
and he has to these things that um
they're<00:01:13.320> actually<00:01:13.770> panini<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.939> they

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
they're actually panini because they

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
they're actually panini because they
actually<00:01:15.960> correspond<00:01:16.820> with<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.140> UM<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.640> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually correspond with the UM with the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.510 
actually correspond with the UM with the
things<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.450> got<00:01:22.439> made<00:01:23.570> sets<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> green

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
things that got made sets at the green

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.450 
things that got made sets at the green
then<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> yellow<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> red<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:29.130> make<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
then the yellow then the red to make the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.399 
then the yellow then the red to make the
fire<00:01:29.640> burn<00:01:29.909> hotter<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> engine<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:33.409> so

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
fire burn hotter for the engine and so

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.649 
fire burn hotter for the engine and so
let's<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.250> look<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.820> train<00:01:36.560> as

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
let's actually look at a train as

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
let's actually look at a train as
buffers<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:41.930> has<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.460> ladder<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.990> they<00:01:46.710> we

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
buffers and has the ladder and they we

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.460 
buffers and has the ladder and they we
have<00:01:47.130> couple<00:01:47.820> guns<00:01:48.530> they<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:49.770> integrate

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
have couple guns they could integrate

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
have couple guns they could integrate
passenger<00:01:52.470> coach<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.820> have<00:01:54.149> bunch<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
passenger coach you have bunch of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.020 
passenger coach you have bunch of
passages<00:01:56.329> here<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> couple<00:01:57.810> logs<00:01:58.439> oh

passages here we have a couple logs oh

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.930 
passages here we have a couple logs oh
by<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.630> string

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
by some string

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.100 
by some string
that<00:02:02.690> tender<00:02:03.200> with<00:02:03.790> these<00:02:04.790> wood<00:02:05.330> with<00:02:05.990> the

that tender with these wood with the
word<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:08.680> near<00:02:09.680> we<00:02:10.100> have<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:11.300> train

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
word and near we have the train

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.190 
word and near we have the train
conductor<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:16.280> now<00:02:16.640> this<00:02:16.850> P<00:02:17.120> touch<00:02:17.330> panel<00:02:17.810> go

it's<00:02:51.110> called<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:52.340> train<00:02:52.580> number<00:02:52.730> one

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
it's called and this train number one

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.220 
it's called and this train number one
131<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.820> told<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.240> in<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.510> second

$1 resonant but here's the cool thing
about<00:03:01.100> this<00:03:01.430> chain<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.260> actually<00:03:03.770> not

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
about this chain this is actually not

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.640 
about this chain this is actually not
what<00:03:04.520> it<00:03:04.640> seems

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
what it seems

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.040 
what it seems
because<00:03:07.750> if<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.989> think<00:03:09.020> back<00:03:10.209> what<00:03:11.209> has<00:03:11.540> those

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
because if you think back what has those

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.340 
because if you think back what has those
wheels<00:03:12.560> warfare<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:14.300> same<00:03:14.600> kind<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.020> train

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
wheels warfare the same kind of train

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.930 
wheels warfare the same kind of train
design<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.739> same<00:03:19.010> kind<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.640> coupling

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
design and the same kind of coupling

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.260 
design and the same kind of coupling
design<00:03:21.880> there<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.770> was<00:03:24.770> actually<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.940> ghost

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
design there that was actually the ghost

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.170 
design there that was actually the ghost
train<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:27.280> transformed<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.880> back<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
train I transformed it to the back to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.660 
train I transformed it to the back to
future<00:03:29.360> train<00:03:29.720> by<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.200> some<00:03:30.980> modifications

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
future train by I some modifications

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.290 
future train by I some modifications
take<00:03:32.239> up<00:03:32.420> some<00:03:32.630> putts<00:03:32.900> make<00:03:33.800> it<00:03:34.070> a<00:03:34.300> ghost

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
take up some putts make it a ghost

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.250 
take up some putts make it a ghost
longer<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.820> actually<00:03:37.820> make<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.510> bit<00:03:39.050> better

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
longer and actually make it a bit better

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.949 
longer and actually make it a bit better
as<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.640> say<00:03:41.330> so<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:43.519> this<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.980> my<00:03:45.980> back<00:03:46.459> in<00:03:46.640> future

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
as I say so so this is my back in future

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.229 
as I say so so this is my back in future
