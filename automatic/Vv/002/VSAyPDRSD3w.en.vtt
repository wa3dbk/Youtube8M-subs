and it came out in this little area
right<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.600> tough<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
right in here so it's really tough to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.540 
right in here so it's really tough to
get<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> pinky<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
get in here but you can use a pinky to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.619 
get in here but you can use a pinky to
get<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:59.300> excuse<00:01:00.300> me<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.449> keep

get in there and and excuse me I keep

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.650 
get in there and and excuse me I keep
moving<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.020> thing<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.579> to<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.090> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
moving this thing here to get it out and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.649 
moving this thing here to get it out and
what<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> found<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:07.909> just<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.180> had<00:01:09.479> been

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
what I found was just what had been

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.560 
what I found was just what had been
described<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.799> another<00:01:11.250> video<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.939> saw<00:01:12.270> on

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
described in with another video I saw on

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.060 
described in with another video I saw on
YouTube<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:17.570> bearing<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:19.439> I'm<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
YouTube is the bearing here I'm kind of

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.740 
YouTube is the bearing here I'm kind of
pinched<00:01:20.520> underneath<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.450> broken

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
pinched underneath here but it's broken

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
pinched underneath here but it's broken
and<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> problem<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.030> steering

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and that's the problem with my steering

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
and that's the problem with my steering
right<00:01:24.780> there<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.280> simply<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> take

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
right there so I'm simply going to take

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
right there so I'm simply going to take
the<00:01:28.009> other<00:01:32.840> hex<00:01:33.840> bearing<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:36.450> I'm<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.650> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
the other hex bearing and I'm going to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.230 
the other hex bearing and I'm going to
find<00:01:37.890> where<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
find where I'm at and then I'm going to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.080 
find where I'm at and then I'm going to
just<00:01:39.829> slide<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.420> right<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.540> through<00:01:42.750> here

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
just slide that in right up through here

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.300 
just slide that in right up through here
slide<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.329> right<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.310> that's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
slide that right in there and that's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.270 
slide that right in there and that's
going<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> put<00:01:47.820> me<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.229> feel<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:49.950> way

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
going to put me and I can feel my way

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to put me and I can feel my way
through<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> set<00:01:52.439> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
through that and you can get it set in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.380 
through that and you can get it set in
there<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:53.159> I'm<00:01:53.460> predicting<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there I think I'm predicting this is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
there I think I'm predicting this is
going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> take<00:01:54.780> me<00:01:54.899> about<00:01:54.990> 15<00:01:55.500> minutes<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
going to take me about 15 minutes to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.719 
going to take me about 15 minutes to
complete<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:57.020> repair<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.310> remains<00:01:59.579> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
complete this repair but that remains to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.800 
complete this repair but that remains to
be<00:01:59.759> seen<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.750> right

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
be seen but that's where I'm at right

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.609 
be seen but that's where I'm at right
now<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.540> we<00:02:03.990> should<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.259> good<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.500> go

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
now and and then we should be good to go

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.780 
now and and then we should be good to go
but<00:02:04.920> I'll<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.189> back<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> minute
