00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.339
 God has done great things in this 40-day campaign of fasting and prayer 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.400
 It all started with a lady I remember from our church 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.350
 who made a phone call to me 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.450
 saying went 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.420
 God has spoken to my heart. 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.730
 that our church should honor 40 days of fasting art in favor of our 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.050
 church 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.009
 as soon as this is a goal is this vision 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.300
 there I clearly felt from the holy spirit that she of God a challenge 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.089
 and I accepted the challenge 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:37.300
 and it was amazing the way God started to put it in my mind 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.590
 is the entire structure the campaign period 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.680
 that not being reached is very similar to the campaign 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.690
 of the 40-day proposal that Pastor Rick Warren 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 fc with his church spread around the world 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.149
 So we decided to do it. 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.109
 in a drive - church so that all I see the lady always god me 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.239
 led to make a book with 40 devotions and prayer requests 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.739
 very specific 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:04.610
 why like that 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.260
 we will be praying in concordance the whole church crying out the blessings of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
 God not only for our church but also for our city 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.330
 but something interesting happened 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.390
 some shepherds of an alliance that we have here a communion of shepherds 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.020
 they knew of our 40-day campaign and they then also asked 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.600
 after correction we would like to participate and of course it was an honor to me 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.060
 is to spread this campaign to other churches as well 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 and it was impressive how those pastors entered church schools were 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 blessed 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.289
 we started to see 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.729
 extraordinary things happening in individual lives 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.350
 happening in cities 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.710
 crime reducing vehicle theft decreased a number of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.499
 things 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.480
 we were very excited 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.160
 and we made the decision to open the campaign to several other pastors and 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.000
 start to 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.270
 national level and we started to spread the word through the internet and he 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.340
 began to operate and do extraordinary things and we praise God 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.100
 for what he has done just so you have an idea I have here 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.209
 some numbers that 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.489
 which show the art 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.519
 so the growth of this campaign in 2006 was when our church 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.919
 first Baptist church in santo andré made only her 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.269
 these shepherds knew and asked us for the book of the grandmothers or more then 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.239
 when the year of 2007 arrived 83 days 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.409
 participated in this campaign has already been a tremendous blessing. 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.980

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.380
 we had 653 oas 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 approximately 180 thousand people. 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.179

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:52.099

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.299
 and four hundred thousand people 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.080

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.459
 that was the success 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.379

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.449
 changes of our nation 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.700
 if you pay close attention 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
 It's incredible what God has done in the Brazilian nation. 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.739
 in the last five years 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.609

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.109
 take a look 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.709

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.109
 focus on families 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.590
 we have noticed a 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.439
 on here 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.439
 violent account of Brazilian families 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.499
 and an even destruction attack 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.889

 It is incredible how the number of divorces has increased so much confusion and 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.050
 families 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.680

 the family values ​​seem to be deteriorating, it's time to 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.599

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.690
 the role of the husband in the marriage role of the wife 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.240
