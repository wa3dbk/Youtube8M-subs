runner<00:01:18.150> before<00:01:19.220> then<00:01:20.220> you've<00:01:20.580> built<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.150> solid

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
runner before then you've built a solid

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
runner before then you've built a solid
foundation<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> strength<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.409> five<00:01:22.590> by<00:01:22.710> five

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
foundation of strength with five by five

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100 
foundation of strength with five by five
great<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.670> did<00:01:24.060> its<00:01:24.210> job<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> need<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
great it did its job but you need to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.420 
great it did its job but you need to
change<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.470> program<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> need

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
change your program right now you need

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
change your program right now you need
to<00:01:26.490> become<00:01:26.790> far<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.060> anabolic<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.530> way

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
to become far more anabolic and the way

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.830 
to become far more anabolic and the way
you're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> receive<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.210> anabolic

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you're going to receive this anabolic

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.330 
you're going to receive this anabolic
response<00:01:31.200> from<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.530> bodies<00:01:31.829> we're<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.159> very

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
response from your bodies we're all very

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.760 
response from your bodies we're all very
different<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.850> with<00:01:33.630> higher<00:01:33.869> volume<00:01:34.560> higher

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
different is with higher volume higher

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.980 
different is with higher volume higher
frequency<00:01:35.369> work<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.150> reason<00:01:36.390> why<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.509> say<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
frequency work the reason why I say that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.469 
frequency work the reason why I say that
is<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.710> your<00:01:38.490> build<00:01:38.850> first<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> all

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
is because of your build first of all

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.810 
is because of your build first of all
you're<00:01:39.630> 31<00:01:39.840> years<00:01:39.990> old<00:01:40.229> 150<00:01:40.860> pounds<00:01:41.280> even
