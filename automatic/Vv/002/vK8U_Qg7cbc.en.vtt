00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.470
 Gorgeous tahiti was here by rios 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.069
 I warmly welcome you to one 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.110
 watching new episode leaves today 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.870
 a topic which I very often e-mails 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.580
 wars of people turning into calories 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.289
 deficit but put in the dry 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.130
 Nevertheless, do not lose weight 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 of course a very frustrating one 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 Frustrate the event when you are 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 Finally, always the broken 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.470
 to lose motivation as a sign 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.670
 and has all the prerequisites for it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 fulfilled and then it works anyway 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.439
 not or 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 It works after a certain time 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.440
 not that is very important there is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 some points at which it most 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.579
 this is probably directly to us 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 by the point 1.1 I unfortunately 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 but relatively often find that 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.670
 people their real calorie needs 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.829
 do not know that means they say that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 they have used any tool online to 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.250
 to calculate their calorie needs and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 now, for example, then just 300 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.760
 calories have eaten less and after 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.989
 four weeks anyway, nothing decreased 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.170
 have or maybe even increased 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.899
 have to say can be easily 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 These tools are in the end one 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.670
 illustration of the theory so that is how 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.850
 someone most likely calories 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.790
 burns over the day based on 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.950
 Body size weight sex 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 level of activity such things and so 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.259
 you will most likely already be in 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.390
 to come the direction 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.860
 the real calorie requirement per day 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 but of course everyone is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.060
 different everyone has easy on 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.040
 different metabolism each 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.630
 maybe another one too 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 advanced musculature in one 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 Progress in different 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 training training stand 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 different activity levels during the day 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 then runs to the bus edges to the bus 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 goes to work in the morning with a bicycle 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.829
 How often does a week work out? 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 that made the weekend hike remains 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.369
 at home in front of the television what does he do 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.439
 Such things are in the evening 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.880
 an incredible number of factors yours 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.790
 calorie balance in the infectious day 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.100
 but influence this tracking 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.969
 calculator not at all in the end 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.170
 yes, because they are simple 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.310
 this data does not know what that means 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.159
 they really have to do somehow 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.930
 to find out real calorie needs 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.670
 just a week in the end 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.969
 to check their calories and then 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.439
 look 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.729
 I've lost weight. I've gained weight 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.950
 and thus also their calorie 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.510
 adjust until you are back 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.370
 lose weight even more and more 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.750
 your real calorie for that is the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.980
 The information is incredibly important 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 You do not need to raise them very often 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 they have to stop raising once so you 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.840
 really knows how the rabbit is running 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.400
 that's the first point of his 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.560
 real calorie needs then know 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 Can you really be deficient and sit 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.500
 then successes see point number 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 two that I see very often is that 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.459
 people are in deficit and afterwards 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.650
 For example, month very good weight 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.760
 lose and then see it in the month 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.680
 All right it is not possible now 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.910
 further the problem is the following if 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.620
 The body realizes that he no longer 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.780
 the necessary energy per day gets yes 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.800
 For example , instead of 3000 calories 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.040
 as I currently do for example 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.620
 only 27 then the body will start 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.620
 certain metabolic processes certain 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.090
 body body processes to break down 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 that starts with things like the beginning 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.569
 you are a bit, for example 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.550
 unfocused he could not be complex 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.140
 brain teasers longer solve since tired he 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.180
 the body releases hormones 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.560
 that just have to take more breaks 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.569
 so as not to burn so much calories 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.120
 you can not do that very much 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.989
 Do not take an extreme form like that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.129
 more correctly the blood circulation 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.629
 works or that for example 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.700
 the body's body temperature 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.920
 Lower body temperature 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.200
 means burning more energy therefore 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.370
 can lower body temperature 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 Defective calorie needs also lowered 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.430
 be from the body 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.069
 therefore, your goal should be general 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.080
 first no huge no huge 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.010
 calories deficit but now on 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.209
 the question to come back 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.519
 that means, for example, if 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.370
 you put yourself in 300 deficit then it is 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.590
 it from my experience about three to three 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.840
 four weeks at the latest at three 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.250
 weeks that the calories with the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.310
 calorie deficits usually no longer 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.629
 enough that is does not start already 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.010
 in the beginning with too high a calorie 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.330
 deficit but rather get in your way 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.980
 a little bit ahead 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.110
 so that everyone still has the possibility that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.560
 calorie deficits in the end too 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.450
 reduce 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.590
 that means the point now again 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.140
 return 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.310
 if you do not lose anymore then that is 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.080
 calorie deficit most likely 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.569
 currently too small or her 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:15.139
 Metabolism has adapted so that 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.750
 He simply less calories per day 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:20.940
 I need a lot of point number three 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.500
 is often very certain that people 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.389
 activities such as training 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.300
 if you train five times a week 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.410
 Too high to classify that is her name 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.600
 For example, look in the tracking 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 apps and the tracking app says 60 per 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.020
 a few minutes hand live 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.610
 burn the 700 calories or 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.950
 Many rely on it because they 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.720
 just see this value close by 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.430
 and know about your food 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.120
 that 's actually pretty accurate and 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.160
 so what you have, for example, 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560
 question because that our points to 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.780
 example 600 calories 100 calories first 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.970
 for example with me that's about 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.800
 a quarter of total daily requirement 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.050
 will that mean if you ever been there 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.789
 it can be really grossly wrong then 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.169
 have very significant influence 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.930
 on your weight loss 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.889
 or your weight gain that 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.210
 means you definitely in any case 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.500
 beat you several values one 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.850
 I tried a bit for a while 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:11.760
 such position for 60 minutes workout 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.450
 about 400 calories and riders so much 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.889
 good now have no high intensity 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.849
 unit just something in my training 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:23.190
 are still relatively comfortable training 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.479
 yes, but without breaks and cardio 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.830
 For example , calculate extra again 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.440
 if I then run extra again 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.530
 go or something 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.229
 point number four is very near inaccurate 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.639
 Tracking things like when people 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.440
 not exactly program input look 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.060
 or for example the fat in the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.380
 pan does not count coconut oil the flag 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.479
 make think yes the five program 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.160
 coconut oil we do not have much work too 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.610
 50 calories yes and always something like that 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.200
 happens more often then it is also summed up 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.610
 That's why they were 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.740
 the four points number one in the 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.750
 he really knows his calorie needs 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.289
 and not just yourself somewhere 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.240
 let have 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.770
 point number two that the 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.289
 Metabolism adapts throughout and 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.180
 where appropriate, your combustion him reason 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.490
 has slowed down 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.590
 point number three that one just 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.699
 Really, everything becomes clear how much 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.650
 I really burn in mine 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.310
 activities or terrible too 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.750
 too much 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.910
 point number four that you do the things 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.020
 really just four points the 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.190
 actually most ask 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.810
 answer the messages that I have 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.850
 I hope I could 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.360
 Represent fairly well as they do 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.009
 now the next time I love 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.600
 hope you liked the video if 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:29.820
 you support me for a business 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.280
 want to give then the video like hetfield 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.530
 Best old friends of products 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.810
 hurts and jim ross looks this 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.650
 Shop over it gets really extreme 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.330
 mean a lot 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.680
 we build up the company and 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.050
 German company what jobs 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.060
 creates in germany and what customers 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.979
 A smile in the whole world 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.259
 we shall try to conjure a face 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:51.240
 fitness and bodybuilding piece better too

 I'm definitely looking forward to it 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.449
 Now say thank you that we are
