00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
recent weeks I didn't think they were

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.759 
recent weeks I didn't think they were
that<00:00:44.039> bad<00:00:44.249> against<00:00:44.760> Fulham<00:00:45.120> yeah<00:00:45.679> that's<00:00:46.679> a

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
that bad against Fulham yeah that's a

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.939 
that bad against Fulham yeah that's a
tough<00:00:46.949> game<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.809> last<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.230> she<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> did

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
tough game they last and she like I did

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.430 
tough game they last and she like I did
change<00:00:50.249> it<00:00:50.489> second<00:00:51.149> half<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.289> they

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
played much better and these purely and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.090 
played much better and these purely and
simply<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:55.019> as<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.469> system<00:00:55.829> isn't<00:00:55.949> working

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
simply down as the system isn't working

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
simply down as the system isn't working
and<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> way<00:00:56.699> he's<00:00:56.850> got<00:00:56.999> those<00:00:57.120> players<00:00:57.390> out

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the end it was that's it was and it

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.609 
the end it was that's it was and it
worked<00:01:09.329> out<00:01:09.509> for<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> best<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.110> chassis

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
worked out for the best because chassis

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
worked out for the best because chassis
managed<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> win<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.759> ya<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
managed to win that game but ya know I

managed to win that game but ya know I
mean<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.649> they<00:01:13.740> won't<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> go

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
mean it was that they won't want to go

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.649 
mean it was that they won't want to go
through<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.399> again<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:14.939> often<00:01:15.270> no<00:01:15.509> they
