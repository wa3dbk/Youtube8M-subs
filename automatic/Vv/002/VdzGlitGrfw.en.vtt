00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.630
 hello to all and fabien I present to you 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.340
 how to get out of the seat map of two 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.500
 different ways optimized with the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.880
 river nile method and the mastodon 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 you can see that I'm trying to 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.080
 to give a simple knife stab 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.600
 takes off in height not in length and 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.860
 that's not allowing me to get out of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.190
 the map or do something 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.930
 else 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.640
 well I presented you this method 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.200
 when your teammate is equipped with a 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.920
 behemoth give you simply 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.660
 a stab 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.680
 and there you see the result you 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.970
 take off clearly higher is 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 far further you have two 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.420
 different ways of being able to get out of 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.860
 this map so the first one is from 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.660
 fall in the same place as me on the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.920
 video so in this case you can 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.330
 do the same path I am in 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.040
 doing to be able to get out 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.420
 so this is the hardest exit 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.950
 of the two so-called difficult games she is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.240
 not really difficult but she is 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.369
 still more complicated than the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.720
 second we make you the same way 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.220
 that I care about you there is 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.590
 small the edge and small ledge to good 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.119
 follow along the way if ever 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.340
 you shift a little too much to the right 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.540
 you will fall in the water is seen more 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.180
 top is not textures and well you 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.010
 go across what and saw that 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.780
 when you go in usually in 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.950
 under a map you take a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.770
 debt barriers and so you will die 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.299
 so suddenly the glitch will stop there 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.320
 so that's very simple course for 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.180
 go out of the map 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.470
 I also want to clarify that this 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.960
 method with the mastodon she is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 much simpler than the one with the 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.979
 months but in addition to that the fastest 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.020
 given that a web a hit of kmc 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.640
 25 elimination a juggernaut without the 10 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.979
 and if in addition you take the records 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 killstreaks assault bunkers pardon 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.390
 you can make two behemoths 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.189
 in 11 elimination or take match on behalf 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080
 of fu is a normal mastodon and you 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.549
 have 2 and more of that when you 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 you give a crush on a 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.600
 mastodon he does not die directly 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.799
 you have to give a dozen to 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.509
 so they die so that's it 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.070
 frankly gives a lot of tests to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.420
 able to realize while she if ever 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.700
 you do with the kmm strike you 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.440
 make a stroke and get screwed 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.209
 these fairs and you have 25 elimination 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.070
 in the baba you have to redo it and in 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.870
 more of that so the last thing is 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.970
 that a detail but it's always without 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.000
 your vision will not be orange being 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.440
 given that you will not have called 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.300
 two strikes of coësmes will not you 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.630
 not the ugly orange radiation on the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.190
 map 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.710
 so see that the second author populated 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.880
 looks a lot like the one we 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.110
 could do with the typing of coësmes 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.850
 it's just a little different there is a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.350
 little bigger way to go 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.550
 so I hope it's him of you will have 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.900
 more if it is the case do not hesitate to 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.100
 let go of a layman and I find myself at very 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.670
 soon for the next video to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.670
 letters on everyone
