00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
look at what they are the first one is

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.810 
look at what they are the first one is
portrait<00:01:43.820> mode<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:45.399> portrait<00:01:46.399> mode<00:01:46.460> your

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
portrait mode in portrait mode your

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.859 
portrait mode in portrait mode your
camera<00:01:47.350> will<00:01:48.350> set<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.490> aperture<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.509> very

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
wide aperture so that it will decrease

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.830 
wide aperture so that it will decrease
the<00:01:55.280> depth<00:01:55.520> of<00:01:55.700> field<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:56.360> that<00:01:56.540> does<00:01:56.780> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
the depth of field and what that does is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.410 
the depth of field and what that does is
it<00:01:57.110> caused<00:01:57.409> a<00:01:57.619> causes<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.399> blurred<00:01:58.759> background

field<00:02:26.849> as<00:02:27.030> possible<00:02:27.629> because<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.989> want

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
field as possible because you want

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.210 
field as possible because you want
everything<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.220> image<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.599> focus

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
everything in the image to be in focus

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.199 
everything in the image to be in focus
so<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.700> uses<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.720> smaller<00:02:34.349> aperture<00:02:35.209> to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
so it uses a smaller aperture to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.270 
so it uses a smaller aperture to
increase<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.900> depth<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.260> field<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.799> get

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
increase the depth of field and get

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.080 
increase the depth of field and get
everything<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.760> focus<00:02:39.769> now<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.970> be

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
everything in focus now you have to be

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.850 
everything in focus now you have to be
aware<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.739> using<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.830> smaller<00:02:44.129> aperture<00:02:44.780> also

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
aware that using a smaller aperture also

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.440 
aware that using a smaller aperture also
necessarily<00:02:46.860> slows<00:02:47.489> down<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.879> shutter<00:02:48.090> speed

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
necessarily slows down the shutter speed

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.530 
necessarily slows down the shutter speed
so<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.040> tripod<00:02:50.790> or<00:02:51.000> some<00:02:51.299> place<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
so if you have a tripod or some place to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.960 
so if you have a tripod or some place to
rest<00:02:52.019> your<00:02:52.170> camera<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.280> stays<00:02:53.549> steady

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
rest your camera so that it stays steady

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.600 
rest your camera so that it stays steady
you'll<00:02:54.810> be<00:02:54.989> much<00:02:55.140> better<00:02:55.200> off<00:02:55.530> using<00:02:56.250> this

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
you'll be much better off using this

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.559 
you'll be much better off using this

now<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:26.430> a<00:03:26.609> really<00:03:26.790> good<00:03:27.180> idea<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
now it's a really good idea to have a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.400 
now it's a really good idea to have a
special<00:03:29.069> lens<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:29.910> macro<00:03:30.359> one<00:03:31.109> that<00:03:31.290> is

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
special lens for macro one that is

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.770 
special lens for macro one that is
totally<00:03:31.889> dedicated<00:03:32.099> to<00:03:32.489> taking<00:03:32.849> those<00:03:33.209> macro

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
totally dedicated to taking those macro

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.069 
totally dedicated to taking those macro
shots<00:03:34.109> because<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.829> glass<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:36.480> lens<00:03:36.720> is

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
shots because the glass in the lens is

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.099 
shots because the glass in the lens is
different<00:03:37.799> than<00:03:38.069> in<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.400> regular<00:03:38.910> lens<00:03:39.120> okay

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
different than in a regular lens okay

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.740 
different than in a regular lens okay
the<00:03:40.380> next<00:03:40.650> setting<00:03:40.859> is<00:03:41.099> for<00:03:41.639> sports<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
the next setting is for sports the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.569 
the next setting is for sports the
sports<00:03:43.079> mode<00:03:43.380> it<00:03:43.590> looks<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> little

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
sports mode it looks like a little

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.240 
sports mode it looks like a little
runner<00:03:44.849> now<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.019> doesn't<00:03:46.530> have<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:46.919> be<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
runner now this doesn't have to be just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.400 
runner now this doesn't have to be just
for<00:03:47.790> sports<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.599> be<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.930> any<00:03:49.079> kind<00:03:49.349> of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
for sports but it can be for any kind of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.740 
for sports but it can be for any kind of
action<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.919> what<00:03:50.099> it<00:03:50.220> does<00:03:50.400> it's<00:03:50.669> it<00:03:50.940> sets<00:03:51.599> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
action and what it does it's it sets the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.110 
action and what it does it's it sets the
camera<00:03:52.290> automatically<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.549> something<00:03:53.880> called

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
camera automatically to something called

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.409 
camera automatically to something called
a<00:03:54.389> one<00:03:54.630> servo<00:03:55.200> which<00:03:55.519> focus<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.669> continuously

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
a one servo which focus is continuously

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.140 
a one servo which focus is continuously
on<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.720> moving<00:03:58.049> object<00:03:58.319> so<00:03:58.769> as<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.609> have<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
on a moving object so as you have the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.629 
on a moving object so as you have the
shutter<00:04:00.690> button<00:04:01.019> pressed<00:04:01.799> halfway<00:04:02.160> down<00:04:02.340> and

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:02.639 
shutter button pressed halfway down and

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.930 
shutter button pressed halfway down and
you're<00:04:03.209> following<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:04.349> action<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:05.549> camera

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
you're following the action the camera

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.089 
you're following the action the camera
will<00:04:06.030> automatically<00:04:06.540> will<00:04:06.870> focus<00:04:07.230> on<00:04:07.620> that

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
will automatically will focus on that

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.839 
will automatically will focus on that
moving<00:04:08.579> object<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.440> you<00:04:10.440> can<00:04:10.650> take<00:04:11.370> pictures

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
moving object and you can take pictures

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.879 
moving object and you can take pictures
of<00:04:12.000> very<00:04:12.209> fast-moving<00:04:12.720> objects<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.650> this

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
of very fast-moving objects like this

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.469 
of very fast-moving objects like this
the<00:04:14.459> camera<00:04:14.849> will<00:04:15.030> bump<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.139> ISO<00:04:16.590> and

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
the camera will bump up the ISO and

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.789 
the camera will bump up the ISO and
increase<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:18.690> shutter<00:04:18.870> speed<00:04:19.289> so<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.590> you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
increase the shutter speed so that you

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.420 
increase the shutter speed so that you
can<00:04:19.949> stop<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.519> person<00:04:20.970> or<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.180> object<00:04:22.169> in

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
can stop that person or that object in

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.570 
can stop that person or that object in
midair<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.840> next<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.889> night<00:04:26.280> scene

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
midair the next one is the night scene

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.570 
midair the next one is the night scene
mode<00:04:26.849> the<00:04:27.270> camera<00:04:27.830> automatically<00:04:28.830> again

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
mode the camera automatically again

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.420 
mode the camera automatically again
everything<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.330> automatic<00:04:30.719> it<00:04:31.080> sets<00:04:32.039> it<00:04:32.219> to<00:04:32.250> a

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
everything is automatic it sets it to a

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.650 
everything is automatic it sets it to a
much<00:04:32.909> slow

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
much slow

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.200 
much slow
work<00:04:33.750> shutter<00:04:34.320> speed<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.610> bumps<00:04:35.940> up<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
work shutter speed and it bumps up the

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.460 
work shutter speed and it bumps up the
ISO<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.560> again<00:04:37.890> it's<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.280> good<00:04:38.490> idea<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:39.360> have<00:04:40.230> a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
ISO so again it's a good idea to have a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.910 
ISO so again it's a good idea to have a
tripod<00:04:40.830> handy<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:42.540> also<00:04:42.720> and<00:04:43.230> activates

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
tripod handy and it also and activates
