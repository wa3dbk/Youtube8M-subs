00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
retaining wall essentially is to have a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
retaining wall essentially is to have a
drainage<00:00:48.390> pipe<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.110> runs<00:00:49.320> along<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> bottom

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
drainage pipe that runs along the bottom

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
drainage pipe that runs along the bottom
of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> wall<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:52.410> pipe<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:54.440> as<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
of the wall and this pipe here as you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
of the wall and this pipe here as you
can<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.090> pan<00:00:57.329> over<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> guys<00:00:59.789> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
can see as we pan over here the guys at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.869 
can see as we pan over here the guys at
this<00:01:00.390> point<00:01:00.660> very<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> stone<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
this point very of the stone but that

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.690 
this point very of the stone but that
black<00:01:03.359> pipe<00:01:03.690> runs<00:01:04.019> all<00:01:04.290> along<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.189> bottom<00:01:05.400> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
black pipe runs all along the bottom of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
black pipe runs all along the bottom of
the<00:01:05.790> wall<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.810> beginning<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.680> it's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the wall to the beginning and it's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
the wall to the beginning and it's
perforated<00:01:08.850> pipe<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.659> happens<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.170> when

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
perforated pipe so what happens is when

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.910 
perforated pipe so what happens is when
the<00:01:10.439> water<00:01:10.650> comes<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:13.200> enters<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> pipe

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the water comes down it enters the pipe

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.749 
the water comes down it enters the pipe
and<00:01:14.689> exits<00:01:15.689> out<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.290> outs<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> street

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and exits out to the outs of the street

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.170 
and exits out to the outs of the street
the<00:01:18.360> other<00:01:18.680> very<00:01:19.680> crucial<00:01:20.159> part<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.000> add

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the other very crucial part is to add

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
the other very crucial part is to add
three<00:01:22.170> quarter<00:01:22.500> inch<00:01:22.680> queen<00:01:23.100> stones<00:01:23.520> not

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
three quarter inch queen stones not

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
three quarter inch queen stones not
modified<00:01:24.479> some<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.040> air<00:01:26.280> space<00:01:26.610> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
modified some this just has air space in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.370 
modified some this just has air space in
there<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> allows<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> water<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
there so it allows the water to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.069 
there so it allows the water to
penetrate<00:01:29.310> through<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> stone<00:01:30.420> faster<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
penetrate through the stone faster to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.130 
penetrate through the stone faster to
get<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.500> pipe<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.210> out<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.900> wherever

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
get to that pipe and out to to wherever

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.429 
get to that pipe and out to to wherever
you<00:01:34.350> want<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.619> exit<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.720> another<00:01:36.720> crucial<00:01:36.960> part

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you want to exit to another crucial part

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.880 
you want to exit to another crucial part
is<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.490> dry<00:01:39.150> laid<00:01:39.420> walls<00:01:39.689> anyway<00:01:40.049> which

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is to in dry laid walls anyway which

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
is to in dry laid walls anyway which
this<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.400> one<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> benefits<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.780> any

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this is one of the benefits is any

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
this is one of the benefits is any
pressure<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.590> water<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.250> coming<00:01:44.399> down

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
pressure or water that's coming down

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.020 
pressure or water that's coming down
through<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> wall<00:01:45.630> seeps<00:01:46.020> through<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> walls

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
through the wall seeps through the walls

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.030 
through the wall seeps through the walls
again<00:01:48.290> alleviating<00:01:49.290> some<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.829> pressure

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
again alleviating some of that pressure

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.800 
again alleviating some of that pressure
bait<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> basically<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.329> happens<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
bait and basically what happens on a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.840 
bait and basically what happens on a
hill<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.229> retaining<00:01:52.740> wall<00:01:53.450> retain<00:01:54.450> soil<00:01:54.810> so

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
hill so retaining wall retain soil so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
hill so retaining wall retain soil so
number<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.540> pressure<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
number one there's pressure with the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.490 
number one there's pressure with the
soil<00:01:59.210> number<00:02:00.210> two<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> rains<00:02:01.049> there's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
soil number two when it rains there's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.130 
soil number two when it rains there's
added<00:02:01.860> pressure<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> water<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
added pressure with the water so you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.499 
added pressure with the water so you
want<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.710> alleviate<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.549> pressure<00:02:06.119> behind

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
want to alleviate that pressure behind

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.999 
want to alleviate that pressure behind
the<00:02:06.869> retaining<00:02:07.049> wall

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the retaining wall

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130

is standard in doing this there's also a
layer<00:02:19.769> of<00:02:19.879> geotextile<00:02:20.879> fabric<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.629> that

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
layer of geotextile fabric here that

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.640 
layer of geotextile fabric here that
separates<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.579> stone<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.140> soil<00:02:25.409> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
separates the stone and the soil and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.240 
separates the stone and the soil and
what<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.010> does<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.489> eliminate<00:02:27.090> any<00:02:27.299> stone

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
what that does is it eliminate any stone

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.920 
what that does is it eliminate any stone

what we did again going back to the pipe

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.309 
what we did again going back to the pipe
is<00:02:38.810> led<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> pipe<00:02:40.230> out<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.859> an<00:02:40.980> existing<00:02:41.340> pipe
