game your game actually becomes blurry

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.200 
game your game actually becomes blurry
why<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:38.100> game<00:00:38.309> ever<00:00:38.460> become<00:00:38.700> blurry<00:00:38.969> like

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
why the game ever become blurry like

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.049 
why the game ever become blurry like
this<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.200> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> fuzzy<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.309> almost

to unclick this box what this box

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880 
to unclick this box what this box
basically<00:01:04.300> does<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.960> during<00:01:05.620> those

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
basically does is that during those

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.880 
basically does is that during those
times<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.910> intensive<00:01:07.600> fighting<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
times of like intensive fighting it

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.460 
times of like intensive fighting it
turns<00:01:09.160> down<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.490> actual<00:01:09.970> resolution<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.870> of

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
turns down the actual resolution of of

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.210 
turns down the actual resolution of of
the<00:01:12.040> polygons<00:01:12.700> on<00:01:13.300> your<00:01:13.600> screen<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.500> makes<00:01:14.979> it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
the polygons on your screen and makes it

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.950 
the polygons on your screen and makes it
super<00:01:15.700> duper<00:01:15.850> simple<00:01:16.150> for<00:01:16.510> your<00:01:16.600> gadgets

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
super duper simple for your gadgets

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.450 
super duper simple for your gadgets
right<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.260> doesn't<00:01:17.440> help<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:18.130> doesn't<00:01:18.160> help

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
right it doesn't help it doesn't help

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.070 
right it doesn't help it doesn't help
too<00:01:18.700> much<00:01:18.880> for<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.150> high<00:01:19.330> end<00:01:19.509> graphics<00:01:19.600> cards

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
too much for the high end graphics cards

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.300 
too much for the high end graphics cards
but<00:01:20.170> it<00:01:20.259> does<00:01:20.410> help<00:01:20.560> out<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.040> low<00:01:21.160> in

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
but it does help out with the low in

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.940 
but it does help out with the low in
geometry<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.170> game<00:01:23.350> detects<00:01:23.680> frame

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
geometry when the game detects frame

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.080 
geometry when the game detects frame
drop<00:01:25.110> especially<00:01:26.110> when<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:27.520> explosions

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
drop especially when there's explosions

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
drop especially when there's explosions
going<00:01:28.270> off<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.750> can't<00:01:29.200> replicate<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.979> game

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
going off I can't replicate your game

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.940 
going off I can't replicate your game
basically<00:01:34.390> downgrades<00:01:35.050> your<00:01:35.229> image<00:01:35.530> that<00:01:35.800> way

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
basically downgrades your image that way

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.280 
basically downgrades your image that way
you<00:01:36.009> can<00:01:36.190> keep<00:01:36.430> up<00:01:36.580> with<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:37.090> fps

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
you can keep up with the fps

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.139 
you can keep up with the fps
so<00:01:39.070> what<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.340> want<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.610> do<00:01:39.759> is<00:01:39.970> make<00:01:40.119> sure

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
so what you want to do is make sure

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.850 
so what you want to do is make sure
that's<00:01:40.450> off<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:40.930> that<00:01:41.320> will<00:01:41.440> fix<00:01:41.649> your

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
that's off and that will fix your

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's off and that will fix your
problems<00:01:42.280> another<00:01:42.820> thing<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.390> fix<00:01:43.450> your

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
problems another thing that can fix your

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.590 
problems another thing that can fix your
problems<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.229> switching<00:01:44.649> down<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.430> FX<00:01:45.940> AAA

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
problems is switching down to the FX AAA

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.400 
problems is switching down to the FX AAA
from<00:01:47.590> now<00:01:47.740> anti-aliasing<00:01:48.810> I've<00:01:49.810> found<00:01:50.229> that

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
from now anti-aliasing I've found that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.779 
from now anti-aliasing I've found that
there's<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.619> bunch<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.950> problems<00:01:51.100> with<00:01:51.520> with

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
there's a bunch of problems with with

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.940 
there's a bunch of problems with with
the<00:01:51.970> new<00:01:52.750> anti-aliasing<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.740> they<00:01:53.830> just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the new anti-aliasing that they just
