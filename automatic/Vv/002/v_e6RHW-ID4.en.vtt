to show here a little more detail

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.360 
to show here a little more detail
approach<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> first<00:00:11.820> coat<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.300> paint<00:00:12.450> and

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
approach to the first coat of paint and

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.820 
approach to the first coat of paint and
learning<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.509> work<00:00:15.750> harder<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.650> this

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
learning that if I work harder in this

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.550 
learning that if I work harder in this
first<00:00:17.160> approach<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.529> easier

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
first approach it will be much easier

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.550 
first approach it will be much easier
and<00:00:20.150> much<00:00:21.150> more<00:00:22.279> interesting<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> next<00:00:25.050> steps

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
and much more interesting the next steps

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.640 
and much more interesting the next steps
when<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> apply<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> liars<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> glazes<00:00:27.810> as

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
when I apply the liars and the glazes as

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.310 
when I apply the liars and the glazes as
you<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.580> created<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> much<00:00:30.929> more

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you can see I have created a much more

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.209 
you can see I have created a much more
detail<00:00:31.710> drawing<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.800> start

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
detail drawing to work from and I start

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.619 
detail drawing to work from and I start
applying<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.649> thick<00:00:37.649> coat<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> paint<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:39.510> I'm

eyes nose mouth so how I go over and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
eyes nose mouth so how I go over and
over<00:00:48.450> again<00:00:48.950> through<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> different<00:00:50.460> parts

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
over again through the different parts

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
over again through the different parts
of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> face<00:00:51.539> trying<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> create<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.219> image

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of the face trying to create an image

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.389 
of the face trying to create an image
that<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> same<00:00:55.050> time<00:00:56.600> simple<00:00:57.600> but<00:00:58.500> rich

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that is at the same time simple but rich

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
that is at the same time simple but rich
in<00:00:59.930> amount<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.440> information<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.399> think<00:01:03.239> what

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
in amount of information I think what

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
in amount of information I think what
really<00:01:03.930> makes<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.530> portrait<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.610> general<00:01:05.760> a

really makes a portrait or in general a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.770 
really makes a portrait or in general a
painting<00:01:06.510> magic<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:08.210> we<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.330> able<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
painting magic is that we are able to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
painting magic is that we are able to
create<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:13.020> atmosphere<00:01:13.799> around<00:01:14.130> the

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
isn't going to be a closed process what

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.430 
isn't going to be a closed process what
I<00:02:35.950> try<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> reproduce<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.120> transplant<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
I try to reproduce to transplant the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.310 
I try to reproduce to transplant the
image<00:02:39.860> from<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> photography<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:42.050> board

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
image from the photography to my board

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.930 
image from the photography to my board
is<00:02:44.020> living<00:02:45.020> procedure<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.770> which<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.280> come<00:02:46.760> down

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
is living procedure in which I come down

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.750 
is living procedure in which I come down
here<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:48.080> what<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.740> working<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.490> is<00:02:49.580> not

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
here and see what is working what is not

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.750 
here and see what is working what is not
what<00:02:50.210> needs<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.570> be<00:02:50.720> done<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:52.160> listen<00:02:52.550> every

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
what needs to be done and I listen every

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
what needs to be done and I listen every
morning<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> painting<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.290> telling

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
morning to what the painting is telling

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.210 
morning to what the painting is telling
me<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.280> order<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> next<00:02:57.020> and

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
me in order to know what to the next and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.420 
me in order to know what to the next and
probably<00:02:58.220> this<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.430> why<00:02:58.760> I<00:03:00.400> disagree<00:03:01.400> with

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
probably this is why I disagree with

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.230 
probably this is why I disagree with
people<00:03:01.790> who<00:03:02.180> defends<00:03:02.710> painting<00:03:03.710> from<00:03:03.920> life<00:03:04.240> as

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
people who defends painting from life as

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.750 
people who defends painting from life as
opposed<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.810> painting<00:03:06.260> from<00:03:06.410> autography<00:03:06.800> all

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820 
opposed to painting from autography all
my<00:03:07.970> subjects<00:03:08.450> need<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.080> photography<00:03:09.620> because

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
my subjects need the photography because

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.490 
my subjects need the photography because

have<00:03:17.840> them<00:03:17.990> from<00:03:18.980> life<00:03:19.190> but<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:21.290> way<00:03:21.470> I

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
have them from life but the way I

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.200 
have them from life but the way I
understand<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.190> process<00:03:22.580> of<00:03:22.640> work<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.150> do

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
understand the process of work that I do

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.600 
understand the process of work that I do
it<00:03:23.900> would<00:03:24.050> be<00:03:24.080> exactly<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.710> same<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.190> me<00:03:25.340> if<00:03:25.550> I

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
it would be exactly the same to me if I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.710 
it would be exactly the same to me if I
had<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.620> living<00:03:28.040> subject<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.090> front<00:03:29.300> of<00:03:29.390> me<00:03:29.540> I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
had the living subject in front of me I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.590 
had the living subject in front of me I
would<00:03:29.810> do<00:03:30.380> exactly<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.040> same<00:03:31.070> able<00:03:31.580> go<00:03:32.300> there

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
would do exactly the same able go there

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.400 
would do exactly the same able go there
touch<00:03:33.250> couple<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.340> brush<00:03:34.520> strokes<00:03:35.140> come<00:03:36.140> back

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
touch couple of brush strokes come back

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.410 
touch couple of brush strokes come back
get<00:03:37.130> away<00:03:37.310> from<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.580> painting<00:03:37.790> see<00:03:38.210> if<00:03:38.300> it's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
get away from the painting see if it's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.200 
get away from the painting see if it's
working<00:03:38.660> go<00:03:39.050> back<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.530> use<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.520> image<00:03:40.940> the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
working go back I use the image the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.210 
working go back I use the image the
photography<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.840> work<00:03:42.020> from<00:03:42.260> as<00:03:43.840> as<00:03:44.840> a

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
photography that I work from as as a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.310 
photography that I work from as as a
source<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.430> information<00:03:46.820> exactly<00:03:47.720> as<00:03:48.050> if<00:03:48.200> it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
source of information exactly as if it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.900 
source of information exactly as if it
was<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.040> living<00:03:49.660> subject<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
was the living subject and I think the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.120 
was the living subject and I think the
difference<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.290> origin<00:03:54.830> of<00:03:54.950> that

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
difference is not in the origin of that

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.120 
difference is not in the origin of that
image<00:03:55.550> it's<00:03:56.150> photography<00:03:56.450> or<00:03:56.810> life<00:03:57.020> to<00:03:57.650> me<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
image it's photography or life to me the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.190 
image it's photography or life to me the
difference<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.670> big<00:03:58.700> difference<00:03:58.820> it's<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.750> it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
difference a big difference it's is it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.860 
difference a big difference it's is it
in<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.530> way<00:04:00.740> we<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:02.900> work<00:04:03.140> on<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:04.070> we<00:04:04.630> use<00:04:05.630> that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
in the way we we work on it we use that

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.840 
in the way we we work on it we use that
information<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.710> process<00:04:07.280> of<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.520> procedure

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
information the process of the procedure

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.070 
information the process of the procedure
we<00:04:08.180> use<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:09.350> create<00:04:09.590> our<00:04:09.740> painting<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:11.080> I

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
we use to create our painting and I

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.220 
we use to create our painting and I
don't<00:04:12.890> reproduce<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:14.300> photography<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.200> I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
don't reproduce the photography that I

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.860 
the board but he could place two billion
more<00:04:52.330> then<00:04:53.130> he<00:04:54.130> just<00:04:54.430> selects<00:04:55.300> what<00:04:55.480> he<00:04:55.630> needs

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
and he makes some parts work perfectly

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.650 
and he makes some parts work perfectly
with<00:04:58.810> just<00:04:59.610> few<00:05:00.610> sessions<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:01.240> some<00:05:01.420> others

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
with just few sessions and some others

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.690 
with just few sessions and some others
are<00:05:01.900> completely<00:05:02.560> defined<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:03.280> reach<00:05:03.490> in

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
are completely defined and reach in

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.050 
are completely defined and reach in
detail<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.900> me<00:05:04.990> that's<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:06.000> way<00:05:07.000> to

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
detail and to me that's the way to

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.670 
detail and to me that's the way to
understand<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.780> process<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.080> painting<00:05:08.350> and

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
understand the process of painting and

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.080 
understand the process of painting and
is<00:05:08.830> what<00:05:09.070> makes<00:05:09.570> this<00:05:10.950> process<00:05:11.950> alive

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
is what makes this process alive

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
is what makes this process alive
and<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.540> at<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.900> end<00:05:14.020> what<00:05:14.320> we<00:05:14.560> get<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:14.980> this

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
and so at the end what we get is this

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.260 
and so at the end what we get is this
complete<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.380> kind<00:05:17.740> of<00:05:17.830> balanced<00:05:18.520> image<00:05:18.700> of

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
complete and kind of balanced image of

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.159 
complete and kind of balanced image of
the<00:05:19.480> portrait<00:05:20.350> we're<00:05:20.830> working<00:05:21.160> on<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:22.169> I'm

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
the portrait we're working on and I'm

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.640

going to just apply a little more

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.730 
going to just apply a little more
touches<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:27.160> is<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.520> way<00:05:27.700> it's<00:05:27.910> gonna<00:05:28.090> look

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
touches this is the way it's gonna look

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.360

hands cuz I I've learned that is the

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.000 
hands cuz I I've learned that is the
easiest<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.190> best<00:05:39.460> way<00:05:40.390> to<00:05:40.419> do<00:05:40.660> it<00:05:40.780> I'm<00:05:41.320> gonna

sticks to remove some of the paint that
I've<00:06:17.560> applied<00:06:17.680> because<00:06:18.160> it<00:06:18.310> takes<00:06:18.550> a<00:06:18.850> long

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
I've applied because it takes a long

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.050 
I've applied because it takes a long
time<00:06:19.180> for<00:06:19.810> it<00:06:19.840> to<00:06:20.110> dry<00:06:20.320> so<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.770> can<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.340> have<00:06:21.580> time

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
time for it to dry so I can I have time

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.780 
time for it to dry so I can I have time
enough<00:06:22.350> to<00:06:23.350> that<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:24.070> this<00:06:24.220> is<00:06:24.370> one<00:06:24.550> of<00:06:24.580> the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
enough to that and this is one of the

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.469 
enough to that and this is one of the
basic<00:06:25.570> procedures<00:06:25.960> is<00:06:26.320> with<00:06:26.910> thick<00:06:27.910> braces

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
basic procedures is with thick braces

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.839 
basic procedures is with thick braces

in color that is going to make this kind
of<00:06:35.479> richness<00:06:36.349> that<00:06:36.770> I<00:06:36.830> was<00:06:36.979> talking<00:06:37.159> about<00:06:37.309> and

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:37.849 
of richness that I was talking about and

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:39.549 
of richness that I was talking about and
every<00:06:38.300> square<00:06:38.689> inch<00:06:38.899> of<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.199> painting

every square inch of the painting

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:42.359 
every square inch of the painting
there's<00:06:39.740> going<00:06:39.889> to<00:06:39.979> be<00:06:40.039> a<00:06:40.129> lot<00:06:40.369> of<00:06:40.719> colors<00:06:41.719> and

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:42.369 
there's going to be a lot of colors and

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.769 
there's going to be a lot of colors and
of<00:06:43.369> course<00:06:43.610> at<00:06:43.699> the<00:06:43.759> same<00:06:43.939> time<00:06:44.179> you<00:06:44.330> can<00:06:44.479> apply

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
of course at the same time you can apply

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:51.249 
of course at the same time you can apply
thicker<00:06:45.529> or<00:06:46.089> darker<00:06:48.789> tones<00:06:49.789> or<00:06:50.240> details<00:06:50.869> and

thicker or darker tones or details and
you<00:06:51.469> go<00:06:51.740> get<00:06:52.219> in<00:06:52.369> the<00:06:52.610> dark<00:06:53.300> parts<00:06:53.779> a<00:06:53.959> little

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:54.229 
you go get in the dark parts a little

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:56.519 
you go get in the dark parts a little
darker<00:06:54.589> and<00:06:54.800> the<00:06:55.099> light<00:06:55.309> parts<00:06:55.699> are<00:06:55.879> lighter

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:56.529 
darker and the light parts are lighter

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.949 
darker and the light parts are lighter
it<00:06:57.529> as<00:06:57.979> I<00:06:58.099> said<00:06:58.249> is<00:06:58.429> all<00:06:58.639> a<00:06:59.029> slow<00:06:59.300> process<00:06:59.779> in

00:06:59.949 --> 00:06:59.959 
it as I said is all a slow process in

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.769 
it as I said is all a slow process in
which<00:07:00.110> you<00:07:00.469> just<00:07:00.679> determine<00:07:01.039> or<00:07:01.459> decide<00:07:01.779> what

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
which you just determine or decide what

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.049 
which you just determine or decide what
needs<00:07:02.809> to<00:07:03.080> be<00:07:03.229> done<00:07:03.349> and<00:07:03.649> just<00:07:04.580> at<00:07:04.759> the<00:07:04.879> end

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:05.059 
needs to be done and just at the end
