00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.020 

in<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.070> video<00:00:02.370> we're<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.820> be<00:00:02.909> looking

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
in this video we're going to be looking

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.950 
in this video we're going to be looking
at<00:00:03.620> installing<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.680> new<00:00:04.710> hard<00:00:05.100> drive<00:00:05.370> in

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
at installing a new hard drive in

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.290 
at installing a new hard drive in
preparation<00:00:06.960> for<00:00:07.099> formatting<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:09.030> should

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
preparation for formatting or I should

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.240 
preparation for formatting or I should
say<00:00:09.450> partitioning<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.410> then<00:00:10.559> formatting

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
say partitioning and then formatting

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.890 
say partitioning and then formatting
that<00:00:11.400> hard<00:00:11.700> drive<00:00:11.969> within<00:00:13.549> Linux<00:00:14.549> server<00:00:14.910> so

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
that hard drive within Linux server so

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
that hard drive within Linux server so
what<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.139> need<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.650> first<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.340> open

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
what we need to do first of all is open

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.960 
what we need to do first of all is open
up<00:00:17.910> our<00:00:18.119> VirtualBox<00:00:18.330> manager<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.609> we<00:00:20.609> need<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
up our VirtualBox manager and we need to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.900 
up our VirtualBox manager and we need to
be<00:00:21.060> working<00:00:21.480> inside<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.140> virtually<00:00:22.910> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
be working inside that virtually to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.929 
be working inside that virtually to
install<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> new<00:00:24.539> virtual<00:00:24.810> hard<00:00:25.230> drive<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> this

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
install a new virtual hard drive so this

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.679 
install a new virtual hard drive so this
process<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.630> very<00:00:27.689> similar<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:29.179> opening<00:00:30.179> up<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
process is very similar to opening up a

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
process is very similar to opening up a
physical<00:00:31.170> machine<00:00:31.289> whether<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> desktop

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
physical machine whether it be a desktop

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.470 
physical machine whether it be a desktop
or<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> server<00:00:33.750> pulling<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> covers

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
or a server pulling off the covers

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.400 
or a server pulling off the covers
installing<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> physical<00:00:36.960> hard<00:00:37.170> drive

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
installing a physical hard drive

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.340 
installing a physical hard drive
attaching<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> cables<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.350> going

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
attaching it with the cables and going

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.610 
attaching it with the cables and going
through<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> process<00:00:41.250> then<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:42.620> configuring

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
through the process then of configuring

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
through the process then of configuring
it<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> particular<00:00:44.309> server<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.539> we're

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it for that particular server so we're

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940 
it for that particular server so we're
just<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.260> virtually<00:00:46.739> now

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
just going to do all that virtually now

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
just going to do all that virtually now
so<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.340> need<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> open<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:48.059> VirtualBox

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
so you need to open up VirtualBox

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.650 
so you need to open up VirtualBox
manager<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.460> you'll<00:00:50.610> find<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.059> located<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
manager and you'll find that located on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.090 
manager and you'll find that located on
the<00:00:51.780> desktop<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.469> machine<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> you're

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the desktop of the machine that you're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.240 
the desktop of the machine that you're
using<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.260> when<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.920> need<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
using and when we're in there we need to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.610 
using and when we're in there we need to
select<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.789> server<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.449> we're<00:00:57.690> working

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
select the server that we're working

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.970 
select the server that we're working
under<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.390> Ubuntu

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
under so for me it's going to be Ubuntu

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.480 
under so for me it's going to be Ubuntu
10.04<00:01:02.719> server<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> might<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.710> bun<00:01:05.390> 212

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
10.04 server for you it might be bun 212

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.230 
10.04 server for you it might be bun 212
depends<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.580> what<00:01:08.700> you've<00:01:08.939> already

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
depends on what you've already

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.960 
depends on what you've already
pre-configured<00:01:10.040> now<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.280> server<00:01:11.640> already

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
pre-configured now this server already

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.390 
pre-configured now this server already
does<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> hard<00:01:12.900> drive<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.439> we're<00:01:14.220> going

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
does have a hard drive and we're going

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
does have a hard drive and we're going
to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.520> adding<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:14.939> additional<00:01:15.479> hard<00:01:15.750> drive<00:01:15.990> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to be adding an additional hard drive to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
to be adding an additional hard drive to
it<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.030> need<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it so to do that we need to go to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.160 
it so to do that we need to go to
settings<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:20.420> under<00:01:21.420> settings<00:01:21.810> we're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
settings and under settings we're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.940 
settings and under settings we're
looking<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.530> storage<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.470> you'll<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.710> there

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
looking for storage and you'll see there

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.840 
looking for storage and you'll see there
that<00:01:26.330> we've<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> cider<00:01:27.960> controller<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
that we've got a cider controller and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.100 
that we've got a cider controller and
underneath<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> cider<00:01:30.299> controller

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
underneath the cider controller

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.630 
underneath the cider controller
we've<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.829> Ubuntu<00:01:32.750> hard<00:01:33.750> drive<00:01:34.049> which<00:01:34.409> is

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
we've got Ubuntu hard drive which is

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.660 
we've got Ubuntu hard drive which is
actually<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.900> VDI<00:01:36.900> file<00:01:37.380> physical<00:01:38.220> file<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually a VDI file physical file that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.780 
actually a VDI file physical file that
lives<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> host<00:01:39.479> machine<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.579> it's<00:01:41.579> been

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
lives on the host machine and it's been

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
lives on the host machine and it's been
set<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> 8<00:01:42.299> gigabyte<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.610> to

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
set to 8 gigabyte so we're going to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
set to 8 gigabyte so we're going to
install<00:01:45.240> another<00:01:45.630> hard<00:01:45.930> drive<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.500> we're

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
install another hard drive so we're

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
install another hard drive so we're
going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.799> select<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> cider<00:01:47.640> controller<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
going to select the cider controller and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
going to select the cider controller and
down<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> bottom<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> window<00:01:51.590> we're

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
down at the bottom of that window we're

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.679 
down at the bottom of that window we're
going<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.070> add<00:01:53.280> an<00:01:53.430> attachment

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
going to add an attachment

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.149 
going to add an attachment
and<00:01:56.439> we<00:01:56.530> want<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.770> add<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> new<00:01:57.130> hard<00:01:57.340> drive

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
and we want to add a new hard drive

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.719 
and we want to add a new hard drive
we're<00:02:00.159> going<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.340> create<00:02:00.609> a<00:02:00.670> new<00:02:00.909> hard<00:02:01.149> disk

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
we're going to create a new hard disk

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.240 
we're going to create a new hard disk
set<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> default<00:02:04.359> VDI<00:02:08.250> dynamically

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
set the default VDI dynamically

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.460 
set the default VDI dynamically
allocated<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.239> fine<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:12.459> gig<00:02:13.110> default<00:02:14.110> is

allocated is fine and a gig default is
fine<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:17.230> need<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.500> make<00:02:17.650> sure<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.920> we're

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
fine we need to make sure that we're

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.960 
fine we need to make sure that we're
using<00:02:18.069> good<00:02:18.489> naming<00:02:18.760> convention<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:20.970> we're

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
using good naming convention so we're

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.000 
using good naming convention so we're
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.299> call<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.629> Ubuntu<00:02:23.230> something<00:02:23.799> that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
going to call it Ubuntu something that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:34.650 
going to call it Ubuntu something that
is<00:02:24.129> a<00:02:24.160> descriptor<00:02:28.500> 10.04<00:02:32.190> server<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:34.450> need

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
is a descriptor 10.04 server and I need

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.050 
is a descriptor 10.04 server and I need
to<00:02:34.810> identify<00:02:34.930> this<00:02:35.440> hard<00:02:35.920> drive<00:02:36.069> against<00:02:36.879> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
to identify this hard drive against the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.199 
to identify this hard drive against the
first<00:02:37.390> hard<00:02:37.660> drive<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:38.379> I'll<00:02:38.500> use<00:02:38.769> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
first hard drive and so I'll use the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.390 
first hard drive and so I'll use the
Linux<00:02:40.209> naming<00:02:40.900> convention<00:02:41.410> for<00:02:41.440> cider<00:02:42.129> hard

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
Linux naming convention for cider hard

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:53.809 
Linux naming convention for cider hard
drives<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:43.090> I'll<00:02:44.079> do<00:02:44.319> SD<00:02:45.599> B<00:02:48.420> next<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:51.250> create

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.099 

now<00:02:54.819> you'll<00:02:55.060> see<00:02:55.209> that<00:02:55.359> I've<00:02:55.450> got<00:02:55.569> two<00:02:55.629> hard

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
now you'll see that I've got two hard

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.000 
now you'll see that I've got two hard
drives<00:02:57.180> got<00:02:58.180> my<00:02:58.299> primary<00:02:58.599> hard<00:02:58.930> drive<00:02:59.200> my

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
drives got my primary hard drive my

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.039 
drives got my primary hard drive my
secondary<00:03:00.519> hard<00:03:00.819> drive<00:03:01.980> click<00:03:02.980> OK<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:04.870> we're

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
secondary hard drive click OK and we're

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:05.520 
secondary hard drive click OK and we're
finished

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
finished

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.160 
finished
so<00:03:06.519> we're<00:03:06.639> now<00:03:06.760> ready<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.120> start<00:03:07.209> this<00:03:07.780> machine

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
so we're now ready to start this machine

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.470 
so we're now ready to start this machine
up<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.560> go<00:03:09.430> through<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:09.790> process<00:03:10.299> of

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
up and go through the process of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.559 
up and go through the process of
configuring<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:12.459> hard<00:03:12.790> drive<00:03:13.030> within<00:03:13.329> the

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
configuring that hard drive within the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.709 
configuring that hard drive within the
operating<00:03:13.959> system<00:03:14.410> itself
