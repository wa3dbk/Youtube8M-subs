I'm<00:00:55.379> still<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.890> my<00:00:56.160> other<00:00:56.399> commentary<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.210> I

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
I'm still got my other commentary but I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.970 
I'm still got my other commentary but I
can't<00:00:57.960> help<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.350> actually<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> my

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
can't help it it's actually one of my

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.689 
can't help it it's actually one of my
way<00:00:59.219> online<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.930> mp9<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> best<00:01:02.010> sidearm<00:01:02.550> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
way online the mp9 is the best sidearm I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.170 
way online the mp9 is the best sidearm I
think<00:01:03.289> it's<00:01:04.289> probably<00:01:04.920> better<00:01:05.550> than<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.910> mp7

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
think it's probably better than the mp7

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.219 
think it's probably better than the mp7
and<00:01:06.979> my<00:01:08.210> opinion<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.450> don't<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.080> guys

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and my opinion I don't know you guys

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.749 
and my opinion I don't know you guys
think<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.649> it<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.009> I<00:01:11.070> can't<00:01:11.369> really<00:01:11.520> do

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
think about it but I can't really do

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.830 
think about it but I can't really do
things<00:01:12.000> better<00:01:13.460> reason<00:01:14.460> being<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.910> doesn't

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
things better reason being that doesn't

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.900 
things better reason being that doesn't
take<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.110> many<00:01:16.259> bullets<00:01:16.679> to<00:01:16.800> kill<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.310> mean<00:01:17.880> I
