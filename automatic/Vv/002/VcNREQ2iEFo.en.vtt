continuing with the gesture drawings
we're<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.360> learning<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.960> you<00:00:10.320> know<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.519> me

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
we're just learning that you know for me

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.810 
we're just learning that you know for me
example<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.509> as<00:00:12.660> me<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.410> an<00:00:13.650> example<00:00:14.070> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
example for as me and as an example and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.080 
example for as me and as an example and
in<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> body<00:00:15.330> twists<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.109> turns<00:00:16.670> if<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.850> take

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
in the body twists and turns if I take

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.439 
in the body twists and turns if I take
this<00:00:18.270> bottle<00:00:18.750> here<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.230> ink<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:21.090> what<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
this bottle here of ink it is what it is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
this bottle here of ink it is what it is
it<00:00:21.840> doesn't<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.529> doesn't<00:00:22.590> do<00:00:23.010> anything<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> is

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
it doesn't it doesn't do anything it is

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
it doesn't it doesn't do anything it is
you<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> sphere<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> sphere<00:00:26.130> here

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
you have a sphere here and a sphere here

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
you have a sphere here and a sphere here
and<00:00:26.580> that's<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> information<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and that's all the information you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.740 
and that's all the information you
really<00:00:28.140> need<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.890> draw<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.630> let<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
really need is to draw this let the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.470 
really need is to draw this let the
human<00:00:31.019> figure<00:00:31.399> it<00:00:32.399> moves<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.090> bends<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
human figure it moves and bends and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.299 
human figure it moves and bends and
shapes<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.110> that's<00:00:34.230> why<00:00:34.410> we're<00:00:34.590> using<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
shapes and that's why we're using this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
shapes and that's why we're using this
wooden<00:00:35.730> model<00:00:37.610> to<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.820> used<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> how<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
wooden model to get used to how the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
wooden model to get used to how the
figure<00:00:40.980> moves<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> change<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
figure moves so I'm going to change the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.350 
figure moves so I'm going to change the
position<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> feel<00:00:47.789> for

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
position just to kind of get a feel for

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
position just to kind of get a feel for
a<00:00:48.390> different<00:00:48.870> position<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.770> want<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a different position and I just want to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
a different position and I just want to
try<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.370> capture<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.180> body<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> doing

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
try and capture what the body is doing

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
try and capture what the body is doing
you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.980> head<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:53.579> though<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you can see the head is here though the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
you can see the head is here though the
chest<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.469> rear<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.190> spine<00:00:56.489> is

arched<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:58.079> thigh<00:00:58.410> comes<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
arched there the thigh comes out to the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.959 
arched there the thigh comes out to the
back<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.600> calf<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.100> lower<00:01:02.520> leg<00:01:02.789> is

back and the calf and the lower leg is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.880 
back and the calf and the lower leg is
extended<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.870> almost<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.470> person<00:01:04.680> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
extended it's almost like this person is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
extended it's almost like this person is
running<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> always<00:01:06.930> start<00:01:07.290> at

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
running so I'm going to always start at

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.960 
running so I'm going to always start at
the<00:01:07.530> head<00:01:07.710> that's<00:01:07.979> me<00:01:08.250> personally<00:01:08.820> not

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the head that's me personally not

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
the head that's me personally not
everyone<00:01:09.390> does<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.900> i<00:01:10.590> believe<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
everyone does it but i believe it's just

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.310 
everyone does it but i believe it's just
a<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.490> starting<00:01:12.119> point<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> head<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a good starting point so the head is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.179 
a good starting point so the head is
tilted<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:15.470> okay<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> see<00:01:17.009> how<00:01:17.040> the

tilted back okay and you can see how the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.149 
tilted back okay and you can see how the
chest<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:18.060> arches<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:20.130> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
chest it arches there so I can just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.640 
chest it arches there so I can just
indicate<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> neck<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.990> chest<00:01:22.350> comes
