rebound needle and because we've greased
the<00:01:09.000> o-ring<00:01:09.330> inside<00:01:09.650> it's<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:13.549> fit<00:01:14.600> into

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the o-ring inside it's going to fit into

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.640 
the o-ring inside it's going to fit into
the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.230 

into<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> rod<00:01:20.009> fair<00:01:20.430> enough<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.210> just
