00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 well that's not photo tutorial about which we're going to learn 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.529
 an example for a hundred how to create abstract images 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.829
 that you know that 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.159
 can be created in a thousand ways but we are only going to see 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.159
 one of the thousand examples of the thousands of examples that there are 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 and for this we start from the image with a black background 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.140
 a folder that will wrap us in layers 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.349
 of this type 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.929
 that new group d 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.220
 télam - 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.660
 by stages 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.420
 i alestra 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.890
 to this group of boxes 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.440
 the idea of ​​seeing some 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.120
 which is where we are going to make our image to xstrata 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.080
 to start the job 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 the two colors these two colors to white and black 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.700
 and we're going to start applying a filter 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.170
 that is the filter of moody's that we are stealing klaus in English for those who 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.820
 you have in English 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.820
 so they follow us filter 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.410
 since it has been created as 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.100
 image with clouds that what it does is to mix the two agreements 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 in a random way 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.370
 Now we have to continue 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.520
 effect we are going to apply him or whatever mamés or times 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.510
 what he does is create, he rejected me to be the image 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450
 and is infiltrated 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.310
 is the mayor 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.210
 Meza Ink and Love is 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.690
 We made several 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.710
 types 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.049
 d selections we can make 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.690
 to configure this filter 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.200
 we are interested 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.840
 in this case 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 sor destructions 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.180
 that as rejections 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 shorts 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.780
 let's read april 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.299
 and now we are going to use it so that this image starts to appear something 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.390
 Mr 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.290
 one type of filter 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.780
 which is a blur filter 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.930
 radial 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 for this we are not going to filter 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.630
 blur or blur 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.560
 radiate light 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 we set the amount of blur to 100 which is the maximum 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.789
 the blur method 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:14.390
 we configure it to 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.469
 astun 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.509
 and the quality to better 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.569
 let's read cobblestone 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.699
 you see that the investigate the image seems already something else 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.929
 and we will know how to control 

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:28.669
 or filter and this filter that we have here that is the last one that we have 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:29.669
 applied 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.669
 to return it forces it again 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.639
 in this way you see that the image has become as to update much more 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 now let's use a skin type filter 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.609
 what is in fighter 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.609
 seen the distorted face 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.819
 we are going to give it 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.929
 a turn 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:58.249
 well this is already a bit August or your 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.850
 I believe that one feels 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.969
 - a hundred and a little 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.120
 it may look good 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.109
 let's read though 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.029
 b hundred of serra the image has been rotated 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.409
 about herself 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.169
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.169
 duplicate these layers that we have here 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 according to your call 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.849
 and there it is 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.399
 - a man 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.919
 and now we go to the top one is to apply the same affection towards 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.919
 the opposite angle encinosa filter 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.599
 we select 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.599
 about 226 degrees for example 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.329
 you see that 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.539
 so side the image about itself 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.649
 efe 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:52.099
 towards the opposite side 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.849
 and now to leave 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.539
 part of the layer below we will select here the layer above 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.939
 and in the layer mode the mossad we are going to put it to the year 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.769
 and Luis 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.590
 that is created as a species between tissue that wants quite well no 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.339
 margin to plugs 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.609
 can serve us 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.369
 now we are going to 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.369
 learn control 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.919
 or we are going to group these two layers that what we want we can do it with control 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.949
 what 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.819
 or selecting the two 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.150
 mel zelaya is 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.430
 and we are going to use 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
 subsequently control point 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.930
 It is a tool that 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.460
 other tutorials like that of 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.439
 guillén change the color of the eyes and so on 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.439
 will be oriented was already quite familiar 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.990
 with public control 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.789
 and it should not be like that 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.129
 activated 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.240
 we can change the values ​​of 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.779
 saturation 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:59.559
 I remove no 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.939
 even lighting 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.559
 to end up having 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.559
 our image is finally treated as you see 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.389
 to which we can continue to apply some more filter and we want to give it a touch 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:12.479
 final 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.460
 well I hope that this tutorial has been stopped I send a greeting
