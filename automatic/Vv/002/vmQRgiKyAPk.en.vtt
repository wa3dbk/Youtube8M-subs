little bathroom right here just toilet

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.340 
little bathroom right here just toilet
and<00:01:24.890> some<00:01:25.729> total<00:01:26.030> paper<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.390> there<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.229> can

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
and some total paper in there you can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.149 
and some total paper in there you can
see<00:01:27.620> that<00:01:28.240> not<00:01:29.240> really<00:01:29.630> I<00:01:30.200> didn't<00:01:30.680> do<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.799> shower

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
see that not really I didn't do a shower

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.520

it's<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.150> some<00:01:32.299> windows<00:01:32.690> on<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.049> side<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:33.470> I

it's just some windows on this side so I

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.530 
it's just some windows on this side so I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540

guess there's no privacy when you're in
the<00:01:35.600> kitchen<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.110> can<00:01:36.140> see<00:01:36.440> whoever's<00:01:37.190> in<00:01:37.310> the
