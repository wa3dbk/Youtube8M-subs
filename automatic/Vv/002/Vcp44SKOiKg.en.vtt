know<00:00:41.910> was<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.300> complex<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
know was so complex so much going on so

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
know was so complex so much going on so
many<00:00:44.040> new<00:00:44.250> things<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.760> did<00:00:44.910> leave<00:00:45.090> some

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
many new things that they did leave some

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
many new things that they did leave some
holes<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.079> was<00:00:46.230> actually<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> lot<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
holes and there was actually a lot of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
holes and there was actually a lot of
hacking<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> game<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> lot<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:47.969> than<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
hacking in the game a lot more than I

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
hacking in the game a lot more than I
expected<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.980> gotten

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
expected it to be I have actually gotten

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
expected it to be I have actually gotten
in<00:00:50.309> mod<00:00:50.520> lobbies<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.030> black<00:00:51.239> ops<00:00:51.420> 2<00:00:51.600> it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
in mod lobbies on black ops 2 it's

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
in mod lobbies on black ops 2 it's
actually<00:00:52.050> ridiculous<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.370> patched

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
actually ridiculous I think they patched

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
actually ridiculous I think they patched
most<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.090> there's<00:00:54.270> still<00:00:54.449> people<00:00:54.690> hacking<00:00:54.899> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
most of there's still people hacking it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.150 
most of there's still people hacking it
there's<00:00:55.260> always<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.070> people

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
there's always going to be some people

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
there's always going to be some people
hacking<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> game<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.629> games<00:00:57.899> like<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
hacking the game some games like you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.160

know<00:00:58.410> call<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.070> duty<00:00:59.100> 4<00:00:59.570> world<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.719> war<00:01:00.750> are<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
know call of duty 4 world at war are a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.080 
know call of duty 4 world at war are a
lot<00:01:01.379> easier<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.920> hack<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.699> many<00:01:02.789> hackers

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
lot easier to hack into so many hackers

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.369 
lot easier to hack into so many hackers
on<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.780> can't<00:01:03.989> even<00:01:04.049> play<00:01:04.320> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
on the just you can't even play it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.289 
on the just you can't even play it
anymore<00:01:04.589> practically<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> think

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
anymore practically but you know I think

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060 
anymore practically but you know I think
black<00:01:06.720> ops<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.170> tomorrow<00:01:07.439> after<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.890> had

black ops when tomorrow after three had
like<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:09.030> hacking<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.630> opinion<00:01:09.869> especially

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like no hacking in my opinion especially

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
like no hacking in my opinion especially
when<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.409> were<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.939> never<00:01:12.270> got<00:01:12.570> in

I do think that shouldn't be involved in
the<00:02:14.760> game<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.060> unfair<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> people<00:02:15.720> that

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.300 
think should there be modding called D
should<00:02:24.840> only<00:02:25.050> be<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.320> private<00:02:25.710> match<00:02:25.800> but

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
should only be in private match but

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.960 
should only be in private match but
should<00:02:26.490> they<00:02:26.550> do<00:02:26.610> something<00:02:26.910> like

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
should they do something like

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970 
should they do something like
battlefield<00:02:27.570> 3<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.170> think<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> was<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.860> could

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
battlefield 3 I think it was you could

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
battlefield 3 I think it was you could
actually<00:02:29.190> pay<00:02:29.550> extra<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> unlock<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.390> bunch<00:02:30.660> of

what's<00:02:39.570> pretty<00:02:39.780> cool<00:02:39.990> Infinity<00:02:40.560> Ward<00:02:40.740> was

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
what's pretty cool Infinity Ward was

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320 
what's pretty cool Infinity Ward was
actually<00:02:41.310> working<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> game<00:02:41.850> it<00:02:41.910> looked

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
actually working on the game it looked

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.630 
actually working on the game it looked
pretty<00:02:42.510> much<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.780> Diablo<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.890> was<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> diablo

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
pretty much like Diablo it was a diablo

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.220 
pretty much like Diablo it was a diablo
clone<00:02:44.820> they<00:02:45.120> was<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> code<00:02:45.750> word<00:02:45.930> for<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
clone they was the code word for it I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.290 
clone they was the code word for it I
guess<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.010> was<00:02:47.130> back<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.340> 2009<00:02:48.060> around

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
guess but that was back in 2009 around

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.090 
guess but that was back in 2009 around
the<00:02:48.360> release<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.600> modern<00:02:49.080> warfare<00:02:49.290> 2<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> think

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
I supposed to be kind of like Diablo the

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160 
I supposed to be kind of like Diablo the
developers<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.910> think<00:02:54.540> Mark<00:02:54.720> Rubin<00:02:54.870> talked

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
Rubin said and the Diablo game from

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.820 
Rubin said and the Diablo game from
infinia<00:03:24.930> where<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> only<00:03:25.380> one<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.800> know

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
infinia where is the only one I know

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.500 
infinia where is the only one I know
right<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.550> quit<00:03:26.850> out<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.090> production<00:03:27.450> is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
right now they quit out in production is

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.610 
right now they quit out in production is
probably<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.780> bunch<00:03:27.960> more<00:03:28.170> but<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.350> game

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
probably a bunch more but that game

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
for infinity ward think of them as

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.400 
for infinity ward think of them as
modern<00:03:44.280> warfare<00:03:44.490> call<00:03:44.880> duty<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.510> Diablo<00:03:46.230> so
