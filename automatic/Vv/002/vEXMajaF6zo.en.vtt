before<00:00:11.920> you<00:00:12.040> perform<00:00:12.520> the<00:00:12.730> manual<00:00:12.910> cell<00:00:13.390> count

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
before you perform the manual cell count

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.070 
before you perform the manual cell count
you<00:00:13.930> need<00:00:14.110> to<00:00:14.260> wash<00:00:14.440> your<00:00:14.470> hemocytometer<00:00:16.080> it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
you need to wash your hemocytometer it

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.859 
you need to wash your hemocytometer it
needs<00:00:17.290> to<00:00:17.440> be<00:00:17.590> thoroughly<00:00:17.860> clean<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:19.240> the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
needs to be thoroughly clean and the

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.210 
needs to be thoroughly clean and the
first<00:00:20.170> step<00:00:20.560> that<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:21.460> to<00:00:22.330> get<00:00:22.510> your<00:00:23.220> reagents

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
first step that is to get your reagents

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.200 
first step that is to get your reagents
and<00:00:24.510> solutions<00:00:25.510> ready<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.760> you'll<00:00:27.940> need<00:00:28.060> to

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
and solutions ready so you'll need to

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.450 
and solutions ready so you'll need to
put<00:00:28.360> on<00:00:28.480> some<00:00:28.750> gloves<00:00:29.020> for<00:00:29.230> that<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
put on some gloves for that and the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.729 
put on some gloves for that and the
first<00:00:33.699> solution<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.449> some<00:00:34.660> dilute<00:00:34.960> bleach<00:00:34.989> to

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
first solution is some dilute bleach to

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.700 
first solution is some dilute bleach to
disinfect<00:00:36.370> our<00:00:37.170> hemocytometer<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.530> when

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
disinfect our hemocytometer is when

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.220 
disinfect our hemocytometer is when
we're<00:00:38.860> completed<00:00:39.370> with<00:00:39.520> our<00:00:39.670> counts<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:41.050> do

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
we're completed with our counts to do

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.280 
we're completed with our counts to do
that<00:00:41.470> just<00:00:42.190> take<00:00:42.850> your<00:00:43.060> beaker<00:00:43.540> I've<00:00:43.780> labeled

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
that just take your beaker I've labeled

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.780 
that just take your beaker I've labeled
it<00:00:44.440> dilute<00:00:44.860> bleach<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:47.220> we're<00:00:48.220> just<00:00:48.430> gonna

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
it dilute bleach and we're just gonna

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.670 
it dilute bleach and we're just gonna
cover<00:00:49.180> the<00:00:49.480> bottom<00:00:49.930> of<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.140> beaker<00:00:50.320> with

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
cover the bottom of the beaker with

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.920 
cover the bottom of the beaker with
bleach<00:00:50.950> just<00:00:51.910> enough<00:00:52.239> to<00:00:52.390> cover<00:00:52.540> the<00:00:52.690> bottom

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
bleach just enough to cover the bottom

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.819 
bleach just enough to cover the bottom
and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.670> we're<00:00:54.850> gonna<00:00:54.940> fill<00:00:55.360> up<00:00:55.510> about<00:00:55.829> 3/4

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
and then we're gonna fill up about 3/4

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.280 
and then we're gonna fill up about 3/4
of<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.070> way<00:00:57.250> with<00:00:57.969> tap<00:00:58.300> water<00:00:59.880> and<00:01:01.050> we'll<00:01:02.050> be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
of the way with tap water and we'll be

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.510 
of the way with tap water and we'll be
using<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.800> later<00:01:04.080> after<00:01:05.080> we<00:01:05.500> completed<00:01:06.280> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
using this later after we completed the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.920 
using this later after we completed the
counts<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.080> then<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:08.920> is<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.310> hemocytometer

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
counts so then this is the hemocytometer

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.480 
counts so then this is the hemocytometer
detergent<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:11.530> needs<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.860> be<00:01:11.890> about<00:01:12.190> half

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
detergent that needs to be about half

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.510 
detergent that needs to be about half
full<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.300> this<00:01:14.020> is<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.229> dilute<00:01:14.680> detergent<00:01:15.369> that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
full and this is a dilute detergent that

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:25.240 
full and this is a dilute detergent that
we<00:01:15.640> use<00:01:15.880> for<00:01:16.119> cleaning<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.540> hemocytometer<00:01:16.930> x'

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.760 

and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.790> you'll<00:01:26.940> need<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> beaker<00:01:27.870> about<00:01:28.140> 3/4

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and then you'll need a beaker about 3/4

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.030 
and then you'll need a beaker about 3/4
full<00:01:28.800> of<00:01:29.250> deionized<00:01:29.850> water<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.440> need<00:01:34.890> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
full of deionized water now you need to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
full of deionized water now you need to
take<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.370> gloves<00:01:35.610> off

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
take your gloves off

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.890 
take your gloves off
most<00:01:37.440> gloves<00:01:37.890> will<00:01:38.340> leave<00:01:38.580> a<00:01:38.610> sticky<00:01:39.090> film<00:01:39.600> on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
most gloves will leave a sticky film on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.620 
most gloves will leave a sticky film on
your<00:01:40.050> hemocytometer<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.250> layer<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.090> top<00:01:42.570> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
your hemocytometer and layer on top of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.500 
your hemocytometer and layer on top of
your<00:01:42.870> liquids<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:45.270> them

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
your liquids so you want to take them

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.460 
your liquids so you want to take them
off<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> point<00:01:46.940> take<00:01:47.940> off<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.570> cover<00:01:49.290> of

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
off at this point take off the cover of

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.650 
off at this point take off the cover of
the<00:01:49.560> petri<00:01:49.770> dish<00:01:50.160> and<00:01:50.760> here's<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
the petri dish and here's the

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.650 
the petri dish and here's the
hemocytometer<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.800> check<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:53.910> carefully

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
hemocytometer I check it very carefully

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.070 
hemocytometer I check it very carefully
to<00:01:55.440> see<00:01:55.619> if<00:01:55.650> there's<00:01:55.920> any<00:01:56.160> film<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.479> residue

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
to see if there's any film or or residue

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.490 
to see if there's any film or or residue
or<00:01:58.619> debris<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.190> it<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> even<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.050> don't<00:02:01.259> see

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
or debris on it and even if I don't see

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.680 
or debris on it and even if I don't see
any<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.800> still<00:02:02.250> wash<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.479> there's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
any I still wash it because there's

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.139 
any I still wash it because there's
often<00:02:04.280> material<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.910> can't

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
often material on there that you can't

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.090 
often material on there that you can't
see<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.660> will<00:02:06.810> throw<00:02:07.229> off<00:02:07.410> your<00:02:07.440> platelet

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
see that will throw off your platelet

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.880 
see that will throw off your platelet
count<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.429> quite<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> bit<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.320> first<00:02:10.560> step

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
count it's quite a bit so the first step

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.699 
count it's quite a bit so the first step
is<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.550> swish<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.870> detergent<00:02:13.530> like

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
is to swish it in the detergent like

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.160 
is to swish it in the detergent like
this<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.670> then<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.480> scrub<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> with<00:02:16.020> your

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this and then you can scrub it with your

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.360 
this and then you can scrub it with your
finger<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.739> this<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.930> oh<00:02:19.370> three

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
finger like this and I do that oh three

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.150 
finger like this and I do that oh three
or<00:02:20.489> four<00:02:20.730> times<00:02:21.000> actually<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:22.739> time<00:02:22.980> you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
or four times actually the more time you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.570 
or four times actually the more time you
spend<00:02:23.630> cleaning<00:02:24.630> your<00:02:24.780> hemocytometer<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
spend cleaning your hemocytometer the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
spend cleaning your hemocytometer the
better<00:02:27.830> if<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.100> not<00:02:29.340> perfectly<00:02:30.090> clean<00:02:30.420> it'll

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
better if it's not perfectly clean it'll

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.880 
better if it's not perfectly clean it'll
really<00:02:31.410> throw<00:02:31.769> off<00:02:31.799> your<00:02:32.160> counts<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
really throw off your counts then the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.039 
really throw off your counts then the
last<00:02:35.130> time<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.640> scrub<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.209> don't<00:02:36.510> touch<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
last time you scrub it don't touch the

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.500 
last time you scrub it don't touch the
surface<00:02:37.290> again<00:02:37.860> because<00:02:38.640> your<00:02:38.880> fingers<00:02:39.269> have

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
surface again because your fingers have

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.300 
surface again because your fingers have
oil<00:02:39.750> droplets<00:02:40.320> on<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.860> they'll<00:02:41.070> look<00:02:41.250> just

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
oil droplets on it and they'll look just

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.160 
oil droplets on it and they'll look just
like<00:02:41.700> platelets<00:02:42.209> it'll<00:02:42.540> throw<00:02:42.780> off<00:02:42.959> your

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
like platelets it'll throw off your

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.130 
like platelets it'll throw off your
counts<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.190> then<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.970> rinse<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.600> off<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
counts so then you rinse it off in the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.000 
counts so then you rinse it off in the
detergent

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
detergent

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.680 
detergent
then<00:02:47.370> you're<00:02:47.549> gonna<00:02:47.670> rinse<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.090> off<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.480> tap

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
then you're gonna rinse it off in tap

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.850 
then you're gonna rinse it off in tap
water<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:51.920> use<00:02:52.920> warm<00:02:53.280> tap<00:02:53.610> water<00:02:54.620> cuts<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
water I use warm tap water cuts the

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.420 
water I use warm tap water cuts the
detergent<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.459> little<00:02:56.730> better<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:58.380> then<00:02:59.190> rinse

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
detergent a little better and then rinse

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.060 
detergent a little better and then rinse
it<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.790> deionized<00:03:00.390> water<00:03:00.570> just<00:03:01.320> like<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:04.070> and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
it in deionized water just like this and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.039 
it in deionized water just like this and
you<00:03:05.280> shake<00:03:05.580> off<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.090> excess<00:03:06.120> water<00:03:06.630> make<00:03:07.019> sure

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
you shake off the excess water make sure

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.440 
you shake off the excess water make sure
you<00:03:07.380> hold<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.799> securely<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.760> doesn't<00:03:09.180> drop

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you hold it securely so it doesn't drop

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.470 
you hold it securely so it doesn't drop
and<00:03:09.690> break<00:03:09.890> then<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> lint-free<00:03:11.459> kimwipe

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and break then with a lint-free kimwipe

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.890 
and break then with a lint-free kimwipe
it<00:03:13.140> needs<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.650> be<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.670> kimwipes<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.540> do<00:03:15.720> not

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it needs to be the kimwipes that do not

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.350 
it needs to be the kimwipes that do not
have<00:03:16.170> kaolin<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.950> them<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.180> don't

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
have kaolin in them so that you don't

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840 
have kaolin in them so that you don't
scratch<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.019> hemocytometer<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:20.549> want<00:03:20.760> to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
scratch the hemocytometer you want to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.270 
scratch the hemocytometer you want to
just<00:03:21.060> gently<00:03:21.600> wipe<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.320> dry<00:03:23.269> don't<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.660> this

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
just gently wipe it dry don't do this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:38.550 
just gently wipe it dry don't do this
just<00:03:26.280> gently<00:03:26.880> wipe<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.480> dry<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:29.940> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.820 

then<00:03:39.190> we<00:03:39.640> will<00:03:39.849> wash<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.690> coverslip<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.590> same

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
then we will wash the coverslip the same

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.449 
then we will wash the coverslip the same
way<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.420> want<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:43.959> look<00:03:44.890> at<00:03:45.069> your

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
way so you want to look at your

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.360 
way so you want to look at your
hemocytometer<00:03:46.420> coverslip<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.680> check<00:03:48.340> for

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
hemocytometer coverslip and check for

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.960 
hemocytometer coverslip and check for
any<00:03:48.790> debris<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:49.540> film<00:03:50.230> on<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.700> generally<00:03:51.700> the

any debris or film on it generally the

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.240 
any debris or film on it generally the
places<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:52.720> have<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.290> most<00:03:53.530> debris<00:03:54.040> on

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
places that will have the most debris on

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.210 
places that will have the most debris on
it<00:03:54.280> Orly<00:03:54.790> these<00:03:55.000> corners<00:03:55.569> here<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.290> these

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
it Orly these corners here and these

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.400 
it Orly these corners here and these
edges<00:03:57.880> that's<00:03:58.180> where<00:03:58.480> material<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.200> most

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
edges that's where material is most

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.180 
edges that's where material is most
likely<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.130> dry<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.000> coverslip<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.650> even

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
likely to dry on the coverslip so even

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.150 
likely to dry on the coverslip so even
if<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.430> don't<00:04:03.700> see<00:04:04.000> any<00:04:04.380> material<00:04:05.380> on<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.860> I<00:04:06.099> will

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
if I don't see any material on it I will

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.440 
if I don't see any material on it I will
still<00:04:06.640> go<00:04:07.090> through<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.360> washing<00:04:07.959> procedure

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
still go through the washing procedure

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.229 
still go through the washing procedure
and<00:04:10.450> you'll<00:04:10.660> swish<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.200> in<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.500> hemocytometer

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
and you'll swish it in the hemocytometer

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.379 
and you'll swish it in the hemocytometer
detergent<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.220> scrub<00:04:15.549> it<00:04:15.730> between<00:04:16.000> your

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
detergent you can scrub it between your

detergent you can scrub it between your
thumb<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.799> forefinger<00:04:17.799> like<00:04:18.220> this<00:04:19.079> and<00:04:20.079> I<00:04:20.549> pay

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
thumb and forefinger like this and I pay

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.940 
thumb and forefinger like this and I pay
particular<00:04:21.790> attention<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.930> those<00:04:23.320> corners

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
particular attention to those corners

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.450 
particular attention to those corners
and<00:04:24.190> edges<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.710> showed<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:30.130> I<00:04:30.400> do

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
and edges that I showed you and I do

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.719 
and edges that I showed you and I do
that<00:04:30.820> three<00:04:31.780> times<00:04:31.810> or<00:04:32.530> sometimes<00:04:33.130> four<00:04:33.430> times

that three times or sometimes four times

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.170 
that three times or sometimes four times
depending<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.510> how<00:04:35.460> dirty<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.790> looked<00:04:37.030> to

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
depending on how dirty it looked to

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.740 
depending on how dirty it looked to
begin<00:04:37.510> with

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.450 

even<00:04:40.750> if<00:04:40.900> I've<00:04:41.139> cleaned<00:04:41.830> it<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> night<00:04:42.430> before

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
even if I've cleaned it the night before

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.250 
even if I've cleaned it the night before
I<00:04:42.940> still<00:04:43.450> clean<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:43.840> again<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.350> morning

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
I still clean it again in the morning

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.170 
I still clean it again in the morning
it's<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.740> critical<00:04:48.280> to<00:04:48.430> the<00:04:48.580> success<00:04:49.000> of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
it's just so critical to the success of

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.450 
it's just so critical to the success of
your<00:04:49.240> counts<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.410> really<00:04:51.160> really

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
your counts to have it really really

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.969 
your counts to have it really really
clean<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.000> then<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.110> always<00:04:53.320> want<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.800> hold

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
clean and then you always want to hold

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.380 
clean and then you always want to hold
it<00:04:54.220> from<00:04:54.460> these<00:04:54.880> sides<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.690> like<00:04:55.930> this<00:04:56.260> and

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
it from these sides just like this and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.260 
it from these sides just like this and
after<00:04:58.390> you've<00:04:59.280> scrubbed<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.700> last<00:05:00.910> time

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
after you've scrubbed it the last time

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.610 
after you've scrubbed it the last time
you<00:05:01.510> don't<00:05:01.660> want<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:02.020> touch<00:05:02.169> the<00:05:02.410> surface

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
you don't want to touch the surface

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.860 
you don't want to touch the surface
again<00:05:03.100> because<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:03.580> want<00:05:03.789> to<00:05:03.880> avoid<00:05:04.210> oil

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
again because you want to avoid oil

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
now we're going to take another Kim Kim

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.680 
now we're going to take another Kim Kim
wipe<00:05:33.170> lint-free<00:05:34.170> Kim<00:05:34.710> wipe<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:36.210> we're<00:05:36.510> just

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
wipe lint-free Kim wipe and we're just

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.780 
wipe lint-free Kim wipe and we're just
going<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:36.990> gently<00:05:37.350> dry<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.010> in<00:05:38.340> kind<00:05:38.490> of<00:05:38.640> a

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
going to gently dry it in kind of a

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.680 
going to gently dry it in kind of a
circular<00:05:39.150> motion<00:05:39.720> like<00:05:40.230> this<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:41.030> as<00:05:42.030> as<00:05:42.450> it

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
circular motion like this and as as it

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.280 
circular motion like this and as as it
gets<00:05:43.490> wet<00:05:44.490> we'll<00:05:44.850> move<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.450> over<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.900> a<00:05:45.930> dry

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
gets wet we'll move it over to a dry

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:54.469 
gets wet we'll move it over to a dry
area

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.610 

and<00:05:54.930> when<00:05:55.559> we<00:05:55.710> finished<00:05:56.749> we'll<00:05:57.749> check<00:05:58.169> it<00:05:58.379> for

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
and when we finished we'll check it for

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.619 
and when we finished we'll check it for
cleanliness<00:06:01.669> when<00:06:02.669> you<00:06:02.789> hold<00:06:03.029> it<00:06:03.180> up<00:06:03.300> to<00:06:03.360> the

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
cleanliness when you hold it up to the

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.689 
cleanliness when you hold it up to the
light<00:06:03.839> it<00:06:04.080> should<00:06:04.229> be<00:06:04.379> perfectly<00:06:04.889> clear<00:06:05.430> like

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
light it should be perfectly clear like

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.390 
light it should be perfectly clear like
a<00:06:05.729> window<00:06:06.360> and<00:06:06.629> you<00:06:07.289> might<00:06:07.499> even<00:06:07.529> hold<00:06:08.069> it<00:06:08.279> up

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
a window and you might even hold it up

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.779 
a window and you might even hold it up
against<00:06:08.699> something<00:06:09.089> black<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:10.639> should<00:06:11.639> be

there I'm just gonna sit it on top of my
hemocytometer<00:06:18.210> here<00:06:18.809> then<00:06:19.319> we<00:06:19.469> need<00:06:19.620> to

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
hemocytometer here then we need to

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.719 
hemocytometer here then we need to
prepare<00:06:20.129> a<00:06:20.809> moisture<00:06:21.809> chamber<00:06:22.349> you<00:06:23.249> can<00:06:23.279> use<00:06:23.699> a

just<00:06:33.749> just<00:06:34.439> barely<00:06:34.979> moisten<00:06:35.789> it<00:06:35.909> you<00:06:36.210> don't

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
just just barely moisten it you don't

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.019 
just just barely moisten it you don't
want<00:06:36.629> it<00:06:36.719> sopping<00:06:37.259> wet<00:06:37.639> or<00:06:38.639> you'll<00:06:38.819> get

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
want it sopping wet or you'll get

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:41.749 
want it sopping wet or you'll get
condensation<00:06:40.020> in<00:06:40.229> your<00:06:40.469> under<00:06:41.310> your<00:06:41.339> cover

condensation in your under your cover

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.309 
condensation in your under your cover
slip<00:06:42.120> and<00:06:42.360> that's<00:06:42.539> that's<00:06:42.990> not<00:06:43.259> good<00:06:43.560> so<00:06:45.319> this

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
slip and that's that's not good so this

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:50.809 
slip and that's that's not good so this
looks<00:06:46.620> just<00:06:46.800> about<00:06:46.979> right<00:06:48.979> you<00:06:49.979> can<00:06:50.159> also<00:06:50.370> add
