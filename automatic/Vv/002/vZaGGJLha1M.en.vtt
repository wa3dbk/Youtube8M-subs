tablet<00:03:11.410> UI<00:03:12.630> swiped<00:03:13.630> flash<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.530> should<00:03:14.680> be

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
tablet UI swiped flash that should be

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.290 
tablet UI swiped flash that should be
noted<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.490> still<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.090> testing

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
noted that this is still in the testing

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.150 
noted that this is still in the testing
phase<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:17.200> still<00:03:17.380> pretty<00:03:17.500> early<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.920> its

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
phase so it's still pretty early in its

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.450 
phase so it's still pretty early in its
development<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.540> may<00:03:19.630> be<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.780> few<00:03:20.080> bugs<00:03:20.460> so

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
development and it may be a few bugs so

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.010 
development and it may be a few bugs so
we'll<00:03:21.610> go<00:03:21.760> ahead<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.330> successful<00:03:22.900> we'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
we'll go ahead that was successful we'll

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.570 
we'll go ahead that was successful we'll
go<00:03:23.080> ahead<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.260> reboot<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.980> system<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.430> see

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
go ahead and reboot the system and see

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.280 
go ahead and reboot the system and see
what<00:03:24.700> we<00:03:24.790> got<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.660> we'll<00:03:28.810> see<00:03:28.930> what<00:03:29.050> kind<00:03:29.260> of

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
what we got so we'll see what kind of

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.980 
what we got so we'll see what kind of
difference<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.860> made<00:03:30.420> now<00:03:31.420> obviously<00:03:31.630> you

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
difference that made now obviously you

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.420 
difference that made now obviously you
should<00:03:32.230> probably<00:03:32.380> go<00:03:32.650> ahead<00:03:32.770> and<00:03:32.920> make<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
should probably go ahead and make a

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.330 
should probably go ahead and make a
backup<00:03:33.820> before<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.510> flash<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.190> you

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
backup before you flash that so if you

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.860 
backup before you flash that so if you
don't<00:03:36.460> like<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.790> tablet<00:03:37.120> UI<00:03:37.240> you<00:03:37.390> can<00:03:37.600> always

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
don't like the tablet UI you can always

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.860 
don't like the tablet UI you can always
go<00:03:38.020> back<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.560> for<00:03:39.070> some<00:03:39.220> reason<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:40.540> didn't

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
go back and for some reason you didn't

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.440 
go back and for some reason you didn't
make<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.460> backup<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.790> could<00:03:42.910> always<00:03:43.120> just

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
make a backup you could always just

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.110 
make a backup you could always just
reinstall<00:03:44.050> whatever<00:03:44.410> rom<00:03:44.620> you're<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.970> get

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
reinstall whatever rom you're on to get

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.760 
reinstall whatever rom you're on to get

raab<00:04:37.390> so<00:04:37.750> that's<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.170> very<00:04:38.380> much<00:04:38.980> older<00:04:39.400> bill

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
raab so that's a very much older bill

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.400 
raab so that's a very much older bill
but<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:39.970> is<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.150> one<00:04:40.510> just<00:04:40.900> for<00:04:41.050> testing

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
but that is the one just for testing

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.570 
but that is the one just for testing
purposes<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:41.980> I<00:04:42.040> went<00:04:42.220> on<00:04:42.310> ahead<00:04:42.430> and

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
purposes that I went on ahead and

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.540 
purposes that I went on ahead and
installed<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.690> it<00:04:44.050> worked<00:04:44.230> perfectly<00:04:44.650> so<00:04:44.980> if

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
installed and it worked perfectly so if

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.360 
installed and it worked perfectly so if
you<00:04:45.700> don't<00:04:46.000> mind<00:04:46.150> being<00:04:46.360> on<00:04:46.570> an<00:04:46.720> older<00:04:46.990> build

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
you don't mind being on an older build

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.620 
you don't mind being on an older build
also<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.400> did<00:04:48.580> flash<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.180> clockworkmod

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
also I did flash with clockworkmod

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.180 
also I did flash with clockworkmod
recovery<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.290> time<00:04:50.350> instead<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.770> team<00:04:51.010> win

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.590 
recovery this time instead of team win
recovery<00:04:51.220> project<00:04:52.060> because<00:04:52.240> they<00:04:52.420> did

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
recovery project because they did

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.810 
recovery project because they did
suggest<00:04:52.810> clockworkmod<00:04:53.590> recovery<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:54.610> that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
suggest clockworkmod recovery so that

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.460 
suggest clockworkmod recovery so that
could<00:04:54.970> have<00:04:55.060> been<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.270> only<00:04:55.450> thing<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:56.260> held

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.080 
could have been the only thing that held
it<00:04:56.590> back<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:56.980> I<00:04:57.160> installed<00:04:57.580> what<00:04:57.730> orphan

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
it back is that I installed what orphan

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.670 
it back is that I installed what orphan
on<00:04:58.210> clockworkmod<00:04:58.780> recovery<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.350> just<00:04:59.560> keep

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
on clockworkmod recovery so just keep

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.800 
on clockworkmod recovery so just keep
those<00:04:59.920> things<00:05:00.190> in<00:05:00.400> mind<00:05:00.460> but<00:05:00.820> once<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.690> does
