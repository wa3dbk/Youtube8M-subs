one<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:58.859> better<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> simpler

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
one a lot better because of the simpler

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.070 
one a lot better because of the simpler
design<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> screen<00:01:03.120> looks<00:01:03.149> really<00:01:03.840> big

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
design but the screen looks really big

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.280 
design but the screen looks really big
because<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.650> thousand<00:01:05.070> 24<00:01:05.489> x<00:01:05.640> 600

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
teller 780 megahertz chip which I guess

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.830 
teller 780 megahertz chip which I guess
they<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.450> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> first

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840

but for the price you pay it might

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.250 
but for the price you pay it might

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
actually android 2.1 right now but it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.280 
actually android 2.1 right now but it
should<00:01:45.920> be<00:01:45.950> upgraded<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.490> 2.2<00:01:47.270> by<00:01:47.510> the<00:01:47.930> time<00:01:48.110> it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
should be upgraded to 2.2 by the time it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.140 
should be upgraded to 2.2 by the time it
comes<00:01:48.320> out<00:01:49.660> and<00:01:51.670> let's<00:01:52.670> go<00:01:52.820> look<00:01:52.970> at<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
comes out and let's go look at the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:01.940 
comes out and let's go look at the
gallery<00:01:53.540> real<00:01:53.840> quick<00:01:55.210> nope<00:01:56.210> there's<00:01:56.510> no<00:01:56.570> media

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.960 

let's<00:02:02.950> go<00:02:03.100> try

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.630 

so<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:12.080> has<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.530> market<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.610> a

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
so this has the market it's just like a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.570 
so this has the market it's just like a
regular<00:02:14.120> Android<00:02:14.690> phone<00:02:14.990> but<00:02:15.710> I<00:02:15.740> you<00:02:16.400> know

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
regular Android phone but I you know

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.240 
regular Android phone but I you know
it's<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:18.140> pretty<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.740> think<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.130> would<00:02:19.220> be

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it's it's pretty I think it would be

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.430 
it's it's pretty I think it would be
nice<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.120> price<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.360> right<00:02:20.540> again<00:02:20.870> but<00:02:21.410> I

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
nice if the price is right again but I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.140 
nice if the price is right again but I
like<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.680> design<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.460> it's<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:23.000> nice

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
like the design of this it's really nice

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.070 
like the design of this it's really nice
and<00:02:24.970> also<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:28.190> can<00:02:28.370> go<00:02:28.520> up<00:02:28.700> Oh<00:02:29.240> sideways<00:02:29.870> or

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
and also it it can go up Oh sideways or

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.710 
and also it it can go up Oh sideways or
you<00:02:30.890> know<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.040> has<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> nice<00:02:31.510> accelerometer<00:02:32.510> so

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
you know it has a nice accelerometer so

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.780 
you know it has a nice accelerometer so
you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.960> go<00:02:33.080> all<00:02:33.350> four<00:02:33.740> ways<00:02:36.580> anyway<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.610> think

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
you can go all four ways anyway I think

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.870 
you can go all four ways anyway I think
this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.270> good<00:02:38.600> tablet<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.740> watch<00:02:39.890> offer<00:02:40.160> for
