rocket right over there and we are only

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.900 
rocket right over there and we are only
about<00:00:10.559> two<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.040> half<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.309> three<00:00:11.490> miles<00:00:11.700> away

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
about two and a half or three miles away

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.700 
about two and a half or three miles away
from<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.480> launch<00:00:12.690> pad<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> closest

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
from the launch pad this is the closest

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.799 
from the launch pad this is the closest
you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:13.889> get<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.700> we're<00:00:14.849> really<00:00:15.030> gonna

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
you can get to it so we're really gonna

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.269 
you can get to it so we're really gonna
get<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> great<00:00:16.320> view<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.800> rocket<00:00:17.190> it

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
get a great view of this rocket it

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.400 
get a great view of this rocket it
doesn't<00:00:17.520> look<00:00:17.670> like<00:00:17.880> much<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.359> screen<00:00:19.199> right

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
doesn't look like much on screen right

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
doesn't look like much on screen right
now<00:00:19.619> but<00:00:19.859> I'll<00:00:20.010> give<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> zoomed<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.910> view

of what it looks like and you can see
this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> what<00:00:23.519> I'm<00:00:23.609> actually<00:00:23.789> gonna<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.240> with

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
this is what I'm actually gonna see with

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.120 
this is what I'm actually gonna see with
my<00:00:24.539> eyes<00:00:24.600> when<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.170> lifts<00:00:25.410> off<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> pad<00:00:25.949> I'm

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
my eyes when it lifts off the pad I'm

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
my eyes when it lifts off the pad I'm
gonna<00:00:26.310> zoom<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.730> camera<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.330> well

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
gonna zoom in the camera there as well

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.120 
gonna zoom in the camera there as well
so<00:00:27.510> you'll<00:00:27.779> get<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.960> glimpse<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.560> too<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
so you'll get a glimpse of it too so it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800 
so you'll get a glimpse of it too so it
should<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.369> pretty<00:00:30.150> good<00:00:30.240> scene<00:00:30.599> now<00:00:30.689> this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.459 
come up during the course of this of
these<00:00:36.570> launch<00:00:36.780> attempts<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> not

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
these launch attempts this is not

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
these launch attempts this is not
unusual<00:00:37.950> these<00:00:38.070> sorts<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> things<00:00:38.430> happen<00:00:38.640> all

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
perfect weather but an Air Force radar

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.860 
perfect weather but an Air Force radar
went<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.430> had<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.480> work<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
went down so they had to do some work to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869 
went down so they had to do some work to
get<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.200> back<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.649> running<00:00:46.890> yesterday

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
get that back up and running yesterday

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
get that back up and running yesterday
upper-level<00:00:48.329> winds<00:00:48.690> were<00:00:48.899> too<00:00:49.110> high<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
upper-level winds were too high for the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.799 
upper-level winds were too high for the
rocket<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> launch<00:00:50.100> through<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.760> that

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
rocket to launch through so that

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.209 
rocket to launch through so that
scrubbed<00:00:51.809> yesterday's<00:00:52.500> mission<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.980> today

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
scrubbed yesterday's mission but today

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
scrubbed yesterday's mission but today
so<00:00:53.280> far<00:00:53.789> knock<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> wood<00:00:54.300> everything<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
so far knock on wood everything is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
so far knock on wood everything is
looking<00:00:55.140> good<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.649> spectacular<00:00:56.039> sunset

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
looking good for a spectacular sunset

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000 
looking good for a spectacular sunset
launch<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.809> hopefully<00:00:58.590> we'll<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.800> able<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
launch and hopefully we'll be able to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
launch and hopefully we'll be able to
get<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> doesn't<00:01:00.210> launch

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
get a look at that if it doesn't launch

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.599 
get a look at that if it doesn't launch
today<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.190> able<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> go

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
today it's not going to be able to go

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.820 
today it's not going to be able to go
until<00:01:02.940> February<00:01:03.420> 20th<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> reason<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.650> is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
until February 20th and the reason is is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
until February 20th and the reason is is
that<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> moon<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> certain<00:01:06.210> spot

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that the moon will be in a certain spot

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.679 
that the moon will be in a certain spot
in<00:01:06.689> space<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.409> impact<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
in space that will impact the the

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
in space that will impact the the
satellites<00:01:09.689> ability<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> spot

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
satellites ability to get into the spot

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
satellites ability to get into the spot
that<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> needs<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> million<00:01:12.420> miles<00:01:12.630> away

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that it needs to be a million miles away

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
that it needs to be a million miles away
from<00:01:13.049> Earth<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.650> monitor<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> Sun<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
from Earth to monitor the Sun and you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.640 
from Earth to monitor the Sun and you
can<00:01:15.390> check<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.780> preview<00:01:16.170> video<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.530> learn

more about what this Falcon 9 rocket is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
more about what this Falcon 9 rocket is
launching<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.860> gravity<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> issue<00:01:21.570> here<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
launching so gravity is a issue here so

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.270 
launching so gravity is a issue here so
they're<00:01:22.350> hoping<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> up<00:01:23.100> tonight

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
they're hoping to get this up tonight

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280 
they're hoping to get this up tonight
because<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.420> they<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.810> they're<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.080> have

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
because if they don't they're gonna have

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.950 
because if they don't they're gonna have
to<00:01:25.350> wait<00:01:25.619> until<00:01:26.250> February<00:01:26.400> 20th<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.540> get

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to wait until February 20th to get

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
to wait until February 20th to get
everything<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.740> off<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> ground<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.640> rocket

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
everything up off the ground this rocket

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
everything up off the ground this rocket
has<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.360> launch<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.810> exactly<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.710> time

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
has to launch at exactly the right time

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.550 
has to launch at exactly the right time
at<00:01:32.220> 6:03<00:01:32.549> p.m.<00:01:32.820> tonight<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.290> no<00:01:34.409> way

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
at 6:03 p.m. tonight so there's no way

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.289 
at 6:03 p.m. tonight so there's no way
they<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.740> delay<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> misses

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
they can delay it at all so if it misses

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
they can delay it at all so if it misses
that<00:01:36.600> 6:03<00:01:37.500> launch<00:01:37.710> time<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.130> we're<00:01:38.220> gonna

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that 6:03 launch time then we're gonna

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.030 
that 6:03 launch time then we're gonna
have<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> reset<00:01:39.119> until<00:01:39.329> February<00:01:40.320> 20th<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
have to reset until February 20th the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
have to reset until February 20th the
one<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.490> they've<00:01:41.610> changed<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> this

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
one thing that they've changed on this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
one thing that they've changed on this
mission<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.409> preview<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.860> did<00:01:44.009> earlier

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
mission from the preview we did earlier

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.649 
mission from the preview we did earlier
in<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> week<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:44.790> are<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> try<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
in the week they are not going to try to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.539 
in the week they are not going to try to
land<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.290> one<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.009> barge<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> we

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
land this one on that barge that we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.950 
land this one on that barge that we
talked<00:01:47.790> about<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.270> reason<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
talked about and the reason is that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
talked about and the reason is that
there's<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.770> pretty<00:01:49.890> bad<00:01:50.100> weather<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.610> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
there's some pretty bad weather out in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
there's some pretty bad weather out in
the<00:01:50.970> ocean<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> barge<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the ocean and the barge is really not

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
the ocean and the barge is really not
able<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> stay<00:01:53.460> stable<00:01:53.909> few<00:01:54.210> things<00:01:54.390> about

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
able to stay stable few things about

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.880 
able to stay stable few things about
rocket<00:01:54.899> launches<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.590> hard<00:01:55.740> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
rocket launches that are really hard to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.920 
rocket launches that are really hard to
translate<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.430> video<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.360> first<00:01:57.600> thing<00:01:57.780> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
translate on video the first thing is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.240 
translate on video the first thing is
the<00:01:58.170> sound<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.649> you're<00:01:58.740> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the sound so you're going to see this

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.800 
the sound so you're going to see this
thing<00:01:59.490> lift<00:01:59.759> off<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> ground<00:02:00.240> before<00:02:00.570> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
thing lift off the ground before we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
thing lift off the ground before we
actually<00:02:01.229> hear<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.159> takes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
actually hear it that's because it takes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
actually hear it that's because it takes
time<00:02:02.610> for<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.880> sound<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> travel<00:02:03.329> from<00:02:03.840> all

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
time for the sound to travel from all

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
time for the sound to travel from all
the<00:02:04.140> way<00:02:04.229> over<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:05.460> where<00:02:05.670> we're

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
the way over here to where we're

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399 
the way over here to where we're
standing<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> first<00:02:07.079> thing<00:02:07.259> to

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
standing so that is the first thing to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
standing so that is the first thing to
look<00:02:07.530> for<00:02:07.740> tonight<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.940> get<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.149> launch

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
look for tonight if we do get a launch

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.609 
look for tonight if we do get a launch
the<00:02:09.539> second<00:02:09.869> thing<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the second thing that is really

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.550 
the second thing that is really
interesting<00:02:10.770> is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
interesting is

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.750 
interesting is
brightness<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.250> that's<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.550> thing<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
brightness and that's the one thing that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.400 
brightness and that's the one thing that
really<00:02:13.030> does<00:02:13.240> not<00:02:13.390> come<00:02:13.660> over<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.170> video

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
really does not come over on the video

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.690 
really does not come over on the video
you're<00:02:14.590> gonna<00:02:14.650> see<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.010> fry<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.459> video

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
you're gonna see it fry it on the video

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.370 
you're gonna see it fry it on the video
but<00:02:15.760> when<00:02:16.569> you're<00:02:16.690> looking<00:02:16.870> at<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.170> it's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
but when you're looking at it it's

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.690 
but when you're looking at it it's
almost<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.740> looking<00:02:17.890> at<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> Sun<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.520> all

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
almost like looking at the Sun and all

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
almost like looking at the Sun and all
its<00:02:18.819> hurts<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.150> eyes<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.350> these<00:02:20.500> Rockets

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
its hurts your eyes to see these Rockets

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.350 
its hurts your eyes to see these Rockets
lift<00:02:21.040> off<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.400> ever<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> chance<00:02:21.970> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
lift off so you ever do get a chance to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.940 
lift off so you ever do get a chance to
see<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> rocket<00:02:22.900> launch<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:23.200> person<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.620> highly

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
see a rocket launch in person I highly

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.640 
see a rocket launch in person I highly
suggest<00:02:24.130> you<00:02:24.910> try<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.150> get<00:02:25.330> out<00:02:25.360> here<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.930> catch

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
suggest you try to get out here to catch

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.199 
suggest you try to get out here to catch
one<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.860> these<00:02:27.010> live<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.850> really

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
one of these live because it is really

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.940 
one of these live because it is really
an<00:02:28.330> amazing<00:02:28.810> experience<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.440> we're<00:02:29.590> gonna<00:02:29.680> sit

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
an amazing experience so we're gonna sit

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.890 
an amazing experience so we're gonna sit
back<00:02:30.100> here<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.430> await<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.480> launch<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
back here and await the launch and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.449 
back here and await the launch and
hopefully<00:02:32.260> we'll<00:02:32.410> see<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.770> lift<00:02:32.980> off<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> pad

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
hopefully we'll see it lift off the pad

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.430 
hopefully we'll see it lift off the pad
in<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> few<00:02:33.819> minutes<00:02:34.080> five<00:02:35.080> four<00:02:36.069> three<00:02:37.050> two<00:02:38.050> one

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
in a few minutes five four three two one

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.090 
in a few minutes five four three two one
and<00:02:39.959> we<00:02:40.959> have<00:02:41.050> ignition<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.150> there<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.750> goes

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and we have ignition and there it goes

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.930 
and we have ignition and there it goes
you<00:02:45.100> notice<00:02:45.310> we're<00:02:45.430> not<00:02:45.459> hearing<00:02:45.790> anything

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
you notice we're not hearing anything

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.370 
you notice we're not hearing anything
yet<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.690> because<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.170> going<00:02:47.320> to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
yet and that is because it's going to

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.690 
yet and that is because it's going to
take<00:02:47.560> some<00:02:47.739> time<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.250> sound<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.670> travel

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
take some time for the sound to travel

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.120 
take some time for the sound to travel
over<00:02:49.300> here<00:02:49.450> look<00:02:49.600> how<00:02:49.750> bright<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.380> you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
over here look how bright that is you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.130 
over here look how bright that is you
cannot<00:02:51.519> I<00:02:51.820> cannot<00:02:52.420> explain<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.019> how

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
cannot I cannot explain to you how

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.410 
cannot I cannot explain to you how
bright<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.680> rocket<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.489> person<00:02:54.970> versus

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
bright this rocket is in person versus

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:29.530 
bright this rocket is in person versus
what<00:02:55.570> we're<00:02:55.690> hearing<00:02:55.870> here<00:02:55.989> comes<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.410> sound

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.960 

what<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> sight<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:34.500> feel<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.100> air<00:03:35.310> shaking

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
what a sight I can feel the air shaking

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
what a sight I can feel the air shaking
right<00:03:36.150> now

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.630 

it's<00:03:42.990> almost<00:03:43.140> going<00:03:43.350> straight<00:03:43.860> up<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> air

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
it's almost going straight up in the air

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.490 
it's almost going straight up in the air
this<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.210> trajectory<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.750> has<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.080> take<00:03:46.290> to

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
this is the trajectory it has to take to

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.710 
this is the trajectory it has to take to
get<00:03:46.740> to<00:03:47.010> where<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:48.060> normally<00:03:48.480> it's<00:03:48.630> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
get to where it's going normally it's a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.690 
get to where it's going normally it's a
it's<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.170> little<00:03:49.380> bit<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.680> less<00:03:50.400> steep

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
it's a little bit of a less steep

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.180 
it's a little bit of a less steep
incline<00:03:51.210> for<00:03:51.630> some<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.650> other<00:03:52.770> missions

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
incline for some of the other missions

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:04.520 
incline for some of the other missions
that<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:53.490> do<00:03:53.550> with<00:03:53.820> these

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.660 

you<00:04:05.530> know<00:04:05.590> hope<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.890> will<00:04:06.010> be<00:04:06.160> able<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.400> see<00:04:06.550> the

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
you know hope it will be able to see the

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.890 
you know hope it will be able to see the
staging<00:04:07.120> when<00:04:07.210> it<00:04:07.300> happens<00:04:07.660> when<00:04:07.780> they

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
staging when it happens when they

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.010 
staging when it happens when they
jettison<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.620> first<00:04:08.950> stage<00:04:09.220> we'll<00:04:09.580> see<00:04:13.020> you

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
jettison that first stage we'll see you

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.070 
jettison that first stage we'll see you
can<00:04:14.170> see<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:15.000> neat<00:04:16.000> shadow<00:04:16.360> coming<00:04:16.780> off<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
can see a neat shadow coming off the

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.480 
can see a neat shadow coming off the
plume<00:04:17.320> here<00:04:17.590> as<00:04:17.709> well<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.780> Falcon<00:04:23.200> 9<00:04:23.230> is<00:04:23.490> off

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
plume here as well the Falcon 9 is off

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:36.150 
plume here as well the Falcon 9 is off
the<00:04:24.970> pad<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.510> delivering<00:04:26.050> its<00:04:26.230> cargo

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:43.090 

there's<00:04:37.160> me<00:04:37.310> engine<00:04:37.520> cutoff

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.990 

and<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:48.690> that<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.500> Falcon<00:04:49.980> 9<00:04:50.160> is<00:04:50.190> often

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
and so that is it the Falcon 9 is often

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.480 
and so that is it the Falcon 9 is often
delivering<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.660> discover<00:04:52.110> satellite<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.220> its

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
delivering the discover satellite to its

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.310 
delivering the discover satellite to its
new<00:04:53.880> location<00:04:54.450> which<00:04:54.600> will<00:04:54.720> be<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> million

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
new location which will be a million

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.080 
new location which will be a million
miles<00:04:55.530> away<00:04:55.710> it's<00:04:55.980> gonna<00:04:56.070> take<00:04:56.280> about<00:04:56.370> 110

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
miles away it's gonna take about 110

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.970 
miles away it's gonna take about 110
days<00:04:57.360> for<00:04:57.720> Discoverer<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.290> reach<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.710> point

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
days for Discoverer to reach that point

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.100 
days for Discoverer to reach that point
but<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.430> is<00:04:59.580> on<00:04:59.760> its<00:05:00.360> way<00:05:00.450> I'd<00:05:00.660> love<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.900> hear

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110
