call it silliness
madness<00:00:14.809> stupidity<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.020> was<00:00:16.949> looking<00:00:17.609> at<00:00:17.730> this

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
madness stupidity I was looking at this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
madness stupidity I was looking at this
axial<00:00:19.109> wraith<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.310> kind<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.910> mostly

stock ish form right now and realized
something<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.510> done<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
something that could be done to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.310 
something that could be done to
completely<00:00:28.580> transform<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:30.630> vehicle<00:00:31.080> into

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
completely transform the vehicle into

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.120 
completely transform the vehicle into
something<00:00:31.949> very<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:33.059> different<00:00:33.649> for<00:00:34.649> not

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
something very very different for not

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
something very very different for not
much<00:00:35.340> cost<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.120> very<00:00:36.750> quickly<00:00:37.050> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
much cost and very quickly actually

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.729

haven't<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.880> driven<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.510> yet

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
haven't actually driven this thing yet

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.390 
haven't actually driven this thing yet
but<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.200> may<00:01:13.409> well<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:15.090> good<00:01:15.479> candidate<00:01:16.020> for

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
but it may well be a good candidate for

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.890 
but it may well be a good candidate for
doing<00:01:17.400> such<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> conversion<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:20.630> today

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.090 

it's<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> monster<00:01:25.380> truck<00:01:29.210> yeah<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.869> said

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
it's a monster truck yeah like I said

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's a monster truck yeah like I said
stupidity<00:01:32.100> madness<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.390> know<00:01:34.159> here's

stupidity madness I don't know here's

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.010 
stupidity madness I don't know here's
the<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.790> might<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.240> looking<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.869> these

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the thing you might be looking at these

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.649 
the thing you might be looking at these
these<00:01:38.150> these<00:01:39.150> wheels<00:01:40.040> or<00:01:41.040> tires<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.820> both<00:01:42.030> I'm

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
these these wheels or tires or both I'm

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
these these wheels or tires or both I'm
thinking<00:01:43.020> well<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.560> ridiculous

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
thinking well that's just ridiculous

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.010 
thinking well that's just ridiculous
they're<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.520> too<00:01:44.549> big<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.630> snap

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
they're way too big it's just gonna snap

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.440 
they're way too big it's just gonna snap
drive<00:01:46.439> lines<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> such<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:48.060> compare

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
drive lines and such but you compare

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.109 
drive lines and such but you compare
those<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.710> counts<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.610> those<00:01:50.880> which

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
those that what counts about those which

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.639 
those that what counts about those which
is<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> diameter<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.500> what

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
is really the diameter that's what

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
is really the diameter that's what
counts<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.159> dealing<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:54.180> worrying

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
counts for dealing with or worrying

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.859 
counts for dealing with or worrying
about<00:01:54.630> torque<00:01:55.490> it's<00:01:56.490> very<00:01:57.149> close<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.630> diameter

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
about torque it's very close in diameter

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.350 
about torque it's very close in diameter
these<00:01:58.380> are<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.680> regular<00:01:59.250> old<00:02:00.290> proline<00:02:02.090> T<00:02:03.090> Max

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
is very very very close to the diameter
you<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.849> for<00:02:12.180> just<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.450> regular

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you would have for just a regular

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.230 
you would have for just a regular
large<00:02:14.340> crawler<00:02:15.270> tire<00:02:16.790> it's<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.060> little

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
large crawler tire it's just a little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 
large crawler tire it's just a little
just<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.720> little<00:02:18.990> bit<00:02:19.110> larger<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.860> quarter

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
just a little bit larger like a quarter

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.770 
just a little bit larger like a quarter
of<00:02:20.340> an<00:02:20.430> inch<00:02:20.550> it's<00:02:20.820> not<00:02:20.940> enough<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.390> make<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
of an inch it's not enough to make a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.400 
of an inch it's not enough to make a
substantial<00:02:23.390> difference<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.260> actual

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
substantial difference in the actual

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.170 
substantial difference in the actual
load<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.130> you're<00:02:26.220> going<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.400> be<00:02:26.490> putting<00:02:26.760> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
load that you're going to be putting on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.660 
load that you're going to be putting on
your<00:02:27.780> axles<00:02:28.320> certainly<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.100> more<00:02:29.400> width

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
your axles certainly you have more width

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.690 
your axles certainly you have more width
so<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.360> ability<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.930> push<00:02:31.830> more

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
so you have the ability to push more

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.440 
so you have the ability to push more
torque<00:02:33.090> by<00:02:33.270> having<00:02:33.600> more<00:02:33.840> total<00:02:34.650> forward<00:02:35.100> bite

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
torque by having more total forward bite

threes i think they're called and they

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.850 
threes i think they're called and they
have<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> lot<00:05:00.070> of<00:05:00.930> offset<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.260> them<00:05:02.440> you<00:05:02.590> can<00:05:02.710> see

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
have a lot of offset to them you can see

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.000 
have a lot of offset to them you can see
where<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.310> hub<00:05:03.490> is<00:05:03.699> it's<00:05:03.910> very<00:05:04.210> very<00:05:04.900> close<00:05:05.350> to

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
where the hub is it's very very close to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.770 
where the hub is it's very very close to
the<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.580> inside<00:05:07.000> there<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.449> makes<00:05:07.660> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
the the inside there so it makes it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.629 
the the inside there so it makes it
extra<00:05:08.530> wide<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:09.039> that's<00:05:09.160> just<00:05:09.340> gonna<00:05:09.430> give

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
extra wide and that's just gonna give

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.510 
extra wide and that's just gonna give
you<00:05:09.729> extra<00:05:10.030> stability<00:05:10.240> because<00:05:10.930> these<00:05:11.520> larger

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
you extra stability because these larger

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.360 
you extra stability because these larger
wheels<00:05:12.760> are<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.229> have<00:05:14.229> such<00:05:14.830> a<00:05:14.860> large<00:05:15.160> diameter

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
wheels are so have such a large diameter

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.820 
wheels are so have such a large diameter
you<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:15.789> actually<00:05:16.030> put<00:05:16.750> ones<00:05:16.930> on<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
you can actually put ones on to the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.680 
you can actually put ones on to the
Wraiths<00:05:18.039> that<00:05:18.370> don't<00:05:18.639> have<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:19.060> much<00:05:19.270> offset

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
Wraiths that don't have that much offset

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.469 
Wraiths that don't have that much offset
because<00:05:19.780> they'll<00:05:19.960> just<00:05:20.169> fit<00:05:20.530> over<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.699> hubs

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
because they'll just fit over the hubs

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.999 
because they'll just fit over the hubs
both<00:05:22.810> front<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.259> rear<00:05:23.349> but<00:05:23.650> it's<00:05:23.770> nice<00:05:23.889> to

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
both front and rear but it's nice to

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.820 
both front and rear but it's nice to
have<00:05:24.160> extra<00:05:24.340> offset<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.539> for<00:05:25.990> like<00:05:26.380> set<00:05:26.590> more

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
have extra offset just for like set more

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.300 
have extra offset just for like set more
width<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.250> more<00:05:27.430> stability<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:28.090> then<00:05:28.539> for

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
width and more stability and then for

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.529 
width and more stability and then for
adapters<00:05:30.310> and<00:05:30.550> these<00:05:30.760> are<00:05:30.910> just<00:05:31.060> some<00:05:31.210> new

would also work them I'm willing to bet

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.529

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
that some of the the ones that people

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.740 
that some of the the ones that people
use<00:06:16.960> for<00:06:17.349> putting<00:06:18.159> 17<00:06:18.550> millimeter<00:06:18.909> wheels<00:06:19.539> and

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750

fit on to this because it does use a

that<00:06:42.759> you<00:06:42.789> like<00:06:43.949> preferably<00:06:44.949> with<00:06:45.539> as<00:06:46.539> much

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
that you like preferably with as much

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.969 
that you like preferably with as much
offset<00:06:47.259> as<00:06:47.409> possible<00:06:48.599> 17<00:06:49.599> millimeter<00:06:50.199> hub<00:06:50.680> and

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
offset as possible 17 millimeter hub and

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:53.249 
offset as possible 17 millimeter hub and
there<00:06:51.220> you<00:06:51.370> go<00:06:51.520> you<00:06:51.580> just<00:06:51.909> put<00:06:52.629> it<00:06:52.750> on<00:06:52.870> and

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
there you go you just put it on and

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.180 
there you go you just put it on and
you're<00:06:53.710> pretty<00:06:54.129> much<00:06:54.280> set<00:06:54.729> so<00:06:55.539> it's<00:06:55.720> just<00:06:55.870> a

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
you're pretty much set so it's just a

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.790 
you're pretty much set so it's just a
funky<00:06:57.190> little<00:06:57.340> thing<00:06:57.669> to<00:06:57.819> try<00:06:58.060> another

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
funky little thing to try another

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.260 
funky little thing to try another
different<00:06:59.800> thing<00:07:00.009> that<00:07:00.039> you<00:07:00.310> can<00:07:00.460> do<00:07:00.669> with<00:07:01.120> the

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.270 
different thing that you can do with the

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.959 
different thing that you can do with the
axial<00:07:01.780> wraiths<00:07:02.050> again<00:07:02.710> I<00:07:02.740> don't<00:07:02.889> know<00:07:03.069> just

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:03.969 
axial wraiths again I don't know just

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:05.909 
axial wraiths again I don't know just
how<00:07:04.030> much<00:07:04.360> power<00:07:04.659> it<00:07:04.960> would<00:07:05.139> withstand<00:07:05.440> under

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
how much power it would withstand under

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.709 
how much power it would withstand under
this<00:07:06.159> but<00:07:06.460> I'm<00:07:07.000> willing<00:07:07.240> to<00:07:07.330> bet<00:07:07.479> that<00:07:07.509> it

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:07.719 
this but I'm willing to bet that it

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.839 
this but I'm willing to bet that it
would<00:07:07.810> be<00:07:07.990> very<00:07:08.379> very<00:07:08.830> similar<00:07:09.400> to<00:07:09.580> the<00:07:09.639> power

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
would be very very similar to the power

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:12.180 
would be very very similar to the power
that<00:07:10.090> you<00:07:10.240> could<00:07:10.389> put<00:07:10.569> through<00:07:11.259> whoops<00:07:11.680> all

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
that you could put through whoops all

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.890 
that you could put through whoops all
kinds<00:07:12.490> of<00:07:12.520> parts<00:07:12.819> coming<00:07:13.120> from<00:07:13.270> off-screen

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
kinds of parts coming from off-screen

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.869 
kinds of parts coming from off-screen
here<00:07:14.110> very<00:07:14.650> similar<00:07:14.889> to<00:07:15.129> the<00:07:15.219> power<00:07:15.430> that<00:07:15.729> you

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
here very similar to the power that you

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:17.909 
here very similar to the power that you
could<00:07:16.000> put<00:07:16.270> through<00:07:16.930> a<00:07:16.960> normal<00:07:17.469> set<00:07:17.770> of

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 
could put through a normal set of

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:19.409 
could put through a normal set of
crawler<00:07:18.250> tires<00:07:18.580> especially<00:07:19.120> when<00:07:19.300> you

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
crawler tires especially when you

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.140 
crawler tires especially when you
consider<00:07:19.539> that<00:07:19.889> a<00:07:20.889> normal<00:07:21.639> set<00:07:21.849> of<00:07:21.940> crawler

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
consider that a normal set of crawler

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.270 
consider that a normal set of crawler
tires<00:07:22.449> is<00:07:22.659> going<00:07:22.900> to<00:07:22.990> be<00:07:23.139> weighted<00:07:23.830> so<00:07:24.159> it's

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 
tires is going to be weighted so it's

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.860 
tires is going to be weighted so it's
gonna<00:07:24.400> have<00:07:24.550> a<00:07:24.580> lot<00:07:24.819> more<00:07:24.849> weight<00:07:25.240> a<00:07:25.300> lot<00:07:25.599> more

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:25.870 
gonna have a lot more weight a lot more

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.350 
gonna have a lot more weight a lot more
resistance<00:07:26.830> to<00:07:26.919> spinning<00:07:27.490> up<00:07:27.669> than<00:07:27.969> these

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
resistance to spinning up than these

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.170 
resistance to spinning up than these
guys<00:07:28.569> here<00:07:28.990> with<00:07:29.139> no<00:07:29.319> weight<00:07:29.530> in<00:07:29.740> them<00:07:29.889> and

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
guys here with no weight in them and

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.809 
guys here with no weight in them and
again<00:07:31.180> the<00:07:31.449> diameter<00:07:31.960> is<00:07:32.560> pretty<00:07:32.919> close<00:07:33.279> it's

00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:33.819 
again the diameter is pretty close it's

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.070 
again the diameter is pretty close it's
like<00:07:34.029> a<00:07:34.060> quarter<00:07:34.539> of<00:07:34.630> an<00:07:34.719> inch<00:07:34.810> difference

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 
like a quarter of an inch difference

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.010 
like a quarter of an inch difference
over<00:07:35.860> the<00:07:35.889> span<00:07:36.580> of<00:07:36.610> more<00:07:37.180> than<00:07:37.360> five<00:07:37.599> inches

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
over the span of more than five inches

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.740 
over the span of more than five inches
something<00:07:39.009> worth<00:07:39.580> trying<00:07:39.789> out<00:07:40.029> so<00:07:40.569> if<00:07:40.630> you

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:40.750 
something worth trying out so if you

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.439 
something worth trying out so if you
guys<00:07:40.979> do<00:07:41.979> try<00:07:42.219> that<00:07:42.460> out<00:07:42.639> be<00:07:42.819> sure<00:07:42.849> to<00:07:43.090> put<00:07:43.270> up<00:07:43.360> a

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.449 
guys do try that out be sure to put up a

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:45.180 
guys do try that out be sure to put up a

anyway that's it for this I just wanted
to<00:07:51.580> put<00:07:52.120> that<00:07:52.300> idea<00:07:52.479> out<00:07:52.900> there<00:07:53.199> and<00:07:53.440> see<00:07:53.680> if<00:07:53.770> it

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889 
to put that idea out there and see if it

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:55.529 
to put that idea out there and see if it
takes<00:07:54.069> root<00:07:54.279> with<00:07:54.490> anybody<00:07:54.849> if<00:07:55.120> nobody<00:07:55.449> else

00:07:55.529 --> 00:07:55.539 
takes root with anybody if nobody else

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.110 
takes root with anybody if nobody else
does<00:07:55.810> it<00:07:55.960> I'll<00:07:56.860> probably<00:07:57.159> give<00:07:57.520> it<00:07:57.639> a<00:07:57.699> try<00:07:57.909> at

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 
does it I'll probably give it a try at

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.570 
does it I'll probably give it a try at
some<00:07:58.360> point<00:07:58.599> but<00:07:58.900> not<00:07:59.169> immediately<00:08:00.039> because

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.580 
some point but not immediately because
