00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
kind of had like normal humanoid legs it

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
kind of had like normal humanoid legs it
had<00:01:46.979> all<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.729> maneuverability<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
had all of the maneuverability of a

human being but with missile pods and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
human being but with missile pods and
lasers<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.560> lot<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> don't<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.729> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lasers a lot of you don't know but it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.480 
lasers a lot of you don't know but it
can<00:01:54.060> change<00:01:54.090> its<00:01:54.540> mask<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.920> only<00:01:55.950> make

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
can change its mask it can not only make

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.120 
can change its mask it can not only make
itself<00:01:56.820> heavier<00:01:57.299> due<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> different<00:01:58.799> planets

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
itself heavier due to different planets

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
itself heavier due to different planets
having<00:01:59.399> different<00:01:59.759> gravitational<00:02:00.149> pools<00:02:00.630> but

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
having different gravitational pools but

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
having different gravitational pools but
it<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.380> also<00:02:01.500> normalize<00:02:02.250> its<00:02:02.549> its<00:02:03.060> mass<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it can also normalize its its mass it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.569 
it can also normalize its its mass it
can<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.049> itself<00:02:04.350> heavier<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.460> be

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
can make itself heavier that can be

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.950 
can make itself heavier that can be
utilized<00:02:05.729> as<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> weapon<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.509> lot<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.719> people

even<00:02:22.829> get<00:02:23.010> close<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.370> anything<00:02:23.939> in<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.150> game<00:02:24.389> I'm

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
even get close to anything in a game I'm

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.229 
even get close to anything in a game I'm
essentially<00:02:25.409> a<00:02:25.709> sniper<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:26.999> anything

of you change my mass squish Curtin's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.140 
of you change my mass squish Curtin's
it's<00:02:37.139> virtually<00:02:37.799> unstoppable<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.819> only<00:02:39.030> way

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150

Master Chief was able to take it down

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.379 
Master Chief was able to take it down
was<00:02:40.889> actually<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.519> in<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.849> cockpit<00:02:42.060> of

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
was actually to get in the cockpit of

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.929

bit that's not just how like a giant
machine<00:02:59.790> gun<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.659> little<00:03:00.989> arc<00:03:01.169> cannon

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
machine gun on it like little arc cannon

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.289 
machine gun on it like little arc cannon
or<00:03:01.859> something<00:03:02.219> someone<00:03:02.549> with<00:03:02.699> some<00:03:02.849> good<00:03:03.000> pow

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
or something someone with some good pow

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.300 
or something someone with some good pow

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
over there please what's dead so not

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.129 
over there please what's dead so not
only<00:03:08.189> is<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:08.609> like<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.359> maneuverability

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
only is it just like the maneuverability

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.500 
only is it just like the maneuverability
of<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.349> normal<00:03:10.650> vehicle<00:03:10.829> but<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.790> intelligence

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
of a normal vehicle but the intelligence

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.530 
of a normal vehicle but the intelligence
of<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:13.319> very<00:03:13.949> very<00:03:14.959> smart<00:03:15.959> creature<00:03:17.540> okay

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.469 
same time I came from the gorilla there
has<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> be<00:03:23.669> some<00:03:23.819> kind<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.000> bonus<00:03:24.180> points

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
has to be some kind of bonus points

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.569 
has to be some kind of bonus points
therefore<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.840> gorillas<00:03:25.439> and<00:03:25.620> apes<00:03:25.949> they're

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
therefore that gorillas and apes they're

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.129 
therefore that gorillas and apes they're
intelligent<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:27.209> have<00:03:27.479> to<00:03:27.599> think<00:03:27.750> there's<00:03:28.019> some

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
intelligent I have to think there's some

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.869 
intelligent I have to think there's some
kind<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.319> nugget<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.709> Hope<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:29.009> there<00:03:29.189> you<00:03:29.519> have

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
kind of nugget of Hope in there you have

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.550 
kind of nugget of Hope in there you have
the<00:03:30.000> agility<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.629> move<00:03:30.810> around<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.229> dash<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the agility to move around and dash and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.409 
the agility to move around and dash and
do<00:03:31.979> your<00:03:32.129> jump<00:03:32.370> jets<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.790> stuff<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.150> fly<00:03:33.359> up

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
do your jump jets and stuff and fly up

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.539 
do your jump jets and stuff and fly up
in<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.750> air<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.139> then<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.590> also<00:03:35.040> just<00:03:35.340> rain

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
in the air and then you also just rain

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.219 
in the air and then you also just rain
down<00:03:35.729> destruction<00:03:35.759> with<00:03:36.389> your<00:03:36.540> weapons<00:03:36.870> and

down destruction with your weapons and

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:39.110 
down destruction with your weapons and
then<00:03:37.319> they<00:03:37.439> also<00:03:37.590> had<00:03:37.919> shields<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.579> would

then they also had shields that would

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.530 
then they also had shields that would
would<00:03:39.659> shield<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.290> outside<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:41.040> well<00:03:41.540> you

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
would shield the outside as well you

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.089 
would shield the outside as well you
know<00:03:42.659> powered<00:03:42.989> by<00:03:43.079> some<00:03:43.319> kind<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> energy<00:03:44.069> or
