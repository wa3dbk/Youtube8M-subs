00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.430

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.350
 let's see here that is the least 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.350
 complicated, very careful 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.380

 video console get to us in 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.120
 the month of December awaits the date in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 which they were going to deliver the console 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 so that selling his books by the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.910
 great acceptance that the console had 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 here we have the box as you can 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:23.560

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.050
 and also we are going to withdraw the part 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.970
 frontal that tells us here 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.770
 billy beane thank you for believing I'm not 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.700
 here as I tell you we are one of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.860
 the first to support this project and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.720
 therefore, it has not been reached 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.990
 console before you here 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.300
 they are seeing that this one would come to be 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.490
 the console is tiny we are going to put 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.170
 where is the bottom to show you 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 the comparison with the iphone 5 is no more 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.050
 small than the iphone 5 and we're going to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.569
 teach you we are going to take out the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:12.950
 plastics of all unpacking 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.290
 does not have the fresh ventilation area and 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.579
 this little console now has the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 tickets that now more art we are going to 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:24.870
 talk about them and here we have control 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 and also let's talk for a while with 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.080
 Regarding what you are going to find 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.170
 there they have changed the letters 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.599
 they have put on how good to make theirs not like 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.450
 you with appreciate and let's see what 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:42.420
 more we have in the box 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.849
 here we have the batteries for the control 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 because apparently one removes these 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.459
 front covers, place the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.459
 batteries here and ready 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.790

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 console and we have this from here 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.130
 important to connect it to the TV 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.209
 and the respective manuals now yes 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.610
 let's retire and talk a little 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.860
 about the specifications of this 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.060
 console that apparently is the if 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.739
 you now I am going to read you the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.500
 specifications seems like it's a 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.239
 phone as I mentioned at the beginning and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 is a system-based console 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.190

 a ram of 1GB a memory 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.510
 8 gb internal expandable in terms 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.489
 what comes to be the entries you 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.910

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.900
 micro usb input as well as a 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.299
 USB 2.0 input has an ethernet port 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.470

 connect it say to the wall 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.950
 wifi connectivity bluetooth 4.0 and the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.470
 price which will be selling in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.620
 the market as of June 25 is 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.379
 of 99 dollars taken care of included within 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.599
 your package a control in case one 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.269
 want to buy additional control what 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.420
 can find the vtv website to 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.160
 a value of 49 dollars with 99 to be able 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.370
 installing the battery is very simple 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.169
 simply uncover the part of the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.240
 extremes that you can see and 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.300
 they install a battery in each one 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.009
 exported to this one and that's all for 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.069
 power 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.460
 operate the control the buttons you 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.659
 you can see that here we have two levers 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.580
 analogs that also work like 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.830
 buttons we have here 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.569
 the on / off button 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.960
 typical four buttons that in this case 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.389
 you have already placed the letters of the company 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.180
 over here we have two triggers and two 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.760
 more buttons and here is the 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.980
 touchpad 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.630
 it's interesting to see that this control 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.890
 it closely resembles what you 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.900
 possibly they will find in the 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.090
 market but the company 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.350
 julia when you in the video at 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.540
 moment that they started this 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.720
 project because they really put him 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.190
 a lot of emphasis on control and you 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.810
 can see all the designs that they 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.100
 had at hand and finally they came to 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.160
 the conclusion that this was the ideal 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.160
 it is more the most ergonomic 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.600
 and that works more comfortable in the hand of 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.790
 the users when they are playing 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.000
 let's try it and later on we're going to 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.160
 give you a complete review already 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.810
 be the console the games and the 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.970
 experience that one can have with her 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.650
 remember that this is a console based 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.210
 in the Android operating system so 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.740
 that the games that we are going to 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.570
 to be able to use on our screen 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.210
 TV are going to be practically 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.530
 those that you are in your 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.940
 mobile device just you 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.920
 they are going to have a bigger screen and 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.290
 they will be able to use the control to 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.240
 can play then as I tell you more 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.920
 go ahead let's do this analysis and 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.900
