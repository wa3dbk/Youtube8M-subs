was aiming to get three pound off so I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.290 
was aiming to get three pound off so I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really upset but I kind of I couldn't be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
really upset but I kind of I couldn't be
because<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.359> best<00:01:00.629> friend<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:01.079> her<00:01:01.230> first

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
had a very small loss or stayed the same

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.389 
had a very small loss or stayed the same
or<00:01:40.860> I've<00:01:40.979> gained<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.549> maybe<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:43.020> me<00:01:43.229> star<00:01:44.159> week

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and the way styebeck affects me is the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.889 
and the way styebeck affects me is the
week<00:01:46.649> before<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.399> tend<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> heavier<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> don't

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
week before I tend to be heavier I don't
know<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.430> that's<00:01:50.430> definitely<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.180> pattern

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
know and that's definitely a pattern

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
know and that's definitely a pattern
I've<00:01:51.750> noticed<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.310> could<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
I've noticed so that could be what it

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.300 
I've noticed so that could be what it
was<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:55.049> week<00:01:55.290> main<00:01:55.590> member<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.729 
for each day and sim free tomorrow and
obviously<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.930> would<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.230> camp<00:02:42.470> at<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.650> as

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
obviously I would have camp at it as

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.280 
obviously I would have camp at it as
part<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:42.980> my<00:02:43.160> sins<00:02:43.459> on<00:02:43.760> friday<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.660> actually

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
I've over accounted for it so hopefully

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.040 
I've over accounted for it so hopefully
that<00:02:49.550> wouldn't<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.330> caused<00:02:50.570> too<00:02:50.870> much

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050
