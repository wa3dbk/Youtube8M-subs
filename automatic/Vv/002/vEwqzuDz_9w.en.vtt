 the best secrets to reflect it 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:44.190
 let's start secret recharge number 1 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 well these are recharge secrets that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930
 the game developers have been 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.699
 done bowling and for madness to do 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.900
 secret charges the possibility in 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.780
 reality is one in a million 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.420
 practically because they are almost impossible 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.580
 and they are with specific weapons this we are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.680
 seeing that it is one of the bazooka of these 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.420
 videos have only been recorded four if in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.869
 serious as only four people have 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.390
 come out and it's like everything normal comes 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.430
 in father and that my parents and then like 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.110
 that the wave is going to the soldier and not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 knows how to recharge that is this means 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.220
 so good this is the man's 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 sand the sand man consists of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.490
 that a hand comes out of the right as of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.130
 a man of sand and he gives you the recharge is 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.670
 very by turban a little if you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.190
 you consider good this is one of a rifle 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.740
 I do not think what it's called, according to 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.420
 people are excited because and I think that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 is the developer this game bases that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 I fuck with star wars and they think it's 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.240
 reference to force then actually 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.369
 refers to the telekinesis of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.479
 protagonist of dead space a game 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.970
 ancient that have also been 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.620
 developers 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.680
 and gay 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.660
 here is another example of a law that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 they confused people there this is 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.220
 one of you being that this is like a 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.130
 magic trick because as you see the 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.380
 gun you do not see where it is there it is and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.180
 that's a bit weird because it's like 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 inside with magic half by turban 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.470
 number two and the manageable armchair 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 good after the small introduction 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.190
 that we will have we will talk about the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.010
 handy armchair so you can say in 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 because this in Spanish Spanish I bono your 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.270
 real name is less aria american dream 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.280
 American dream that is called and good 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.010
 also in this is the most 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.830
 fast of the whole game and it comes out in this 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.980
 no more crude map next penalty and 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.849
 well here you can find it 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.140
 you get to a place and it says american dream ' 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.519
 same if you kill someone in the corner 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.280
 top says america 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.560
 I say america how the american has 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.819
 seat for four people is not being 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.299
 seeing 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.689
 of copilot driver one from above and 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:17.260
 one on the side and well this is that it is a 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.290
 very very rare vehicle or is it like very 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.239
 I miss this one too if you have a good 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.939
 momentum can go up to fly it 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.540
 can repair with the engineer that has 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.859
 the torch can repair it and it's good 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.810
 which is a very rare vehicle imagine 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.439
 get with someone and kill him and he 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.180
 will be with cra draw an armchair and 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.459
 good is that with that you can handle it and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.200
 is that it is very real is like all terrain 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.889
 and then they just rang the area with a 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.290
 motorcycle and it's like it's a mystery that 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:50.510
 he is very very father is very funny 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.909
 and then I think it's the best 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.540
 all there is until now that is 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.540
 the best of all 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.040
