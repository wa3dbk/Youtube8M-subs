honestly the upper on this is so is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.220 
honestly the upper on this is so is
really<00:01:59.660> thin

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
really thin

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.130 
really thin
it's<00:02:00.890> actually<00:02:01.220> really<00:02:01.460> thin<00:02:01.820> like<00:02:02.080> can<00:02:03.080> you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
it's actually really thin like can you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.750 
it's actually really thin like can you
see<00:02:03.320> my<00:02:03.470> finger<00:02:03.860> on<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.070> other<00:02:04.160> side<00:02:04.370> it's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
see my finger on the other side it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.100 
see my finger on the other side it's
probably<00:02:05.180> thinner<00:02:05.390> than<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.690> Superfly

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
probably thinner than the Superfly

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.680 
probably thinner than the Superfly
threes<00:02:06.460> for<00:02:07.460> sure<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.180> toe<00:02:08.330> box<00:02:08.570> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
threes for sure and the toe box is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.340 
threes for sure and the toe box is
definitely<00:02:09.160> super<00:02:10.160> low<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:11.750> can<00:02:11.900> see<00:02:12.110> it's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
definitely super low you can see it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.640 
definitely super low you can see it's
definitely<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.890> low<00:02:13.040> toe<00:02:13.310> box<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.110> it's<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
definitely a low toe box and it's just a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.100 
definitely a low toe box and it's just a
really<00:02:15.860> nice<00:02:16.220> shoe<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.750> upper<00:02:18.050> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
really nice shoe and it's the upper is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
really nice shoe and it's the upper is
super<00:02:18.590> soft<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:21.410> see<00:02:21.710> why<00:02:21.890> they<00:02:22.040> went<00:02:22.220> kind

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
super soft I can see why they went kind

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.370 
super soft I can see why they went kind
of<00:02:22.820> back<00:02:23.060> towards<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.960> vapor<00:02:24.140> eight

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
of back towards this in the vapor eight

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.440 
of back towards this in the vapor eight
because<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.040> really<00:02:25.220> nice<00:02:25.460> and<00:02:25.730> I've

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
because it this is really nice and I've

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.680 
because it this is really nice and I've
never<00:02:26.630> worn<00:02:26.960> anything<00:02:27.110> below<00:02:27.740> vapor<00:02:28.690> papers

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
never worn anything below vapor papers

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.690 
never worn anything below vapor papers
fives<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.800> was<00:02:33.860> pretty<00:02:34.010> happy<00:02:34.250> when<00:02:34.520> my
