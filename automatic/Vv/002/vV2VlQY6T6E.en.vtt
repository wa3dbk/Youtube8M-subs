00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.239 
xg8 a let me take a peek right away at
the<00:00:08.049> bypass<00:00:09.049> valve<00:00:09.349> which<00:00:09.619> is<00:00:09.650> actually

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:10.249 
the bypass valve which is actually

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:17.890 
the bypass valve which is actually
plastic<00:00:11.240> on<00:00:11.360> this<00:00:11.480> one<00:00:16.689> what<00:00:17.689> you're<00:00:17.810> gonna

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
plastic on this one what you're gonna

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.359 
plastic on this one what you're gonna
notice<00:00:18.080> right<00:00:18.289> away<00:00:18.410> right<00:00:18.710> here<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:19.099> this

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
notice right away right here is this

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.700 
notice right away right here is this
fram's<00:00:19.699> got<00:00:20.210> metal<00:00:20.570> end<00:00:20.750> caps<00:00:20.990> which<00:00:21.529> hasn't

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
fram's got metal end caps which hasn't

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.120 
fram's got metal end caps which hasn't
really<00:00:22.210> been<00:00:23.210> on<00:00:23.419> a<00:00:23.449> lot<00:00:23.749> of<00:00:23.810> consumer<00:00:24.740> product

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
really been on a lot of consumer product

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.829 
really been on a lot of consumer product
ran<00:00:25.279> before<00:00:25.580> unless<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:26.630> have<00:00:26.869> a<00:00:26.900> wear<00:00:27.800> guard

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
ran before unless you have a wear guard

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.019 
ran before unless you have a wear guard
there<00:00:29.839> is<00:00:30.019> actually<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:30.859> little<00:00:31.400> bit<00:00:31.550> of<00:00:31.669> gasket

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
there is actually a little bit of gasket

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.709 
there is actually a little bit of gasket
material<00:00:32.419> here<00:00:32.599> and<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.350> where<00:00:34.719> the

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
material here and that is where the

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.479 
material here and that is where the
bypass<00:00:36.110> valve<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.680> spring<00:00:36.920> will<00:00:37.039> sit<00:00:37.309> right

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
bypass valve and spring will sit right

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.700 
bypass valve and spring will sit right
on<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:37.910> that's<00:00:38.030> actually<00:00:38.300> that's<00:00:39.289> pretty<00:00:39.469> nice

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
on so that's actually that's pretty nice

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.290 
on so that's actually that's pretty nice
to<00:00:39.890> see<00:00:40.070> I've<00:00:40.190> never<00:00:40.430> seen<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.820> before<00:00:40.879> on

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
to see I've never seen that before on

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.930 
to see I've never seen that before on
the<00:00:41.359> filter

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
the filter

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.270 
the filter
we've<00:00:43.940> got<00:00:44.180> our<00:00:44.590> anti<00:00:45.590> drain<00:00:45.800> back<00:00:46.010> valve

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
we've got our anti drain back valve

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.650 
we've got our anti drain back valve
which<00:00:46.969> this<00:00:47.390> once<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:49.120> snug<00:00:50.120> compared<00:00:50.570> to

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
which this once it's snug compared to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.810 
which this once it's snug compared to
the<00:00:50.750> other<00:00:50.899> Fram<00:00:51.170> filter<00:00:51.559> whereas<00:00:51.949> if<00:00:52.489> I<00:00:52.699> were

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
the other Fram filter whereas if I were

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.979 
the other Fram filter whereas if I were
to<00:00:52.910> hold<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.210> upside<00:00:53.539> down<00:00:53.570> on<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.109> PGA<00:00:54.500> Tour

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
to hold it upside down on the PGA Tour

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.419 
to hold it upside down on the PGA Tour
PHA<00:00:56.989> day<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.920> would<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:58.250> fallen<00:00:58.489> right<00:00:58.609> out

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
PHA day it would have fallen right out

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.430 
PHA day it would have fallen right out
as<00:01:01.429> we<00:01:01.550> take<00:01:01.760> peek<00:01:02.000> on<00:01:02.179> the<00:01:02.210> inside<00:01:02.600> yes

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
as we take peek on the inside yes

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.320 
as we take peek on the inside yes
typical<00:01:03.890> metal<00:01:04.129> tube<00:01:06.760> what<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:07.790> can't<00:01:08.120> really

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
typical metal tube what I can't really

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.140 
typical metal tube what I can't really
catch<00:01:08.860> with<00:01:09.860> my<00:01:10.040> camera<00:01:10.550> or<00:01:10.760> at<00:01:10.820> least<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.090> don't

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
catch with my camera or at least I don't

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.490 
catch with my camera or at least I don't
think<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.630> can<00:01:11.690> because<00:01:12.110> right<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:12.410> I'm

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
think I can because right now I'm

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.780 
think I can because right now I'm
looking<00:01:12.770> at<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.950> screen<00:01:15.280> there's<00:01:16.280> actually<00:01:16.760> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
looking at the screen there's actually a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.060 
looking at the screen there's actually a
screen<00:01:17.180> within<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:19.040> filter<00:01:19.430> there<00:01:20.420> are

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
screen within this filter there are

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.890 
screen within this filter there are
three<00:01:22.070> layers<00:01:22.310> in<00:01:22.580> here<00:01:22.610> I'm<00:01:23.180> about<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> cut

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
three layers in here I'm about to cut

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.790 
three layers in here I'm about to cut
them<00:01:24.050> apart<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:25.340> will<00:01:25.640> measure<00:01:26.140> and<00:01:27.140> show

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
them apart and I will measure and show

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.790 
them apart and I will measure and show
you<00:01:27.860> exactly<00:01:28.990> what<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.140> inside<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.590> filter

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
you exactly what is inside this filter

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.160 
you exactly what is inside this filter
there's<00:01:31.460> two<00:01:31.640> layers<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.240> do<00:01:32.660> not<00:01:32.870> know<00:01:33.020> what

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
there's two layers I do not know what

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.060 
there's two layers I do not know what
they're<00:01:34.390> made<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:35.950> we're<00:01:36.950> gonna

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
they're made of but we're gonna

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.109 
they're made of but we're gonna
hopefully<00:01:37.310> find<00:01:37.490> out

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.560 

all<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.450> according<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.990> box<00:01:44.570> we're

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
all right so according to the box we're

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.889 
all right so according to the box we're
gonna<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> metal<00:01:46.320> screen<00:01:47.600> what<00:01:48.600> looks<00:01:48.810> like

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
gonna see a metal screen what looks like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
gonna see a metal screen what looks like
an<00:01:49.859> orangish<00:01:50.280> paper<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.090> then<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:53.009> outer

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
an orangish paper and then the outer

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.309 
an orangish paper and then the outer
layer<00:01:53.490> being<00:01:53.819> what<00:01:54.539> would<00:01:54.689> appear<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.109> like

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
layer being what would appear to be like

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.789 
layer being what would appear to be like
a<00:01:55.350> cardboard<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:59.959> what<00:02:00.959> we<00:02:01.049> actually<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.560> see

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
a cardboard but what we actually do see

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.949 
a cardboard but what we actually do see
here<00:02:03.859> was<00:02:04.859> the<00:02:04.979> screen<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:06.509> appears<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
here was the screen and what appears to

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.610 
here was the screen and what appears to
be<00:02:07.729> one<00:02:08.729> layer<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.450> synthetic<00:02:09.750> media<00:02:10.489> but

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
be one layer of a synthetic media but

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
be one layer of a synthetic media but
after<00:02:13.620> cutting<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> apart<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.840> actually

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
after cutting it apart it is actually

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.449 
after cutting it apart it is actually
two<00:02:16.319> layers<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.769> just<00:02:16.950> gotta<00:02:17.099> peel<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.400> apart

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
two layers you just gotta peel it apart

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.860 
two layers you just gotta peel it apart
and<00:02:17.700> you'll<00:02:17.819> actually<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.750> two

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
and you'll actually see that it is two

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:27.710 
and you'll actually see that it is two
layers<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:20.610> earlier<00:02:23.630> in<00:02:24.630> earlier<00:02:26.420> then<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> had

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
layers the earlier in earlier then I had

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
layers the earlier in earlier then I had
a<00:02:27.750> metal<00:02:27.989> screen<00:02:28.319> right<00:02:28.709> here

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.670 

well<00:02:32.760> three<00:02:32.910> dimensions<00:02:33.329> as<00:02:34.290> far<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
well three dimensions as far as the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.729 
well three dimensions as far as the
media<00:02:34.950> goes<00:02:35.209> each<00:02:36.209> leak<00:02:36.540> came<00:02:36.750> out<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.989> 1.75

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
media goes each leak came out to 1.75
