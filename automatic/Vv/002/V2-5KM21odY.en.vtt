00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Russian scientists have invented a new 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.150
 energy source magnesium graphene 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.919
 cumulation what is it and why behind 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.700
 such batteries future ask 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.650
 member of the committee of commerce and industry 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.679
 chambers of russia on energy 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.320
 rustam tank 's growth strategies 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.500
 hello good send to you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.170
 claim that the oil age is ending 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.029
 and here we are waiting for these wonderful magnesium 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.930
 at the carafe you battery and ends 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.699
 century of internal combustion engines 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.070
 ends zile omone century 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 oil is not yet the main 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 a problem 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 which remained at this electric vehicles 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.219
 battery problem needed 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.200
 reliable Christmas tree battery which 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.350
 it will cost little enough from what 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.610
 current confuse lithium ion 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 lithium ion insufficient capacity 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 very expensive and I must say that stocks 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 lithium on earth is not all limitless 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.789
 The idea of â€‹â€‹Russian scientists is that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 Magnesium and lithium are used instead of 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.570
 magnesium which is much cheaper than lithium 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 the reserves of which are much more 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.189
 what is the margin you see and the lifetime 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 after all what if an electric car is needed 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.030
 charge there like every three to four 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 hours then with a new battery graph 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.400
 how much car will keep on the rally 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.240
 on one machine battery charge 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.590
 weighing two and a half tons and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.549
 about 300 horsepower 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.659
 forces can travel thousands of kilometers 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.650
 analysts he drove on mean 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.830
 when we say that we exclude gasoline 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.440
 out of turn because we swap 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.170
 all cars have great batteries 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.210
 we exclude from turnover about 15-20 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.290
 percent in all oil refining 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.230
 because everything else goes on 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.530
 production of chemistry goods and the most 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.270
 main 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.730
 energies that 5 batteries need 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.260
 will charge if in Russia 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.350
 65 percent of this energy is produced 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.880
 with gas then in Europe significantly 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.970
 a large proportion produced by 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.940
 nitrogen and other petroleum fuels so 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 It is expected that when moving to 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.179
 electricity consumption of oil can 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.390
 grow by 20 percent why 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.640
 the state does not take control of such 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.620
 revolutionary solution and 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.540
 We do not start production such as 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.550
 know the subway and how the state could 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.880
 rub so many brains that 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.850
 we lost over the last decade from 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.730
 creators of this technology ideal 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.310
 ideologues first drag graduates 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.240
 Physical Technology College 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.310
 Moscow residents are now 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.140
 uk who went to live 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.300
 uk wish your discovery 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.220
 it was there and she herself is Great Britain 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.440
 industrial flow it delivered it 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.540
 make your program goals here given 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.100
 what is there for how is patented yes yes yes 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.830
 there will be very powerful research these 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.250
 people have excellent funding they 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.140
 work at the University of Manchester 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.260
 or found doing what research 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.900
 research but just before the advent 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.209
 decanters many times we were told that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.820
 humanity has found almost eternal 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.250
 engine here that we were moving 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.280
 ahead let's forget about oil forget 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.390
 about gasoline and every time it turns out that 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.370
 best case for producing such 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.140
 engine still need to spend something 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.720
 such an amount that he is completely not 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.940
 looks like production it really 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.570
 so but as for the electric motor 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.530
 electric electric cars they are very strong 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.670
 evolved in recent years 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.019
 now per unit of motor weight 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.720
 more power is being developed than on 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.760
 unit weight of the best engine 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.190
 internal combustion under our conditions 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.110
 Russian winter we probably will not soon 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.269
 all the same see you on our electric 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.280
 roads we move on electric cars 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.570
 the next 10 years tamed will decide 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.030
 one problem 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.739
 because the cost of an electric car is higher for now 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.340
 than a gasoline engine car 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.050
 one and a half times 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.230
 this is a female very much in these ten years 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.610
 it will be necessary to decide not to make syoss and 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.200
 charging and with temperatures 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.580
 we shift the fire on so on 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.069
 you have no idea how many problems already 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.049
 it was decided well well we'll see 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.319
 We look when there will be thank you about 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.319
 plums
