00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.810
 decimal notation of fractional numbers and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.680
 Express the distance of 6 decimeters three 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.370
 centimeters in centimeters and so in 6 TEC and 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.369
 meters is 60 centimeters 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:21.869
 therefore 6 decimeters and three centimeters 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 it is 63 centimeters to express the same 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.150
 decimeter distance 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 will have to use fractions as one 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.600
 centimeter is one tenth 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.390
 decimeter then three centimeters is three 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.729
 tenths of a meter and therefore 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 6 decimeters three centimeters is equal to 6.3 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:47.699
 decimeter in the same way 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.790
 we find that four centners 17 kilograms 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.510
 these are four point seventeen hundredths 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.420
 quintals because in one center 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.489
 there is 100 kilograms therefore 17 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.750
 kilogram is seventeen hundredth centners 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 denominator of the fractional part of 6.3 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 equal to 10 and the number 4 is seventeen 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.940
 hundredths it is equal to 100 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.960
 denominators of 10100 1000 and so on 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.550
 agreed to record without a denominator 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.690
 first write the whole part 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.090
 and then the numerator of the fractional part while 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:39.380
 the whole part is separated from the fractional part 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:42.360
 For example, a comma instead of 6.3 is written 6.3 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.700
 instead of 4 point seventeen hundredths 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.560
 write 4 point seventeen hundredths 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 any number denominator in the fractional part 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.200
 which is expressed by the unit 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.370
 with one or more zeros you can 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.540
 present as a decimal if 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.620
 fraction correct 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:08.569
 then before the comma write the number 0 for example 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.270
 instead of fifty seven hundredths writes 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.360
 0.57 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.450
 then 57 centimeters is fifty 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.580
 seven hundredths of a meter is 0.57 meters then 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 have here here the whole we didn't have 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.670
 so we write 0 integers 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.510
 further we put a comma and we write 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.150
 numerator 57 decimal numerator 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.080
 fractional part should have the same 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.480
 characters how many zeros in the denominator 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.130
 so for example the number seven is whole 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.360
 twenty one thousandth 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:50.510
 first you need to write down seven integers 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:54.890
 zero twenty one thousandth that is in 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.010
 numerator we had a two-digit number 21 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.490
 and the denominator is one and three zeros 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.440
 since 30 and that means in the numerator 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.680
 should also be three digits 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.290
 and we only had 2 digits 2 and 1 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.530
 so we need to finish the third 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.020
 figure here in this case list 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.410
 or recorded the required number 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.440
 zeros in our case was necessary 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.190
 only 10 in the numerator 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.980
 there were three numbers but then we have this number 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.380
 write so seven whole twenty one 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.390
 thousandth means 6 kilograms 24 grams 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.959
 equal to 6 pounds twenty four 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.690
 thousandth kilogram is 6 whole 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.840
 twenty four thousandths of a kilogram 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.740
 that is, we see that here we have recorded one 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:52.570
 missing 0 and now answer 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.570
 please the following questions
