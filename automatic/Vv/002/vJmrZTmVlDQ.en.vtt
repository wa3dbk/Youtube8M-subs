frustrating what worked for me was being

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.400 
frustrating what worked for me was being
a<00:04:16.220> teenage<00:04:16.699> girl<00:04:17.000> living<00:04:17.479> in<00:04:17.630> suburban<00:04:18.079> Ohio

a teenage girl living in suburban Ohio

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.460 
a teenage girl living in suburban Ohio
who<00:04:18.919> did<00:04:19.609> math<00:04:19.850> ran<00:04:20.269> track<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.870> loved<00:04:21.079> art<00:04:21.289> and

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
who did math ran track and loved art and

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.750 
who did math ran track and loved art and
if<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.829> thought<00:04:22.039> that<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.340> could<00:04:22.550> work<00:04:22.699> for

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
if I thought that that could work for

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.330 
if I thought that that could work for
every<00:04:23.570> single<00:04:23.870> one<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.229> then<00:04:24.500> trust<00:04:24.949> me<00:04:25.190> I

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
every single one of you then trust me I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.100 
every single one of you then trust me I
would<00:04:25.669> tell<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.449> don't<00:04:26.510> think<00:04:26.660> again

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
would tell you but I don't think again

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.170 
would tell you but I don't think again
and<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.590> think<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.949> sex<00:04:28.160> change<00:04:28.400> operation<00:04:29.060> to

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
and I think the sex change operation to

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.909 
and I think the sex change operation to
become<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.449> teenage<00:04:29.840> girl<00:04:30.050> would<00:04:30.229> be<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.380> painful

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
become a teenage girl would be a painful

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.550 
become a teenage girl would be a painful
