00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 very good guys here we are in another 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.220
 video over gta 5 online and here we are 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.660
 in the third episode of the series 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.120
 all against this series that I created 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.670
 today he is really enjoying himself on the channel 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.679
 well, guys, well, see how many people 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.880
 life for me in this episode well let's go 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.080
 to look at it exactly so that it looks already 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.190
 are dispersing this version doing 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.420
 very well I guess 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:27.630
 one already in helicopter I'm going to fast 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.310
 that comes and they are 12 123456789 are not not 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 more that is 12 they were going to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.800
 they will be scattered I do not see them well but 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.360
 some guys like they see are 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 scattering super good some look 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.120
 they are seeing here the airport others 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.239
 two so the truth is I'm pretty 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.379
 fucked up so for now let's look 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.660
 the situation a bit here on the map 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.070
 As you can see, I'm right here and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 have strategy for I have a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 strategy to see the key would be to go for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.239
 the place where less people come by 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.410
 here is not a plan because two such 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.760
 that I think you look at my mind is for the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 trevor airport although I think that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910
 some must go to the port of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.250
 clover 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.980
 so honestly the one where I 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.399
 I put guys 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.809
 of BTT amounted to these two that come 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.060
 around here because they live alone and well 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.740
 separated makes you try to do it 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.119
 although it is that this car comes with one 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.860
 inside copilot but well I think 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.940
 what are we going to take here, let's see 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.340
 here we will take half with the 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.080
 mountain in flat to make the mess I 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 I think that we can get out there 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.390
 we can roll and then we're going to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.369
 the city of saints and after 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.869
 we hold on a bit more so we are 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.190
 politicians as you know I put in another 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.259
 series basically what it's about is that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.400
 I 'm going to one end of the stick after point 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.680
 are all the subscribers that in this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.390
 case are voices from 12 to 15 are still not 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.090
 it's not the maximum in the next I 'm a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.520
 try to make it 16 what is the maximum and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.960
 in the comunico they have to try 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.399
 kill me all and the one that kill me then 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.500
 I say his name of the play and you can 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.759
 add and carl in plan champion and the one that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.460
 he killed the discrete in episode number 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.710
 3 megabytes and all the control so 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.350
 let's go there let's try as I say 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 divert this type of path no no if not no 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.759
 I know how to say it to free him to talk to him 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.800
 we can see ourselves messing 222 of how 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.729
 say it try worth worth goes for the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.470
 another perfect perfect road 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:05.500
 perfect let's move on in plan 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.450
 he passes by one side the number playing a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.920
 sniper in the lead 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 Obviously here, see if there is a 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.900
 I walk made so perfect I'll go 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.190
 rising little by little the piri piri what 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.810
 bad is that as you will have seen before 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.370
 there were two at the airport of the saints 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.610
 in the international moment we are going to 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:27.660
 look a little bit that is going up 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.160
 what I 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.840
 it's not time to start looking at the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.840
 map the moment to act 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.500
 perfect 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.320
 here I always have the four wheels 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.000
 come on now it means the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.810
 left over here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.380
 OK 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.630
 and perfect let's go up to see let's 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.630
 we'll get him out here liar 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.760
 and here he does not just wait for us but 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.760
 they do not wait for you 321 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.620
 let's go to the benefits 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 falling at 50,000 kilometers per hour is 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.970
 impossible that you can point me and I 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.870
 can give but shoot bastard no 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.909
 I know if you have heard I was 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.510

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.840
 I do not accelerate the car I have it behind 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.069

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:10.290
