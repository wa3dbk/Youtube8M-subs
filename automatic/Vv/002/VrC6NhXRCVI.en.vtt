 sexy chocolate my good and today I 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.189
 you presented a little gameplay in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.349
 team death match on the map 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.660
 bootleg and yes people I'm going very 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.360
 very well because I could have some 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.890
 days of rest in order to avenge me a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.880
 little bit of all trolls to that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.900
 I had when I said I was going 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.859
 to be at the weekend and you tell me 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.390
 down we have two weeks of vacation 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.130
 etc., etc 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 so I arranged to con boss 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.150
 I said I can not leave my 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.769
 subscribers make fun of me with impunity 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 give me to play gave me two days 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.340
 like that it makes me a little rest of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 four more days I was able to enjoy 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 to go see the poles at the paris 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.960
 games week 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.640
 it was pretty good then there is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.809
 some of you who are telling me 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.059
 followed on twitter who had me 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.360
 asked my my impressions on black 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.370
 ops 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 know that I did not really look at 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 no play so I know it's 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.719
 maybe a little stupid bunnies to the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.030
 paris games week 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.440
 without stopping watching the games but 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.969
 good it was really to go see 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 legs and more when we arrived 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.829
 I was with Algiers and we went to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 side of the stand black ops 2 we heard 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 that there was then it seems to me that 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 it was 4 o'clock I think to be able to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 touch the joystick and play black 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.830
 ops 2 so honestly people have 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.260
 beautiful being a fan of bob of call of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.610
 I think I would not have the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.400
 patience to be able to wait four 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 just hours to play seven minutes a 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 game just that it's stick to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.200
 fuck i see the cua whip whew 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.030
 seriously to be mad to wait 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.869
 four hours to play seven 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.329
 minutes a video game 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.650
 after I say that it's not mean but 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.270
 well here it is in any case it's not my 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 delirious to make a tail for four 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 hours at the worst with good we will not 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.329
 to go in there so what is it 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 I have just woken up 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.610
 wise is perhaps the way that is a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.829
 little bit hoarse 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 so I hope it will not be too much 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.520
 embarrassing in the how betting me I 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 do not think you 'll mind me but 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.640
 I really wanted to comment on you 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.560
 that's it 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.110
 in the most natural way possible 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.530
 when I wake up I'm in my bed in the hold 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.729
 bar with hair all messed up fake 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.080
 everyone knows that I have no 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.740
 hair finally brief go i'm going to stop 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.119
 to say bullshit 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.850
 so as I said I have not 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.250
 played trick game but anyway it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.350
 arrive in a week we will really have 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 way to test it quietly at 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 the house is to bleed him for a 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.290
 year in addition ben me it will make me 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.630
 pleasure to really change the game as 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 you know it mw3 it was a little bit 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.739
 hard for me even though I took 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 fun on this game we will not say the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.209
 contrary but it is true that at the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.630
 late I was really starting to get some 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.130
 fed up 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.769
 besides it is very very certainly 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.720
 the last gameplay of mw3 in any case 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.440
 before the release of black ops two that I 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.989
 will offer you 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.050
 and then ben saw that black ops of water 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.790
 happen I'll be able to start down at 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.930
 do a little bit of other things on 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.100
 my chain so when I say other 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.630
 things do not worry it will stay out of 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.120
 supra will always be fun 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.790
 in any case I hope you get it 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.860
 look like that in my opinion yes and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 but here's to see you show a little 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.420
 little how do I apprehend a game how 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.700
 I dread and ben the objective modes 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.870
 on a game that just came out that this 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.680
 or on any maps on 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.870
 any mode 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.220
 then again I will not make you 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.010
 no tutorials I do not pretend 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.840
 to be able to make big tutorials 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 of goals stuff and then everything 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.230
 I just do not have the 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.840
 pretense teach you things 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.380
 that was able to play as well as me if 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.290
 it's better 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.700
 but here you can interact at the exit 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.260
 of the game it will be good because it's true 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.049
 that on a w3 I had been a little bit 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.440
 blocked I got to half of the 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.720
 season 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.970
 everything had already been done we are not going to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.489
 hide I was not going to make you how 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.440
 my feelings about guns felt 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.290
 on assets etc etc 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.420
 it had been done well before 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.430
 exit of the game what is normal talk 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.410
 youtuber who was there and although they 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.350
 were well posed like me i'm 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.209
 arrived with my mini wooden clogs 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.510
 wrought with marked on the foot 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.810
 left and prat cyr the epsp and right 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.549
 excuse me okay let's go so 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.340
 here but there you dread 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.560
 really the game from the start and then 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.390
 interact with you you will also have 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.760
 and well, why not things to 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.280
 teach me how to show you 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.870
 see eh ben the thing simply 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.569
 and then besides there is going to be the mode 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.359
 zombie that will happen so I think that 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.039
 live it will really disassemble everything 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.019
 whether it's an itunes account is that this 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.970
 with the brownie either with 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.740
 others in addition that we can play 8 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.870
 why not she's going to make a team of 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.760
 four youtuber against a team of 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.190
 four subscribers it can be nice to do 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.900
 filming all that danced all this on our 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.940
 respective chains finally I do not know I 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.820
 will see that with the poles and then that's it 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.320
 if not well then what else to say to you 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.930
 do not thank it that you have 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.639
 did the relief I did with my 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.070
 little lolo of love my little criel on 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.940
 bf3 i know everyone is not 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.470
 bf fan 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.840
 but hey we have to please all the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.650
 world to there are also bf3 players 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.449
 who follows my videos 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.570
 me it's fun in said play 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:00.590
 so here we decided on both 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.990
 to continue this little series so I 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.280
 think all 4 5 videos maybe a 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.130
 little more maybe a little less 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.370
 eh ben you present a live with her 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.349
 on battlefield 3 why not continue 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.940
 the series on bf 4 when it will come out then 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.870
 honestly I do not know at all when 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.789
 is he going to get out 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.460
 I go a little bit forward if we 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.720
 find by then lolo will not want anymore 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.890
 to do 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.740
 or we do not know what can be 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.270
 pass but hey me anyway I know 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.280
 that I would take bet4 when he 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 will come out then as I tell you I do not 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.650
 do not know that either he'll go out in 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.280
 a year 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.580
 and then and here and there will be a lot 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.950
 things that will change we'll see 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.020
 finally, the gameplay is coming to an end 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.820
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.070
 follow me and watch this little 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.530

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.910
 pleasure to comment on it I am 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.950
 gone in little stuff like I 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.120
 wanted to say just wake up I 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.590
 am in my bed and I am quiet 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.120
