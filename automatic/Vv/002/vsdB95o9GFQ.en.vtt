dude<00:04:29.960> it's<00:04:30.960> just<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:32.150> takes<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.240> lot<00:04:33.389> more

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
dude it's just it takes a lot more

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.940 
dude it's just it takes a lot more
energy<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.170> don't<00:04:34.320> get<00:04:34.440> as<00:04:34.590> much<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.770> a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
energy and you don't get as much of a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.850 
energy and you don't get as much of a
break<00:04:35.570> so<00:04:36.570> what<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.750> like<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:36.960> do<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.260> like<00:04:37.740> I

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
break so what I like to do is like I

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.310 
break so what I like to do is like I
said<00:04:38.070> I'll<00:04:38.400> do<00:04:38.669> groups<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.270> 30<00:04:39.750> seconds<00:04:40.200> in

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
said I'll do groups of 30 seconds in

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:49.720 
said I'll do groups of 30 seconds in
with<00:04:40.470> 16<00:04:40.889> so

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.980 

or<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.940> could<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.120> go

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.839 

that<00:04:56.990> works<00:04:57.169> too<00:04:57.349> of<00:04:57.949> course<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.340> kind<00:04:58.789> of

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
that works too of course I kind of

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.240 
that works too of course I kind of
messed<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.120> up<00:04:59.180> what<00:04:59.599> happened<00:05:00.099> it's<00:05:01.099> the

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
messed that up what happened it's the

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.980 
messed that up what happened it's the
forum<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.789> don't<00:05:01.970> think<00:05:02.150> any<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.750> are

forum I don't think any of you are
really<00:05:03.229> going<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.650> judge<00:05:03.889> me<00:05:04.099> neither<00:05:04.940> case<00:05:05.210> um

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
really going to judge me neither case um

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.270 
really going to judge me neither case um
and<00:05:06.740> at<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.550> faster<00:05:08.000> speeds<00:05:08.270> once<00:05:09.259> you<00:05:09.680> use<00:05:09.919> if

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
and at the faster speeds once you use if

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:19.529 
and at the faster speeds once you use if
you're<00:05:10.550> playing<00:05:12.340> I'd<00:05:13.340> say<00:05:13.669> even<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:18.340> 135

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
you're playing I'd say even in a 135

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.490 
you're playing I'd say even in a 135
actually<00:05:20.539> Omaha<00:05:20.840> will<00:05:20.990> just<00:05:21.139> make<00:05:21.289> it<00:05:21.319> easy

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
actually Omaha will just make it easy

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.520 
actually Omaha will just make it easy
130<00:05:22.360> when<00:05:23.360> you're<00:05:23.509> at<00:05:23.629> one-thirty<00:05:24.169> you're

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
130 when you're at one-thirty you're

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.189 
130 when you're at one-thirty you're
using<00:05:24.710> your<00:05:24.919> legs<00:05:25.159> and<00:05:25.930> if<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.020> go<00:05:27.139> to

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
using your legs and if you go to

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:36.790 
using your legs and if you go to
triplets<00:05:27.770> that<00:05:28.580> would<00:05:28.729> be<00:05:32.800> 195<00:05:35.650> maybe<00:05:36.650> it's

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
triplets that would be 195 maybe it's

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.580 
triplets that would be 195 maybe it's
205<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.180> think<00:05:38.360> it's<00:05:38.449> going<00:05:38.629> 5<00:05:38.870> now<00:05:39.440> that

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
205 and I think it's going 5 now that

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.920 
205 and I think it's going 5 now that
case<00:05:39.740> then<00:05:39.979> it's<00:05:40.129> 205<00:05:40.699> when<00:05:41.240> you're<00:05:41.360> doing<00:05:41.509> 16

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
case then it's 205 when you're doing 16

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.260 
case then it's 205 when you're doing 16
triplets<00:05:42.409> so<00:05:42.979> did<00:05:43.219> it<00:05:43.340> it<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.520> it<00:05:43.610> didn't<00:05:44.150> do

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
triplets so did it it it it didn't do

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.149 
triplets so did it it it it didn't do
diddily<00:05:44.620> little<00:05:45.620> bit<00:05:46.330> and<00:05:47.469> that's<00:05:48.469> like<00:05:49.129> I

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
diddily little bit and that's like I

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.499 
diddily little bit and that's like I
said<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.550> triplet<00:05:49.879> thing<00:05:50.030> but<00:05:50.180> what<00:05:50.300> you<00:05:50.389> can

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
said the triplet thing but what you can

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:55.540 
said the triplet thing but what you can
do<00:05:50.719> is<00:05:51.020> throw<00:05:51.379> quads<00:05:51.979> in<00:05:52.969> with<00:05:53.479> 16<00:05:54.139> triplets<00:05:54.650> so

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
do is throw quads in with 16 triplets so

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.580 
do is throw quads in with 16 triplets so
I<00:05:55.969> mean<00:05:56.330> you<00:05:56.419> can<00:05:56.539> play<00:05:56.690> around<00:05:56.780> my<00:05:57.020> doo-doo

those<00:06:13.789> two<00:06:13.969> are<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:15.199> wrist<00:06:15.500> motion<00:06:15.830> I<00:06:16.279> mean<00:06:17.000> if

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
those two are the wrist motion I mean if

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.870 
those two are the wrist motion I mean if
you<00:06:17.270> can<00:06:17.419> get<00:06:17.539> that<00:06:17.569> whip<00:06:18.020> on<00:06:18.169> my<00:06:18.259> hi-hat<00:06:18.880> the

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
you can get that whip on my hi-hat the

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.820 
you can get that whip on my hi-hat the
tentative<00:06:20.419> visited<00:06:21.610> it

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830

mechanical for those of you who sit next

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.270 
mechanical for those of you who sit next
to<00:06:32.640> a<00:06:32.670> metronome<00:06:33.090> all<00:06:33.270> day<00:06:33.450> and<00:06:34.040> digit<00:06:35.040> of<00:06:35.160> it

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
to a metronome all day and digit of it

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.080 
to a metronome all day and digit of it
did<00:06:35.670> it<00:06:35.820> did<00:06:36.090> it<00:06:36.780> you<00:06:37.320> know<00:06:37.440> that's<00:06:37.860> cool<00:06:38.820> if

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
did it did it you know that's cool if

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.060 
did it did it you know that's cool if
you<00:06:39.180> play<00:06:39.360> like<00:06:39.510> a<00:06:39.570> robot<00:06:39.990> but<00:06:40.290> I<00:06:40.560> mean<00:06:40.890> if<00:06:41.010> you

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
you play like a robot but I mean if you

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.740 
you play like a robot but I mean if you
like<00:06:41.220> George<00:06:41.490> flies<00:06:41.820> it's<00:06:42.120> probably<00:06:42.510> because

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
like George flies it's probably because

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.050 
like George flies it's probably because
he<00:06:43.050> plays<00:06:43.260> like<00:06:43.440> a<00:06:43.500> human<00:06:43.830> and<00:06:45.260> that's<00:06:46.260> cool

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
he plays like a human and that's cool

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.390 
he plays like a human and that's cool
like<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:48.180> said<00:06:48.290> that<00:06:49.290> whole<00:06:49.470> driving<00:06:49.800> thing<00:06:49.980> not

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
like I said that whole driving thing not

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.780 
like I said that whole driving thing not

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
helps me with power because I mean it

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:05.510 
helps me with power because I mean it
