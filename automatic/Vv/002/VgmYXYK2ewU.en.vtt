00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 the attention the appearance of ghosts in 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.940
 disaster places exactly good 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.940
 without going any further, notice that in the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.099
 Japan tsunami it was seen what many 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.279
 people claim that it is a kind of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.590
 ghost a presence this plasma 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.080
 that dissolves as mysteriously as 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.240
 appeared in the very same please if I 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.449
 we can see to analyze all good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.340
 So here are two theories on the one hand 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.070
 there are some people who say no that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.989
 it should be simply a kind of 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.050
 bag dragged by the day inside and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 program but says the angle despite the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.540
 way that it adopts disappears for it 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 any would change color that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.610
 area and when it is above a 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.520
 darker background and I respect red that is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.370
 where this form should be more noticeable 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.340
 quite curious that subsequently 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 see what it is now it is proven not 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.390
 it was an altered image they are not 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.789
 superimposed in fact is in the same 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.230
 pixel formation that the background where 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.690
 this record is made 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.300
 and finally they dissolve from it 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.780
 mysterious way it manifests 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.980
 that something like that will enter the text 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.410
 almost like an astral trip that a stake 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.320
 maritime as if through a 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.960
 dematerialization capacity appears 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.730
 spontaneously it takes a small turn towards 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 up and when it should be seen more 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.670
 I insist on him with doubt because of the contrast 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.320
 true of the background with which he does is 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 fade into the air disappearing 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.030
 already in sight too much action of 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.710
 operator in this impactful masters that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.470
 has been repeated in another catastrophe but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.690
 nowadays it does not illustrate so graphically 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.060
 could beat a theory already begun to 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 current circular and that says that really 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
 these space visitors and these 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.540
 Spectral presences audiences 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.840
 fundamentally to a fact that there 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.940
 tonic in the future of humanity has 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 managed to leave in time who 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.350
 then these images that we 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.710
 we see these UFOs and these figures 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.570
 spectral are men of the future who 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.610
 come advance 10 travels in time and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.800
 is with us is possible is good not 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.080
 is wrong donaldo because look 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.810
 others interview at this time 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.320
 to the greatest poles of the country look 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.540
 that even they see very very difficult 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.910
 for example the visit of beings of others 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.990
 planets that do not deny their existence 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.880
 but that clearly there is not one 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.650
 intervention as frequent as not 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.440
 thinks it says that what is 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.120
 happening really are contacts with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.850
 civilizations that exist in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.980
 parallel dimensions or more credible yet 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.990
 being there was physics is pÃ©rez 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.390
 creatures that leave time in fact 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.370
 travel in time physics let's say what 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.890
 He showed many teak years ago 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.440
 that one can travel to the future that 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.880
 let's say physically for a person today 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.820
 it is impossible but in terms of 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.050
 particles that is a process that is real 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.180
 and what happens all the time however 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.830
 However, travel to the past when 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.290
 before it was considered an impossible 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.570
 there are several renowned scientists 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.910
 true as a great certain specialist 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.580
 African-American who says he's about 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.130
 to achieve it and there would be that possibility 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.780
 attend because high event because some 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.710
 way they defined part of the future of the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.180
 humanity 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.340
 a spectrum that comes from the future also 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.780
 It can be a soul because it was giving 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.180
 come back from this catastrophe that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.650
 also how to discard that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.580
 possibility that even has more 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.860
 handle 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.810
 now that the camera can capture it and not 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.390
 always a human is also something that is 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.240
 very typical let 's say the right now by 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.980
 andrew this could also explain the 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.630
 old question of humanity from the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.030
 decade of the 40 when they begin to become 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.040
 patent these paranormal phenomena and 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.770
 the question that we become great and 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 always the question of why why 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.400
 they tie us with their presence because they do not 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.720
 they make contact with us then they are 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.360
 the future for a very simple reason 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 because if the beings of the future 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.450
 intervene in the past 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.630
 future create a chain the effect 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.630
 butterfly 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.620
 it is the least curious thing to notice that 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.180
 we are seeing snapshots of the 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.400
 videos filmed with the recordings 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.940
 originals also for a thing of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.739
 seconds you can rescue these forms 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.450
 capricious we can say mere 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.650
 chance I do not know but 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.750
 there were several that at some point 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.120
 they began to notice that the smoke 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.490
 product of the fire caused in the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.750
 world trade center after the attack of 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.700
 these two commercial aircraft that are 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.890
 they crashed against them they ended up 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.290
 forming an image is that we 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.970
 let's say within popular culture 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.470
 we can easily recognize how 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.930
 images of the devil according to how 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.600
 Renaissance painting the mission has 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.760
 even before it has been in charge of 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.530
 translate put an image to the devil 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.750
 it's pretty much what it looks like now 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.530
 here two things can happen and you have to 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.180
 be very honest there is a gestalt process 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.160
 where the current human mind that to all 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.420
 needed the senses that people 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.040
 it's about clear drawing shapes that 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.650
 regrets the human collective can is 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.630
 able to recognize especially in subjects 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.790
 as tragic as these where they are 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.490
 looking for some character shapes 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.050
 diabolical however this say that it 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.820
 have tried to find another fire 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.630
 but you can always do this 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.950
 exercise here with an overwhelming 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.650
 exaggeration and clarity access of this 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.120
 image is with the face of something with 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.669
 the cheeks fingers 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.440
 and said something about not wanting 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.860
 say or do not want to manifest because 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.350
 somehow modifies the stretch is not 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.840
 true or the normal timeline good 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.270
 there is to interpret is not true 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.760
 because indeed those who make a 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.639
 attack being associated with the devil or 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.160
 are they the bad ones or in some way the 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:52.860
 attack is towards the USA because its 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.040
 authorities are the diabolical ones for those 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.720
 people for the side that always 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.340
 exercise the truth that gives you just 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.080
 to establish that one can not 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.880
 interpret good photos full of 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.800
 images interprets bless for happy 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.479
 I do not want to go back and in this case like 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.350
 affected and the attackers are the same 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:17.960
 that the US is plotting with the priorities 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.960
 that he has enough to believe absolutely 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.080
 let say 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.940
 also good also in the towers 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.400
 twins see that it was said that it was seen 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.180
 the presence of 200 fliers 120 fixed 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.180
 we are seeing imagine 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:35.030
 and there enters the plane does not continue happening and 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.040
 we understand that is the rest of the 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.650
 plane with as we say 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.060
 rightly it is a pain object not 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.770
 identified that he was doing the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.870
 destination because it's still going on 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.700
 happening but but let's also say 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.890
 pointing out the emotional thing could be 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.120
 perfectly part of the fuselage of the 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.160
 aircraft that crashed into the 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.140
 building is quite logical to think it 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.430
 exactly they have not been logical because in 

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.900
 the moment of impact must have 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.370
 changed the trajectory and this example 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.500
 confirmed with linear elektra 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.810
 and it's not just one of the fish as something 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.280
 if it's an object that went flying has 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:09.860
 what to do with the house let's say what 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:13.190
 I know I do not know how to find many blocks 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.080
 they round them no part of functions that 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.910
 the planes or turbines or anything I want 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.470
 the image at least never to show that 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.240
 image looks small compared to the 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.310
 plane but in real terms pretty 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.140
 grace and it's great it 's as big as a 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.520
 clear bus be we are not talking about 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.520
 several meters in diameter 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:30.830
 and for the glass
