00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.620
 but that's okay I left altogether 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 short out and do not read that yourself 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.270

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.260
 Tom and grip at this point many 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 thanks to hello technique sloth that should 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.530
 that fits that fits that fits that fits 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.869
 I think there is nothing private 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.610
 no address no address so the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.200
 The technology vtb have a small 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.390
 Collection of energy drinks for testing 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.380
 compiled and hope you find 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 like it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.220
 We have the energy drinks in the Kremlin 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 free and at the german czech 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 Boundary purchased in part it acts 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 That's why German products are still there for that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.549
 24 cents are offered I think so 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.689
 I also have to go there and find that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.280
 You then back in Germany 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.070
 that means a dose costs then 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 four cent moment that works without 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.729
 without jojo 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380
 we have already tested everything ourselves 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.119
 but of course they are curious as they are 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.180
 taste much fun it continue 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.340
 so mega videos many greetings tom and 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.820
 crystal love so much the picture 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.659
 The art of drawing would have looked then 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.460
 Let's go in and do it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.090
 paper paper paper paper paper where 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.099
 a huge pack of this giant 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.420
 is it really crass because I know 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.110
 not at all in any order 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.660
 to begin 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.400
 I'll take the first out of you 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.099
 I'll tell you directly or already 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.280
 so no monster energy low carb 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.769
 So delight zero variant that could 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.590
 but very familiar 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.510
 then you will help very cool but what 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.379
 is because strong cola I still have 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.150
 never seen plus 20 percent caffeine on 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.480
 what value do we get there? 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.510
 Do not look at caffeine 32 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.510
 milligrams to 100 milliliters but 38 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.150
 4 above me quotes the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:50.879
 allowed out very very very cool then 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.870
 again with extra caffeine where 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.640
 are they here? 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.730
 that looks really cool 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.230
 out and still unanimously did not know 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.700
 that there are so many hellinger 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.569
 normal classical holds I am yes 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.530
 actually quite good 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.380
 So limited edition summer cool 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.160
 hopefully all the hero would have to go 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.919
 by no, there is still one bright 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.160
 limited edition again but cool me 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.859
 am so blown away so i thought i had 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.680
 yes, no idea that there are so many bright 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:26.090
 drinks then we have race once 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:33.660
 cat caffeine and taurine so energy drink 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.410
 ok, then there is tatanka pink 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.340
 ok then blackrock special edition 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.660
 Honestly I have of these things 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.730
 Never heard of it before 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.130
 now i can test you love a lot 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.639
 Thanks, I'm blown away 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:01.169
 then we have a big energy 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:08.130
 the energy is not bad either 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:10.520
 and then there is the last tyros power 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.900
 and healthy 508 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.060
 You can even get around 60 milliliters 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.950
 German and even with fanta that's the 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.980
 I found it then okay then I will 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.190
 still with us and watch so great we 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.140
 have 246 18 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.250
 I think that's the only one I do 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.820
 already know about it 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.340
 and I say of seven of them 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.560
 the other nine I had no idea that 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.560
 is that ever there at this point 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.560

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.420
 the time rush on it and the in 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.410
 temperate then then one behind the other away 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.640
 Do not finish it that takes a while 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.260
 I think if I all at once 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.080
 would drink or sequentially to 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.070
 second weekend you would try there 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.660
 I would really just like one 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.460
 hummingbirds hopping through the area 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.500
 that should have been now 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.000
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.000
