of obey I believe a modern warfare 2 and

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:33.140 
of obey I believe a modern warfare 2 and
he<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.079> recently<00:03:25.230> joined<00:03:27.590> obvious<00:03:31.940> but<00:03:32.940> that

he just recently joined obvious but that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.630 
he just recently joined obvious but that
would<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.510> think<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.530> was<00:03:34.650> our<00:03:34.799> team<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.159> what

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
would I think that was our team I what

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.580 
would I think that was our team I what
we<00:03:35.819> played<00:03:36.390> these<00:03:36.510> guys<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:36.989> good<00:03:37.319> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
we played these guys really good and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.020 
we played these guys really good and
really<00:03:37.650> tough<00:03:38.010> if<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.340> play<00:03:38.549> like<00:03:38.579> these

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
really tough if we play like these

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.750 
really tough if we play like these
against<00:03:39.359> these<00:03:39.540> guys<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.370> play<00:03:41.489> against

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
against these guys if we play against

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.129 
against these guys if we play against
everybody<00:03:42.180> like<00:03:42.329> we<00:03:42.450> did<00:03:42.599> against<00:03:42.810> these<00:03:42.959> guys

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
everybody like we did against these guys

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.699 
everybody like we did against these guys
I<00:03:43.470> think<00:03:43.739> will<00:03:43.829> be<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.879> good<00:03:45.000> team<00:03:45.709> like

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
I think will be a really good team like

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.830 
I think will be a really good team like
in<00:03:46.950> attorneys<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.549> everything<00:03:47.909> but<00:03:48.359> I<00:03:48.420> think

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
in attorneys and everything but I think

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.660 
in attorneys and everything but I think
with<00:03:49.049> us<00:03:49.079> how<00:03:49.560> come<00:03:49.709> our<00:03:49.859> records<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.519> very

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
with us how come our records not so very

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.349 
with us how come our records not so very
good<00:03:51.349> because<00:03:52.349> we<00:03:52.590> see<00:03:53.190> teams<00:03:53.459> like<00:03:53.790> their<00:03:54.209> own

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
good because we see teams like their own

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.119 
good because we see teams like their own
oh<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.989> we<00:03:55.139> don't<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.889> don't<00:03:56.010> really

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
oh you know we don't we don't really

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.199 
oh you know we don't we don't really
think<00:03:56.220> that's<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.609> good<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.970> then<00:03:57.060> would<00:03:57.180> we

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
think that's that good and then would we

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.479 
think that's that good and then would we
just<00:03:57.629> play<00:03:58.139> them<00:03:58.319> different<00:03:58.709> like<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.370> this
