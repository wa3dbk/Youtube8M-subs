anticipate<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.510> they<00:00:45.510> would<00:00:45.719> continue

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
anticipate was that they would continue

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.490 
anticipate was that they would continue
to<00:00:46.969> just<00:00:47.969> stand<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.260> anything

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
to just stand there and not do anything

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.689 
to just stand there and not do anything

I'm<00:01:35.790> playing<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.390> computer<00:01:36.570> I'm<00:01:37.020> playing<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I'm playing the computer I'm playing the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.420 
I'm playing the computer I'm playing the
AI<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.490> after<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> hit<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> ball<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:41.070> just
