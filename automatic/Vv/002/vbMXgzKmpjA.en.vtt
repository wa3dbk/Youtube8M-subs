knife compared to the moro number one
which<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.630> guess<00:00:33.660> what<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.230> compare

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
which is I guess what you can compare

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.410 
which is I guess what you can compare
everything<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.120> blade

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
everything to you can see that the blade

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.639 
everything to you can see that the blade
is<00:00:36.450> slightly<00:00:37.079> longer<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.800> slightly<00:00:38.070> wider<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
is slightly longer is slightly wider the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.060 
is slightly longer is slightly wider the
handle<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.540> significantly<00:00:42.540> larger<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
handle is significantly larger and this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.930 
handle is significantly larger and this
handle<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.550> made<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.980> flexible<00:00:46.980> plastic

handle is made of a flexible plastic
material<00:00:48.510> sort<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.320> rubbery<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.190> not

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
material sort of rubbery it's not

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.779 
material sort of rubbery it's not
squishy<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:53.270> hard<00:00:54.270> enough<00:00:55.399> but<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.520> gives<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
squishy it's hard enough but it gives a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.020 
squishy it's hard enough but it gives a
much<00:00:56.940> better<00:00:57.329> grip<00:00:57.660> compared<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.910> more<00:00:59.910> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
much better grip compared to the more on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.599 
much better grip compared to the more on
number<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.620> much<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.829> secure<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.430> has<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
number one much more secure it has a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.620 
number one much more secure it has a
small<00:01:03.059> guard<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.489> might<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:05.880> cut

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
small guard that I might actually cut

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
small guard that I might actually cut
down<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> bit<00:01:07.369> but<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> guard<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.030> doesn't<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
down a bit but the guard it doesn't get

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.230 
down a bit but the guard it doesn't get
in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.409> grip<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.290> blade<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
in the way of a good grip the blade is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.780 
in the way of a good grip the blade is
as<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> said<00:01:15.630> carbon<00:01:16.259> steel<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.610> can

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
as I think I said carbon steel you can

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
as I think I said carbon steel you can
see<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> machine<00:01:18.509> marks<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> blade<00:01:19.290> where

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
see the machine marks on the blade where

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
see the machine marks on the blade where
it<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.970> sharpened<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> Scandinavian

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it was sharpened with the Scandinavian

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.850 
it was sharpened with the Scandinavian
grind<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:23.009> think<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.030> those<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.680> ground<00:01:25.680> away

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
grind I think when those are ground away

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
grind I think when those are ground away
from<00:01:26.299> finer<00:01:27.299> sharpening<00:01:27.900> you'll<00:01:28.439> be<00:01:28.590> much

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
from finer sharpening you'll be much

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.520 
from finer sharpening you'll be much
better<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.610> sheath<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.930> secure<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
better the sheath is very secure the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
better the sheath is very secure the
blade<00:01:31.680> snaps<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.369> place<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.049> is<00:01:34.049> not

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
blade snaps in place and that is not

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.670 
blade snaps in place and that is not
going<00:01:34.619> anywhere<00:01:34.890> no<00:01:35.759> matter<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.299> do

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
going anywhere no matter what I do

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.319 
going anywhere no matter what I do
unless<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.860> give<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.430> hard<00:01:38.670> pull<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> get

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329

up some and I'm going to file the back
of<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:19.040> sharp<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.370> it'll<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:21.780> as

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
of it to make it sharp so it'll work as

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.090 
of it to make it sharp so it'll work as
a<00:02:21.990> scraper<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.060> also<00:02:24.060> work<00:02:24.240> better<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.110> get

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
a scraper and also work better to get

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.930 
a scraper and also work better to get
sparks<00:02:26.580> from<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:27.000> fire<00:02:27.210> steel<00:02:27.620> other<00:02:28.620> than<00:02:28.800> that

sparks from a fire steel other than that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.640 
sparks from a fire steel other than that
for<00:02:29.940> twelve<00:02:30.210> dollars<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.260> pretty<00:02:31.470> good

out they're very strong and if I put

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.710 
out they're very strong and if I put
this<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.910> can<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.240> that<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.510> holds

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
this on here you can see that it holds

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.010 
this on here you can see that it holds
on<00:03:10.020> right<00:03:10.890> through<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.550> handle<00:03:12.300> material<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
on right through the handle material and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.010 
on right through the handle material and
as<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.830> move<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.160> back<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.270> will<00:03:15.450> tell<00:03:15.630> us<00:03:15.660> how

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
as I move it back this will tell us how

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.990 
as I move it back this will tell us how
long<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.530> tang<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.690> can<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:20.850> it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
long this tang is you can see that it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.560 
long this tang is you can see that it's
still<00:03:21.240> sticking<00:03:21.720> on<00:03:21.870> here<00:03:22.610> as<00:03:23.610> i<00:03:24.270> move<00:03:24.420> it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
still sticking on here as i move it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.750 
still sticking on here as i move it
fairly<00:03:24.900> far<00:03:25.320> back<00:03:26.870> some<00:03:27.870> point<00:03:28.460> there<00:03:29.460> it

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
fairly far back some point there it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.030 
fairly far back some point there it
falls<00:03:30.030> off<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:31.110> tang<00:03:31.380> extends<00:03:31.920> to

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
falls off so that the tang extends to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.370 
falls off so that the tang extends to
just<00:03:32.250> about<00:03:32.490> there<00:03:32.880> which<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:33.810> almost<00:03:34.020> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
just about there which is almost the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.810 
just about there which is almost the
full<00:03:34.620> length<00:03:34.830> of<00:03:35.010> my<00:03:35.190> hand<00:03:35.520> when<00:03:35.700> it's

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
full length of my hand when it's

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.720 
full length of my hand when it's
covering<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.270> knife<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.830> makes<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.700> a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
covering the knife so that makes for a

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.020 
covering the knife so that makes for a
very<00:03:38.970> strong<00:03:39.510> construction<00:03:42.320> very<00:03:44.030> durable

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
very strong construction very durable

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.580 
very strong construction very durable
reliable<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:46.070> think<00:03:47.070> it's<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.250> good<00:03:47.370> enough
