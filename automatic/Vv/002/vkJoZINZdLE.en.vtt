00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
very very cool if it almost looks like

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.839 
very very cool if it almost looks like

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
looking at it head on another thing I

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.279 
looking at it head on another thing I
did<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> FaceTime<00:00:30.420> camera<00:00:30.660> really

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
did you like the FaceTime camera really

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.420 
did you like the FaceTime camera really
impressed<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> quality<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
impressed with the quality actually that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.790 
impressed with the quality actually that
was<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.030> most<00:00:33.590> surprising<00:00:34.590> thing

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
was one of the most surprising thing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
was one of the most surprising thing
because<00:00:35.130> I've<00:00:35.399> seen<00:00:35.640> FaceTime<00:00:36.149> cameras

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
because I've seen FaceTime cameras

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.479 
because I've seen FaceTime cameras
before<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.590> wasn't<00:00:37.920> impressed<00:00:38.340> with

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
before really it wasn't impressed with

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.330 
before really it wasn't impressed with
it<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.700> iphone<00:00:39.120> 4<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.649> apparently<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> suppose

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it on iphone 4 and apparently I suppose

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
it on iphone 4 and apparently I suppose
the<00:00:41.460> iPod<00:00:41.850> Touch<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> supposed<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the iPod Touch is supposed to have the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.090 
the iPod Touch is supposed to have the
same<00:00:42.719> camera<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.469> maybe<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:43.950> wasn't

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
same camera so maybe I just wasn't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.220 
same camera so maybe I just wasn't
looking<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.789> maybe<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> quality

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
looking at you maybe some of the quality

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
looking at you maybe some of the quality
samples<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.620> saw<00:00:46.829> weren't<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.399> whatever<00:00:47.760> but

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
samples I saw weren't right whatever but

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
samples I saw weren't right whatever but
very<00:00:48.690> very<00:00:48.870> impressed<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> FaceTime

find more but of course that software
stuff<00:04:13.000> that<00:04:13.329> will<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.930> easily<00:04:14.139> fixed<00:04:14.530> Apple<00:04:15.009> is

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
stuff that will be easily fixed Apple is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.249 
stuff that will be easily fixed Apple is
