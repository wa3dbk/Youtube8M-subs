00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.060 
at the doll then turning the transducer
through<00:01:09.150> 90<00:01:09.570> degrees<00:01:09.600> from<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> axial<00:01:10.740> image

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
through 90 degrees from the axial image

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
through 90 degrees from the axial image
will<00:01:11.820> produce<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.420> coronal<00:01:12.960> image<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> face

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
will produce a coronal image of the face

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
will produce a coronal image of the face
which<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:14.970> useful<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.659> looking<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:16.080> the

nostrils moving down from the head then

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
nostrils moving down from the head then
the<00:01:21.900> next<00:01:22.170> measurement<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.650> take<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the next measurement we take is the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100 
the next measurement we take is the
abdominal<00:01:23.700> circumference<00:01:24.150> which<00:01:24.960> is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
abdominal circumference which is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.840 
abdominal circumference which is
measured<00:01:25.470> by<00:01:25.650> tracing<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> outer<00:01:26.460> edge<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
image taken at the level of the stomach
and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> intrahepatic<00:01:32.369> portion<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and the intrahepatic portion of the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
and the intrahepatic portion of the
umbilical<00:01:34.020> vein<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.670> doll<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.119> it's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
umbilical vein on this doll then it's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
umbilical vein on this doll then it's
about<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:37.280> remember<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.790> fluid

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
about here remember we know that fluid

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.219 
about here remember we know that fluid
is<00:01:39.329> hypoechoic

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
is hypoechoic

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
is hypoechoic
so<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> dark<00:01:41.790> fluid<00:01:42.390> filled

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so we look for the dark fluid filled

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
so we look for the dark fluid filled
stomach<00:01:43.079> below<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> normally<00:01:44.130> situated

doll again to measure the femur length

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
doll again to measure the femur length
we<00:01:50.310> place<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> transducer<00:01:51.290> about<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.500> level

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
we place a transducer about this level

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
we place a transducer about this level
here<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.790> measured<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> length<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
here and we measured the length of the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.980 
here and we measured the length of the
ossified<00:01:55.259> part<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> bone<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.630> look<00:01:57.810> for

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
ossified part of the bone so we look for

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.929 
ossified part of the bone so we look for
the<00:01:58.079> bright<00:01:58.320> leading-edge<00:01:58.950> reflector<00:01:59.579> with

the bright leading-edge reflector with

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.630 
the bright leading-edge reflector with
posterior<00:02:00.540> shadowing<00:02:00.780> seen<00:02:01.290> beyond<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> after

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
posterior shadowing seen beyond it after

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.770 
posterior shadowing seen beyond it after
we've<00:02:02.759> done<00:02:02.820> those<00:02:03.090> measurements<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
we've done those measurements we can

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.649 
we've done those measurements we can
also<00:02:04.079> assess<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> heart<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> heart<00:02:06.270> for

also assess the heart the heart for

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.930 
also assess the heart the heart for
chambers<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.069> color<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.580> used<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
chambers and the color is used to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.490 
chambers and the color is used to
demonstrate<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.660> position<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> the
