you

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 

we're<00:00:10.590> going<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> take<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.190> CD<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.059> we're

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
we're going to take this CD and we're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
we're going to take this CD and we're
going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> take<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> dremel<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.820> going<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
going to take a dremel and it's going to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.170 
going to take a dremel and it's going to
spin<00:00:15.629> and<00:00:15.980> probably<00:00:16.980> explode<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.700> CD

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
spin and probably explode this CD

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.850 
spin and probably explode this CD
through<00:00:18.630> friction<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.259> just<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> go

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
through friction it's just going to go

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.490 
through friction it's just going to go
shards<00:00:20.340> everywhere<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.290> to<00:00:22.349> be

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
shards everywhere and it's going to be

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.010 
shards everywhere and it's going to be
really<00:00:23.099> cool<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.270> Dremel<00:00:24.599> will<00:00:24.689> be<00:00:24.810> going

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
really cool and the Dremel will be going

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.540 
really cool and the Dremel will be going
at<00:00:25.140> top<00:00:25.320> speed<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.860> it's<00:00:26.009> gonna<00:00:26.100> be<00:00:26.189> awesome

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
at top speed so it's gonna be awesome

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.779 
at top speed so it's gonna be awesome
and<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> doesn't<00:00:28.050> explode<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.550> we're

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and if it doesn't explode by this we're

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.049 
and if it doesn't explode by this we're
gonna<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.330> foot<00:00:30.740> at<00:00:31.740> my<00:00:32.010> exercise<00:00:32.640> ball<00:00:32.879> and

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
gonna take foot at my exercise ball and

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
gonna take foot at my exercise ball and
just<00:00:33.180> chuck<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:36.350> hopefully<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.500> don't

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
just chuck it at that hopefully we don't

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:53.190 
just chuck it at that hopefully we don't
kill<00:00:37.860> ourselves<00:00:39.050> go
