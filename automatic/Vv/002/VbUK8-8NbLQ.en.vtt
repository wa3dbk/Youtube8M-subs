00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.580
 guide video because on this occasion 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.730
 I bring a video about me what was the 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.660
 legendary pokemon that we're going to change 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.029
 so I'm going to put it here in 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.150
 the psc so you can see the good 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.160
 I usually tell me what is in the form 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.340
 lyric that is this that is here you are 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:39.050
 watching and it is normal psychic as we see 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.199
 is a pokémon that stands out a lot 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.129
 his special attack taking it right there 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.769
 now 5.168 and for his special defense 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:52.460
 as we can see he is missing an attack worth 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:55.309
 what is your movement 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.550
 the movement that characterizes it that the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.700
 which one are we going to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.399
 to have to teach them so that 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.979
 can change shape to its dance form 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.810
 changing his time to the kind of normal 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.960
 struggle to do that we have to come to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.560
 frustrating city and talk to this 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.990
 man here who is going to give us I can not 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 leave the option to leave a pokémon 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 so that we learn an attack that we 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.100
 he taught an attack this time we just 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.530
 teach me the archaic song that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.690
 it's a characteristic movement like 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.649
 well I said I'm going to put it here 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.649
 singing in the helmet 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's see caic singing or if you attack 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.190
 with moving rivals around 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.080
 with an old song you can sleep 1 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.240
 this attack of normal type as we can 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.880
 see has a power of 75 and a 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:52.480
 100's precision how can we know how 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.600
 it is changed in a good way only 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.120
 changes him in battle he just does not know 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.680
 can change in another way and how is it 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.750
 at level 100 it will be very difficult for me 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.660
 find a pokémon that can stand 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.900
 a blow of his is why I'm going to go 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.760
 someone to pokemon and try that version 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.160
 some little can stand at least this 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.530
 beat of archaic chant because 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.250
 I want to show your way and your 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.320
 statistics and everything so let's go to it 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 well let's see here the archaic chant 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.820
 let's see if this but now what 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.410
 Hold on because it is very very important 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.250
 that the endurance so we can see well 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.250
 its way 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.410
 can not stand it but we can leave it well 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.870
 in battle this we can leave in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.370
 battle it eta eta and let's see how there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.370
 just changed shape there we are 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.180
 seeing me is in shape 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.180
 dance vale 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.890
 well I'm going to cut this part so that 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.590
 do not see how it goes up to me all the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.420
 level here I can see mel or eta in 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.800
 spear shape and let's see their 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.570
 statistics I'm going to change here look 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.300
 here we are seeing I'm not going to put here 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.340
 let's remove what we can see that is 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.930
 has changed the normal time fight 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.510
 also the funny thing is that the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 statistics also change him 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.069
 increasing the attack on speed and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.050
 a little in defense but nevertheless 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.459
 sacrifices the attack to special 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.550
 and the special defense as well we are 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.070
 seeing that that is the difference 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.260
 the biggest difference with its shape 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.730
 lyrical also the psychic type in 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.340
 truth and nothing 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.560
 this is simply to catch and teach him the 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.319
 archaic chant I have received this me what 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.360
 of is for the least bad because you know 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.489
 that the necessary poem in japan and then 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.379
 they exchanged it with me and nothing 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.840
 I hope you liked this this 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.440
 video has been pretty fast 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.540
 just to see it as it changes 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.790
 way less eta and there it is 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.129
 I hope you liked guys if so 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.500
 it comes out a like they came up for more and we 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.500
 we see in a next episode goodbye
