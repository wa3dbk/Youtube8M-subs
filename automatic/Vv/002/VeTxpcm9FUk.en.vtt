all<00:00:00.480> right<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.350> supposed<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.770> be<00:00:01.860> a

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:02.419 
all right this is supposed to be a

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.690 
all right this is supposed to be a
comparison<00:00:03.419> between<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.990> fulltone<00:00:04.560> OCD<00:00:04.670> as<00:00:05.670> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
comparison between the fulltone OCD as a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.990 
comparison between the fulltone OCD as a
version<00:00:06.029> three<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.919> love<00:00:08.189> petal<00:00:08.639> super

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
version three and a love petal super

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.180 
version three and a love petal super
lead<00:00:09.210> both<00:00:09.750> pedals<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.320> designed<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.889> emulate

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
lead both pedals are designed to emulate

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.360 
lead both pedals are designed to emulate
a<00:00:11.370> Marshall<00:00:11.969> however<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> OCD<00:00:13.469> focuses<00:00:14.160> more

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
a Marshall however the OCD focuses more

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
a Marshall however the OCD focuses more
on<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.580> driven<00:00:15.509> 18<00:00:16.289> watt<00:00:16.529> Marshall<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
on a driven 18 watt Marshall and the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.140 
on a driven 18 watt Marshall and the
super<00:00:18.300> lead<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.810> its<00:00:19.740> namesake<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.609> more<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
super lead as its namesake is more the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
super lead as its namesake is more the
Marshall<00:00:21.570> stack<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.680> let's<00:00:22.859> see<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.189> they

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
Marshall stack so let's see how they

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.990 
Marshall stack so let's see how they
compare

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
compare

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.760 
compare
first<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> clean<00:00:25.050> tone<00:00:32.750> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:34.410> let's

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
first the clean tone and then let's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.560 
first the clean tone and then let's
start<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.610> super<00:00:36.000> lead<00:00:37.730> draw<00:00:38.730> level

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
start with the super lead draw level

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.619 
start with the super lead draw level
just<00:00:39.899> past<00:00:40.200> 12<00:00:41.090> Drive<00:00:42.890> at<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:44.219> 1:30<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.420> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
just past 12 Drive at about 1:30 this is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:01:09.060 
just past 12 Drive at about 1:30 this is
with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.930> mid<00:00:46.140> boost<00:00:46.350> on

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.550 

let's<00:01:10.070> try<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.430> OCD<00:01:11.830> 18<00:01:12.830> watt<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:13.570> 18<00:01:14.570> volt<00:01:14.869> and

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
let's try the OCD 18 watt or 18 volt and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:42.400 
let's try the OCD 18 watt or 18 volt and
drive<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.550> not<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.880> applaud

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.200 

so<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.710> would<00:01:44.310> say<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:44.880> no

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
so I would say a little bit more no

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.650 
so I would say a little bit more no
definition<00:01:45.900> with<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.080> OCD<00:01:46.770> also<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.660> the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
definition with the OCD also the the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.880 
definition with the OCD also the the
tone<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> OCD<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.220> turned<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.030> about<00:01:51.890> 10:30

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
tone on the OCD is turned to about 10:30

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.820 
tone on the OCD is turned to about 10:30
and<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.390> tone<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> shoe<00:01:55.800> police<00:01:56.070> raid<00:01:56.370> 12

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
and the tone on the shoe police raid 12

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:16.390 
and the tone on the shoe police raid 12
go<00:01:58.830> back<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.280> Superleague

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.390 

same<00:02:17.400> grip<00:02:17.760> on<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.240> same<00:02:19.200> sequence<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.190> this

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
same grip on the same sequence on this

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:41.850 
same grip on the same sequence on this
evening

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.380 

all<00:02:42.860> right<00:02:43.040> let's<00:02:43.250> back<00:02:43.459> some<00:02:43.730> out<00:02:43.879> see<00:02:44.239> what

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
all right let's back some out see what

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.580 
all right let's back some out see what
the<00:02:44.480> difference<00:02:44.810> is

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:10.330 

all<00:02:48.590> right<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:49.129> game<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.610> maxed<00:02:50.030> out

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:41.430 

OCD

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.190 

that's<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:43.150> obviously<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.510> OCD<00:03:45.050> is<00:03:45.110> a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
that's that obviously the OCD is a

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.470 
that's that obviously the OCD is a
little<00:03:45.350> bit<00:03:45.500> darker<00:03:45.890> pedal<00:03:46.250> more<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.300> the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
little bit darker pedal more in the

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.850 
little bit darker pedal more in the
low-mids<00:03:49.390> Superleague<00:03:50.440> still<00:03:51.440> has<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> good

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
low-mids Superleague still has a good

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.140 
low-mids Superleague still has a good
base<00:03:52.040> response<00:03:52.430> but<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.000> definitely

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
base response but it's definitely

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.180 
base response but it's definitely
focused<00:03:53.840> more<00:03:55.420> less<00:03:56.420> high<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:57.050> mean<00:03:57.500> more<00:03:58.160> like

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
focused more less high I mean more like

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.020 
focused more less high I mean more like
a<00:03:58.550> like<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.150> high<00:03:59.390> cut<00:04:00.459> all<00:04:01.459> right<00:04:01.670> let<00:04:01.910> me<00:04:01.970> know

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
a like a high cut all right let me know

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.420
