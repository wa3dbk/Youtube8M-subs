00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello friends I want to show this set of 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:09.090
 today the virus maker is the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 reference to the cooking iter comes the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.910
 typical cousin transport bag 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.439
 On the one hand we are going to see the interior but 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 we are not going to find two sheets of one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.419
 capacity of 17 and two as one liter 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 they are all made of aluminum 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.619
 anodized interesting adherent and with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.520
 a multilayer in titanium for a greater 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.250
 resistance to the cover separate today 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 we find characteristic 15 a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.170
 euro base of cousins this would be the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.239
 pot of smaller capacity of 17 liters 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 comes totally here graduate comes to us 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.560
 very good at the time of graduating the food 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.240
 so do not prepare an iof type the 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.490
 hoisting of food we need to know the 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.470
 amount of water the interior is aluminum 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.850
 organized, I recommend you, let's always 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.800
 use this type of travel in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.870
 non-stick do not put it to heat 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.270
 directly with nothing inside already 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.040
 that if not with time 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.870
 the moon is going to jump you always 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.990
 we can use it with water with oil 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.540
 with a blanket that the heat that the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.360
 pot is transmitted to the seasoning that we 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.430
 interested here you can see that it helped 1 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.250
 circle to distribute the heat better 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.900
 the cover the same for both though 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.120
 this would be a little more output but 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.190
 perfectly we see here is the little 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320
 cookie rag that suits us very well 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.300
 for transportation I recommend you also 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.950
 that for example if you are going to use both 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.750
 pots and in the middle that takes your 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.090
 small stove and some cartridge in 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.790
 seasonings you put everything in bags 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.380
 independent first to make it more 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.580
 hygienic for cleaning and then in the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.210
 we always transport in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.860
 backpack or bicycle 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.850
 and they are giving blows so that they do not scratch us 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.070
 the announced interior 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 this would be the highest capacity of about 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.510
 2.1 liters that has approximately one 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.130
 diameter of 18 centimeters and a height 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.710
 that does not reach 10 centimeters you can 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.780
 see here also in the small diffuser 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.290
 that has good equipment that has been 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 forgotten that this would be the 1.7 pot 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.360
 which has approximately a diameter of 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 about 17 centimeters and a height of about 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260
 7 centimeters and a half as you can see 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.700
 here the diffuser 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.290
 they are a water that is worth us perfectly 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.670
 for one for two people they can 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 use our activity is free and 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.760
 free backpacker I delivered cyclotourism 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.769
 since it suits us very well I hope that the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.160
 information has helped help greetings and 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.160
 good trip
