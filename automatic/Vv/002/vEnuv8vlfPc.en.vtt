00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
timing here is a big big bitch and I

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.479 
timing here is a big big bitch and I
lose<00:02:07.780> too<00:02:08.019> much<00:02:08.170> time<00:02:08.229> otherwise<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.039> pass<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
trick up the final climb is a pain

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.390 
trick up the final climb is a pain
simply<00:02:13.569> because<00:02:13.959> it's<00:02:14.140> just<00:02:14.380> barely<00:02:14.769> specific

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
simply because it's just barely specific

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.880 
simply because it's just barely specific
enough<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.670> earn<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> death<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.930> damage<00:02:17.680> on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
enough to earn you a death or damage on

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.330 
enough to earn you a death or damage on
more<00:02:18.220> than<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.489> couple<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.880> attempts<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.340> now

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
more than a couple of attempts and now

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.640 
more than a couple of attempts and now
Blizzard<00:02:22.060> Wolfgang<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.340> next<00:02:24.610> level

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.420 

okay<00:02:29.650> fine

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
okay fine

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.500 
okay fine
so<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:31.000> fairly<00:02:31.690> obvious<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.769> short<00:02:33.130> fight

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so it's fairly obvious in a short fight

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.210 
so it's fairly obvious in a short fight
that<00:02:34.510> no<00:02:34.690> matter<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.140> happens<00:02:35.650> you're<00:02:36.160> not

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that no matter what happens you're not

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.699 
that no matter what happens you're not
gonna<00:02:36.549> run<00:02:36.700> into<00:02:36.760> too<00:02:37.060> much<00:02:37.239> trouble<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.930> on

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
gonna run into too much trouble and on

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.070 
gonna run into too much trouble and on
level<00:02:39.069> one<00:02:39.310> he's<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:39.880> goddamned<00:02:40.450> pathetic

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
level one he's so goddamned pathetic

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.870 
level one he's so goddamned pathetic
that<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.410> defies<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.069> point<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.459> describing

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880
