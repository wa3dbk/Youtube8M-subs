00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hi how are you now I come with another 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.109
 review of limited collections of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.099
 Christmas edition of these seasons 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.960
 Christmas 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.559
 the review with which I come the day of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.750
 today is this palette of the brand of coors 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.270
 this time of the Christian victims in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.369
 rumors palette last year I did not 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
 I bought the palette that had the rumors 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.330
 because at that time I almost did not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 like that is if I liked rumors 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.310
 but I had one that was always there 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.410
 did not change blush in which always 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.180
 I was always but lately been 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 experimenting with the rumors and the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.710
 true that I see that it does a lot 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.360
 difference in the appearance of when 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.790
 one gets fixed looks like more 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 healthy and all that is what he called me 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.620
 very much the attention this palette like this is 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 as you look at the packaging that is supposed 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.199
 that looks like a handheld wallet of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.649
 fact opens like a portfolio of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 hand and good have two clasps here that 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.559
 you can use 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.340
 it's very nice the truth is they make me 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.940
 Pretty smart for a day 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.610
 and so a little more looks a little more 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.770
 loving that I put something to decorate 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.300
 the hair heard some review that 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.830
 they say they do not like packaging because 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.780
 they are very thick in the headquarters 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.720
 pretty good and if it's a little bit 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.210
 thick but there really are five rumors 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.400
 in a palette that to me personally yes 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.260
 It's good for me to travel my bags 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.510
 they're big so I do not have any 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.250
 problem that I fit in the bag that 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.460
 I took with me the edges of this 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.119
 blue mark of point 2011 50 thousand 16 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 Dollars 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.460
 these are five point blushes 15 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.850
 ounce each one or the size of their 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.420
 rumors is almost the regular size of a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.490
 blush of this brand and costs with this 2 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.170
 dollars makes a blush in 26 dollars 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.210
 weeks is too expensive I do not think that 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.850
 I would never buy it 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.760
 with edges for 40 dollars comes out 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.190
 every blush about 8 dollars that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.900
 makes me very very good price and good the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.119
 I really feel that it is a good way to 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.220
 I can deal with these rumors that everything 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.470
 the world says they are great to a 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.780
 much more reasonable price 8 dollars per 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.890
 a rumor is opposite to being in the store 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 from the pharmacy 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 has a neutral blush that the truth is 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.380
 can use to make makeup 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.260
 smoked where you do not want 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.300
 the focus here on your cheekbones comes with 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.670
 a wine color that is usually perfect 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.520
 for now these fall seasons 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.030
 winter comes with a flush as well 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.150
 Fusha type and completely matte 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.400
 that is great for now also the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.590
 winter seems to get a color like this 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.080
 tell me in the winter a little bit the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.950
 Cheeks and little nose gives the effect 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.780
 as if you were like that is when 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.780
 you go winter to winter and you go 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.360
 puts you and that no skin rosita 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.520
 I know the cold fascinates me such 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.850
 of rumors of winter comes a color 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.800
 coral is also completely matte this 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.410
 coral color I like for the 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.020
 spring and there is also a pink color 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.910
 like old rose what 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.220
 all all the best and I think that you 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.870
 are left to any type of skin except 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 with this color here that makes me feel 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.480
 I was a little bit very basic in and toned 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.390
 of skin I do not notice 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.000
 note very little this but all the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.360
 others look very good this one although it 's 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.040
 very short I like how I mention them 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.930
 so that you do not notice so much or that nothing 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.730
 more look a little bit at using them and what 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.860
 I will use now if you are more skin 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.890
 brunette that mine this robot can you 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.020
 serve as to illuminate 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.209
 all the flushes are very parents 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.890
 they have a super creamy texture the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.380
 I had never felt a blush like that before 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.680
 from father or so soft I like the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.660
 texture the durability these rumors 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.040
 says that its structure last 12 hours and 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.980
 the truth is that if it lasts all day to 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.790
 another day put on with this blush this 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.820
 color came from here 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.580
 and I put it in the morning at night what 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.400
 I had as if I had just applied it and 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.940
 packing all the blushes here are 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.740
 mates with the exception of this wine here 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.300
 and good is a review of this palette of 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.400
 this palette can only 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.200
 get in season they are the 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.030
 I highly recommend at least if they go 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.990
 to the store I recommend that you try it 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.090
 because the truth is very good five 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.730
 blushes for 42 dollars that is coming out 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.240
 eight dollars for every rumor is very 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.070
 all right 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.170
 I do not have the truth, I do not have anything bad 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.850
 What to say about this palette 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.050
 people said that the size to me was 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.960
 it's good because it's up to the mattress 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.360
 adif to the other day I dropped the only thing 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.460
 is that you looked at yourself I think it was this robbery 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.620
 rosita is here looked to the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.600
 little bit of dust but for nothing that 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.180
 that pink up that helps cushion 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.760
 the blows and then everything with this 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.050
 review girls I hope you liked it and 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.050
 see you until the next video
