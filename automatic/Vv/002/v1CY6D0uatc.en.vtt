00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.880 
stupid but anyway we stopped to say Kahn
we<00:02:03.830> stopped<00:02:04.069> him<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:05.030> bag<00:02:05.209> was<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:06.709> bag

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
we stopped him so the bag was the bag

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.400 
we stopped him so the bag was the bag
stayed<00:02:07.160> with<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> old<00:02:07.489> lady<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.030> she<00:02:08.410> gives

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
stayed with the old lady and she gives

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.550 
stayed with the old lady and she gives
us<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.649> bomb<00:02:10.099> mask

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
us the bomb mask

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.040 
us the bomb mask
class<00:02:12.160> masks<00:02:12.460> my<00:02:12.700> mistake

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
class masks my mistake

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.050 
class masks my mistake
it<00:02:14.650> has<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> same<00:02:15.190> features<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> bomb

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
it has the same features of the bomb

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.560 
it has the same features of the bomb
okay<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.290> blows<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:18.250> hurts<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.420> if<00:02:19.480> you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
okay it blows up it hurts you but if you

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.360 
okay it blows up it hurts you but if you
actually<00:02:19.840> it's<00:02:20.050> really<00:02:20.170> strange<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
actually it's really strange is if you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.400 
actually it's really strange is if you
put<00:02:21.520> your<00:02:21.640> shield<00:02:22.000> down<00:02:22.240> while<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
put your shield down while you have the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.080 
put your shield down while you have the
mask<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.010> activate<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.490> bombs<00:02:24.700> or

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
mask on and you activate the bombs or

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.780 
mask on and you activate the bombs or
the<00:02:25.180> blast<00:02:25.450> part<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.370> don't<00:02:27.460> get<00:02:27.580> hurt

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the blast part of it you don't get hurt

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.400 
the blast part of it you don't get hurt
which<00:02:28.060> doesn't<00:02:28.300> make<00:02:28.360> any<00:02:28.630> sense<00:02:28.960> because<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
which doesn't make any sense because the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.590 
which doesn't make any sense because the
blast<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.830> behind<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:31.120> feels<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:31.480> you

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
blast is behind you it feels like you

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.510 
blast is behind you it feels like you
would<00:02:31.720> hurt<00:02:31.810> get<00:02:32.020> hurt<00:02:32.230> more<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.950> shield<00:02:33.280> is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
would hurt get hurt more the shield is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.790 
would hurt get hurt more the shield is
holding<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.940> blast<00:02:34.150> next<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:35.560> it's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
holding the blast next to you but it's

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.730 
holding the blast next to you but it's
really<00:02:36.340> doesn't<00:02:36.880> make<00:02:37.000> any<00:02:37.180> sense<00:02:37.740> but

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
really doesn't make any sense but

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.520 
really doesn't make any sense but
regardless<00:02:39.160> we<00:02:39.490> have<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.760> masking<00:02:40.120> now<00:02:40.530> let's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
regardless we have the masking now let's

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.730 
regardless we have the masking now let's
speed<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> night<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.970> third<00:02:43.270> day

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:31.219 
midnight my mistake 10 o'clock 10:00

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:37.390 
midnight my mistake 10 o'clock 10:00
p.m.<00:03:35.530> midnight<00:03:36.530> would<00:03:36.590> be<00:03:36.739> pushing<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.189> but<00:03:37.370> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
p.m. midnight would be pushing it but I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.920 
p.m. midnight would be pushing it but I
believe<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:37.819> store<00:03:38.090> would<00:03:38.209> still<00:03:38.510> be<00:03:38.629> open

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
believe this store would still be open

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.370 
believe this store would still be open
at<00:03:39.049> midnight

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.350 

I<00:03:44.470> don't<00:03:45.250> know<00:03:45.370> when<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:45.580> store<00:03:45.760> closes<00:03:45.790> I

I don't know when the store closes I

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.120 
I don't know when the store closes I
know<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.540> opens<00:03:46.690> at<00:03:46.990> 10:00<00:03:47.200> p.m.<00:03:47.380> but<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.890> don't

00:03:48.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
know it opens at 10:00 p.m. but I don't
know<00:03:48.250> when<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.520> closes<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:50.700> just<00:03:51.700> whatever
