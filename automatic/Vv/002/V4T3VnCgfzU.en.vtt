producing some very very cool and
interesting<00:00:25.980> new<00:00:26.970> rail<00:00:27.210> platforms<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.619> AR<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
interesting new rail platforms for AR is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.070 
interesting new rail platforms for AR is
specifically<00:00:29.730> for<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> m4<00:00:30.449> platform

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
specifically for the m4 platform

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709 
specifically for the m4 platform
currently

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 

for<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.530> other<00:00:34.649> other<00:00:35.340> platforming<00:00:35.879> flow

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
for some other other platforming flow

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.880 
for some other other platforming flow
yeah

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
yeah

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.889 
yeah
we<00:00:37.100> are<00:00:37.489> looking<00:00:37.790> at<00:00:37.910> that<00:00:38.090> by<00:00:38.300> currently<00:00:38.720> this

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
we are looking at that by currently this

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.580 
we are looking at that by currently this
is<00:00:39.079> what<00:00:39.290> we<00:00:39.410> offer<00:00:39.590> okay<00:00:40.300> well<00:00:41.300> in<00:00:41.899> my<00:00:42.170> video<00:00:42.410> I

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
is what we offer okay well in my video I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.290 
is what we offer okay well in my video I
kind<00:00:42.950> of<00:00:43.010> talked<00:00:43.220> about<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.760> designs<00:00:44.120> that

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
kind of talked about the designs that

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.460 
kind of talked about the designs that
were<00:00:44.390> available<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.900> things<00:00:45.079> like<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:45.379> but

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
were available and things like that but

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.680 
were available and things like that but
I<00:00:45.530> didn't<00:00:45.710> really<00:00:45.800> get<00:00:45.980> into<00:00:46.129> how<00:00:46.790> how<00:00:47.629> you

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
I didn't really get into how how you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.240 
I didn't really get into how how you
guys<00:00:47.870> call<00:00:48.110> about<00:00:48.140> mountain<00:00:48.649> being<00:00:48.739> the

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
guys call about mountain being the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.860 
guys call about mountain being the
receiver<00:00:49.579> kind<00:00:50.090> of<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.210> technology<00:00:50.750> behind

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
receiver kind of the technology behind

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.110 
receiver kind of the technology behind
that<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.530> make<00:00:51.649> it<00:00:51.680> interesting<00:00:52.010> secure<00:00:52.520> so<00:00:52.790> if

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
that to make it interesting secure so if

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.189 
that to make it interesting secure so if
you<00:00:53.239> can<00:00:53.390> go<00:00:53.540> over<00:00:53.780> how<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:53.960> whole<00:00:54.170> system

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
you can go over how the whole system

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.900 
you can go over how the whole system
works<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.920> conjunction<00:00:55.100> with<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> statement

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
works in conjunction with the statement

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.319 
works in conjunction with the statement
yeah<00:00:56.150> absolutely<00:00:56.329> we<00:00:57.019> have<00:00:57.230> our<00:00:57.530> own<00:00:57.970> to<00:00:58.970> tar

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
yeah absolutely we have our own to tar

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.210 
yeah absolutely we have our own to tar
barrel<00:00:59.780> nut<00:00:59.900> mounting<00:01:00.260> system<00:01:00.680> that

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
barrel nut mounting system that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.149 
barrel nut mounting system that
integrates<00:01:01.909> into<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:03.110> upper<00:01:03.379> receiver<00:01:03.500> and

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
integrates into the upper receiver and

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.450 
integrates into the upper receiver and
then<00:01:04.400> allows<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:05.449> to<00:01:05.780> have<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.140> tube<00:01:07.009> come<00:01:07.340> on

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
then allows you to have the tube come on

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.279 
then allows you to have the tube come on
and<00:01:07.670> mount<00:01:07.820> with<00:01:07.970> six<00:01:08.360> mounting<00:01:08.720> screws<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
and mount with six mounting screws and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.980 
and mount with six mounting screws and
that<00:01:09.440> makes<00:01:09.649> it<00:01:09.740> be<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> free<00:01:10.250> float<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.030> sure

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
that makes it be a free float and sure

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.040 
that makes it be a free float and sure
okay<00:01:12.350> now<00:01:13.160> typically<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.720> distance

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
okay now typically the the distance

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.389 
okay now typically the the distance
between<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.350> receiver<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.009> upper<00:01:16.220> rail

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
between the receiver the upper rail

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.219 
between the receiver the upper rail
system<00:01:16.759> is<00:01:16.850> somewhat<00:01:17.240> standardized<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:18.050> terms

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
system is somewhat standardized in terms

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.740 
system is somewhat standardized in terms
it's<00:01:18.560> fairly<00:01:19.220> close<00:01:19.550> for<00:01:19.850> most<00:01:19.970> home<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.479> ours

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
it's fairly close for most home so ours

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.460 
it's fairly close for most home so ours
get<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> very<00:01:22.280> post<00:01:23.240> but<00:01:23.690> not<00:01:23.869> exactly

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
get you with a very post but not exactly

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.419 
get you with a very post but not exactly
sure

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
sure

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.900 
sure
now<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.300> great<00:01:26.600> thing<00:01:26.780> about<00:01:27.310> rail<00:01:28.310> platforms

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
now the great thing about rail platforms

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.950 
now the great thing about rail platforms
like<00:01:29.119> this<00:01:29.390> is

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
like this is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.390 
like this is
and<00:01:30.049> you<00:01:30.290> can<00:01:30.440> pretty<00:01:30.590> much<00:01:30.680> have<00:01:30.890> any<00:01:31.070> design

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
and you can pretty much have any design

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.950 
and you can pretty much have any design
like<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.729> guys<00:01:31.820> have<00:01:32.000> done<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.180> Johnson<00:01:32.750> here

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
like you guys have done the Johnson here

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.460 
like you guys have done the Johnson here
but<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.799> can<00:01:33.950> still<00:01:34.159> read<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.840> rail<00:01:36.080> mounting

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
but you can still read for rail mounting

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.320 
but you can still read for rail mounting
points<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.220> about<00:01:37.400> anywhere<00:01:37.729> yes<00:01:38.090> exactly

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
points just about anywhere yes exactly

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.250 
points just about anywhere yes exactly
it<00:01:38.780> our<00:01:39.110> standard<00:01:39.770> ones<00:01:39.979> they<00:01:40.190> come<00:01:40.430> with

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
it our standard ones they come with

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.430 
it our standard ones they come with
holes<00:01:42.550> drilled<00:01:43.550> on<00:01:43.790> them<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:45.020> you<00:01:45.170> can<00:01:45.290> mount

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
holes drilled on them and you can mount

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.580 
holes drilled on them and you can mount
them<00:01:45.650> at<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.070> six<00:01:46.790> nine<00:01:47.090> twelve<00:01:47.540> position<00:01:48.050> but

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
them at the six nine twelve position but

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.170 
them at the six nine twelve position but
if<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.830> were<00:01:48.950> going<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.280> have<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.610> full<00:01:49.909> custom

if you were going to have a full custom
one<00:01:50.479> done<00:01:50.750> that<00:01:51.170> could<00:01:51.350> be<00:01:51.470> located<00:01:52.159> in

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
one done that could be located in

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.740 
one done that could be located in
anywhere<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.700> like<00:01:52.970> we<00:01:53.420> have<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.540> lot<00:01:53.720> of

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
anywhere you like we have a lot of

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.910 
anywhere you like we have a lot of
people<00:01:53.930> don't<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.380> put<00:01:54.530> them<00:01:54.619> out<00:01:54.680> on<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
people don't like to put them out on the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.520 
people don't like to put them out on the
45<00:01:55.430> I<00:01:55.759> was<00:01:55.970> noticing<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.690> blue<00:01:56.899> one<00:01:57.050> who<00:01:57.380> has

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
45 I was noticing the blue one who has

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.280 
45 I was noticing the blue one who has
both<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.970> iron<00:01:59.210> sights<00:01:59.420> located<00:02:00.140> on<00:02:00.259> a

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
both of the the iron sights located on a

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.130 
both of the the iron sights located on a
45<00:02:00.740> which<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.130> really<00:02:01.460> cool<00:02:01.670> yep<00:02:02.330> that<00:02:02.509> way<00:02:02.690> you

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
45 which is really cool yep that way you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.630 
45 which is really cool yep that way you
have<00:02:03.229> nothing<00:02:03.649> much<00:02:03.860> steering<00:02:04.130> with<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.399> our

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
have nothing much steering with you our

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.460 
have nothing much steering with you our
objects<00:02:05.149> on<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.390> top<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:05.899> that's<00:02:06.110> one<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.410> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
objects on the top so that's one of the

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.430 
objects on the top so that's one of the
features<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.070> integrate<00:02:07.369> into<00:02:08.149> sure

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
features that we can integrate into sure

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
features that we can integrate into sure
the<00:02:09.440> same<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:09.920> our<00:02:10.130> quick-detach<00:02:10.789> system<00:02:11.269> we

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the same with our quick-detach system we

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.710 
the same with our quick-detach system we
have<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> steel<00:02:12.470> integrated<00:02:13.100> insert<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
have a steel integrated insert and the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.660 
have a steel integrated insert and the
nice<00:02:15.080> thing<00:02:15.230> about<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.890> when<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:16.519> do<00:02:16.640> a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
nice thing about this is when you do a

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.750 
nice thing about this is when you do a
custom<00:02:17.060> design

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
custom design

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.210 
custom design
that's<00:02:19.390> all<00:02:19.599> what<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.870> say<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.319> need<00:02:20.769> one<00:02:21.189> right

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
that's all what you say I need one right

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.149 
that's all what you say I need one right
here<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.599> pop<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.989> hole<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.409> screw<00:02:23.829> in<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
here we pop the hole and screw in the

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.920 
here we pop the hole and screw in the
insert<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.819> you're<00:02:25.150> good<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.329> go<00:02:25.450> especially

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
insert and you're good to go especially

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.809 
insert and you're good to go especially
when<00:02:26.200> they're<00:02:26.290> sucking<00:02:26.709> QD<00:02:27.220> points<00:02:27.459> are<00:02:27.700> it's

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
when they're sucking QD points are it's

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.380 
when they're sucking QD points are it's
so<00:02:28.090> useful<00:02:29.250> feeling<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.849> large<00:02:31.060> platform

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
so useful feeling it's a large platform

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.899 
so useful feeling it's a large platform
these<00:02:31.599> people<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.019> into<00:02:32.170> DMR's<00:02:32.790> having<00:02:33.790> that

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
these people get into DMR's having that

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.369 
these people get into DMR's having that
the<00:02:34.090> ability<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.420> kind<00:02:34.689> of<00:02:34.780> move<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.200> around

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
the ability to kind of move that around

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.030 
the ability to kind of move that around
as<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.829> see<00:02:35.980> fit<00:02:36.159> is<00:02:36.430> great<00:02:37.650> I'm<00:02:38.650> sure<00:02:38.709> people

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
you have a ranch that will fit down on

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.620 
you have a ranch that will fit down on
your<00:03:11.650> butt<00:03:11.830> stock<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.730> will<00:03:12.880> also<00:03:13.240> fit<00:03:13.450> right

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
your butt stock it will also fit right

your butt stock it will also fit right
here<00:03:13.810> on<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.020> now<00:03:14.590> judging<00:03:14.890> by<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.070> two

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
here on this now judging by the two

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400 
here on this now judging by the two
holes<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.390> are<00:03:16.480> located<00:03:16.780> against<00:03:17.290> where

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
holes that are located against where

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.930 
holes that are located against where
that<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.590> guess<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.860> receiver<00:03:18.190> would<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.490> now

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
that I guess the receiver would be now

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.060 
that I guess the receiver would be now
that's<00:03:19.120> where<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> gas<00:03:19.690> tube<00:03:20.080> yes<00:03:20.500> exactly<00:03:20.740> so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
that's where the gas tube yes exactly so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.980 
that's where the gas tube yes exactly so
much<00:03:21.340> where<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.760> gas<00:03:21.910> tube<00:03:22.180> port<00:03:22.480> would<00:03:22.660> come

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
much where the gas tube port would come

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.280 
much where the gas tube port would come
through<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:24.330> we've<00:03:25.330> allowed<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:25.720> two

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
through and we've allowed for two

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.140 
through and we've allowed for two
options<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.070> way<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.580> get<00:03:27.670> closer

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
options and that way it can get closer

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.070 
options and that way it can get closer

having that get either mount it there or
a<00:03:39.350> lot<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.680> times<00:03:39.860> you<00:03:39.980> can<00:03:40.100> get<00:03:40.220> just<00:03:40.460> one<00:03:40.670> more

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
a lot of times you can get just one more

a lot of times you can get just one more
little<00:03:41.150> turn<00:03:41.450> out<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.020> then<00:03:42.140> it'll

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
little turn out of it and then it'll

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.810 
little turn out of it and then it'll
melt<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.830> it<00:03:42.920> as<00:03:43.010> tight<00:03:43.040> as<00:03:43.250> possible

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
melt get it as tight as possible

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.540 
melt get it as tight as possible
now<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.570> is<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:45.410> really<00:03:45.620> works<00:03:45.860> well<00:03:46.250> for

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
now that is that really works well for

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.120 
now that is that really works well for
like<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.210> usual<00:03:47.770> designers<00:03:48.770> a<00:03:48.950> lot<00:03:48.980> of

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
like this the usual designers a lot of

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.890 
like this the usual designers a lot of
times<00:03:49.370> in<00:03:49.520> years<00:03:49.880> they<00:03:50.210> also<00:03:50.360> replicate<00:03:50.810> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
times in years they also replicate the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.390 
times in years they also replicate the
gas<00:03:51.050> piston<00:03:51.260> design<00:03:51.560> like<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:51.920> for<00:03:52.070> 16

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
gas piston design like that for 16

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.580 
gas piston design like that for 16
things<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:52.970> sure<00:03:53.210> is<00:03:53.600> this<00:03:53.720> also<00:03:54.050> compatible<00:03:54.320> in

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
things I sure is this also compatible in

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.540 
things I sure is this also compatible in
system<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.510> yes<00:03:56.890> without<00:03:57.890> having<00:03:58.370> to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
system like that yes without having to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.030 
system like that yes without having to
okay<00:04:01.660> any<00:04:02.660> other<00:04:02.780> kind<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.170> unique<00:04:03.470> or

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
okay any other kind of unique or

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.590 
okay any other kind of unique or
interesting<00:04:04.190> facts<00:04:04.730> you<00:04:04.850> like<00:04:05.030> tell<00:04:05.270> us<00:04:05.300> that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
interesting facts you like tell us that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.750 
interesting facts you like tell us that
maybe<00:04:05.780> we<00:04:05.870> haven't<00:04:06.170> covered<00:04:06.610> one<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
maybe we haven't covered one of the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.120 
maybe we haven't covered one of the
message<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:08.780> this<00:04:08.959> rail<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:09.709> designed

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
message is is that this rail is designed

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.460 
message is is that this rail is designed
so<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.550> is<00:04:10.820> inclined<00:04:11.720> across<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.260> top

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
so that it is inclined across the top

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.120 
so that it is inclined across the top
okay<00:04:12.800> so<00:04:13.150> at<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.209> custom<00:04:14.720> extrusion<00:04:15.680> made<00:04:15.860> for

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
okay so at a custom extrusion made for

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.050 
okay so at a custom extrusion made for
us<00:04:17.350> when<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.470> do<00:04:18.650> mount<00:04:18.890> it<00:04:19.040> on

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
us when you do mount it on

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.730 
us when you do mount it on
line<00:04:21.359> across<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.750> top<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.320> think<00:04:22.470> one<00:04:22.650> of

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
line across the top now I think one of

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.560 
line across the top now I think one of
those<00:04:22.889> annoying<00:04:23.160> things<00:04:23.340> prayers<00:04:24.000> anyway

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
those annoying things prayers anyway

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.690 
those annoying things prayers anyway
because<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> huge<00:04:25.680> variety<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.250> scopes

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
because of the huge variety of scopes

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.340 
because of the huge variety of scopes
and<00:04:26.850> optics<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.210> are<00:04:27.360> available<00:04:27.510> nine<00:04:28.169> times

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
and optics that are available nine times

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.720 
and optics that are available nine times
out<00:04:28.500> of<00:04:28.530> ten<00:04:28.740> you'll<00:04:28.860> end<00:04:29.010> up<00:04:29.100> having<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.580> mount

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
out of ten you'll end up having to mount

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.390 
out of ten you'll end up having to mount
it<00:04:29.970> right<00:04:30.090> here<00:04:30.570> yeah<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.889> lack<00:04:32.130> of<00:04:32.160> a

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
it right here yeah and so the lack of a

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430 
it right here yeah and so the lack of a
gap<00:04:32.639> or<00:04:32.880> break<00:04:33.150> there<00:04:33.360> makes<00:04:33.570> it<00:04:33.720> really<00:04:34.110> easy

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
gap or break there makes it really easy

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.379 
gap or break there makes it really easy
about<00:04:34.800> just<00:04:35.040> about<00:04:35.190> anything<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.760> these<00:04:35.880> reels
