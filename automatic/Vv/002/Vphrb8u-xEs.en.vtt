00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.670 
because they think is a place of time I
think<00:04:49.430> it's<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.699> ways<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.449> be<00:04:50.599> able<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:51.050> watch

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
think it's a ways to be able to watch

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.260 
think it's a ways to be able to watch
other<00:04:51.979> people<00:04:52.310> play<00:04:52.340> video<00:04:52.759> games<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.120> know

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
other people play video games you know

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.390 
other people play video games you know
it's<00:04:53.569> just<00:04:53.659> that<00:04:53.900> little<00:04:54.500> sort<00:04:54.919> of<00:04:54.979> like<00:04:55.190> and

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
it's just that little sort of like and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.920 
it's just that little sort of like and
support<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:56.180> is<00:04:56.300> stopping<00:04:56.750> him<00:04:56.900> from

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
support that is stopping him from

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.080 
support that is stopping him from
pursuing<00:04:57.259> what<00:04:57.590> he<00:04:57.740> wants<00:04:58.009> to<00:04:58.069> do<00:04:58.310> but<00:04:58.849> if<00:04:58.970> he

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
pursuing what he wants to do but if he

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.360 
pursuing what he wants to do but if he
had<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.509> little<00:04:59.960> less<00:05:00.139> strict<00:05:00.530> parents<00:05:01.039> if<00:05:01.250> you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
had a little less strict parents if you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.700 
had a little less strict parents if you
had<00:05:01.580> people<00:05:01.909> who<00:05:02.120> actually<00:05:02.690> supported<00:05:03.530> him
