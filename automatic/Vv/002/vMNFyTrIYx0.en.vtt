 proper day is generally in principle 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.060
 very cheap and more everything that is more accurate 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.660
 closely you can eat and therefore 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.400
 but really the ball and this is in view of the fact that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.019
 in the sea ​​here these are from meters 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.610
