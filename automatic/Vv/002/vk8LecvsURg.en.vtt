kind of makes sense if you step on your
cord<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:23.200> not<00:02:23.380> gonna<00:02:23.560> pull<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.130> out<00:02:24.220> it

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
cord it's not gonna pull it out it

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.270 
cord it's not gonna pull it out it
catches<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.900> telling<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.350> man<00:02:26.530> if
