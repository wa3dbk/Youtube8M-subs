00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
way it rolled right over the branch

pretty easily let me give it a try I
thought<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.440> was<00:01:45.560> kind<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.770> ugly<00:01:45.890> but

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.880 

sometimes<00:01:49.920> forum<00:01:50.400> takes<00:01:51.770> precedence<00:01:52.770> over

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
sometimes forum takes precedence over

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:07.070 
sometimes forum takes precedence over
fashion<00:01:58.490> again<00:01:59.490> attending

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.600 

and<00:02:07.650> bang<00:02:07.920> you're<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.370> hitch

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.810 

you<00:02:11.180> can<00:02:11.300> see<00:02:11.480> because<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.220> not<00:02:13.220> engaged

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
you can see because this is not engaged

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.460 
you can see because this is not engaged
it's<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.150> neutral<00:02:14.450> position<00:02:14.480> as<00:02:15.230> soon<00:02:15.350> as

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
it's in the neutral position as soon as

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.640 
it's in the neutral position as soon as
I<00:02:15.560> pull<00:02:15.740> it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.369 

when<00:02:19.129> you<00:02:19.220> get<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.810> achieve<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.230> oil

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
when you get that achieve on that oil

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.610 
when you get that achieve on that oil
like<00:02:21.680> blushing<00:02:21.920> engaging<00:02:23.349> see<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.530> this

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
like blushing engaging see that this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.580 
like blushing engaging see that this
looks<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:25.780> I'm<00:02:26.780> getting<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.140> tricky<00:02:27.409> spot

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590

here

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.210 

very<00:02:36.240> nice<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.740> even<00:02:38.100> better

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
very nice it's actually even better

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.790 
very nice it's actually even better
because<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.760> doesn't<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:40.380> don't<00:02:40.560> have<00:02:40.680> to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
because it doesn't you don't have to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.020 
because it doesn't you don't have to
pull<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.010> fire-dependent<00:02:43.880> normally<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
pull this fire-dependent normally the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.590 
pull this fire-dependent normally the
hitch<00:02:45.210> would<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.630> hit<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.960> rope<00:02:46.110> wrench

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
hitch would have to hit the rope wrench

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:59.630 
hitch would have to hit the rope wrench
it<00:02:48.600> doesn't<00:02:56.390> when<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.750> CT<00:02:58.140> fix<00:02:58.640> because

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
it doesn't when I get the CT fix because

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.200 
it doesn't when I get the CT fix because
then<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.090> mount<00:03:00.270> this<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> middle<00:03:02.210> my

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
then I can mount this in the middle my

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.330 
then I can mount this in the middle my
rope<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.540> run<00:03:03.690> behind<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.740> my<00:03:04.860> cords<00:03:05.220> up

a little bit when I was tending slack in
the<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.080> would<00:03:32.440> would<00:03:32.590> end<00:03:32.739> up<00:03:32.860> down<00:03:33.069> here<00:03:34.379> so

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
the I would would end up down here so

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.690 
the I would would end up down here so
with<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> double<00:03:35.830> fisherman's<00:03:36.010> they<00:03:36.370> lock<00:03:36.519> up

tight<00:03:36.910> under<00:03:37.269> under<00:03:37.900> pressure<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:38.950> they<00:03:39.069> don't

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
tight under under pressure so they don't

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:48.809 
tight under under pressure so they don't
move

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.500
