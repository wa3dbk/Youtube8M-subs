here's<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> head<00:00:26.160> unit<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:27.630> Kenwood<00:00:28.109> KDC

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
here's the head unit with Kenwood KDC

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.030 
here's the head unit with Kenwood KDC
252<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:30.710> Pandora

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I'll pause for a minute and here's the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.439 
I'll pause for a minute and here's the
subs<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.600> itself<00:00:55.940> as<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.360> these

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
subs there itself as you can see these

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.619 
subs there itself as you can see these
wires<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.800> hidden

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
wires here that's going to be hidden

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
wires here that's going to be hidden
possibly<00:01:00.629> thinking<00:01:00.960> about<00:01:01.219> building<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
possibly thinking about building and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
possibly thinking about building and
basically<00:01:03.359> enclosing<00:01:04.140> these<00:01:04.290> subs<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.860> than

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
basically enclosing these subs more than

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
basically enclosing these subs more than
what<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.570> whole<00:01:06.780> wall

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
what they are just make one whole wall

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.190 
what they are just make one whole wall
maybe<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.770> couple<00:01:08.420> eighths<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.689> something<00:01:10.110> up

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
maybe a couple eighths or something up

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.780 
maybe a couple eighths or something up
in<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> corners<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:12.049> this<00:01:13.049> was<00:01:13.260> done<00:01:13.790> took

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
in the corners but this was done took

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
in the corners but this was done took
about<00:01:15.030> half<00:01:15.090> hour<00:01:15.540> before<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.020> had<00:01:16.110> begun<00:01:16.380> man

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
about half hour before we had begun man

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.109 
about half hour before we had begun man
that<00:01:17.610> amp<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> getting<00:01:18.659> warm<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.320> uh<00:01:19.939> here<00:01:20.939> we
