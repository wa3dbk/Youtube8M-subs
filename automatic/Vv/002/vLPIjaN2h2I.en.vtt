kind<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> disappointed<00:01:49.890> he<00:01:49.979> didn't<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.250> any

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460

leg<00:01:50.610> printing<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.210> guess<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.200> wouldn't<00:01:52.380> make

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
leg printing I guess it wouldn't make

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
leg printing I guess it wouldn't make
much<00:01:52.649> sense<00:01:52.860> there's<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.670> show

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
much sense there's not much to show

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
much sense there's not much to show
there<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.380> other<00:01:55.500> figures

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
were getting it so I kind of thought it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.990 
were getting it so I kind of thought it
would<00:01:57.509> happen<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.869> maybe<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
would happen but maybe not so it it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.760 
would happen but maybe not so it it
