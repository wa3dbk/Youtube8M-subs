closer to ten so there we go
half<00:04:43.730> half<00:04:44.730> deduction<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.720> wait<00:04:45.900> right<00:04:46.110> there

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
half half deduction and wait right there

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.780 
half half deduction and wait right there
alone<00:04:46.590> so<00:04:46.860> this<00:04:47.010> thing<00:04:47.190> should<00:04:47.520> be<00:04:47.550> pretty

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
alone so this thing should be pretty

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.630 
alone so this thing should be pretty
good<00:04:48.090> should<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.080> fairly<00:04:49.320> stable

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
good should be fairly stable

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.250 
good should be fairly stable
the<00:04:50.940> only<00:04:51.090> thing<00:04:51.330> might<00:04:51.780> be<00:04:51.960> a<00:04:51.990> little

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the only thing might be a little

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.350 
the only thing might be a little
concerned<00:04:52.770> about<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.340> this<00:04:53.940> it's<00:04:54.180> just

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
concerned about is this it's just

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.230

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
hilling with it but I don't think it'll

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.100 
hilling with it but I don't think it'll
really<00:04:58.710> be<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> problem<00:04:59.190> seeing<00:04:59.550> how<00:04:59.670> these<00:05:00.110> two
