00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.770 
right here all we gotta do is to pull it
out<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.360> bathroom

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
out I'm actually in my bathroom

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120 
out I'm actually in my bathroom
recording<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> store

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
recording this right now to the store

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.820 
recording this right now to the store
going<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.970> Texas<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.259> lights<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.650> cut

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
going on in Texas and the lights are cut

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.499 
going on in Texas and the lights are cut
out<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.130> everyone<00:01:20.640> using<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.590> bathroom<00:01:22.590> light

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
out of everyone using the bathroom light

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
out of everyone using the bathroom light
then<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.840> guess<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.560> we<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then I guess this is just if we put it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
then I guess this is just if we put it
up<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> video<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.460> put<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> TV<00:01:27.240> or

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
up to video or put it up to TV or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
up to video or put it up to TV or
something<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:28.409> not<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.650> sure

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
something like that I'm not really sure

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
something like that I'm not really sure
how<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.070> works<00:01:29.400> yet<00:01:29.610> there's<00:01:30.000> my<00:01:30.180> first

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
how that works yet there's my first

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.690 
how that works yet there's my first
camcorder<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.619> myself<00:01:31.860> I'm

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
camcorder that actually first myself I'm

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
camcorder that actually first myself I'm
assuming<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> adapter<00:01:34.020> port<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.070> USB

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
assuming that's the adapter port a USB

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.069 
assuming that's the adapter port a USB
charger<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> charger<00:01:36.780> itself

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
charger and this is the charger itself

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.230 
charger and this is the charger itself
right<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.189> here<00:01:38.250> seems<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> be

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
right here and right here seems to be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
right here and right here seems to be
the<00:01:40.110> battery<00:01:40.500> pack<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> charge<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the battery pack you know you charge the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
the battery pack you know you charge the
