what double lugging there is possible

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
what double lugging there is possible
but<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.200> they<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> double<00:01:46.920> legendary<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
but if they got a double legendary and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.399 
but if they got a double legendary and
then<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.090> got<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> Ronon<00:01:48.780> helmet<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.170> well

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
then they got to Ronon helmet as well

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
then they got to Ronon helmet as well
over<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.860> weekend<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:50.939> be<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
over the weekend then that would be a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
over the weekend then that would be a
legit<00:01:51.540> triple<00:01:52.020> legendary<00:01:52.650> but<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
legit triple legendary but out of the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.460 
legit triple legendary but out of the
three<00:01:53.640> guns<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.180> have<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.840> items

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
three guns that they have here and items

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.069 
three guns that they have here and items
I<00:01:55.650> do<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.220> think<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.790> actually<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.509> real

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
I do not think this is actually a real

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.590 
I do not think this is actually a real
Supply<00:01:58.770> Drop<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.310> that's<00:01:59.850> pretty<00:02:00.150> much<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
Supply Drop so that's pretty much it for

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
Supply Drop so that's pretty much it for
this<00:02:00.720> video<00:02:01.110> guys<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.799> tell<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.610> real

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
this video guys and tell me if it's real

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.480 
this video guys and tell me if it's real
fake<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> comments<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.710> personally

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
fake in the comments and I personally

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.060 
fake in the comments and I personally
think<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:05.970> fake<00:02:06.299> but<00:02:06.720> especially<00:02:07.530> since

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
think it's fake but especially since

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.249 
think it's fake but especially since
there<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.250> no<00:02:08.340> video<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.600> video<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
there was no video if there was video I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.990 
there was no video if there was video I
feel<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.769> you<00:02:10.890> could<00:02:11.040> still<00:02:11.370> make<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.790> fake

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
feel like you could still make it fake

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
feel like you could still make it fake
but<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.570> wouldn't<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:12.959> as<00:02:13.049> clean<00:02:13.350> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but it just wouldn't be as clean this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.470 
but it just wouldn't be as clean this
one<00:02:13.769> was<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.130> edited<00:02:14.640> pretty<00:02:14.970> clean<00:02:15.269> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
one was really edited pretty clean and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.350 
one was really edited pretty clean and
done<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.380> photoshop<00:02:17.220> most<00:02:17.430> likely<00:02:17.850> so

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
done with photoshop most likely so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.840 
done with photoshop most likely so
whoever<00:02:18.690> did<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.430> started

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
whoever did this you have started

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.599 
whoever did this you have started
something<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.690> obviously<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:23.010> probably

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
something so obviously it's probably

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.789 
something so obviously it's probably
most<00:02:23.820> likely<00:02:24.000> fake<00:02:24.359> and<00:02:24.690> that's<00:02:25.200> for<00:02:25.500> much<00:02:25.650> it

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
most likely fake and that's for much it

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.349 
most likely fake and that's for much it
