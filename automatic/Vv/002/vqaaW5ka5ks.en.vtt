00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.849
 right here where we get the list of 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:15.270
 The products we can add new 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.270
 products to the same in plus give enter 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.930
 we get the list and we get off we go down 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.440
 where they are 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.770
 the last product that we have degree 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.160
 the latest products all the sauces 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:36.770
 then we are going to put for example 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.770
 let's say sauce 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.079
 to the brain of the people 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.350
 we give enter 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:53.050
 it does not show an example and it has no price 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.149
 and does not have a name then that sauce 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.280
 it will not have pressure you can be 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:02.030
 if it were another product like for example 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 a malt pony we write the value 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.820
 in 1500 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.820
 but as it is not the case let's say 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.680
 we give you the zero because we change the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.650
 first name 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.830
 we go down where it says plus and we come the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.550
 keyboard again 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.550
 selection 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.100
 we started to write salsa 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980
 sauce 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 good whatever it is and already 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760
 sauce 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.409
 the department of the sauce 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.220
 if you want to put and it's not air that are not 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.220
 programming 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.330
 because if not then you can not read 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.860
 then if not some product is not 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.710
 programming we modify here to enter 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.310
 in essence 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.310
 here 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.410
 and there is a 2 to these options 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.680
 open guy 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.680
 we are like this 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.530
 we go back with him 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.689
 well then since we put the sauce 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.689
 we give people and is recorded 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.190
 skip the plus 3 as we already have it in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.450
 sauce 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.069
 the last plus every life 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.239
 or not 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.689
 we enter again the people to erase that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.689
 job 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.250
 plus 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.620
 we return 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.980
 where we go back to what we recorded when 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.840
 let's record and cut and modify a 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.370
 product since I understand it we return to you 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.370
 with this and escape keys 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.790
 we do not go out 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.230
 for example we already see was not the 30 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.230
 36 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.830
 so that change that we made that I've 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.060
 recorded inside the memory so that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.199
 when we relearn the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.680
 register 2 and that's the new data and 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.120
 I do not press appear 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.120
 we have to save 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.870
 the changes that we have made then 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 we go to mode again 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.349
 we go to mode again 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.270
 Y 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.480
 we go 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.150
 card mode 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.150
 and we give him sitting 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.749
 to keep them 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.340
 I do not remember 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:24.580
 if we are going to save here we can record 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.580
 today's sales data 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.979
 in the case that they want to go saving 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.569
 All the data of daily sales will 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.849
 give here save data from the list 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.909
 always, every day 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.789
 then we keep if we did 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.469
 modifications in the programming either 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.039
 of price or whatever 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:48.149
 we save all the programming with 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:48.149
 enter and ok
