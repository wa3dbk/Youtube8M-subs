00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.859 
while I think it's very interesting I
have<00:01:58.979> not<00:01:59.130> chosen<00:01:59.429> to<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.209> geeked<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
have not chosen to really geeked out on

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.349 
have not chosen to really geeked out on
it<00:02:01.020> instead<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.799> focus<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.490> what<00:02:02.639> looks<00:02:02.819> good<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
it instead I focus on what looks good to

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.019 
it instead I focus on what looks good to
my<00:02:03.450> eye<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.959> over<00:02:04.529> time<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.009> have<00:02:05.219> developed<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:06.029 
my eye and over time I have developed a

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.210 
my eye and over time I have developed a
sense<00:02:06.539> for<00:02:06.959> what<00:02:07.109> colors<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.499> think<00:02:07.859> look<00:02:08.039> good

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
sense for what colors I think look good

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.370 
sense for what colors I think look good
together<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.900> ability

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
together so there is I think the ability

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890 
together so there is I think the ability
to<00:02:13.590> identify<00:02:13.740> color<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.730> match<00:02:14.910> color<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to identify color and match color is a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.559 
to identify color and match color is a
skill<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:18.120> much<00:02:18.299> any<00:02:18.480> other

given state but you can improve it by
doing<00:02:26.139> exercises<00:02:27.139> by<00:02:27.290> slowing<00:02:27.590> down<00:02:27.920> by

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
doing exercises by slowing down by

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.520
