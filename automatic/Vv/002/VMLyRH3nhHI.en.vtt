00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.739
 and well hello to all the gas is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.480
 wilson came here today to 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.070
 this new video so that's going to be a 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.170
 pretty short video because the gameplay 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.640
 is basically very short and I decided 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.250
 to make a comment 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.750
 that they go with the gameplay that's at 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 say my who hold in the duration of the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.450
 gameplay 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.550
 so to start this little 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.930
 dog commentary presented the gameplay 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.960
 first of all so it's a gameplay that is going to 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.810
 unfold to the v e pr so it's a 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.820
 weapon not very used right now at 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.890
 because of his particular recoil game 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.509
 the team a silencer a quick shot 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.330
 which is really it's a killing at 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.369
 melee but by far it's a little 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.690
 pushed koussa finally brief that's what 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.160
 gameplay I 'm not telling you yet what 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.820
 it's gonna be just telling you it's in 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.990
 enraged and that's going to be a perfect 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 so here I was in attempts case m 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.660
 personally it's one of my 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.250
 best gameplay for now on 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.729
 ghost since he came out there is no 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.259
 long time 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.880
 in short I also want to say that 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.090
 this video i will send it to qg code 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.369
 is next is obviously and then that's it 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.569
 so let's start with the subject of 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.450
 this video that will still be very 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.640
 short is the gameplay on the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.289
 youtube videos then as you know 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.319
 the gameplay is right now a little 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.880
 with ghost a little below what we 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.670
 had seen on back of the ie 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.369
 more than 100 kg + 300 finally that's it 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.259
 it was a little abused anyway on goss 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.459
 why do not we have +100 kg 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.690
 of more than 100 he already because he 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.630
 just out and then because the 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.520
 strict scores are very very very 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.920
 lower in power compared to those 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.050
 of bo 2 finally it was not my subject 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 I was not going to go on is that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.440
 the gameplay here are the standards not 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.870
 I had not talked about that I had spoken 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.569
 in fact a subject that is no longer me 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.819
 staff let's say that's what he 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.700
 must the gameplay of youtube hours 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.000
 either his in fact is what he 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.980
 better 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.810
 the best is what is basically a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.000
 better gameplay but not him or a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.220
 less good gameplay of youtube hours 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 so I'll tell you everything from 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.030
 following what I think so I think 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.459
 frankly 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.980
 I prefer a gameplay of youtuber me 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.840
 already because if we are looking for someone 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.180
 who makes you the performance 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.920
 if we are on a channel we are not 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.830
 he who plays good ben we will not subscribe 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 and then it's not me 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.080
 personally it's not the gameplay 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.030
 which interests me the most 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.410
 obviously if it's all gameplay 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.870
 for one but that makes 20 deaths for 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.040
 scratch that he undermines has made him want too much of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.340
 look but if the subject interesting 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.860
 why not so here is my opinion 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.660
 and I think it's better it's a 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.230
 gameplay of a youtube hours and then 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is already because with the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.510
 gameplay we see really sees we did not 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.400
 more related with youtube hours 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.140
 ie if we want to subscribe 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.580
 to improve on call of duty on 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.680
 we see that he is bad ben voila 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.630
 if you want fun and if it's not him 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.489
 who plays we will pass subscribers finally brief 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.239
 all these little factors that are going to make 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.459
 that basically I obviously prefer a 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.170
 gameplay of a youtube hours more 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.340
 so you do not hesitate to put in 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.049
 comments if you prefer a 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.519
 big big gameplay obviously good if 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.720
 it's a huge gameplay the best 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.130
 gameplay all the time that is not of 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.730
 view but that you can have 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.230
 that's not bad too but but me 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.120
 personally I prefer a gameplay 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.280
 which was done by the commentator 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.049
 this is because already and know him well 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.459
 he knows how he did it all 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.530
 can give little tips while at 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.209
 along the video 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.470
 so here is after that said me in the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.079
 comments I have no time too much 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.880
 developed good voila me I prefer 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.310
 when it's the one who made the gameplay 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930
 who comments then do not hesitate to 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.950
 put in the comments your opinion 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.470
 if you disagree 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.570
 do not hesitate to argue because 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.709
 this is me I argued a little when 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.480
 even good I do not have much time to 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.280
 loading anyway so avoid this 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.799
 kind of insults or others like that 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.190
 so that's the video is over soon 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.440

 and still not badly developed and then 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.080
