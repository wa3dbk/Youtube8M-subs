00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.859
 Hi, I'm Marcos Cossoy, professor of motorcycle mechanics and electronics at the 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.590
 Technological Institute of Automotive Training 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.619
 in today's video we will see how to change the brake fluid to a motorcycle 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:42.050
 remove the brake reservoir cap 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:51.809
 with extreme care that no liquid falls because the same stain 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:10.640
 With a syringe we will remove the liquid from the brake reservoir 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:22.570
 we load the tank with new liquid 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.690
 We are going to place a 6 mm hose in the caliper trap by placing previously 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:45.290
 a key of 10 in the same 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.340
 the 6 mm hose is going to be placed inside a tank so that when I 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.110
 start to draw the fluid from the system the same go to the tank 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.900
 In order to remove the fluid from the system we will start to pump the brake 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.369
 we put the lid 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.939
 we started to pump 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.790
 we pump three times 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420
 we hold the brake tight 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.480
 and we loosen the trap 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.950
 we re-tighten the bleeder without releasing the brake and start pumping again 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:49.330
 in this way the new liquid is entering the circuit and is sweeping the old liquid 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.510
 I loosen the bleeder back without releasing the brake 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.860
 I return to tighten the trap 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.400
 pumping three times 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.720
 I loosen the trap 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920
 I press again 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.680
 and I repeat this sequence until I see the new liquid that is coming out of the hose 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.599
 once the liquid change process is finished 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:27.770
 We complete the liquid level in the tank 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:40.610
 we put the lid 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.430
 you have to keep in mind always respect the type of liquid that should go on each motorcycle 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.120
 We will find the information of this type in the user manual or in the manual of 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.269
 workshop 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.880
 this was another video from ITCA TV, I hope it has been useful, see you 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.630
 in the next 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.750
 ITCA, forming your future.
