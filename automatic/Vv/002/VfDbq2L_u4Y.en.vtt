00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
Duff Beer boxers and I just thought

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
Duff Beer boxers and I just thought
these<00:00:44.610> were<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.059> cute<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> easy<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.530> sleep

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.459 
and that's like what souvenirs are for
so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.520> thought<00:00:50.850> these<00:00:51.000> were<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> very<00:00:51.449> good<00:00:51.840> sign
