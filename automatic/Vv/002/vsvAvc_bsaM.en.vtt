00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
wanting to organize a date night for my

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.420 
wanting to organize a date night for my
husband<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> have<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> suggestion<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.370> a

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
husband do you have a suggestion for a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.650 
boy style night that I won't hate this
obviously<00:02:25.430> depends<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> guy<00:02:26.300> but<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.600> think

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
obviously depends on the guy but I think

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.300 
obviously depends on the guy but I think
the<00:02:26.990> most<00:02:27.170> important<00:02:27.590> thing<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:27.980> just

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the most important thing is to just

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.370 
the most important thing is to just
think<00:02:28.460> about<00:02:28.610> things<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:29.120> he<00:02:29.360> likes<00:02:29.660> or<00:02:29.930> that

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
think about things that he likes or that

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.580 
think about things that he likes or that
could<00:02:30.530> even<00:02:30.770> be<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.280> convenience<00:02:32.150> factor<00:02:32.600> so<00:02:33.200> if

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
could even be a convenience factor so if

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.040 
could even be a convenience factor so if
I<00:02:33.740> were<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:34.040> planning<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.520> date<00:02:34.730> night<00:02:34.880> for

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
I were to be planning a date night for

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
I were to be planning a date night for
Jeffrey<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.260> would<00:02:36.770> make<00:02:37.100> sure<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.880> either

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
Jeffrey I would make sure that I either

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.420 
Jeffrey I would make sure that I either
would<00:02:38.540> drive<00:02:38.840> or<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.620> we<00:02:39.740> wouldn't<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.220> an

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
would drive or that we wouldn't get an

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.920 
would drive or that we wouldn't get an
uber<00:02:40.730> for<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.030> night<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.480> he<00:02:41.750> wouldn't

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
uber for the night so that he wouldn't

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.170 
uber for the night so that he wouldn't
have<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.290> worry<00:02:42.530> about<00:02:42.640> all<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.970> driving

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
have to worry about all of the driving

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.220 
have to worry about all of the driving
because<00:02:44.390> that's<00:02:44.600> usually<00:02:44.900> something<00:02:44.930> that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
because that's usually something that

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.050 
because that's usually something that
falls<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.680> his<00:02:45.830> shoulders<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.430> would<00:02:46.880> then<00:02:47.030> take

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
falls on his shoulders I would then take

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.480 
falls on his shoulders I would then take
him<00:02:47.480> someplace<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:48.260> he<00:02:48.590> would<00:02:48.860> love<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.160> go

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
him someplace that he would love to go

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.240 
him someplace that he would love to go
to<00:02:49.790> eat<00:02:50.090> barbecue<00:02:50.630> is<00:02:51.110> his<00:02:51.260> favorite<00:02:51.590> spot<00:02:51.860> I'm

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
to eat barbecue is his favorite spot I'm

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
to eat barbecue is his favorite spot I'm
down<00:02:52.580> with<00:02:52.610> it<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.420> manage<00:02:53.690> there<00:02:53.930> I'm

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
down with it so I can manage there I'm

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.570 
down with it so I can manage there I'm
really<00:02:54.380> big<00:02:54.530> into<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.800> size<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.280> mac<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
really big into the size the mac and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.730 
really big into the size the mac and
cheese<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.940> can<00:02:56.060> get<00:02:56.209> behind<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.590> think

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
cheese I can get behind and then I think

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.650 
cheese I can get behind and then I think
it's<00:02:57.860> all<00:02:57.950> about<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.580> compromise<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.450> don't

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
it's all about a compromise you don't

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.510 
it's all about a compromise you don't
have<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.840> go<00:02:59.930> see<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.230> craziest<00:03:00.650> sci-fi<00:03:01.130> movie

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
have to go see the craziest sci-fi movie

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.010 
have to go see the craziest sci-fi movie
that's<00:03:01.820> what<00:03:02.060> he<00:03:02.150> would<00:03:02.240> want<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.480> do<00:03:02.600> but

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
that's what he would want to do but

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.120 
that's what he would want to do but
something<00:03:03.380> that's<00:03:03.560> kind<00:03:03.800> of<00:03:03.830> an<00:03:03.950> in-between

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
something that's kind of an in-between

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.949 
something that's kind of an in-between
something<00:03:05.000> that<00:03:05.090> he's<00:03:05.240> been<00:03:05.390> wanting<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.690> see

something that he's been wanting to see

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.990 
something that he's been wanting to see
an<00:03:06.200> action<00:03:06.650> flick<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.250> always<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.610> good<00:03:07.970> option

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
an action flick is always a good option

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.120 
an action flick is always a good option
so<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.720> think<00:03:08.990> it's<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.200> about<00:03:09.410> figuring<00:03:09.980> out

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
so I think it's just about figuring out

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.750 
so I think it's just about figuring out
