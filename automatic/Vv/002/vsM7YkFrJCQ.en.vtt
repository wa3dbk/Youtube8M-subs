00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi from we were a look for you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.750
 that you can go to school or work 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.529
 and that you have less activity time 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.090
 costs 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.370
 it is therefore also a very simple book 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 with very few products 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 I use less than ten products and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.100
 only one eye shadow 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.840
 Of course we think we are very much around it 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.980
 invent your other house renting pencil 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.080
 you can do it a second time 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.420
 using eyeshadow can be another bronzer 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.119
 but I decided to use it that way 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 keep it as simple as possible for me and everything 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.750
 minimal products to use that 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.300
 after all, you are the fastest 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.120
 it is a delicious and fresh look 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.680
 beautiful soft pink tones and I hope so 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760
 you like it and have fun with it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 look 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 I use the catrice all as a foundation 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 matt plus foundation and I have one myself 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 color 010 in like this and this is mine 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.800
 favorite budget foundation he costs 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.640
 I think 5 or 6 euros and is for sale 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.820
 at herb barrel 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.410
 and for me the best budget 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 foundation dear currently in the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 stores 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770
 and I use about a bowl until 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 my hand i got it out with a beauty 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 blender 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.630
 This happens to be a beauty blender 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.939
 a bid but also 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.500
 patries has one and a lot 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 drugstore making have recently become too 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 one is enough sponges 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.799
 to be found for less 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.990
 money to the original beauty blender that 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.310
 I think it costs 20 euros per pound 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.439
 use as much for nation as you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.390
 I need this myself I have one 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 desk the uneven skin so I use 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.409
 self-enrichment of these markets from 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.409
 you do n't have beautiful skin yourself 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 so very much for this skip than this one 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.329
 steps or by less foundation because 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.610
 I now use concealer for this but this 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.270
 the culture comes with Flemish cream 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.770
 010 color again and you remains 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.409
 patries simply has the best budget 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.729
 foundations english irish so this is for sure 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.049
 one of my favorite things a bit 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.150
 Evenings my eyes and covers spots 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.550
 that I have 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.890
 day powder my favorite budget powder 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.950
 is picking up again trys it's a prime 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.560
 and fine with pain, the test gets older and older 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.600
 Its transparent powder to just you 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.200
 skin a little bit and i know one 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.970
 bit eligible to have a nose of mine 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.680
 glasses would soon come to an eye a 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 little below side meets where 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.550
 the fat is not further 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.800
 I have fairly dry skin at the moment 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.180
 so rather not too much powder 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.680
 then I go to work with eyebrows 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.030
 are actually eyebrow for me 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 very important even though I have one 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.840
 very simple look i always do my 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.489
 eyebrows it just that little bit more 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 definition of my face 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.760
 especially if you have glasses it is anyway 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.450
 very beautiful more eyebrows though 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480
 to do 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.739
 and I use the nyc brewer for that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.989
 sam kit 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.989
 in the color 876 green at 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.970
 I always put the line here first 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.830
 I tilt the box then begin 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.840
 the base 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.070
 and then I fill in the first part 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.260
 but only if you wipe it out 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:05.130
 then I leave it that way then I start 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.709
 first on the tail now I pull one 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.660
 a do so why then work already starts 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.790
 nice dividing the color a bit 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.790
 here to make sharp light 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.930
 time for the eye look to myself when I go to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.799
 school must or should or I have 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.540
 rush 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.950
 then I just go people quickly 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.690
 for once eye shadow delicious 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.360
 easy and yet with a little something 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
 more color on your eyes or freshness 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.810
 one of my favorite color in the spring 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 for my eyes is a light one 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.540
 highlighter color should only be good 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.549
 moving eyelid 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.019
 then it radiates just a little more but me there 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.860
 very little work of it is really in one 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.630
 seconds beep 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.220
 what I do then is loan what 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.209
 eye shadow base to this is the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:51.329
 eye shadow pan and sometimes the ai becoming 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:57.200
 and simply print a few dots on it 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.200
 my eyelids this a bit off 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.520
 and then a flat brush and mine 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.080
 eye shadow 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.260
 today I'm going for this light 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.750
 white eye shadow of eleven and I bring it 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.320
 only on my moving eyelid and 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.460
 a bit in the inner corner of the eye 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.280
 possibly just something below you 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.900
 eyebrow and that's it within 25 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.220
 seconds are done 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.720
 then finish with mascara 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.760
 and then you will see me and you will return 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.200
 for the rest must face 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.720
 I applied that mascara to the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.080
 upper and lower lashes 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.600
