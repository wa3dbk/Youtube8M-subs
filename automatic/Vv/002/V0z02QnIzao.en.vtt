00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
basic because you only use one hot key

basic because you only use one hot key
to<00:00:34.670> places<00:00:35.750> you<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> four<00:00:37.410> players

second one is f h and an L right I'm

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
second one is f h and an L right I'm
going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> use<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.530> red<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.369> gonna

going to use the red one so I'm gonna

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to use the red one so I'm gonna
use<00:01:11.520> F<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.240> depends<00:01:13.140> how<00:01:13.290> long<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.710> hold<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
use F and depends how long you hold the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
use F and depends how long you hold the
hockey

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
hockey

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
hockey
and<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.979> quadrant<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.549> land<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.210> the

and what quadrant you land on that's the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
and what quadrant you land on that's the
units<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.869> will<00:01:19.020> create<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.579> see<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> ship

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
units you will create so you see my ship

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.969 
units you will create so you see my ship
is<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.479> red<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.899> I'm<00:01:22.079> not<00:01:22.200> filling<00:01:22.649> in<00:01:22.740> right

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
is the red one I'm not filling in right

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
is the red one I'm not filling in right
now<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> middle<00:01:24.539> that<00:01:24.659> there's<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
now and in the middle that there's this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.610 
now and in the middle that there's this
little

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
little

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.350 
little
I<00:01:26.740> guess<00:01:27.160> progress<00:01:27.730> bar<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:27.940> don't<00:01:28.180> know<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
I guess progress bar I don't know you

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.270 
I guess progress bar I don't know you
called<00:01:28.600> us<00:01:28.750> but<00:01:29.020> if<00:01:29.710> you're<00:01:29.890> not<00:01:29.980> building

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
called us but if you're not building

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.030 
called us but if you're not building
anything<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:30.760> thing<00:01:30.910> will<00:01:31.030> queue<00:01:31.300> up<00:01:32.040> and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
anything that thing will queue up and

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.640 
anything that thing will queue up and
you<00:01:33.160> can<00:01:33.280> actually<00:01:33.400> build<00:01:33.820> units<00:01:34.650> quicker

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
you can actually build units quicker

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.310 
you can actually build units quicker
that<00:01:35.800> way<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.880> even<00:01:37.870> though<00:01:37.960> I'm<00:01:38.020> giving

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
that way right even though I'm giving

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.380 
that way right even though I'm giving
him<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.650> head<00:01:39.010> start<00:01:39.040> here<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.850> can<00:01:40.270> actually

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
him a head start here I can actually

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.320 
him a head start here I can actually
feel<00:01:40.570> like<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.340> three<00:01:42.640> different<00:01:42.850> units

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
feel like you have three different units

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.540 
feel like you have three different units
so<00:01:43.510> if<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:43.840> want<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.050> build<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.320> freighter<00:01:44.620> is<00:01:45.010> the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
so if I want to build a freighter is the

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.940 
so if I want to build a freighter is the
third<00:01:45.790> quadrant<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.570> collaborator<00:01:47.290> you

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
third quadrant in a collaborator you

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.950 
third quadrant in a collaborator you
want<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.160> make<00:01:48.220> those<00:01:48.370> little<00:01:48.460> ones<00:01:48.880> they<00:01:49.750> call

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
want to make those little ones they call

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800 
want to make those little ones they call
them<00:01:50.250> fighters<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.610> think<00:01:52.030> their<00:01:52.150> planes<00:01:52.450> or

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
them fighters I think their planes or

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.440 
them fighters I think their planes or
both<00:01:53.080> i'm<00:01:53.290> not<00:01:53.410> sure<00:01:53.620> exactly<00:01:54.100> what<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.430> is<00:01:54.460> but

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
both i'm not sure exactly what it is but

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.370 
both i'm not sure exactly what it is but
looks<00:01:56.110> like<00:01:56.200> pleased<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.740> me<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:59.050> middle

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
looks like pleased to me and the middle

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.070 
looks like pleased to me and the middle
one<00:01:59.530> is<00:01:59.560> for<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.550> bomb<00:02:00.760> or<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.300> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
one is for the bomb or so the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
mind aeroplanes well rock paper scissors

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.100 
mind aeroplanes well rock paper scissors
like<00:02:26.380> I<00:02:26.470> said<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.760> last<00:02:28.000> one<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:29.080> last

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
like I said and the last one the last

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.960 
like I said and the last one the last
quadrant<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.860> actually<00:02:30.130> for<00:02:30.340> upgrades<00:02:30.730> not

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
quadrant is actually for upgrades not

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.390 
quadrant is actually for upgrades not
four<00:02:31.510> units<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.590> see<00:02:32.739> let<00:02:32.890> me<00:02:32.920> go<00:02:33.100> do<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
four units so you see let me go do the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340 
four units so you see let me go do the
upgrades<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.820> no<00:02:33.970> there<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> go

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
upgrades or no there you go

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.310 
upgrades or no there you go
let<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:35.710> go<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:37.180> guess<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> upgrades<00:02:38.050> for

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
let it go and I guess the upgrades for

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.570 
let it go and I guess the upgrades for
maybe

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.360 

progress<00:02:43.360> bar<00:02:43.800> quicker<00:02:44.800> I'm<00:02:44.890> not<00:02:45.040> exactly

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
progress bar quicker I'm not exactly

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.610 
progress bar quicker I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:45.580> that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.459 

you<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.760> appraisal<00:02:50.760> afraid

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.469 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.500 

so<00:02:54.469> game<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.250> can<00:02:55.430> actually<00:02:55.579> control<00:02:56.329> your

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
so game you can actually control your

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.050 
so game you can actually control your
units<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.109> thus<00:02:57.349> automatic<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.609> can't<00:02:58.849> say<00:02:59.030> oh

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
units is thus automatic you can't say oh

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.580 
units is thus automatic you can't say oh
yeah<00:02:59.420> all<00:02:59.659> of<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.900> attack<00:03:00.200> because<00:03:00.439> in<00:03:00.560> one

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
yeah all of you attack because in one

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
yeah all of you attack because in one
unit<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.549> doesn't<00:03:01.879> work<00:03:01.909> that<00:03:02.030> way<00:03:02.359> you<00:03:02.420> can't

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
unit it doesn't work that way you can't

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.520 
unit it doesn't work that way you can't
control<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.349> you<00:03:03.530> know

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
control that you know

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.130 
control that you know
you<00:03:06.340> know<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.900> units<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.050> build<00:03:08.319> us<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:10.140> so

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
you know the units we build us it so

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.780 
you know the units we build us it so
they<00:03:11.350> do<00:03:11.410> have<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> little<00:03:11.920> strategy<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.610> so

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
they do have a little strategy but so

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.850 
they do have a little strategy but so
very<00:03:12.819> basic<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:14.200> wish<00:03:14.380> someone<00:03:14.590> would<00:03:14.830> just

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
very basic and I wish someone would just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.740 
very basic and I wish someone would just
take<00:03:15.340> up<00:03:15.520> even<00:03:16.060> at<00:03:16.240> work<00:03:16.630> yeah

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750
