00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 Amen 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.110
 good to all and welcome to a new 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.050
 video in fall sandro now we bring you a 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.590
 short video that we hope you will be 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.939
 useful and is the best and worst of the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.339
 sony xperia z 2 that we have here in front 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.789
 let's go quickie the best is the 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.280
 fluency that is a snapdragon 801 with 3 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.519
 gb of ram is not the maximum speed that 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.159
 we have seen in the processor but without 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.219
 But in the sony layer hesperia 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.350
 launcher since we know that it overloads 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.170
 little the terminal and that its 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 it works well enough 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 good 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.900
 the three gigabytes of ram make the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.540
 which are they works well enough 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.030
 in multitasking we can have applications 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.010
 very heavy and loaded games and not 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 we will have any kind of problems in 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.530
 move from one to the other practically without 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.020
 applications closes so then the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.660
 terminal optimization is really 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.540
 good another good point that has to please 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.450
 of your camera is a 20.7 camera 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.400
 megapixels has trick because the mode 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.410
 automatic as we see that that car in it 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600
 Automatically activates automatically 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.760
 superior as only 8 is allowed 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
 megapixel though as if 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.390
 we activate the manual mode then in the mode 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.660
 manual if we have has the possibility 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.390
 to reach 20 as 7 megapixels in 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.540
 four thirds is always a camera 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.530
 good has good brightness 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.590
 works well both abroad and 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.720
 in how indoors in colors 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.700
 perhaps in low light they are a bit flat 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.119
 but in studies if they have good 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.680
 saturation and then the truth is that both 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.440
 in photography as in video that has 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 ability to record 4k video because it's a 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.760
 pretty good camera 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 is that of the actor this year but 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.390
 probably 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.260
 Another point in favor is that of autonomy 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.090
 they are 3200 milliamperes of batteries but 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.750
 gets approximately between 20 and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.820
 24 hours of autonomy with about 5 hours 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.060
 screen at least in the use that I have 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.130
 given here and that without counting the mode 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.150
 this line you already know they are and has a 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.350
 battery optimization mode that is 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.210
 the stamina mode that then follows 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 multiply practically by two to 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.680
 Although when the screen is 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.960
 off cuts the data and allows only 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.610
 sporadic connections and others but without 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.070
 doubt because autonomy is another of the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.400
 strong points which is the worst thing that has 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.620
 the east are experience 2 as you have 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.140
 the accumulation of failures that we come 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.330
 claiming sonny to fix from 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.690
 already several models have the 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 materials we see that it is a coverage of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.430
 plastic both the glass plastic 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.470
 in the back full and the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 frontal even surpassing what is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.560
 the screen itself and it's a fighter 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.240
 traces as we see, even though 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.920
 then in operation 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.440
 whether it has fingerprints or not 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.960
 the use interferes but it remains 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.400
 quite unsightly apart from the fact 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.620
 that coverage for glass 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.810
 do and finish is fragile and that therefore 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.360
 in a fall and so on it is very 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.790
 simple that the screen moving the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.070
 part of the screen or the back 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.350
 so then at this point is a point 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.450
 in a negative point 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.690
 another bad point the screen despite 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.890
 which is full hd of 5.2 inches as the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.410
 viewing angles are not too 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.930
 good this is the fault of the of the 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.310
 room technology and mobile mobile 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.040
 bravia engine 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.459
 we see that the visibility variation is 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.459
 remarkable 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.680
 and even if it is used whenever it is 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.650
 good front, it is a point to improve 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.030
 and especially since outdoors, that 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.650
 combination of footprints with the fact 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.079
 that is not a very visible screen in 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.480
 outside because it makes it maybe one of 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:10.510
 the one of the weak points and the last 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.150
 point and the last criticism this terminal 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.340
 is the size is a terminal 52 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.810
 inches that is how we see with the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.310
 screen on, it has a lot 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.470
 frame at the top and in the part 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.860
 inferior on the edges is also not 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.449
 too fine tuned and they are 5.2 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.490
 inches that however it has 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.430
 basically the same size as axis 3 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.490
 that are 5.5 inches so that we 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.660
 let's make the idea that maybe then the 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.000
 design can be improved in this sense 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.320
 we hope that these points have been 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.420
 Usefulness that you know a little bit more 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.240
 of the g2 if you have not had a chance 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.700
 to try it and if yes, if you consider that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.710
 there are more positive or negative aspects 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.560
 of the terminal then you have the comments 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.920
 both youtube and android fax a 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.920
 greeting
