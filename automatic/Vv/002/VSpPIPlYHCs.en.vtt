okay<00:00:05.580> we<00:00:05.730> smoked<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.150> brisket<00:00:06.540> about<00:00:06.780> two

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
okay we smoked the brisket about two

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.299 
okay we smoked the brisket about two
2210<00:00:08.389> and<00:00:09.410> hickory<00:00:10.410> smoked<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:11.040> five

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
2210 and hickory smoked for about five

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.650 
2210 and hickory smoked for about five
hours<00:00:11.660> brought<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:12.750> in<00:00:12.870> put<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.660> bag

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
hours brought it in put it in a bag

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.730 
hours brought it in put it in a bag
called<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.170> POC<00:00:16.860> saber<00:00:17.099> bag<00:00:17.900> which<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.080> good<00:00:19.380> for

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
called a POC saber bag which is good for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.420 
called a POC saber bag which is good for
about<00:00:20.130> 40<00:00:20.580> degrees<00:00:20.690> and<00:00:21.770> stuff<00:00:22.770> inside<00:00:22.949> there

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
about 40 degrees and stuff inside there

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
about 40 degrees and stuff inside there
and<00:00:23.750> then<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.900> wrap<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.350> saran<00:00:25.560> wrap<00:00:25.920> real

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and then we wrap it in saran wrap real

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.400 
and then we wrap it in saran wrap real
tight<00:00:26.600> and<00:00:27.680> put<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.070> temperature<00:00:29.340> probe<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
tight and put the temperature probe in

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.490 
tight and put the temperature probe in
we're<00:00:31.410> gonna<00:00:31.500> unwrap<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.859> now<00:00:32.010> put<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.940> tray

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
we're gonna unwrap it now put on tray

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500 
we're gonna unwrap it now put on tray
very<00:00:34.500> important<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.129> some<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:35.970> sides<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
very important to some of the sides and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
very important to some of the sides and
the<00:00:37.200> footing<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.620> 200<00:00:38.010> 5<00:00:38.250> degrees

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the footing have about 200 5 degrees

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
the footing have about 200 5 degrees
until<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:39.899> internal<00:00:40.620> temperature

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
until it got to a internal temperature

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.530 
until it got to a internal temperature
of<00:00:41.130> 210<00:00:41.700> degrees<00:00:42.440> took<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.649> unwrapped<00:00:44.130> it

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
of 210 degrees took it out unwrapped it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.200 
of 210 degrees took it out unwrapped it
punished<00:00:45.540> left<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.559> then<00:00:47.460> let<00:00:47.880> it<00:00:47.969> rest<00:00:48.120> for

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
punished left and then let it rest for

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
punished left and then let it rest for
10<00:00:48.480> minutes<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
10 minutes and now we're going to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.869 
10 minutes and now we're going to
separate<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.030> blade<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.879> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
separate the blade from the point the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.319 
separate the blade from the point the
blade<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> flat<00:00:55.050> part<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:56.329> then

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
blade is a kind of a flat part and then

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.670 
blade is a kind of a flat part and then
the<00:00:57.420> point<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> gnarly<00:00:58.200> thing<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the point is this gnarly thing with a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
the point is this gnarly thing with a
lot<00:00:58.860> of<00:00:58.890> fat<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.660> blade<00:01:01.230> runs

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
lot of fat in it now the the blade runs

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.189 
lot of fat in it now the the blade runs
across<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.070> bottom<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> run<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:04.020> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
across the bottom but it run then the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.670 
across the bottom but it run then the
point<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:05.160> up<00:01:05.399> here<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:06.420> gnarly<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
point is up here really gnarly but it

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.650 
point is up here really gnarly but it
runs<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.039> as<00:01:08.130> diagonal<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:08.910> we're<00:01:09.509> going<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
runs it as diagonal so we're going to

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.190 
runs it as diagonal so we're going to
find<00:01:09.959> the<00:01:10.140> fat<00:01:10.920> line<00:01:11.190> between<00:01:11.459> the<00:01:11.759> two<00:01:12.200> runs

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
find the fat line between the two runs

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.249 
find the fat line between the two runs
out<00:01:13.319> that<00:01:13.530> way<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.690> run<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> some

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
out that way and then just run it some

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
out that way and then just run it some
path<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.590> least<00:01:16.709> resistance<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
path of least resistance and it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.940 
path of least resistance and it
separates<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.690> cuts<00:01:21.929> of<00:01:22.050> meat<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.440> they're

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
separates two cuts of meat and they're

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.279 
separates two cuts of meat and they're
separated<00:01:23.399> now<00:01:23.810> okay<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:24.959> to<00:01:25.020> cut<00:01:25.170> some

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
separated now okay I'm going to cut some

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.469 
separated now okay I'm going to cut some
of<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.440> fat<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:25.679> here<00:01:26.069> it's<00:01:26.190> there's<00:01:26.849> a<00:01:27.000> layer

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
of the fat off here it's there's a layer

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.449 
of the fat off here it's there's a layer
of<00:01:27.599> fat<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.929> here<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:29.190> not

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
of fat in here that just is not

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.830 
of fat in here that just is not
necessary<00:01:32.149> yeah<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.330> got<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> little<00:01:33.630> bit

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
necessary yeah and it got a little bit

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.779 
necessary yeah and it got a little bit
of<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:34.009> point<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.280> too<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.700> I'll

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
of the point in there too but I'll

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.120 
of the point in there too but I'll
Salvage<00:01:36.209> those<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.539> a<00:01:36.599> second<00:01:37.050> this<00:01:37.830> looking

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
Salvage those in a second this looking

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.050 
Salvage those in a second this looking
good<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.490> far

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
good so far

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.850 
good so far
we'll<00:01:39.869> start<00:01:40.080> carving<00:01:40.319> down<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:42.649> it<00:01:43.649> get

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
we'll start carving down here it get

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.570 
we'll start carving down here it get
smoke<00:01:44.099> ring<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:45.740> smoked<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.890> thing<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.280> fat

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
smoke ring I smoked this thing the fat

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.160 
smoke ring I smoked this thing the fat
layer<00:01:47.819> down<00:01:48.119> with<00:01:48.869> counterintuitive

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.150 

but<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.500> smoke<00:01:54.830> falls<00:01:55.250> down<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.820> meat<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
but the smoke falls down on the meat and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.109 
but the smoke falls down on the meat and
it's<00:01:58.160> working<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.610> pretty<00:01:58.820> good

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.350 

get<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> good<00:02:05.810> smoke<00:02:06.079> ring<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.209> nice

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
get a good smoke ring it's a nice

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.989 
get a good smoke ring it's a nice
looking<00:02:08.599> brisket
