00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to be lightweight and the fastest player

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.529 
to be lightweight and the fastest player

Flywire bring a little bit of this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
Flywire bring a little bit of this
performance<00:00:52.289> cue<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> consumer<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
performance cue to the consumer and so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
performance cue to the consumer and so
they<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.170> this<00:00:55.170> technology<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
they can see what this technology is and

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.860 
they can see what this technology is and
