00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.700
 hello people welcome to one 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:15.160
 another small video tutorial yes it 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.950
 I'm very sorry that no 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.170
 Videos lately came it lay 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.099
 I just had a lot of school stress 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.380
 Blabla already knows because 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.050
 currently it's really about me 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.150
 Anyway, I wanted to do that now 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.130
 start again as active as that 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.320
 make and drive also wears times today 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.300
 with the first plugin that's called 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.940
 plug in updater from a developer la 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.430
 core or core i have no idea how s 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.019
 I'm sorry I can 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.760
 two plugins of them that is once 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.410
 plug in updater and sounded reloader me 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.379
 personally put only the plug in 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.089
 updater ago because plugin reloader use 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 not me 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.039
 I use my own plugin reloader 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.960
 that is you can know which one 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.420
 you use I recommend you now 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.109
 no precipitation retired individual to 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.989
 heart 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.820
 Anyway, would like long updater 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.250
 imagine because is just right 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.840
 awesome plugin we click here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.160
 download or directly download 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.590
 is in the end the same and can 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 then get started in the minecraft server 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.800
 folder is then the plug in updater here 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930
 in it 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.690
 and here is my real player he has 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.160
 first in this tutorial to do and 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.160
 can start the service 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.060
 he started 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.590
 and he has the plug-in small updater 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:53.170
 successfully fogged we look now 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.899
 once again safe - so that the server too 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.280
 is shot clean or 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.340
 stopped watching a plug now 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.380
 into the online and see a plugin from the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.039
 plug in updater folder has turned up 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.929
 in there a config sml file and a 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.450
 tile cache folder 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.190
 that's important in the config 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.959
 The first time, every couple takes over what 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
 we have in our server folder 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.819
 and he practically sits down doing one 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.819
 add automatic link or 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.549
 automatically yes how should I say here 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.269
 the plugin is also called the back 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.220
 drangehÃ¤ngt 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.590
 with that you can adjust for example 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.450
 if you say for example it is 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.459
 another side then you can 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.430
 Add another page and a car 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.079
 update whether the automatically in each time 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.660
 as many seconds as you can get up here 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:43.389
 set can update automatically 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.400
 yes, for example my own plugin 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:47.350
 takes over my chorus here, too 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.549
 but then write out that he does that 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.069
 plugin can not find 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.569
 because as I said I have it myself 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.030
 programmed and will probably not on 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.139
 be found in the Track 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.910
 otherwise that could be out of here, too 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.040
 delete will jump you there as always 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.130
 Let's go back , let's just go 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.049
 open and good, the thing is more 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.810
 yourself in the config we can now 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.239
 once go to the server 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:15.090
 depending on the service started of course 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.090
 also smart start once again 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:29.819
 So go on the server now 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.390
 many moments sec okay all the time now 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.700
 how can you type / update once then 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.870
 there must be a plugin to give 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.430
 we want to reject 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.340
 I have an older version now 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.670
 from world cup on it therefore I will 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.820
 now for the first time 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.410
 which update wild times now 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.900
 It takes a bit of downloading 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.870
 she will see a zip file and now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:03.390
 you also what update 5.626 east was 301 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.200
 kilobyte big in size and was 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.450
 Also automatica did not unzip it 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.110
 file but a water in front of it 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 was textile designer for the license 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.810
 advised me and wanted the problem myself 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:25.470
 of course it is now when we go to 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:29.729
 make example wg and then version 5.5 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.290
 point 4 though 5.6 point two is that 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.390
 is because you have to go again 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.580
 that ribery wage or plugin 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:41.550
 here comes my plugin use 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:45.930
 reloader reload world and watch now 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.610
 again, 5,554 does not have that on itself 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.600
 in any case, the last version is that 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.850
 He himself saw the vines 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.710
 downloaded and unzipped and that 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.860
 Here I could now also with academy 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.120
 and do the rest of the plugins 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.650
 we can believe that I still know it 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.330
 not tested if that too with others 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.990
 small it is actually in europe 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.830
 in the folder is for example 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.750
 Let's do that with my promoter 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.940
 plugin i just give it one 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.940
 Promoters are waiting for a moment 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.970
 okay maybe not now 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.800
 accepted 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.580
 the sk 9 kuwait 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.819
 apparently it does not seem to 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.509
 but it is also important to us to be on your server 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:33.180
 not so bad 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.710
 Anyway, so could manually update what 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.539
 It's a lot easier for people 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.080
 own courage and not just upload 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.879
 have to 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.199
 I thank you for seeing and 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.199
 I wish you a lot of fun with plugins
