everything<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.400> case<00:03:35.580> very<00:03:36.480> well<00:03:36.930> done

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
everything is in the case very well done

everything is in the case very well done
that's<00:03:38.370> another<00:03:38.670> huge<00:03:39.120> plus<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.720> these<00:03:40.050> is

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
that's another huge plus about these is

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.759 
that's another huge plus about these is
this<00:03:40.410> case<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:44.010> Bayer<00:03:44.519> dynamics<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.450> have

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
this case the Bayer dynamics that I have

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.350 
this case the Bayer dynamics that I have
do<00:03:46.769> not<00:03:46.950> did<00:03:47.250> not<00:03:47.370> come<00:03:47.610> with<00:03:47.760> any<00:03:47.790> kind<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.269> a

do not did not come with any kind of a

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.259 
do not did not come with any kind of a
case<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.440> fold<00:03:49.739> down<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.730> that's

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
case and do not fold down so that's

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.170 
case and do not fold down so that's
another<00:03:51.720> expenditure<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.769> if<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.820> decide<00:03:54.150> to

how<00:05:08.280> light<00:05:08.610> these<00:05:08.760> are<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.289> definitely<00:05:10.289> was<00:05:10.530> not

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
how light these are I definitely was not

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.920 
how light these are I definitely was not
expecting<00:05:11.010> that<00:05:11.340> from<00:05:11.729> looking<00:05:12.570> at<00:05:12.780> this

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
expecting that from looking at this

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.000 
expecting that from looking at this
design<00:05:14.180> by<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.240> use<00:05:15.539> of<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.870> metal<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.770> would

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
design by the use of the metal you would

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.680 
design by the use of the metal you would
definitely<00:05:17.490> think<00:05:17.699> it's<00:05:17.849> heavier<00:05:20.690> even

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
definitely think it's heavier even

compared<00:05:22.020> to<00:05:22.080> those<00:05:22.169> bear<00:05:22.380> dynamics<00:05:22.830> I

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
compared to those bear dynamics I

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.860 
compared to those bear dynamics I
thought<00:05:23.070> those<00:05:23.280> were<00:05:23.460> like<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:24.120> custom<00:05:24.720> one

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870

millimeters<00:06:30.719> to<00:06:30.930> 3.5<00:06:31.680> millimeter<00:06:32.010> so<00:06:32.550> it

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
millimeters to 3.5 millimeter so it

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.810
