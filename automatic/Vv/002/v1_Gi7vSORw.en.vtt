00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
we want to share with you is how do you

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.310 
we want to share with you is how do you
create<00:00:13.820> volume<00:00:14.299> in<00:00:14.389> terms<00:00:14.660> of<00:00:14.839> knowing<00:00:15.139> how

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
create volume in terms of knowing how

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.589 
create volume in terms of knowing how
much<00:00:15.559> volume<00:00:15.889> to<00:00:16.189> create<00:00:16.550> one<00:00:17.329> of<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:17.450> things

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
much volume to create one of the things

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.179 
much volume to create one of the things
I<00:00:17.750> learned<00:00:17.960> what<00:00:18.200> I<00:00:18.230> was<00:00:18.439> competing<00:00:18.860> as<00:00:19.160> a

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189

student in beauty school was
understanding<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:21.980> proportion<00:00:22.610> of<00:00:22.699> volume

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:23.239 
understanding the proportion of volume

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:25.630 
understanding the proportion of volume
in<00:00:23.390> proportion<00:00:24.079> of<00:00:24.110> face<00:00:24.860> especially<00:00:25.490> when

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
in proportion of face especially when

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.669 
in proportion of face especially when

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
you look at a profile view so let's turn

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.370 
you look at a profile view so let's turn
Karen<00:00:28.189> profile<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:29.630> look<00:00:29.750> at<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:29.900> profile

Karen profile and you look at a profile

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.109 
Karen profile and you look at a profile
so<00:00:30.589> how<00:00:30.830> do<00:00:30.890> you<00:00:31.039> know<00:00:31.070> how<00:00:31.310> much<00:00:31.429> volume<00:00:31.939> to

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
so how do you know how much volume to

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.000 
so how do you know how much volume to
give<00:00:32.269> a<00:00:32.300> particular<00:00:32.689> face<00:00:33.050> shape<00:00:33.290> when<00:00:33.980> you

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
give a particular face shape when you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.770 
give a particular face shape when you
turn<00:00:34.309> profile<00:00:34.850> what<00:00:35.059> I<00:00:35.089> want<00:00:35.300> you<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.480> do<00:00:35.629> is

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
point right there and then look at the

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.799 
point right there and then look at the
hairline<00:00:43.670> you're<00:00:44.270> going<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.449> take<00:00:44.600> this

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
hairline you're going to take this

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
distance right there that distance right

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.500 
distance right there that distance right
there<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.410> amount<00:00:48.770> of<00:00:48.949> natural<00:00:49.510> volume

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
there is the amount of natural volume

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.979 
there is the amount of natural volume
that<00:00:51.050> Karen<00:00:51.680> needs<00:00:52.309> in<00:00:52.699> proportion<00:00:53.390> or<00:00:53.840> their

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
that Karen needs in proportion or their

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.740 
that Karen needs in proportion or their
face<00:00:54.289> on<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.680> profile<00:00:55.399> view<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:56.329> that's<00:00:56.510> really

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
face on a profile view now that's really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.209 
face on a profile view now that's really
interesting<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.829> lot<00:00:58.129> of

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
interesting is it because a lot of

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.650 
interesting is it because a lot of
clients<00:00:58.340> tell<00:00:58.670> us<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:58.879> want<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.180> lot<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.359> volume

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
clients tell us I want a lot of volume

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.150 
clients tell us I want a lot of volume
now<00:01:00.109> imagine<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:00.710> let<00:01:00.920> me<00:01:00.949> give<00:01:01.100> you

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
now imagine this let me give you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.400 
now imagine this let me give you
scenario<00:01:01.429> here<00:01:01.850> if<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.570> eyebrow<00:01:03.050> or<00:01:03.289> the

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
scenario here if the eyebrow or the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.359 
scenario here if the eyebrow or the
hairline<00:01:03.920> itself<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:04.940> closer<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.950> eyebrow

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
hairline itself is closer to the eyebrow

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.730 
hairline itself is closer to the eyebrow
and<00:01:07.610> let's<00:01:08.030> say<00:01:08.179> it's<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.479> close<00:01:08.740> imagine

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
and let's say it's that close imagine

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.680 
and let's say it's that close imagine
that's<00:01:10.190> all<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.700> our<00:01:10.820> hairline<00:01:11.210> right<00:01:11.420> there

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
that's all of our hairline right there

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.960 
that's all of our hairline right there
you<00:01:12.170> can<00:01:12.320> barely<00:01:12.560> see<00:01:12.979> any<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.369> your<00:01:13.459> skin<00:01:13.789> to
