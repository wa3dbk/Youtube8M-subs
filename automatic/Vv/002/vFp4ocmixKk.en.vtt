00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.379
 one of Latin America greetings in a video 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.469
 previous we talked about what are the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.690
 constellations that are groupings or 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.540
 imaginary ways that our mind 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.880
 plasma in the night sky we commented 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.070
 that the first human beings 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 they imagined figures in the sky of things 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.029
 important many of the mythology of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.769
 each culture is reflected in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.230
 the constellations that they imagined in the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.599
 sky however what we are going to do 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 this time is to understand that the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 figure that imagines in a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 constellation is just an illusion by the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.020
 stars that form the constellations 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.079
 they are actually separated and distant 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.969
 by looking at them in a three-dimensional way 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.800
 and now we are going to use our tool 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.570
 to analyze a constellation that we have 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.149
 seen previously and that is the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.910
 Orion constellation so let's go to the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.820
 constellations tool we search 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.219
 our orion constellation because 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.810
 let's analyze again each one of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 its stars 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.820
 but now let's see what is the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 distance there is from our system 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.560
 solar to each of these stars by 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.310
 example let's analyze this star 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 we are going to approach and we are going to see which 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.490
 they are his properties we had already seen 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.230
 this tool but now we are going to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.550
 use to find what is the distance 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.060
 there in our solar system is 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.520
 star that is beetlejuice we see in the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 properties that is not the data of the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 distance but we can investigate using 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.830
 in this case wikipedia that again 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.010
 comment wikipedia is not a tool 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.510
 very faithful about the information that 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.340
 has because anyone can 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.950
 modify it and sometimes not with good 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.890
 purposes then we have this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.990
 star let's assume that the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 information here is correct and we are going 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.570
 to find that the distance of our 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.350
 solar system to this star is 643 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.500
 Light years 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.190
 with a margin of error more or less than 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.230
 146 light-years this to see the distance of 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.510
 each of these stars I did 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.090
 prior to at least for the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.790
 stars of the orion constellation 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 using this tool for each of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.840
 these stars but I will not do it 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.590
 here for reasons of time so that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.860
 we can see the objective of this video in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.980
 a reasonable time we return to our 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.350
 chalkboard of constellations and I'm going to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.990
 mix that I already did previously a 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.060
 drawing more or less 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.930
 of the constellation of pray though here 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.840
 I need your arms 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.549
 but as you can see these are the stars 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.000
 main components that make up this 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:55.780
 constellation and this is how we see it 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.579
 from the ground it looks like a figure in two 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.359
 dimensions well more or less like a 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:06.310
 little but this drawing of the 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:09.969
 constellation I added the names or 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.909
 its Greek letters of each of these 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:15.239
 stars and the xoom and with the lines that 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.650
 represent the figure of the constellation 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.230
 so here we have alpha orion and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.840
 lambda delta range epsilon zeta this layer 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.150
 and beta that almost is not enough to see here 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.669
 beta using the tool that gives them 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.489
 I showed a moment ago I found which one 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.439
 is the approximate distance of our 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.900
 solar system towards each of these 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:40.780
 stars and taking into account each one 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.290
 of the names that I put here 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.990
 draw this table that I will center for 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.520
 that looks better with the distance of 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:55.750
 each of these stars we see that 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.810
 Alpha Orion is at approximately 643 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.640
 light-years with a margin of error of 146 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.030
 this is the data that we have just taken from 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.430
 wikipedia and besides seeing all these 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.200
 distances and assign them to each of 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.989
 the stars that correspond to me 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.989
 I took the liberty of enumerating from the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.090
 farthest star that is 42 m in the 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.950
 Orion belt that is in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:24.340
 thousand 344 light-years more or less followed by 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.620
 epsilon that is 1300 light years away 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.780
 and so on until the star 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.810
 nearest that is gamma that 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.180
 is only 250 light-years away from 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.070
 distance from our solar system and 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.100
 besides numbered to each one of these 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.430
 stars assigned a color we see 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.750
 the farthest star m 42 the second 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.370
 is epsilon the third is lambda 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:55.170
 the fourth is eta the fifth is delta the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:58.950
 seventh is zeta the octave is alpha and the 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:03.090
 ninth is gamma remember these colors 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.610
 because based on these instances 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.010
 I made a graph that is not good 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.430
 scale for nothing but that can give them 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.920
 an idea of â€‹â€‹the distances actually made here 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.200
 there are two diagrams this is from the 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.750
 earth as we observe this 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.660
 constellation with the way I showed them 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.700
 a moment ago and indicating the letters 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.530
 of each of these stars 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:33.560
 alfaland to gamma delta epsilon z eta m 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.420
 42 layer and beta but if we take into account 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.720
 the distances that I showed to your 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:43.760
 moment these distances remember which 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.900
 it was the furthest away from that 42 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.260
 so we go back to our graph 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.330
 we see that distances from the sun 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.360
 they measure from the sun not from the earth 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.990
 from the sun to the star m 42 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.460
 we see that this is the longest distance 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.159
 or the farthest distance from the star 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.580
 further away is here in 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:12.150
 the belt is the farthest and 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:16.560
 otherwise we see that gamma calls it is 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:19.349
 this one here is here and it's 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.509
 the star that is closest so 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.439
 that if we try to join these stars 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:27.719
 with the lines of the constellation but 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.509
 from a perspective looking at profile 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:33.719
 our star and by far those 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.729
 stars of this constellation these are 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:38.310
 the lines that connect each of the 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.740
 stars that's why I was telling them 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.990
 that the constellations the image of the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.699
 constellation is an illusion because 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.889
 we are imagining figures in 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.409
 two dimensions when in reality the 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:52.569
 stars are distant between 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:54.879
 yes in three dimensions 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:58.919
 educational I recommend the following 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.919
 videos so you can keep learning
