planned
let's<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.210> around<00:01:46.640> but<00:01:47.640> yet<00:01:47.880> him<00:01:48.150> it<00:01:48.600> doesn't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
let's go around but yet him it doesn't

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
let's go around but yet him it doesn't
make<00:01:49.200> sense<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.910> him<00:01:51.150> going

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
make sense and then you have him going

make sense and then you have him going
against<00:01:51.840> nobodies<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.130> other

against nobodies is the other

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560 
against nobodies is the other
alternative<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.300> him<00:01:54.420> going

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
alternative you just have him going

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.390 
alternative you just have him going
against<00:01:54.900> killing<00:01:55.380> nobodies<00:01:55.860> which<00:01:55.980> still<00:01:56.250> can

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
against killing nobodies which still can

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.450 
against killing nobodies which still can
make<00:01:56.520> good<00:01:56.700> stories<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.510> not<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.650> interesting

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
Deathstroke it's like why hasn't he

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
Deathstroke it's like why hasn't he
killed<00:04:25.050> anyone<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.380> don't<00:04:25.650> care<00:04:25.860> unless<00:04:26.070> he's

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
killed anyone I don't care unless he's

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.170 
killed anyone I don't care unless he's
killed<00:04:26.490> someone<00:04:28.160> but<00:04:29.160> antihero<00:04:29.699> destro<00:04:30.030> it

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
killed someone but antihero destro it

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.400 
killed someone but antihero destro it
makes<00:04:30.360> sense<00:04:30.630> that<00:04:30.780> he<00:04:30.840> hasn't<00:04:31.080> killed<00:04:31.199> anyone

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
makes sense that he hasn't killed anyone

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.219 
makes sense that he hasn't killed anyone
granted<00:04:31.860> he<00:04:31.949> did<00:04:31.979> kill<00:04:32.310> Beast<00:04:32.580> Boy<00:04:32.759> though

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
granted he did kill Beast Boy though

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.469 
granted he did kill Beast Boy though
that<00:04:34.229> was<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.620> whole<00:04:35.099> different<00:04:35.130> thing<00:04:35.520> oh<00:04:35.990> I

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
that was a whole different thing oh I

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:46.790 
that was a whole different thing oh I
just<00:04:39.479> okay<00:04:40.110> he<00:04:40.229> didn't<00:04:40.470> see<00:04:40.560> me<00:04:44.870> so<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.560> just

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
just okay he didn't see me so it just

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.189 
just okay he didn't see me so it just
it's<00:04:47.009> an<00:04:47.160> easier<00:04:47.550> storyline<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:48.300> me<00:04:48.449> for<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
it's an easier storyline to me for the

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.810 
it's an easier storyline to me for the
writers<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.710> write<00:04:50.039> you<00:04:50.280> can't<00:04:50.520> do<00:04:50.699> a<00:04:50.729> whole

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
writers to write you can't do a whole

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.640 
writers to write you can't do a whole
thing<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.270> Judd<00:04:51.479> Winick<00:04:51.630> did<00:04:51.900> every<00:04:52.500> single
