00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
of a cookie that uses the same system of

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.790 
of a cookie that uses the same system of
breaking<00:00:08.809> now<00:00:09.809> there's<00:00:10.139> two<00:00:10.290> ways<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> do<00:00:10.769> this

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
breaking now there's two ways to do this

breaking now there's two ways to do this
you<00:00:11.190> can<00:00:11.340> either<00:00:11.429> tighten<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> brake<00:00:12.269> disc

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you can either tighten up the brake disc

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.770 
you can either tighten up the brake disc
which<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.019> rather<00:00:13.200> got<00:00:13.860> using<00:00:14.389> your<00:00:15.389> screws

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
which is rather got using your screws

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.060 
which is rather got using your screws
right<00:00:16.049> here<00:00:17.570> but<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> Aqua<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> get

starts pretty quick I'm almost in front
of<00:02:14.459> my<00:02:14.550> camera<00:02:15.650> which<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.830> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.100> kind

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
of my camera which is going to be kind

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.870 
of my camera which is going to be kind
of<00:02:17.580> hard<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.820> do<00:02:18.000> while<00:02:18.270> holding<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.690> phone<00:02:19.880> and

of hard to do while holding my phone and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.340 
of hard to do while holding my phone and
put<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.510> brakes<00:02:21.750> on<00:02:26.570> its<00:02:27.570> kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.959> difficult

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
put the brakes on its kind of difficult

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.180 
put the brakes on its kind of difficult
for<00:02:28.830> now<00:02:30.019> so<00:02:31.019> that's<00:02:31.769> good<00:02:32.570> from<00:02:33.570> which<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.410> not
