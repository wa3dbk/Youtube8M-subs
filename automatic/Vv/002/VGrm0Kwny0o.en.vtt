00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it there before but I thought it could

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.620 
it there before but I thought it could
be<00:04:11.400> quite<00:04:11.610> interesting<00:04:12.150> could<00:04:12.269> make<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.420> bit

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
be quite interesting could make a bit

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
gear all the time because at the time

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.420 
gear all the time because at the time
whenever<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.470> switchgear<00:04:16.950> I<00:04:16.979> just<00:04:17.190> got<00:04:17.340> this
