in<00:00:00.089> this<00:00:00.900> clip<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.230> gonna<00:00:01.319> be<00:00:01.469> talking

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
in this clip we're gonna be talking

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.919 
in this clip we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.070> drawbars<00:00:02.610> which<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.060> the<00:00:03.389> main<00:00:03.659> way

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
about the drawbars which is the main way

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.660 
about the drawbars which is the main way
that<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.380> get<00:00:04.640> sounds<00:00:05.640> out<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.940> your<00:00:06.089> organ

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
that you get sounds out of your organ

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.499 
that you get sounds out of your organ
each<00:00:09.530> each<00:00:10.530> keyboard<00:00:11.219> has<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> set<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.360> draw

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
each each keyboard has a set of draw

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.450 
each each keyboard has a set of draw
bars<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.900> controls<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:14.130> can<00:00:14.280> see

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
bars that controls it and you can see

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.340 
bars that controls it and you can see
they<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:15.150> know<00:00:15.240> they<00:00:15.360> they<00:00:15.870> push<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.230> they

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
they you know they they push in they

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.560 
they you know they they push in they
push<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.680> they<00:00:16.949> go<00:00:17.070> through<00:00:17.310> from<00:00:17.699> 0<00:00:18.180> all<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
push out they go through from 0 all the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.679 
push out they go through from 0 all the
way<00:00:18.600> up<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.900> 8<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.609> way<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> these<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
way up to 8 and the way that these the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.509 
way up to 8 and the way that these the
way<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> sounds<00:00:22.380> work<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
way that the sounds work on all these is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.410 
way that the sounds work on all these is
they<00:00:23.760> start<00:00:24.320> they<00:00:25.320> start<00:00:25.350> low<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:27.240> get

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
they start they start low and they get

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:37.110 
they start they start low and they get
higher<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.230> go

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.460 

now<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.360> play<00:00:38.570> them<00:00:38.720> all<00:00:38.900> all<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.350> way

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
now when you play them all all the way

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.130 
now when you play them all all the way
out<00:00:39.620> it's<00:00:39.800> gonna<00:00:39.950> sound<00:00:40.190> really<00:00:40.400> bad

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.200 

well<00:00:44.130> to<00:00:44.370> most<00:00:44.550> people<00:00:44.790> it's<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> sound

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
well to most people it's going to sound

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810 
well to most people it's going to sound
really<00:00:45.390> bad<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.170> that's<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.310> key<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.670> getting

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
really bad so that's the key to getting

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.730 
really bad so that's the key to getting
a<00:00:47.970> good<00:00:48.000> sound<00:00:48.390> out<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.720> Hammond<00:00:49.080> is<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.500> hat

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740 
a good sound out of a Hammond is is hat

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.890 
a good sound out of a Hammond is is hat
is<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.130> use<00:00:50.400> those<00:00:50.700> straw<00:00:50.970> bars

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
is to use those straw bars

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.350 
is to use those straw bars
yeah<00:00:52.650> you<00:00:52.830> know<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> understand<00:00:53.520> how<00:00:53.850> they

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
yeah you know to understand how they

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.610 
yeah you know to understand how they
work<00:00:54.540> together<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.290> are<00:00:55.440> basically

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
work together and these are basically

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.770 
work together and these are basically
just<00:00:55.860> harmonics<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:56.880> pipe<00:00:57.090> organ<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.480> believe

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
just harmonics of a pipe organ I believe

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
just harmonics of a pipe organ I believe
the<00:00:58.260> same<00:00:58.640> they're<00:00:59.640> based<00:00:59.880> on<00:01:00.059> different

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the same they're based on different

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.530 
the same they're based on different
length<00:01:00.780> pipes<00:01:01.680> within<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.160> pipe<00:01:02.309> organ<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
length pipes within a pipe organ so this

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.180 
length pipes within a pipe organ so this
started<00:01:03.870> off<00:01:04.020> simulating<00:01:04.620> a<00:01:04.650> pipe<00:01:04.830> organ<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
started off simulating a pipe organ it

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.260 
started off simulating a pipe organ it
doesn't<00:01:05.460> obviously<00:01:05.760> doesn't<00:01:06.000> sound<00:01:06.150> quite

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
doesn't obviously doesn't sound quite

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.180 
doesn't obviously doesn't sound quite
like<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.690> but<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.440> does<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.770> its<00:01:07.800> own<00:01:07.979> unique

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
like it but it does have its own unique

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.969 
like it but it does have its own unique
things<00:01:09.120> about<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.870> that<00:01:10.830> make

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
things about it that make it that make

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.070 
things about it that make it that make
it<00:01:11.010> sound<00:01:11.220> pretty<00:01:11.430> awesome<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.880> its<00:01:12.030> own<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
it sound pretty awesome in its own in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.400 
it sound pretty awesome in its own in
its<00:01:13.229> own<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.530> now<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> b3<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.090> c3<00:01:15.810> you'll<00:01:16.140> see

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
its own way now on a b3 or c3 you'll see

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.990 
its own way now on a b3 or c3 you'll see
that<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.860> five<00:01:17.130> sets<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> draw<00:01:17.759> bars

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
that there are five sets of draw bars

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.520 
that there are five sets of draw bars
one<00:01:18.900> two<00:01:19.440> three<00:01:20.040> four<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> five<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.660> four<00:01:22.380> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
one two three four and five and four of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
one two three four and five and four of
these<00:01:22.619> these<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.600> these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
these these the you know all these

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.060 
these these the you know all these
together<00:01:25.110> except<00:01:25.410> for<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.619> middle<00:01:25.800> group

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
together except for this middle group

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.430 
together except for this middle group
are<00:01:26.280> exactly<00:01:27.270> identical<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:27.990> all<00:01:28.110> they<00:01:28.410> all

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
are exactly identical they all they all

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.170 
are exactly identical they all they all
do<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.830> exact<00:01:29.160> same<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> they're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
do the exact same thing and they're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.590 
do the exact same thing and they're
basically<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.820> different<00:01:32.820> sounds<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
basically just different sounds that you

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.880 
basically just different sounds that you
can<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.899> for<00:01:34.050> different<00:01:34.350> keyboards<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can get for different keyboards and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.230 
can get for different keyboards and
we'll<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.130> talking<00:01:35.340> more<00:01:35.520> about<00:01:35.729> how<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
we'll be talking more about how you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.600 
we'll be talking more about how you
access<00:01:36.660> those<00:01:37.250> later<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:40.610> basically

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
access those later this is basically

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.249 
access those later this is basically
those<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.090> first<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> each<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.110> these

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
those the first two of each one of these

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.910 
those the first two of each one of these
sets<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.570> this<00:01:45.570> set<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> draw<00:01:46.080> bars<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.560> for

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
sets and this set of draw bars is for

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.860 
sets and this set of draw bars is for
the<00:01:47.070> pedals<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:47.760> in<00:01:48.000> rock-and-roll<00:01:48.540> organ

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
the pedals which in rock-and-roll organ

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.800 
the pedals which in rock-and-roll organ
you<00:01:48.990> typically<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:51.360> they're

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you typically don't use but they're

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.200 
you typically don't use but they're
they're<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> same<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:52.940> we'll<00:01:53.940> just<00:01:54.060> keep

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
they're all the same and we'll just keep

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
they're all the same and we'll just keep
them<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.920> those<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
them like that for now so those are the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789
