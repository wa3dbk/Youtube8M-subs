00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.580
 depression today makes more than 300 million 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.010
 of victims around the world but 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.230
 cure with proper follow-up see 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.270
 in the report of indira gomes como 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.699
 identify the first symptoms of 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.090
 depression 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.910
 a disabling sadness and anguish 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.759
 apathy that overlaps with the activities of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 routine, depression leads the patient to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.180
 create a parallel world loaded with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.520
 suffering 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.160
 Maria Theresa lives so sad crying 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.440
 I cried for anything right isolated her from 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 Everyone, I did not go from house to place. 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.789
 no cigarettes just inside the house, right? 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.309
 and then that sadness was taking 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.620
 has been losing weight to people who 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.989
 I was sent to look for a psychiatrist who 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 I thought I was depressed 5% 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.859

 350 million people around the world and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.479
 less than half seek treatment not 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 there is a specific cause for the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 depression that manifests itself due to a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 set of factors such as social and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.869
 biological 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 weekly therapy is required. 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 psychologist clarifies that there is no cure but 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.950
 it is possible to lead a normal life without 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.920
 relapses, provided that the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.439
 proper follow-up the first step 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.570
 is to overcome prejudice by admitting 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.119
 problem and seek help 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.700

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.920

 important to so many people that many in

 house may be watching us until we have the 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.989
 still do not know how to 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.549
 identify even allowed to send a 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.200
 hug by itamar of parnaÃ­ba that is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.599
 morning news 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.670
 question about the symptoms of depression 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:39.239
 indicates already anticipated and this sadness 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.159
 deep from this unjustified and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.019
 I ask you what you can 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.930
 to trigger depression 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.829
 depression is a symbol and 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.389
 multidimensional that will encompass 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:54.030
 emotional and physical symptoms and may 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.449
 compromise the ability to socialize 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.680
 may compromise the ability of 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.199
 interpersonal can compromise the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.159
 ability of the person's work 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:08.909
 sure and would be a genetic predisposition 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:13.730
 where the person can have an inheritance 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.959
 genetics and traumas of some options 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.430
 frustrations during life can 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.829
 trigger disease 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.709
 now it's this women's issue 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.579
 are more likely to be depressed than 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.439
 men 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.120
 we know that modern life in the 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.799
 years the woman has been absorbing 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.049
 absorbing absorbing increasingly 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.239
 things beyond the traditional functions that 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.220
 the woman already had it can help in 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.129
 formation of a depressive picture of the 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.739
 women also in reality the hypothesis 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.239
 such as the hormonal question that is important 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.769
 the fact that the woman does not bear children also 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.900
 different stressor factors for the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.199
 women are factors that contribute to 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.799
 for commitment of the problem in sex 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.810
 female 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.209
 we have a treatment that can be 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.799
 done with medication that should be done 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.269
 even in severe cases or adopted and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.729
 with psychological support also 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.769
 this is usually important 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:07.620
 association of pharmacological treatment 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.539
 with medication associated with psychotherapy 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.639
 with counseling now 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:13.709
 then when the patient refuses to 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.519
 to treat depression can even 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.709
 kill 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.099
 can even kill in more serious cases 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.810
 where there is a greater commitment one 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:27.030
 isolation thoughts and convictions 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.190
 against your own life 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.770
 it can cause more 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.690
 severe enough to cause malnutrition 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.160
 really good keyboards cases 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.660
 complementary cases including 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.550
 people who refuse to do what they 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.840
 is also taking this treatment 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.740
 The question of prejudice is still very 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.570
 strong 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.860
 Israel has a lot to help I'll search 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.340
 a psychiatrist I'm not 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.650
 crazy is too much that doctor is has 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.780
 improved has not yet 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.060
 in some prejudice regarding the 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.250
 question is not to seek the professional 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.430
 psychiatrist but has improved a lot 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.200
 today because new techniques 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.720
 new magazines with fewer effects 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.160
 have made the treatment more 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.140
 increasingly common insurance in our 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.880
 day to day talk in treatment to sandra 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.280
 rooms ask how long the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.150
 treatment program provides positive responses 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.610
 patient depends on the picture is important 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.800
 starting a medication usually starts 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.780
 to take effect and by the second or 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.300
 third week and over time 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.790
 A viewer is improving here 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.550
 Question Doctor Depression Has Cure Both 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.900
 has a cure is a disease that has a 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.760
 tendency to chronify recurrence 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.040
 but if a treatment is instituted 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.440
 appropriate follow-up as well 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.970
 supervised patient may be 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.880
 free of depressive symptoms 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.030
 patient may stay for as long as 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.789
 time taking the treatment until you feel

 life without what is cured of 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.200
 depression and this combs episodes 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.030
 depends on the relapse of the 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.190
 usually the first episode the 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.210
 counseling is treatment by a 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.669
 period of one year 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.260
 here is the question of the viewer one 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.810
 person who is undergoing 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:13.289
 A termination of a relationship can lead to 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.870
 causing a relapse may cause snow 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:18.150
 emotions do not currently have 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.130

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.020
 break the affective contribute yes by 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.660
 recurrence of depressive symptoms 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.760
 important is that as indira spoke 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.979

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.860
 Prejudice and get rid of it if you 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.680

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.210
 no apparent reason is sad many 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.230
 Sometimes they have half a bath. 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.630
 get out of bed 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.730

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.070
 strong of frames is necessary to seek a
