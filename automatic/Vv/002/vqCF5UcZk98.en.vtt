00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 I'm sorry, I'm on the track, I'm 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.480
 sustaining but what the Baptist eike 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:21.689
 Then there was beauty in the video for 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 this time to organizations that will 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.189
 have a pib this April I think 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 that the way we're going to have that already has 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 not only the mode has not played 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.870
 normal very normal presentation average 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.969
 the skills is everyone won is the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.239
 dinosaur that are distinguishes the tank 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.469
 the ebit the days where we're laughing seven days 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.809
 at week and such 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.300
 and this ability of them are the same 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.370
 thing has arrived the strongest and we will put 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 already had only more powerful and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.350
 if the raptor or extinguished the acidi 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 level and punished two carved galuco and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 google that keeps if the child speaks as 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 works a donation of r 1 7 meters only 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.170
 I want dinosaurs to be a minute you go 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 be released five minutes you will be 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 is the terror will start as 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 so dinosaur even if I had 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 normal only the right dinosaur 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 So this is it , it's really cool to have 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.729
 maps here is very interesting the port 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.049
 just so that's going there and take another 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.000
 another and another and something else that will have 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.960
 which I found much more interesting 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.070
 adds up to the new weapons the new goes to 47 is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.610
 64 that of the cs there alone to ll 88 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.640
 ls it looks like a sniper i do not know much 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.439
 very close and even there appears the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.630
 gun cool guy neither take the bottom 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.329
 of the photo is useless semcel but it is already 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.829
 worthy and the most prepared galley 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.390
 What hurts the best is the suit of 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.520
 little bug 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.930
 I think it's just that negative shooters 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.360
 We have a surprise for you with 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.340
 certainly nothing in general and for those 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 girls and sunglasses because these 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 enemies will not be able to withstand 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.690
 penalty shine 90 sensational goals 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.200
 just watching here 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.880
 It's but it 's something that must be very strong. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.340
 call for sale here I was with the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.900
 doubt is if they being more sack giving 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.850
 more and more the normal championship by 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.240
 90 blow is someone from gold 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.840
 the damage is greater then yes being greater can 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.520
 be that in this case let's suppose that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.320
 nobody wanted to use one then if daniel 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.940
 It was a goal to give to someone or something 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.070
 nobody will want to use it then well 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.600
 I also know there, let's see, let's see 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.730
 Who's going to do this? 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.930

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.090

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.430
 worthy that it will be really cool this guy in 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.330
 ball in a laboratory will be fine 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.580

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.350

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.400

 without posting it was bad because I was going to be 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.240
 tired of doing the recording 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.160
