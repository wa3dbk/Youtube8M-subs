00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
separate the yolks in the egg white and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
separate the yolks in the egg white and
now<00:00:45.570> we're<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.989> using<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.070> pore

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
now we're going to be using for the pore

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.900 
now we're going to be using for the pore
strips<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.180> our<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> egg<00:00:49.230> whites<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
strips in our the egg whites so you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
strips in our the egg whites so you
might<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> extra<00:00:52.079> bowl<00:00:52.260> off<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> side

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
might want to extra bowl off to the side

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.030 
might want to extra bowl off to the side
that<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.629> yolk<00:00:54.870> in

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.729 

might<00:00:59.040> take<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.430> practice<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.360> trust<00:01:01.050> me<00:01:01.170> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
might take some practice but trust me it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.520 
might take some practice but trust me it
gets<00:01:01.770> easy<00:01:02.220> it'll<00:01:02.899> it'll<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.019> easier<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:07.409> then

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
gets easy it'll it'll be easier and then

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.410 
could actually rip the tissue in half so
it's<00:02:53.709> thinner<00:02:53.980> if<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.340> want<00:02:54.520> but<00:02:55.090> i<00:02:55.150> just

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
it's thinner if you want but i just

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's thinner if you want but i just
chose<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.630> fold<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.470> tissue<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.640> half<00:02:57.820> like<00:02:58.420> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
chose to fold a tissue in half like the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.360 
chose to fold a tissue in half like the
whole<00:02:58.690> tissue<00:02:58.870> would<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.230> without<00:02:59.709> ripping

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
whole tissue would have without ripping

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.280 
whole tissue would have without ripping
it<00:03:00.520> i<00:03:00.760> found<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.480> kind<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.690> easier<00:03:02.080> and<00:03:02.230> it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
it i found it kind of easier and it

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.280 
it i found it kind of easier and it
didn't<00:03:02.470> trip<00:03:02.620> as<00:03:02.770> much<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.750> then<00:03:05.170> you're

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
didn't trip as much and then you're

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.330 
didn't trip as much and then you're
going<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.470> take<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.950> egg<00:03:06.459> white<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:08.250> put<00:03:09.250> it

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
going to take the egg white and put it

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.490 
going to take the egg white and put it
on<00:03:09.489> top<00:03:09.610> of<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.970> clean<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.390> also<00:03:11.140> so<00:03:11.410> you're

on top of the clean it also so you're

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.930 
on top of the clean it also so you're
gonna<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.680> one<00:03:11.920> layer<00:03:12.100> on<00:03:12.280> your<00:03:12.430> nose<00:03:12.610> and
