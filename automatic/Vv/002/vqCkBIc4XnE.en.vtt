00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
so the connection is usually pretty

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.299

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
bigger scorestreaks that I could have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.430 
bigger scorestreaks that I could have
used<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.329> easier<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.809> map<00:00:48.960> sucks

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
used to make this easier this map sucks

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.279 
used to make this easier this map sucks
for<00:00:49.680> dogs<00:00:49.920> by<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.520> just<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.690> 1

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
for dogs by the way just so you know 1

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
for dogs by the way just so you know 1
you're<00:00:52.530> always<00:00:52.710> wide<00:00:53.070> out<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> open<00:00:53.730> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
you're always wide out in the open so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
you're always wide out in the open so
you're<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.239> susceptible<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.930> snipers<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
you're very susceptible to snipers and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.400 
you're very susceptible to snipers and
other<00:00:56.280> players<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.879> assault<00:00:57.210> rifles<00:00:58.170> and

other players with assault rifles and
guns<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.890> general<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.390> second<00:01:00.719> reason<00:01:00.960> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
guns in general and the second reason it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.340 
guns in general and the second reason it
sucks<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.559> knife<00:01:02.460> only<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> dogs<00:01:03.239> dogs<00:01:04.080> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
sucks for knife only and dogs dogs in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
sucks for knife only and dogs dogs in
particular<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:05.129> because<00:01:05.780> they<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.290> any

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
particular is because they don't get any

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500 
particular is because they don't get any
kills<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> map<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> maps<00:01:08.850> too<00:01:09.119> big<00:01:09.360> I
