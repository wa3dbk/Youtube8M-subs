particular filter will pull out and the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.329 
particular filter will pull out and the
other<00:00:50.300> will<00:00:50.510> spew<00:00:50.720> out<00:00:50.809> makes<00:00:51.680> no<00:00:51.860> sense<00:00:52.129> but

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
other will spew out makes no sense but

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.210 
other will spew out makes no sense but
it's<00:00:52.970> always<00:00:53.300> good<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.540> know<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.440> but

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
it's always good to know so but
