00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.930
 if you get all the guys and laces 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.910
 states and this here is minecraft 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.859
 We are on Thursday and you know that all 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.330
 On Thursdays we will have seeds agreements 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.430
 seeds to death 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.380
 we are a version 1.8 and those in fear and 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.610
 The truth is that it is very, very, very 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.199
 interesting because 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.610
 because it's still because it's almost super 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.480
 interesting really will find us 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.330
 very much 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:28.490
 good first of all is that it is 24 the 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:32.540
 seed is 2 466 1948 39 64 about 60 77 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.640
 40 agreement that brought this seed as 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.690
 sorry let's do creative and let's 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.839
 put here the seed that has put it 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.129
 bad to know and we believe that brings these 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.440
 seed seeds do not have any 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.720
 teleport okay you're not going to do any 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.600
 tp to anywhere you have everything in the 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.879
 spam you will go all spam but without the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.360
 title put it on 16 diamonds yes guys 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.820
 16 diamonds 22 gold ingots 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.770
 emeralds iron armor or are there of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.500
 everything here apart from everything there is also 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.640
 landscapes or quite curious areas 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.230
 also at least I take a 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.870
 back mention that is this signature here 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.420
 this area that is very cool just is 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.280
 all this bit of swamp is worth 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.080
 very cool because if you look here that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.910
 isolating you know that there is a position is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 cool this mini cave then to do 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 a construction has to be 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 very well in addition to soul you can do 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.040
 here something cool really but good if 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 we have started here what we have to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.490
 to do is direct us the part of the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.070
 desert that would be been here and as 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 you see there I'm already in identifying what 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 that is being a separate pyramid 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 this area is great because we 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.210
 we found horses the first of 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.490
 change so it's great and food 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.770
 free for the face with the red mushrooms 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 and macro mesquida and the agreement also 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 we have savanna wood and a little 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.940
 more from far away we have the one of the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.520
 four trees the tree all in agreement 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.610
 well we found a pyramid and a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.890
 populated and really pegaditos are worth 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.570
 very close the ordination is desert a 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.770
 little peculiar of this area here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.520
 worth doing as a kind of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.990
 pretty curious hole in which like 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.760
 we can observe already from here we are going to 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.290
 get enough iron and or at least 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.500
 I see from here already eight ingots of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 iron because if so it is more to start 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.120
 do you have horses do you have leather by the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.190
 face bamboo dish everything everything you have 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.500
 here in the generation of the town as 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.070
 you see is a little random palet sometimes 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 weird is how you see this here he 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.850
 I found it very illogical according to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.990
 the construction is that you have then 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.910
 down here 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.270
 I find it very stupid but good 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270
 are the things 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.130
 the generations as you see from earth 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.480
 exaggerated here in the desert itself 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.590
 but exaggerated 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.959
 and we have one two three four five and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.519
 six plantations apart those 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.180
 farms and the super generation 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.340
 strange we are going to meet with the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.799
 bookstore as you see here and his visit to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.019
 character and then apart here we have a 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.580
 diamond of mountains and white trees and 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.459
 normal according to how you see the biome 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.080
 of mountains with a stern and the avap 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.150
 you want the whole biome you know that sign what 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.670
 you have everything really and everything super 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.780
 stuck because we have started ay good 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.400
 let's go to the pyramid which is what 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.240
 we are really going to be interested in it 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.050
 in agreement 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.450
 let's break through here 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.490
 here and here and we fall a good part of the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.740
 pyramid already brings us remove the lever 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.080
 our and what is being these 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.280
 parts of here that always come in handy 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.830
 as a decoration and we're going to start 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.230
 open the chests three diamonds by the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.440
 moment of agreement the three diamonds 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.880
 iron and something worthy we already have two 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 armor because if one diamond 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.220
 in addition another iron armor and more 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.300
 diamonds we carry diamond ones 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.610
 bones that come right at the beginning 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.760
 maybe for crops and some meat 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.720
 rotten because if it never comes 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.140
 wrong 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.680
 two emeralds and well let's go if trias 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.630
 before 22 golden 8 iron and all two 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.319
 emeralds I think it's pretty good 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.719
 Now what are we going to do? 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.249
 not much ballet are you going to apply 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.849
 exactly where the lever was 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:10.519
 ballet pressure has no place of 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.980
 loss and we are going down slowly and 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.230
 boom we fall in this cave this cave 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.789
 quite peculiar that we already have land 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.010
 we have coal iron if we do 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.960
 enough things is quite big 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.680
 and we're going to keep going down we're going to give the 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.140
 f3 and bs.f 3 where it puts 28 we will search 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.420
 one that puts 11 or 12 the two of us 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.960
 once we agree to it 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:37.360
 let's be 14 15 12 11 here we take it off 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.669
 we break this weird stone as soon as 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.160
 we break this pebble that also 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.060
 when we the name that is ten thousand 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 seven is worth 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.620
 we have broken 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.320
 and we will leave this cave at a level 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.780
 where you can generate diamond is worth not 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.060
 only diamond found 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.370
 quite spooky gold quantities 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.380
 they are worth 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.650
 but well let's go to what we came for 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.990
 the diamond here we have a diamond 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.070
 agreement 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.000
 a diamond 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.120
 here it would be like that we take a diamond 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.800
 eight diamonds we would take and here as 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.800
 you see also more diamonds appear 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.340
 there we are and we have a total of 4 and 48 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:33.560
 more diamonds for your pretty face is worth 1 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:35.690
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 already because 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.060
 yes 16 diamonds and the truth that we have not 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.250
 chopped almost nothing to say nothing we have 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.110
 chopped down to this height and already 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.880
 It is in the process we took longer a 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.350
 little stone of all types and 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.660
 we have found two caves in which 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.169
 There's Jerry Coal to kick and he's here 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.810
 we find gold we find carbon rest 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.220
 iron out there the cave finished off 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.560
 agreement so come here you have 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.419
 lava to make our portal or your 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.660
 mold more rest plus carbon that you want 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.010
 and then on this side around here the 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.890
 cave will continue to agree in case 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.110
 you want to investigate, you are going to continue 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.820
 While waiting a portion of vision 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.800
 night why 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.240
 you will continue to find many 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.540
 materials as you see a lot of coal 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.160
 for here more gold plus rest rest and 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.540
 we also find the lapis lazuli that 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.430
 it's very good for our friendship 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.990
 enchantments lapis lazuli 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.150
 it was a material that does and now it's a 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.310
 pretty interesting material for the 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.680
 theme of the enchantment tables yes 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.470
 we follow the cave as you see it is very 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.900
 great is worth it you can follow it 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.569
 this lava dog and the less tested me 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.699
 quiet 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.510
 you can follow it and get here more or 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.340
 less 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.530
 and here I ended up slow after that 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.570
 you have a cave to bore materials 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.100
 to bore you have to leave the 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.390
 head to find them in agreement 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.390
 because they are easy to see 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.090
 and there is no golden mystery of 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.740
 all of all of everything is that of all the 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.330
 seed I think it has very complete by 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.789
 that's because you do not have to look for the 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.500
 materials come to you that's very 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.000
 very very very very good news 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.970
 possibilities that you want in the cave 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.979
 sure of yourself that you can lose 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.630
 is global is very big as you see 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.210
 I am saving and I continue to see materials 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.889
 on the one hand materials on the other the cave 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.419
 that goes on and on and on and on and on and on 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:21.760
 goes on and on in these caves that never 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.850
 finish 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.950
 and that's it, this is basically everything 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.620
 what can I bring you if you look for 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:32.020
 seed nothing the real there are subscribe and 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.140
 not guys tomorrow more and better until 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.140
 then
