our camera to our character

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.480 
our camera to our character
automatically<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:10.349> when<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.650> hold<00:00:10.950> down<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
automatically but when we hold down the

automatically but when we hold down the
right<00:00:11.969> mouse<00:00:12.030> button<00:00:12.889> will<00:00:13.889> notice<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.309> jumps

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
right mouse button will notice it jumps

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.410 
right mouse button will notice it jumps
to<00:00:14.730> our<00:00:14.969> player<00:00:15.379> but<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.830> quite<00:00:17.420> moving

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
to our player but it's not quite moving

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.140 
to our player but it's not quite moving
the<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.990> want<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.980> only<00:00:20.250> capturing<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the way we want it's only capturing the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.070 
the way we want it's only capturing the
click<00:00:21.619> for<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.740> frame<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.869> that's<00:00:24.869> pretty

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
click for that frame and that's pretty

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.599 
click for that frame and that's pretty
easy<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.500> fix<00:00:25.710> we're<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.070> gonna<00:00:26.160> set<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
easy to fix we're just gonna set up a

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.810 
easy to fix we're just gonna set up a
boolean<00:00:27.000> value<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> let's<00:00:29.039> stop<00:00:29.550> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
boolean value for so let's stop that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.799 
boolean value for so let's stop that
we'll<00:00:30.060> go<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> model<00:00:30.840> develop<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
we'll go back in to model develop and

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.660 
we'll go back in to model develop and
those<00:00:33.809> two<00:00:34.170> lines<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.680> originally<00:00:35.160> commented

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

just gonna call it camera setup which
will<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.160> take<00:00:53.520> any<00:00:53.699> variables<00:00:54.210> at<00:00:54.390> least<00:00:54.539> not

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
will not take any variables at least not

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
function I'm just gonna actually call

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.580 
function I'm just gonna actually call
that<00:01:10.950> function<00:01:11.780> now<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> reason<00:01:13.140> why<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> put

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that function now the reason why I put

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.440 
that function now the reason why I put
it<00:01:13.650> into<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.100> function<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> later<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.150> we'll

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it into a function is later on we'll

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
it into a function is later on we'll
might<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.110> able<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> pass<00:01:16.530> some

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
might want to be able to pass some

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.450 
might want to be able to pass some
variables<00:01:17.189> in<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:18.500> at<00:01:19.500> least<00:01:19.650> I'm<00:01:19.830> thinking

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
variables in here at least I'm thinking

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980 
variables in here at least I'm thinking
that<00:01:20.850> way<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> road<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> might<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that way down the road I might want to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.109 
that way down the road I might want to
pass<00:01:22.170> some<00:01:22.380> variables<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.220> use<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
pass some variables in here and use this

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
pass some variables in here and use this
here<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> positioning<00:01:25.979> instead<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
here to do the positioning instead of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.490 
here to do the positioning instead of
doing<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> positioning<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:28.380> we'll

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
doing the positioning in here but we'll

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.420 
doing the positioning in here but we'll
get<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> other

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
get to that and one of the other

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
get to that and one of the other
tutorials<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.229> should<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> camera

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
tutorials so that should put the camera

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.550 
tutorials so that should put the camera
in<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> position<00:01:32.850> when<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.810> first<00:01:34.170> start<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in the position when we first start the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.300 
in the position when we first start the
game<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:36.360> started<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
game so we started up there we go it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
game so we started up there we go it
doesn't<00:01:38.850> move<00:01:39.270> according<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.049> way<00:01:40.229> it's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
doesn't move according to the way it's

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.249 
doesn't move according to the way it's
supposed<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.299> least<00:01:42.509> moves<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
supposed to but at least moves to the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
supposed to but at least moves to the
player<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> first<00:01:44.040> starts<00:01:44.549> next<00:01:45.509> we'll

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
player when it first starts next we'll

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
player when it first starts next we'll
want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.960> address<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> camera<00:01:49.530> moving<00:01:50.250> when

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
want to address the camera moving when

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
want to address the camera moving when
we<00:01:50.490> hold<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.970> button<00:01:51.680> so<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.890> to

we hold down the button so I'm going to
create<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.189> private<00:01:53.460> boolean<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:56.390> I'll<00:01:57.390> call

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
create a private boolean and I'll call

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
create a private boolean and I'll call
it<00:01:58.579> cam<00:01:59.579> button<00:01:59.909> pressed<00:02:03.530> down

comment now now let's quickly go try

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.780 
comment now now let's quickly go try
this<00:03:40.020> out<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> when<00:03:42.960> we<00:03:43.080> hit<00:03:43.260> play<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:44.460> camera

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
this out so when we hit play the camera

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.400 
this out so when we hit play the camera
does<00:03:44.970> move<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.330> our<00:03:45.420> player<00:03:45.690> but<00:03:46.020> you<00:03:46.110> notice

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
does move to our player but you notice

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.020 
does move to our player but you notice
it's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.680> actually<00:03:47.160> following<00:03:47.460> our<00:03:47.820> player

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's not actually following our player

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.880 
it's not actually following our player
unless<00:03:48.870> we<00:03:49.050> hold<00:03:49.230> down<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.680> right<00:03:49.830> mouse

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
unless we hold down the right mouse

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.030 
unless we hold down the right mouse
button<00:03:50.100> in<00:03:50.760> which<00:03:51.300> case<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.810> moves<00:03:52.650> towards

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
button in which case it moves towards

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.040 
button in which case it moves towards
supposed<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.550> and<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.270> rotating<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.780> we

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
supposed to and it's rotating like we

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.500 
supposed to and it's rotating like we
want<00:03:55.260> but<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.520> notice<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.180> rotate

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
want but if you notice you can rotate

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.860 
want but if you notice you can rotate
below<00:03:58.310> by<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.340> Train<00:03:59.820> and<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.600> we<00:04:00.720> had

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
below by the Train and if we had

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.130 
below by the Train and if we had
buildings<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:01.710> trees<00:04:02.480> around<00:04:03.480> our<00:04:03.720> character

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
buildings and trees around our character

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.110 
buildings and trees around our character
it<00:04:04.740> would<00:04:04.860> actually<00:04:05.040> go<00:04:05.490> through<00:04:05.700> those<00:04:05.880> as

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
it would actually go through those as

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.240 
it would actually go through those as
well<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:06.570> don't<00:04:06.810> want<00:04:07.050> that<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.620> little

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
well and we don't want that a little

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.070 
well and we don't want that a little
later<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.460> when<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:08.970> into<00:04:09.120> ray<00:04:09.390> casting<00:04:09.990> we

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
later on when we get into ray casting we

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.440 
later on when we get into ray casting we
can<00:04:10.230> come<00:04:10.410> back<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.920> adjust<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.090> camera<00:04:12.420> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
can come back and adjust the camera so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.350 
can come back and adjust the camera so
it<00:04:12.630> doesn't<00:04:13.020> go<00:04:13.680> through<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.950> terrain<00:04:14.310> but<00:04:15.150> in

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
it doesn't go through the terrain but in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.789 
it doesn't go through the terrain but in
the<00:04:15.450> next<00:04:15.660> tutorial<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.170> want<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.380> address<00:04:16.560> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
the next tutorial I want to address the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.490 
the next tutorial I want to address the
fact<00:04:17.040> that<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.519> camera<00:04:17.940> isn't<00:04:18.150> following<00:04:19.109> our

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
fact that the camera isn't following our

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.460 
fact that the camera isn't following our
player<00:04:20.430> properly<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.359> that's<00:04:21.989> because<00:04:22.320> we

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
player properly and that's because we

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.820 
player properly and that's because we
have<00:04:22.740> our<00:04:23.240> position<00:04:24.240> updating<00:04:24.840> only<00:04:25.620> when<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
have our position updating only when the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.590 
have our position updating only when the
button<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.340> pressed<00:04:26.520> down<00:04:26.730> for<00:04:27.270> our<00:04:27.360> cam

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
button is pressed down for our cam

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.350 
button is pressed down for our cam
button<00:04:27.840> I'm<00:04:28.560> gonna<00:04:28.860> move<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.310> out<00:04:29.550> of<00:04:29.610> this

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
button I'm gonna move that out of this

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.020 
button I'm gonna move that out of this
block<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.020> be<00:04:31.680> able<00:04:31.919> to<00:04:32.100> position<00:04:32.760> it

block and be able to position it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.850 
block and be able to position it
according<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.540> where<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.720> players<00:04:34.050> or<00:04:34.440> lease

according to where the players or lease

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.050 
according to where the players or lease
before<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.160> camera<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.550> supposed<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.940> be
