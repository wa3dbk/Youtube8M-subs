the nice beefy watch and I can just see
what<00:03:03.430> it<00:03:03.519> looks<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.730> on<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> wrist<00:03:04.330> here<00:03:10.200> so

what it looks like on the wrist here so

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.990

too<00:03:13.030> high<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.540> my<00:03:13.569> opinion<00:03:14.019> for<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.200> dive<00:03:14.440> watch

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
too high in my opinion for a dive watch

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.840 
too high in my opinion for a dive watch
certainly<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.280> isn't<00:03:15.549> going<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.730> be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
certainly this isn't going to be

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.570 
certainly this isn't going to be
something<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.269> you<00:03:16.360> necessarily<00:03:17.580> get

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
something that you necessarily get

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.030 
something that you necessarily get
really<00:03:18.850> dressy<00:03:19.269> with<00:03:19.450> this<00:03:20.380> is<00:03:20.500> more<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.859> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
really dressy with this is more of a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.630 
really dressy with this is more of a
tool<00:03:21.489> dive<00:03:21.850> look<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.620> certainly<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> nice

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
tool dive look but certainly a nice

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.479 
tool dive look but certainly a nice
watch<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.420> really<00:03:25.750> did<00:03:25.900> like
