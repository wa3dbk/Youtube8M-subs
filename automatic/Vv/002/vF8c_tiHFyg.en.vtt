song but just in towns Earl
Justin<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:12.290> an<00:00:13.290> artist<00:00:13.740> from<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.040> time<00:00:14.250> it's

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
Justin is an artist from this time it's

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.950 
Justin is an artist from this time it's
quite<00:00:15.389> modern

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
quite modern

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.870 
quite modern
while<00:00:16.260> songs<00:00:16.650> are<00:00:16.800> actually<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.340> old<00:00:17.550> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
while songs are actually very old and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.160 
while songs are actually very old and
that's<00:00:18.920> beautiful<00:00:19.920> paradox<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.960> it

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
that's beautiful paradox but I like it

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.859 
that's beautiful paradox but I like it
and<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:24.330> those<00:00:24.510> also<00:00:24.990> should<00:00:25.289> stay<00:00:25.529> alive

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
and I think those also should stay alive

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.600 
and I think those also should stay alive
so<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:30.090> song<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.449> will<00:00:30.630> be<00:00:30.720> playing<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.610> Harlem

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
so the song I will be playing as Harlem

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.150 
so the song I will be playing as Harlem
River<00:00:32.790> Blues<00:00:33.350> actually<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> song<00:00:34.739> was<00:00:34.890> quite

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
River Blues actually that song was quite

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.639 
River Blues actually that song was quite
fast<00:00:35.520> but<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> version<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
fast but there's a version on the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
fast but there's a version on the
Internet<00:00:38.270> it's<00:00:39.270> an<00:00:39.860> kxt<00:00:40.860> recording<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> there

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Internet it's an kxt recording and there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.950 
Internet it's an kxt recording and there
he<00:00:42.690> plays<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> quite<00:00:43.320> slow<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.750> in<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
he plays it quite slow so in that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
he plays it quite slow so in that
recording<00:00:46.440> he<00:00:46.590> looks<00:00:46.800> quite<00:00:46.950> messed<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
recording he looks quite messed up I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.319 
recording he looks quite messed up I
think<00:00:47.879> he<00:00:47.969> had<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.379> rough<00:00:49.379> night<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> bad<00:00:50.039> day

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
think he had a rough night or a bad day

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
think he had a rough night or a bad day

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
very simple but the B sin was a bit hard

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.380 
very simple but the B sin was a bit hard
to<00:02:14.000> play<00:02:14.240> oh<00:02:14.510> yeah<00:02:15.320> I<00:02:15.380> forgot<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.740> mention<00:02:16.390> yes

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.320 
to play oh yeah I forgot to mention yes
I<00:02:17.900> have<00:02:18.110> my<00:02:18.260> cheap<00:02:18.500> chords<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.460> cheap

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
I have my cheap chords and my cheap

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.990 
I have my cheap chords and my cheap
capo<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.170> 3rd<00:02:21.470> fret<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.280> we<00:02:22.430> also<00:02:22.700> need<00:02:22.880> to

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
capo on the 3rd fret so we also need to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.790 
capo on the 3rd fret so we also need to
do<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.900> then<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.200> gets<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.410> bit<00:02:24.560> hard<00:02:24.740> to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
do this but then it gets a bit hard to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.620 
do this but then it gets a bit hard to
play<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.100> b7<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.850> think<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
play the b7 I think so

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.740 
play the b7 I think so
you<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.140> play<00:02:27.260> like<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.750> 6th

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
you just play like this with the 6th

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.130 
you just play like this with the 6th
string<00:02:30.620> open<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:32.510> he<00:02:32.780> does<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.050> as

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
string open and I think he does it as

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.070 
string open and I think he does it as
well<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:35.110> let's<00:02:36.110> look<00:02:36.260> first<00:02:36.470> at<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.770> Sun<00:02:38.080> this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
well so let's look first at the Sun this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:58.710 
well so let's look first at the Sun this
all<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.440> does<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.310> way<00:02:40.550> place<00:02:41.350> first

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.030 

b7<00:03:01.480> agonistic<00:03:02.480> sing<00:03:02.810> -<00:03:02.959> 3rd<00:03:03.230> string<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.950> at

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
b7 agonistic sing - 3rd string and at

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:11.860 
b7 agonistic sing - 3rd string and at
first<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:09.110> um<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.910> melody<00:03:11.269> plays<00:03:11.570> with<00:03:11.780> his

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:45.680 

and<00:03:39.170> many<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.440> them<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:42.780> Sun<00:03:44.390> notice<00:03:45.390> that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
and many of them the Sun notice that

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.870 
and many of them the Sun notice that
when<00:03:46.110> he<00:03:46.230> hammers<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.710> then<00:03:47.460> he<00:03:47.580> starts

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
when he hammers it then he starts

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.030 
when he hammers it then he starts
playing<00:03:48.120> with<00:03:48.210> his<00:03:48.360> thumb<00:03:48.570> so<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.840> goes<00:03:49.040> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
playing with his thumb so it goes and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:05.350 
playing with his thumb so it goes and
not

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:13.140 

there<00:04:06.360> goes<00:04:06.570> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.160 

doesn't<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.210> matter<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:14.600> much<00:04:14.810> what<00:04:15.080> you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
doesn't really matter so much what you

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.530 
doesn't really matter so much what you
play<00:04:15.350> with<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.950> think<00:04:16.330> you<00:04:17.330> should<00:04:17.480> do

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
play with a I think you should do

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.810 
play with a I think you should do
whatever<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.050> but<00:04:18.550> sometimes<00:04:19.550> he<00:04:19.640> makes

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
whatever you like but sometimes he makes

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:32.110 
whatever you like but sometimes he makes
a<00:04:19.940> variation<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:21.110> he<00:04:21.200> goes

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.700 

so<00:04:32.750> just<00:04:33.760> when<00:04:34.760> he<00:04:34.850> chases<00:04:35.389> from<00:04:35.540> A<00:04:35.690> to<00:04:35.720> B<00:04:35.900> from

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
so just when he chases from A to B from

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:48.060 
so just when he chases from A to B from
80<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:37.130> a

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.040 

no<00:04:49.070> so<00:04:49.220> it'd<00:04:49.340> be<00:04:49.520> doesn't<00:04:49.880> really<00:04:50.000> matter

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
no so it'd be doesn't really matter

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.240 
no so it'd be doesn't really matter
I<00:04:52.110> always<00:04:52.770> play

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250
