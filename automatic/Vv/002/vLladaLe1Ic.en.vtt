that aspect ok well again so we have the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.220 
that aspect ok well again so we have the
toy<00:02:48.010> pad<00:02:48.310> which<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> our<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.720> know<00:02:49.750> our<00:02:49.810> base

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
toy pad which is our you know our base

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.380 
toy pad which is our you know our base
upon<00:02:50.590> which<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.010> characters<00:02:51.489> are<00:02:51.520> placed<00:02:52.150> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
upon which the characters are placed and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.440 
upon which the characters are placed and
emerge<00:02:52.989> into<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.530> game<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:54.489> as<00:02:55.060> always<00:02:55.180> we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
emerge into the game but as always we

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.340 
emerge into the game but as always we
wanted<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:55.810> challenge<00:02:56.110> themselves

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
wanted to really challenge themselves

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.900 
wanted to really challenge themselves
are<00:02:56.709> not<00:02:56.739> happy<00:02:57.070> with<00:02:57.220> just<00:02:57.400> doing<00:02:57.700> what<00:02:57.790> other

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
are not happy with just doing what other

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.550 
are not happy with just doing what other
people<00:02:58.239> do<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:58.690> we've<00:02:58.840> invested<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.380> lot<00:02:59.530> of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
people do so we've invested a lot of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.030 
people do so we've invested a lot of
time<00:02:59.680> years<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.730> R&amp;D<00:03:00.940> into<00:03:01.510> making<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.040> break

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
time years of R&amp;D into making this break

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.920 
time years of R&amp;D into making this break
the<00:03:03.220> rules<00:03:03.430> would<00:03:03.640> start<00:03:04.330> with<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.660> something

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
the rules would start with for something

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.130 
the rules would start with for something
new<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.560> really<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.430> controller<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.750> of

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
new so it really is a controller in of

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.830 
new so it really is a controller in of
itself<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:08.950> there<00:03:09.430> are<00:03:09.459> puzzles<00:03:10.120> involving

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
itself so there are puzzles involving

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.190 
itself so there are puzzles involving
you<00:03:11.250> mixing<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.400> blending<00:03:12.489> colors<00:03:13.150> their<00:03:14.020> toy

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
you mixing and blending colors their toy

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.290 
you mixing and blending colors their toy
pad<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.590> can<00:03:14.650> see<00:03:14.860> behind<00:03:15.010> me<00:03:15.340> has<00:03:15.940> lots<00:03:16.270> of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
pad you can see behind me has lots of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.390 
pad you can see behind me has lots of
different<00:03:16.540> color<00:03:16.750> elements<00:03:17.260> into<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:17.980> we

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
different color elements into it so we

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.550 
different color elements into it so we
can<00:03:18.610> assign<00:03:19.450> different<00:03:19.840> colors<00:03:20.290> different

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
can assign different colors different

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.160 
can assign different colors different
sections<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.459> then<00:03:21.850> we've<00:03:22.390> add<00:03:22.720> into<00:03:23.080> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
sections and then we've add into the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.500 
sections and then we've add into the
puzzle<00:03:23.350> mechanics<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.640> for<00:03:24.820> example<00:03:24.850> we<00:03:25.360> might

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
puzzle mechanics so for example we might

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.509 
puzzle mechanics so for example we might
have<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> there's<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.680> power<00:03:26.920> called<00:03:27.130> shift

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
have a there's a power called shift

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.570 
have a there's a power called shift
which<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.209> a<00:03:28.239> teleportation<00:03:28.930> power<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.370> as

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
which is a teleportation power and as

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.250 
which is a teleportation power and as
you<00:03:30.760> physically<00:03:31.209> move<00:03:31.360> your<00:03:31.510> carrot<00:03:31.810> from<00:03:31.900> one

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
you physically move your carrot from one

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.199 
you physically move your carrot from one
side<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> toy<00:03:32.920> pad<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.400> other<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:34.150> you

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
side of the toy pad to the other so you

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.940 
side of the toy pad to the other so you
will<00:03:34.390> emerge<00:03:34.780> in<00:03:35.080> different<00:03:35.380> vortices<00:03:35.890> that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
will emerge in different vortices that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.490 
will emerge in different vortices that
correspond<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:37.060> colors<00:03:37.360> on<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.049> toy<00:03:38.230> pad

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
correspond to the colors on the toy pad

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.110 
correspond to the colors on the toy pad
so<00:03:38.980> we're<00:03:39.070> getting<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:39.489> can<00:03:39.640> weave<00:03:39.880> that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
so we're getting so we can weave that

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.060 
so we're getting so we can weave that
into<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.570> gameplay<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:41.709> there<00:03:42.040> are

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
into the gameplay and then there are

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.610 
into the gameplay and then there are
five<00:03:42.549> or<00:03:42.730> six<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.030> these<00:03:43.120> different<00:03:43.620> game

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
five or six of these different game

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.830 
five or six of these different game
mechanics<00:03:45.190> all<00:03:45.430> based<00:03:45.970> around<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.360> toi<00:03:46.570> pads

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
mechanics all based around the toi pads

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140 
mechanics all based around the toi pads
and<00:03:47.110> on<00:03:47.500> top<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:48.160> lot<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.760> other

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
and on top of that a lot of other

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.410 
and on top of that a lot of other
characters<00:03:49.870> superpowers<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:51.420> Batman's

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
characters superpowers like Batman's

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.539 
characters superpowers like Batman's
ability<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.590> cloak<00:03:53.829> himself<00:03:54.010> in<00:03:54.430> with

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
ability to cloak himself in with

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.330 
ability to cloak himself in with
visibility<00:03:55.239> or<00:03:55.560> while<00:03:56.560> stars<00:03:56.829> relic<00:03:57.130> of<00:03:57.220> a

visibility or while stars relic of a
relic<00:03:57.970> scanner<00:03:58.450> ability<00:03:59.049> again<00:03:59.650> they're<00:03:59.829> all

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
relic scanner ability again they're all

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.009 
relic scanner ability again they're all
toy<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.610> physical<00:04:01.030> moving<00:04:01.630> around<00:04:01.840> of

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
toy to the physical moving around of

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.229 
toy to the physical moving around of
characters<00:04:02.380> on<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.620> toy<00:04:02.799> pack<00:04:03.070> so<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.970> just

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
characters on the toy pack so it's just

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.300 
characters on the toy pack so it's just
when<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.510> see<00:04:04.750> they<00:04:04.900> took<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.260> toys<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:06.130> want

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
when you see they took the toys you want

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.500 
when you see they took the toys you want
to<00:04:06.400> pick<00:04:06.549> them<00:04:06.700> up<00:04:06.790> you<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.269> play<00:04:07.390> with
