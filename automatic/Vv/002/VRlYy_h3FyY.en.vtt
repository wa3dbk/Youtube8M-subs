without<00:05:09.650> hurting<00:05:10.160> is<00:05:10.400> like<00:05:10.840> wiggling<00:05:11.840> it

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
without hurting is like wiggling it

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.100 
without hurting is like wiggling it
around<00:05:12.700> because<00:05:13.700> like<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:14.000> ball<00:05:14.210> is<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.479> meant

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
around because like the ball is I meant

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.020 
around because like the ball is I meant
to<00:05:15.350> be<00:05:15.560> bigger<00:05:15.860> than<00:05:16.100> your<00:05:16.250> actual<00:05:16.430> nose<00:05:16.790> hole

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
to be bigger than your actual nose hole

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.219 
to be bigger than your actual nose hole
so<00:05:18.040> it<00:05:19.040> just<00:05:19.310> goes<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.669> differently<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.330> it

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
so it just goes in differently and it

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.370 
so it just goes in differently and it
won't<00:05:21.410> come<00:05:21.590> out<00:05:22.390> but<00:05:23.390> it<00:05:23.510> kind<00:05:23.630> of<00:05:23.690> hurts<00:05:23.930> they

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
won't come out but it kind of hurts they

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.260 
won't come out but it kind of hurts they
get<00:05:24.560> first<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.370> first<00:05:25.580> couple<00:05:25.760> months

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
get first but the first couple months

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.600
