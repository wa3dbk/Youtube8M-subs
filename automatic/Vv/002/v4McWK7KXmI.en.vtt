of Japan

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.279 
of Japan
it<00:05:51.669> doesn't<00:05:52.030> appear<00:05:52.300> there<00:05:52.630> was<00:05:52.780> ever<00:05:53.020> any

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
it doesn't appear there was ever any

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.439 
it doesn't appear there was ever any
plans<00:05:53.620> of<00:05:53.979> bringing<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:54.669> game<00:05:54.880> to<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> west

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
plans of bringing this game to the west

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.300 
plans of bringing this game to the west
but<00:05:55.900> I<00:05:55.960> think<00:05:56.229> it<00:05:56.320> may<00:05:56.470> have<00:05:56.620> had<00:05:56.889> something<00:05:57.160> to

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
but I think it may have had something to

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.800 
but I think it may have had something to
do<00:05:57.490> with

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
do with

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.780 
do with
that<00:05:57.960> being<00:05:58.260> just<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.710> few<00:05:58.919> months<00:05:59.250> close<00:05:59.580> to

unfortunately<00:06:04.350> there's<00:06:04.590> no<00:06:04.650> clear<00:06:05.070> answer<00:06:05.100> as

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
unfortunately there's no clear answer as

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.890 
unfortunately there's no clear answer as
to<00:06:05.730> why<00:06:05.910> this<00:06:06.090> game<00:06:06.300> was<00:06:06.450> never<00:06:06.570> released

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
to why this game was never released

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.140 
to why this game was never released
perhaps<00:06:07.740> it<00:06:07.950> was<00:06:08.070> due<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.430> it<00:06:08.580> there<00:06:08.820> already

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
perhaps it was due to it there already

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.659 
perhaps it was due to it there already
