we're<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> creamy<00:02:01.020> ideas<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> fork

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
we're going to creamy ideas with a fork

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.740 
we're going to creamy ideas with a fork
and<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> your<00:02:02.790> opportunity<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.329> try<00:02:03.659> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and this is your opportunity to try and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.449 
and this is your opportunity to try and
make<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:05.689> mine<00:02:06.689> look<00:02:06.899> fine<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.500> they're

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
make your mine look fine and they're

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.830 
make your mine look fine and they're
gonna<00:02:08.610> look<00:02:08.759> even<00:02:09.090> better<00:02:09.300> when<00:02:09.660> they're

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
gonna look even better when they're

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.080 
gonna look even better when they're
puffed<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.379> golden

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
puffed up and golden

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
puffed up and golden
so<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.240> just<00:02:13.480> helps<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:14.350> seal<00:02:14.860> in<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.340> edges

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
so this just helps to seal in the edges

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.660 
so this just helps to seal in the edges
