00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello to all i'm blog margot 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.349
 mec fashion.fr in this video I will 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.519
 present you three beauty recipes to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.080
 coffee grounds 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.759
 so there will be a scrub for the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:24.269
 face a scrub for the body and a 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:25.980
 anti dark circles the coffee grounds is full 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.480
 vitamins and antioxidants especially 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.429
 it will make a scrub for the face 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 perfect then the idea is still to 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.940
 mix it with something so either 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 honey but if you have oil 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 sweet almond it's the perfect mix 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 so I'm going to mix that up at the nose 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 with two spoons of almond oil 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 sweet I have more than to apply it on my 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 face avoiding the eye area 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 so always what is good with the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 coffee grounds is that it's really okay 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.670
 to make a scrub but very very soft the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 coffee grounds it's not big chunks 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 for example sand where I do not know of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.510
 apricot kernel for example not really 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.949
 to make a scrub very very soft so we 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.840
 put that on the face have made small 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.190
 circles on the face and then you 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.140
 can let ask for example 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.350
 two minutes before rinsing with water 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350
 lukewarm 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.750
 among the many properties of Marc 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.430
 of coffee there is also the tensor effect 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.870
 absolutely natural that are found in 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 this product so it's perfect to do 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.440
 a concealer so for that it's going to be 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.760
 very simple I put in a bowl 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.600
 the equivalent of a good spoon to 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.360
 coffee grounds 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.310
 I also took egg white and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.530
 then a tablespoon of honey 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.530
 perfect to make Serbians disappear 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.630
 so now that was going 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.310
 correctly i will stay like this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.560
 two minutes the time it takes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.480
 well then I'll rinse everything with water 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
 lukewarm as usual he cons I 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 know I'm going to do it very 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.770
 delicately because it's for her 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.420
 a skin that is delicate and that would be 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
 beast to make redness under my eyes 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 since we want to remove the cern side 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.830
 so here's the little tip is when 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.830
 even to go 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.640
 the coffee grounds is also an exfoliant 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.140
 natural so it's perfect for a 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.610
 body scrub so the better like 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.319

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.280
