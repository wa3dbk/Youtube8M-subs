00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.660
 as if controlled by magic hands 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.040
 Here's the food on the 15 tables up to 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.820
 there must be a new altitude meter 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.250
 overcome 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.980
 the biggest challenge for pommes 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.929
 and co of looping an absolute 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.270
 world first in the so-called hub 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.760
 restaurant and how it works 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.390
 They look very closely at our young 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.890
 reporter and technology worlds fans ebay 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.380
 Hi, I'm much better at what 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.540
 and today for you for tech tv im 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 europapark I heard here there is 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.200
 really fast food in the truest sense of the word 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.150
 , word and I look now times 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 on 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.920
 At the entrance, the 14-year-old gets one 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.110
 card on it you can load orders 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.030
 and pay later 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.620
 Sibel quickly realizes that everything is here 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 little different than in a normal one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.130
 restaurant so it works here so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.810
 a waiter is pretty much for it 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.520
 Touchscreen with which you can create 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.300
 then just push his card in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.740
 how to get ahead and choose 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.250
 his seat out afterwards you can 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.770
 order sibel leafs in the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.940
 digital menu card finally 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 she chooses one 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.479
 Spring salad and a cola in the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.280
 cart confirm and go the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.470
 order appears immediately on one 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 screen in the kitchen every dish 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.280
 get a sticker with it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.610
 Roller coaster sled accurately identified 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.610
 can be 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 The cooks prepare around 800 daily 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.080
 meals for the fast ride all 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.080
 drive first one floor higher 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.280
 Operations Manager Hans supervises here 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.680
 Heizmann strict the drain if now 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.360
 A mistake happens ends up eating 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.490
 the wrong table we have 15 here 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.090
 they appeared at the respective tables 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.190
 to lead 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.229
 for the upper tables up here 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.300
 we are again so-called lifts 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.729
 those behind them where the food is still eating 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.740
 times to a certain height yard must with it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.570
 it has the natural gradient around then 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.940
 come down corresponding table 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.520
 that is the highest point we have here 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.650
 in the restaurant have nine meters 50 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.420
 that was originally thought of 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.980
 first seven meters and then 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.660
 we found that the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.970
 speed of the sled with the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.560
 product is not enough to him through the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.180
 to get looping and then we had to 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.120
 again raise one and a half meters 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.130
 an apple or an orange we can 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.830
 For example, do not mail because yourself 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.540
 The product in the pot rotates and 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.800
 so it is not suitable then 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.540
 means we have this scoop 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 dishes or other food already 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.220
 have to design that in the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.720
 Potties also have a certain weight 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.640
 that is important because 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.680
 It must have a minimum weight with it 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.880
 it then through the looping and through the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.530
 others seem to go 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.150
 and that was why it was in the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.130
 already very difficult to start 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.130
 consider what we send at all 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.470
 over the rail the second tricky 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.970
 place the high-speed train the 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.610
 curve after looping 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.610
 here the pots were too fast at the beginning 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.230
 and flew off a conveyor system brakes 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.420
 They therefore now on a tolerable 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.190
 pace so that schnitzel and co 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.400
 unscathed to the hungry guests 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.470
 come 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.540
 Michael Mack is the inventor of 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.299
 innovative restaurant systems and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.340
 owner of a small company he owns 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.250
 also the profitable patent on the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.920
 Roller coaster gastronomy how did you come up 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.560
 this idea of ​​club in europapark me 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.650
 I like to cook at home for twelve 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.629
 Guests were cooked then after I left 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.159
 I always cooked between the kitchen 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.620
 and the dining table on the oven bench 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.689
 sat and it is ten meters 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.099
 distance about and then I have me 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:49.200
 think now who is not ideal 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.269
 if the food somehow automatically by 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.310
 the kitchen would come to the table and that was 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.290
 actually the basis of the idea and 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.389
 then I start to puzzle and yes 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.180
 Eventually something came out of it 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.220
 as here the raft has the restaurant 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.930
 around 200 seats and has been around 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.230
 opening almost always full 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.939
 especially young guests are thrilled 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.189
 she quickly comes to eat at the table 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.549
 the probably fast salad of the world 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:16.650
 Of course, in the top of the served 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.190
 green stuff has looping and roller coaster ride 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.669
 well survived and tastes obviously 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.050
 excellent food without looping here 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.970
 have a good appetite 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.660
 Roller coaster rides did just that 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.660
 do it too
