00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.289
 open egg 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.560
 mites that have the sticker here a 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.560
 sticker 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.570
 you have to have nails 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570
 it's a radio 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.110
 Well, we're going to have it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.440
 and the woman the scissors of class 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.680
 and web 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.930
 and is not cut now remembered yes 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.710
 let's have a good time by the way sir 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.100
 on twitter twitter competitive even and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.200
 channel twitter is online at -2 if 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
 you can 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.380
 and good once opened with the three 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.380
 class wounds here 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.619
 let's see if we can open it amanda 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.520
 look at my wig as I treat it 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.100
 we take it out 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.530
 according to the fucking life 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.830
 here we have the scoop as you can see 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.570
 it seems a normal command 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.270
 but when we uncover what 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.600
 we found that it is 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.790
 a playstation 3 mushroom 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.130
 a moment I will lower the volume of 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.000
 good computer we can see a mushroom 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.770
 Playstation 3 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.470
 here the cable because otherwise I would not be worth 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.170
 for the danish the scoop has to be of 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 cable 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.280
 once this is done we know this 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.200
 and we 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.200
 we found two levers 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.860
 or the first time you hit the kids 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:19.120
 and some stops here you can see some stops 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.849
 to slow down so you shoot before or 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.890
 whether the reaction is before the 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.439
 of the command here we see the levers the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.879
 typical palanquita of the spurs that 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.280
 they use one to jump and the other 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.500
 to slash 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.270
 and well they cicle 'ps3 is because 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.480
 theoretically you get much more 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.370
 accuracy that I accept because the truth 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.819
 is that you get a lot more 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.819
 precision
