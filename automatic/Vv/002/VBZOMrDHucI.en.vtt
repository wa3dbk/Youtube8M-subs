a staircase so you can actually access

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.680 
a staircase so you can actually access
pretty<00:03:06.050> much<00:03:06.230> all<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.310> towers<00:03:07.850> let's<00:03:08.480> see<00:03:08.630> if

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
pretty much all the towers let's see if

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.960 
pretty much all the towers let's see if
we<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.900> actually<00:03:09.050> get<00:03:09.350> up<00:03:09.500> there<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:10.760> sure

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
we can actually get up there I'm sure

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.190 
we can actually get up there I'm sure
there's<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.210> ladder<00:03:11.360> somewhere<00:03:11.900> around<00:03:11.960> here

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
there's a ladder somewhere around here

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.120 
there's a ladder somewhere around here
there<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:17.020> and<00:03:18.020> they<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.710> view<00:03:18.950> of

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
there we go and they have the view of

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.870 
there we go and they have the view of
the<00:03:19.430> entire<00:03:19.730> village

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.360 

so<00:03:24.570> I'm<00:03:24.720> now<00:03:24.870> back<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.560> superflat<00:03:26.100> world

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
so I'm now back on my superflat world

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.890 
so I'm now back on my superflat world
and<00:03:26.610> I'll<00:03:26.730> tell<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.150> story<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.510> why<00:03:27.870> I

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
and I'll tell you the story of why I

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.110 
and I'll tell you the story of why I
ended<00:03:28.260> up<00:03:28.410> building<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.860> castle<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.430> actually

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
ended up building a castle I actually

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.180 
ended up building a castle I actually
wanted<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:30.870> build<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.290> medieval<00:03:31.800> prison

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
wanted to build a medieval prison

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.620 
wanted to build a medieval prison
because<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.520> haven't<00:03:32.670> seen<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.450> many

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
because I haven't seen that many

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.260 
because I haven't seen that many
tutorials<00:03:34.080> on<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.560> medieval<00:03:34.860> prison<00:03:35.250> before<00:03:35.520> so

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
tutorials on a medieval prison before so

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.970 
tutorials on a medieval prison before so
I<00:03:36.300> just<00:03:36.390> basically<00:03:36.750> started<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.590> building

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
I just basically started out building

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.370 
I just basically started out building
the<00:03:38.160> initial<00:03:38.730> prisoner<00:03:39.360> cell<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.230> was

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the initial prisoner cell and this was

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.450 
the initial prisoner cell and this was
the<00:03:40.470> best<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.800> could<00:03:40.830> come<00:03:41.130> up<00:03:41.160> with

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
the best I could come up with

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.340 
the best I could come up with
you<00:03:41.580> got<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:41.910> mossy<00:03:42.390> cobblestone<00:03:42.750> which

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
you got this mossy cobblestone which

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.410 
you got this mossy cobblestone which
looks<00:03:43.650> rundown<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.550> got<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> half<00:03:44.970> slab<00:03:45.180> floor

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
looks rundown you got a half slab floor

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.470 
looks rundown you got a half slab floor
which<00:03:45.690> makes<00:03:45.930> quite<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.440> decent<00:03:47.040> prisoner<00:03:47.730> bed

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
which makes quite a decent prisoner bed

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.480 
which makes quite a decent prisoner bed
and<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.230> got<00:03:49.350> these<00:03:49.470> windows<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.100> upside-down

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
and you got these windows of upside-down

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.760 
and you got these windows of upside-down
cobblestone<00:03:51.270> stairs<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.900> toilet<00:03:52.170> which<00:03:52.620> is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
cobblestone stairs and a toilet which is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.770 
cobblestone stairs and a toilet which is
just<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.100> hopper<00:03:53.490> in<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.730> ground<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.570> here's<00:03:54.720> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
just a hopper in the ground so here's a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
just a hopper in the ground so here's a
closer<00:03:55.050> look<00:03:55.320> at<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.550> know<00:03:56.580> I<00:03:56.700> thought

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
closer look at it and you know I thought

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.430 
closer look at it and you know I thought
this<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.210> a<00:03:57.240> really<00:03:57.480> good<00:03:57.750> design<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.350> I'll

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
this was a really good design so I'll

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.110 
this was a really good design so I'll
incorporate<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.400> into<00:03:59.580> my<00:03:59.940> medieval<00:04:00.540> prison

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
incorporate it into my medieval prison

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.670 
incorporate it into my medieval prison
so<00:04:03.120> after<00:04:03.480> searching<00:04:03.690> Google<00:04:04.140> Images<00:04:04.560> I

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
so after searching Google Images I

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.980 
so after searching Google Images I
realized<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.700> most<00:04:05.910> medieval<00:04:06.330> prisons<00:04:06.870> were

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
realized that most medieval prisons were

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.770 
realized that most medieval prisons were
kept<00:04:07.260> inside<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.800> castle<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:08.820> that's<00:04:09.570> where<00:04:09.750> I

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
kept inside a castle so that's where I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.080 
kept inside a castle so that's where I
got<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.110> idea<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:11.160> always<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:11.700> got<00:04:11.820> really

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
got the idea and as always I got really

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.730 
got the idea and as always I got really
carried<00:04:12.270> away<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.870> this<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.320> what<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.560> turned

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
carried away and this is what it turned

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.100 
carried away and this is what it turned
out<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.490> that's<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.780> thought

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.110 
out to be so that's that so I thought

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.990 
out to be so that's that so I thought
I'd<00:04:19.290> show<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.530> one<00:04:19.980> last<00:04:20.160> thing<00:04:20.340> before<00:04:20.760> we<00:04:20.790> go

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
I'd show you one last thing before we go

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.850 
I'd show you one last thing before we go
this<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.510> my<00:04:21.660> first<00:04:21.959> attempt<00:04:22.470> at<00:04:22.500> building

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
this is my first attempt at building

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.220 
this is my first attempt at building
elven<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.730> really<00:04:24.390> don't<00:04:24.570> know<00:04:24.720> what<00:04:24.870> elven

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
elven I really don't know what elven

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.810 
elven I really don't know what elven
looks<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.070> thought<00:04:26.190> I'd<00:04:26.370> build<00:04:26.640> a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
looks like I just thought I'd build a

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.660 
looks like I just thought I'd build a
huge<00:04:27.180> roof<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.750> it'll<00:04:28.020> turn<00:04:28.200> out<00:04:28.260> fine<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:29.280> if

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
huge roof and it'll turn out fine but if

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.430 
huge roof and it'll turn out fine but if
you<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.120> style<00:04:30.360> let<00:04:30.780> me<00:04:30.900> know<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.260> I'll

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
you like the style let me know and I'll

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.470 
you like the style let me know and I'll
build<00:04:31.680> some<00:04:32.010> similar<00:04:32.430> stuff<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.880> hopefully

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
build some similar stuff and hopefully

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.350 
build some similar stuff and hopefully
do<00:04:33.630> some<00:04:33.840> tutorials<00:04:34.590> on<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.580> tower<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:36.090> mean

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
that is old news I built it a long time

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.130 
that is old news I built it a long time
ago<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:39.150> can<00:04:39.330> download<00:04:39.510> it<00:04:39.840> on<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:39.960> new
