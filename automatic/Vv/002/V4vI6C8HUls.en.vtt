00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
I goalkeeper somehow that stain to make

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.500 
I goalkeeper somehow that stain to make
it<00:02:33.450> 5-3<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.440> almost<00:02:35.040> clinch<00:02:35.580> another<00:02:35.820> goal

with<00:02:36.720> hige<00:02:36.960> waivers<00:02:37.440> could<00:02:37.860> not<00:02:38.100> do<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.550> said

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
with hige waivers could not do it I said

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.840 
with hige waivers could not do it I said
always<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.210> can't<00:02:39.360> cross<00:02:40.230> with<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.280> team<00:02:41.610> it's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
always I can't cross with this team it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.600 
always I can't cross with this team it's
so<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:42.930> difficult<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.410> get<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> loss<00:02:43.800> which<00:02:44.340> is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
so so difficult we get a loss which is

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.610 
so so difficult we get a loss which is
one<00:02:44.880> downgrade<00:02:45.480> but<00:02:45.690> we<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.990> get<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.260> goal<00:02:46.470> with

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
one downgrade but we do get a goal with

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.680 
one downgrade but we do get a goal with
hick<00:02:46.800> Wayne<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.310> kind<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> balances<00:02:48.510> itself

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
hick Wayne so kind of balances itself

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.260 
hick Wayne so kind of balances itself
out<00:02:49.050> which<00:02:49.230> means<00:02:49.410> pretty<00:02:49.830> much<00:02:49.950> nothing<00:02:50.820> is

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
out which means pretty much nothing is

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.060 
out which means pretty much nothing is
going<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.690> change<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.500> keep<00:02:52.650> our<00:02:52.830> players

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
going to change so we keep our players

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.790 
going to change so we keep our players
we<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:53.910> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.420> get<00:02:55.050> any<00:02:55.170> upgrades<00:02:55.590> which

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
we don't have to get any upgrades which

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.650 
we don't have to get any upgrades which
it's<00:02:56.760> actually<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.150> bit<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.420> shame<00:02:57.630> I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
it's actually a little bit of a shame I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.710 
it's actually a little bit of a shame I
kind<00:02:58.050> of<00:02:58.110> hoped<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.790> could<00:02:59.820> pull<00:03:00.540> off<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
kind of hoped that we could pull off a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.050 
kind of hoped that we could pull off a
comeback<00:03:01.320> so<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:02.160> downgrade<00:03:02.670> for<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.910> loss

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
comeback so one downgrade for the loss

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
comeback so one downgrade for the loss
of<00:03:03.209> one<00:03:03.390> upgrade<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.930> higway<00:03:04.110> goal<00:03:04.530> no

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
of one upgrade for the higway goal no

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.120 
of one upgrade for the higway goal no
upgrades<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.700> total<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.420> team<00:03:06.660> stays<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:07.380> it

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
upgrades in total the team stays as it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.300 
upgrades in total the team stays as it
is<00:03:08.430> hopefully<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.720> next<00:03:09.900> game<00:03:10.260> will<00:03:10.890> be<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
is hopefully the next game will be a

three upgrades for our team in the next

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900 
three upgrades for our team in the next
episode<00:04:54.350> which<00:04:54.920> is<00:04:55.130> pretty<00:04:55.370> good<00:04:55.640> so<00:04:55.790> we're

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
episode which is pretty good so we're

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.360 
episode which is pretty good so we're
finally<00:04:56.420> getting<00:04:57.350> somewhere<00:04:57.380> three<00:04:57.980> upgrades

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
finally getting somewhere three upgrades

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.100 
finally getting somewhere three upgrades
is<00:04:58.520> actually<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.910> pretty<00:04:59.150> substantial<00:04:59.870> amount

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
is actually a pretty substantial amount

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.830 
is actually a pretty substantial amount
and<00:05:00.170> we<00:05:00.260> could<00:05:00.380> probably<00:05:00.470> upgrade<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.840> silver

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
and we could probably upgrade the silver

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.580 
and we could probably upgrade the silver
non<00:05:03.530> rare<00:05:03.800> striker<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.330> non<00:05:05.780> rare<00:05:06.050> gold<00:05:06.350> if

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
non rare striker to a non rare gold if

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.260 
non rare striker to a non rare gold if
we<00:05:06.980> wanted<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.520> could<00:05:07.790> probably<00:05:08.000> get

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
we wanted to I could probably get

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.510 
we wanted to I could probably get
Palacio<00:05:08.870> or<00:05:09.020> some<00:05:09.140> of<00:05:09.170> that<00:05:09.380> but<00:05:09.650> i'm<00:05:09.920> thinking

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
Palacio or some of that but i'm thinking

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.820 
Palacio or some of that but i'm thinking
i<00:05:10.640> should<00:05:10.670> probably<00:05:10.970> upgrade<00:05:11.390> some<00:05:12.260> of<00:05:12.590> the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
i should probably upgrade some of the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.070 
i should probably upgrade some of the
non-rev<00:05:13.310> bronzes<00:05:13.760> i<00:05:13.820> could<00:05:14.030> upgrade<00:05:14.300> those

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
non-rev bronzes i could upgrade those

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.890 
non-rev bronzes i could upgrade those
two<00:05:15.320> red<00:05:15.500> ones<00:05:15.740> and<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:16.220> actually<00:05:16.400> be

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
two red ones and it actually be

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.320 
two red ones and it actually be
