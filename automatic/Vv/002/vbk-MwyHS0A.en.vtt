um inner evil you know there's a lot of

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.800 
um inner evil you know there's a lot of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
but definitely in my opinion it's the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.900 
but definitely in my opinion it's the
inner<00:03:51.810> quincy<00:03:52.290> within<00:03:52.590> him<00:03:52.800> uh<00:03:53.010> whether<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.790> be

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
inner quincy within him uh whether it be

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.630 
inner quincy within him uh whether it be
a<00:03:53.940> manifestation<00:03:54.300> of<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:55.070> actual<00:03:56.070> juhabach

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
because pretty much this entire time

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.979 
because pretty much this entire time
when<00:04:14.940> we<00:04:15.030> saw<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.239> younger<00:04:15.630> version<00:04:15.930> of

when we saw the younger version of

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.990 
when we saw the younger version of
zangetsu<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.830> then<00:04:17.220> we<00:04:17.310> saw<00:04:17.489> old<00:04:17.669> zangetsu

zangetsu and then we saw old zangetsu

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.759 
zangetsu and then we saw old zangetsu
and<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.720> wasn't<00:04:18.870> even<00:04:19.049> an<00:04:19.320> old<00:04:19.530> guy

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
and that wasn't even an old guy

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.320 
and that wasn't even an old guy
apparently<00:04:20.220> because<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.640> thousand<00:04:21.120> years

of what the way he connected this it was

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.700 
of what the way he connected this it was
really<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.730> bombshell<00:04:36.970> just<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.930> bombshell<00:04:38.140> now

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.140 
final getsugatensho its possibility
there's<00:04:50.890> different<00:04:51.340> manifestations<00:04:52.000> and

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
there's different manifestations and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.250 
there's different manifestations and
that's<00:04:52.300> where<00:04:52.480> final<00:04:52.720> against<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> potential

that's where final against a potential

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.870 
that's where final against a potential
came<00:04:53.590> from<00:04:53.770> because<00:04:54.040> we<00:04:54.370> didn't<00:04:54.580> really<00:04:54.700> get

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
came from because we didn't really get

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.790 
came from because we didn't really get
the<00:04:54.940> ins<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.780> outs<00:04:55.900> of<00:04:56.080> how<00:04:56.230> each<00:04:56.440> go<00:04:56.620> learn

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
the ins and outs of how each go learn

final getsugatensho we didn't really get
that<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.440> it<00:04:59.560> makes<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.830> think<00:05:00.010> all<00:05:00.790> right<00:05:00.850> how

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.490 
that so it makes you think all right how
did<00:05:01.840> he<00:05:02.080> learn<00:05:02.230> it

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500

honestly<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:11.860> just<00:05:11.920> really<00:05:12.370> depends<00:05:12.730> on<00:05:12.910> where

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090

writing<00:05:15.100> I<00:05:15.250> think<00:05:15.310> there<00:05:15.730> might<00:05:15.850> be<00:05:15.910> a

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
writing I think there might be a

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.960 
writing I think there might be a
connection<00:05:16.300> there<00:05:16.510> overall<00:05:17.700> because<00:05:18.700> I<00:05:18.850> was

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
connection there overall because I was

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.010 
connection there overall because I was

everything<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:27.010> writing<00:05:27.400> just<00:05:27.550> became<00:05:28.180> so

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
everything the writing just became so

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.870 
everything the writing just became so
much<00:05:28.600> more<00:05:28.660> solid<00:05:29.050> like<00:05:29.290> Kubo<00:05:29.740> made<00:05:30.700> the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
much more solid like Kubo made the

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.220 
much more solid like Kubo made the
writing<00:05:31.240> so<00:05:31.420> much<00:05:31.540> more<00:05:31.750> solid<00:05:31.960> with

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
writing so much more solid with

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.920 
writing so much more solid with
disconnecting<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.010> now<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:34.060> also<00:05:34.270> makes<00:05:34.780> you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
disconnecting this now it also makes you

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.600 
disconnecting this now it also makes you
beg<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.260> question<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.740> know<00:05:35.800> some<00:05:36.220> people<00:05:36.460> might

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
beg to question I know some people might

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.460 
beg to question I know some people might
not<00:05:36.640> have<00:05:37.000> followed<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.390> anime<00:05:37.720> some<00:05:38.200> people

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
might not have a watch some of the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.880 
might not have a watch some of the
fillers<00:05:41.700> zanpakutou<00:05:42.700> rebellion<00:05:43.450> arc<00:05:43.890> was

fillers zanpakutou rebellion arc was

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.100 
fillers zanpakutou rebellion arc was
that<00:05:45.130> some<00:05:45.370> sort<00:05:45.610> of<00:05:45.670> foreshadowing<00:05:46.150> Kubo

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
that some sort of foreshadowing Kubo

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.140 
that some sort of foreshadowing Kubo
telling<00:05:47.440> them<00:05:47.560> yo<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:48.310> can<00:05:48.520> do<00:05:48.670> that<00:05:48.880> because

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
telling them yo you can do that because

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.760 
telling them yo you can do that because
at<00:05:49.480> some<00:05:49.660> given<00:05:49.900> point<00:05:49.960> something<00:05:50.560> might

at some given point something might

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.500 
at some given point something might

happen along the lines of that that

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.970 
happen along the lines of that that
really<00:05:52.720> makes<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:52.990> think<00:05:53.170> how<00:05:53.350> long<00:05:53.590> Kubo

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
really makes you think how long Kubo

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.060 
really makes you think how long Kubo
might<00:05:54.430> have<00:05:54.550> had<00:05:54.700> this<00:05:54.910> in<00:05:55.090> store<00:05:55.390> for<00:05:55.570> us<00:05:55.630> and

might have had this in store for us and

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
might have had this in store for us and
overall<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.220> connection<00:05:57.640> with<00:05:57.730> everything

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
hell did Juha box thousand year old self

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.350 
hell did Juha box thousand year old self
pretty<00:06:06.070> much<00:06:06.190> sneak<00:06:06.520> his<00:06:06.700> way<00:06:06.730> into<00:06:07.090> the

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
pretty much sneak his way into the

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.050 
pretty much sneak his way into the
zanpakuto<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:07.960> become<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:09.460> know<00:06:09.580> song

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
zanpakuto and become the you know song

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.120 
zanpakuto and become the you know song
again<00:06:10.240> so<00:06:10.390> did<00:06:10.510> he<00:06:10.600> kill<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.020> real<00:06:11.230> zangetsu<00:06:11.500> I

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
again so did he kill the real zangetsu I

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.310 
again so did he kill the real zangetsu I
think<00:06:12.790> is<00:06:12.910> possibility<00:06:13.510> he<00:06:13.720> killed<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.140> real

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
think is possibility he killed the real

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.890 
think is possibility he killed the real
zangetsu<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:15.520> take<00:06:15.730> that<00:06:15.940> place<00:06:16.540> you<00:06:16.690> know<00:06:16.780> as

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
zangetsu to take that place you know as

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.970 
zangetsu to take that place you know as
the<00:06:17.110> Guardian<00:06:17.500> for<00:06:17.980> Ichigo<00:06:18.520> and<00:06:18.730> that's<00:06:19.510> why

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
the Guardian for Ichigo and that's why

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.220 
the Guardian for Ichigo and that's why
basically<00:06:20.980> Lee<00:06:21.850> Maya<00:06:22.060> said<00:06:22.420> say<00:06:22.900> goodbye<00:06:23.170> to

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
basically Lee Maya said say goodbye to

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.840 
basically Lee Maya said say goodbye to
zangetsu<00:06:23.500> because<00:06:24.130> it's<00:06:24.280> on<00:06:24.400> guess<00:06:24.580> who<00:06:24.700> he

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
zangetsu because it's on guess who he

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.540 
zangetsu because it's on guess who he
knew<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.410> basically<00:06:26.410> not<00:06:26.680> John<00:06:27.010> gets<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.400> and

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
knew is basically not John gets to and

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.610 
knew is basically not John gets to and
probably<00:06:28.090> zangetsu<00:06:28.300> is<00:06:28.720> dead<00:06:28.930> so<00:06:29.410> he's<00:06:29.500> gonna

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
probably zangetsu is dead so he's gonna

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.960 
probably zangetsu is dead so he's gonna
have<00:06:29.800> to<00:06:29.890> get<00:06:29.980> a<00:06:30.040> whole<00:06:30.220> new<00:06:30.250> being<00:06:30.580> in<00:06:30.730> it<00:06:30.850> and

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
have to get a whole new being in it and

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.240 
have to get a whole new being in it and
you<00:06:31.360> know<00:06:31.480> completely<00:06:32.020> different<00:06:32.260> but<00:06:33.070> the

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
you know completely different but the

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.159 
you know completely different but the
being<00:06:33.460> might<00:06:34.090> be<00:06:34.240> something<00:06:34.660> similar<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.140> what

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
being might be something similar to what

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.790 
being might be something similar to what
you've<00:06:35.350> seen

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
you've seen

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.890 
you've seen
maybe<00:06:36.100> final<00:06:36.490> gets<00:06:36.640> a<00:06:36.730> potential<00:06:37.240> form<00:06:37.540> and

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
maybe final gets a potential form and

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.240 
maybe final gets a potential form and
we've<00:06:38.140> seen<00:06:38.290> that<00:06:38.410> little<00:06:38.500> bodyguard<00:06:38.890> thing

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
we've seen that little bodyguard thing

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.250 
we've seen that little bodyguard thing
maybe

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
maybe

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.960 
maybe
was<00:06:40.380> actually<00:06:40.770> something<00:06:40.980> like<00:06:41.580> along<00:06:41.850> the

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
was actually something like along the

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.910 
was actually something like along the
lines<00:06:42.150> of<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:42.480> actual<00:06:43.170> spirit<00:06:43.500> that<00:06:43.680> should

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
lines of the actual spirit that should
