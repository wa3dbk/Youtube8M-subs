like<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.290> looks<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.070> think

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
like this it looks like this I think

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
like this it looks like this I think
that's<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:40.230> air

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
that's it this is basically just air

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.229 
that's it this is basically just air
hardening<00:00:41.370> modeling<00:00:41.910> material<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.290> just

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
hardening modeling material so you just

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
hardening modeling material so you just
like<00:00:45.239> clay<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.559> shaped

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
like clay basically so you just shaped

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.510 
like clay basically so you just shaped
and<00:00:47.570> work<00:00:48.570> with<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.110> little<00:00:49.320> bit<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.980> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
