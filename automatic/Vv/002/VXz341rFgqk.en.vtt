00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
that was sunday it is yeah was it had to

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.520 
that was sunday it is yeah was it had to
be<00:03:08.580> sunday<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.960> yeah<00:03:10.650> so<00:03:11.130> i<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.489> measured<00:03:12.530> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
be sunday so yeah so i just measured the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.910 
be sunday so yeah so i just measured the
diameter<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.600> laid<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.959> flat<00:03:16.170> and

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
diameter of that so I laid it flat and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.040 
diameter of that so I laid it flat and
took<00:03:17.550> that<00:03:17.580> measurement<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.390> doubled<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
took that measurement and I doubled it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.979 
took that measurement and I doubled it
and<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.739> that's<00:03:19.920> how<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.190> knew<00:03:20.520> how<00:03:21.360> long<00:03:21.690> to

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
and so that's how I knew how long to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.390 
and so that's how I knew how long to
make<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.320> because<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.830> fold<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.370> half

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
make it because when you fold it in half

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000 
make it because when you fold it in half
and<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.380> piece<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.620> fabric

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
and really it's just a piece of fabric

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.690 
and really it's just a piece of fabric
that<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.459> fold<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.360> half<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.520> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
that you fold in half and you so so the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.930 
that you fold in half and you so so the
scenes<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.660> sides<00:03:30.900> together<00:03:31.170> BAM<00:03:32.130> you<00:03:32.550> got

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.259 
because it's the same thing it's secure
but<00:06:31.809> it's<00:06:32.019> not<00:06:32.439> it's<00:06:32.889> not<00:06:33.039> super<00:06:33.699> tight<00:06:33.939> so

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:34.269 
but it's not it's not super tight so

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.119 
but it's not it's not super tight so
it's<00:06:34.419> not<00:06:34.629> going<00:06:35.019> to<00:06:35.139> put<00:06:35.319> that<00:06:35.349> stress<00:06:35.949> on

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:36.129 
it's not going to put that stress on

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.969 
it's not going to put that stress on
your<00:06:36.249> edges<00:06:36.729> or<00:06:37.449> make<00:06:37.719> your<00:06:37.869> head<00:06:38.199> feel<00:06:38.229> tight

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
your edges or make your head feel tight

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:40.679 
your edges or make your head feel tight
and<00:06:39.249> things<00:06:39.459> like<00:06:39.609> that<00:06:39.669> I<00:06:39.999> just<00:06:40.299> remember

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
and things like that I just remember

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.889 
and things like that I just remember
doing<00:06:40.899> those<00:06:41.199> puffs<00:06:41.619> like<00:06:42.489> when<00:06:42.879> I<00:06:42.909> first<00:06:43.479> did

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:43.899 
doing those puffs like when I first did

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:46.019 
doing those puffs like when I first did
my<00:06:44.169> big<00:06:44.439> chopper<00:06:44.829> you<00:06:44.979> know<00:06:45.129> when<00:06:45.759> I<00:06:45.789> had

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.029 
my big chopper you know when I had

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:48.979 
my big chopper you know when I had
enough<00:06:46.299> hair<00:06:46.509> to<00:06:46.539> do<00:06:46.869> like<00:06:47.110> a<00:06:47.349> small<00:06:48.039> puff<00:06:48.399> and

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:48.989 
enough hair to do like a small puff and

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:51.059 
enough hair to do like a small puff and
you<00:06:49.989> know<00:06:50.139> you<00:06:50.199> have<00:06:50.409> to<00:06:50.529> wrap<00:06:50.769> it<00:06:50.949> around

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
you know you have to wrap it around

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.279 
you know you have to wrap it around
usually<00:06:51.519> twice<00:06:51.759> because<00:06:52.029> once<00:06:52.419> is<00:06:52.689> too<00:06:52.929> loose

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
usually twice because once is too loose

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.239 
usually twice because once is too loose
and<00:06:53.919> I<00:06:54.899> would<00:06:55.899> literally<00:06:56.289> have<00:06:56.499> headaches<00:06:57.009> and

00:06:57.239 --> 00:06:57.249 
and I would literally have headaches and

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:59.100 
and I would literally have headaches and
be<00:06:57.369> like<00:06:57.519> light<00:06:57.849> headed<00:06:58.299> and<00:06:58.389> stuff<00:06:58.719> it<00:06:58.959> was

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
be like light headed and stuff it was

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.279 
be like light headed and stuff it was
not<00:06:59.439> the<00:06:59.829> business<00:07:00.399> so<00:07:00.819> there<00:07:01.629> are<00:07:01.659> other

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:02.289 
not the business so there are other

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.449 
not the business so there are other
alternatives<00:07:03.029> to<00:07:04.029> that<00:07:04.299> and<00:07:04.629> again<00:07:05.379> too<00:07:05.769> if

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:06.459 
alternatives to that and again too if

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:10.589 
alternatives to that and again too if
you<00:07:07.449> so<00:07:07.749> you<00:07:08.469> can<00:07:08.649> modify<00:07:09.069> the<00:07:09.309> tube<00:07:09.909> so<00:07:10.509> you

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
you so you can modify the tube so you

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.219
