still very manageable the bike I've
ridden<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.670> bike<00:03:52.820> in<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.330> both<00:03:53.770> positions<00:03:54.770> and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
ridden the bike in in both positions and

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.590 
ridden the bike in in both positions and
it<00:03:55.310> handles<00:03:56.410> more<00:03:57.520> easy<00:03:58.520> going<00:03:58.700> at<00:03:59.120> low<00:03:59.240> speeds

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
it handles more easy going at low speeds

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.970 
it handles more easy going at low speeds
in<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.900> lower<00:04:00.050> position<00:04:00.260> instead<00:04:00.920> of

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
in the lower position instead of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.790 
in the lower position instead of
reaching<00:04:01.820> with<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.030> high<00:04:02.210> bars<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.710> know

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
you know wins it's strange what I think

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.449 
you know wins it's strange what I think
about<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.900> bike<00:04:09.200> being<00:04:09.500> convertible<00:04:10.310> I'm

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
about a bike being convertible I'm

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.310 
about a bike being convertible I'm
thinking<00:04:10.880> about<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.120> top<00:04:11.420> case<00:04:11.720> coming<00:04:12.050> off

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
thinking about a top case coming off

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.229 
thinking about a top case coming off
four<00:04:12.590> bags<00:04:12.770> coming<00:04:13.190> up<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.489> never<00:04:13.790> would<00:04:14.209> have

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
four bags coming up I never would have

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.510 
four bags coming up I never would have
thought<00:04:14.360> of<00:04:14.690> adjustable<00:04:15.560> bars<00:04:15.800> is<00:04:16.220> being<00:04:16.459> a

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
thought of adjustable bars is being a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.890 
thought of adjustable bars is being a
convertible<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.120> it<00:04:17.209> does<00:04:17.359> provide<00:04:17.690> two

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
convertible but it does provide two

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900 
convertible but it does provide two
different<00:04:18.200> types<00:04:18.350> of<00:04:18.500> riding<00:04:18.650> experience<00:04:19.040> it

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
different types of riding experience it

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.580 
different types of riding experience it
