tutorial for spiral matrix this is

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.929 
tutorial for spiral matrix this is
stitched<00:00:05.680> by<00:00:06.040> first<00:00:06.370> setting<00:00:06.759> your

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:06.939 
stitched by first setting your

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.170 
stitched by first setting your
foundation<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:08.290> matrix<00:00:08.980> so<00:00:09.670> you're<00:00:09.940> going

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
foundation with matrix so you're going

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.080 
foundation with matrix so you're going
to<00:00:10.330> stitch<00:00:10.600> long<00:00:11.230> Wiggly<00:00:12.040> lines<00:00:12.250> across<00:00:12.760> your

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
to stitch long Wiggly lines across your

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.109 
to stitch long Wiggly lines across your
quilting<00:00:13.420> space<00:00:13.780> then<00:00:14.710> travel<00:00:15.400> along<00:00:15.910> the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:16.119 
quilting space then travel along the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.579 
quilting space then travel along the
edge<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:18.300> echo<00:00:19.300> that<00:00:19.570> line<00:00:19.810> with<00:00:20.380> another

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
edge and echo that line with another

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.579 
edge and echo that line with another
wiggly<00:00:21.099> line<00:00:21.339> an<00:00:21.789> equal<00:00:22.419> distance<00:00:22.869> away<00:00:23.109> so

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
wiggly line an equal distance away so

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.640 
wiggly line an equal distance away so
I'm<00:00:24.189> stitching<00:00:24.460> about<00:00:24.880> an<00:00:25.029> inch<00:00:25.359> away<00:00:25.720> from<00:00:26.439> my

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
I'm stitching about an inch away from my

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.980 
I'm stitching about an inch away from my
first<00:00:26.890> line<00:00:27.130> of<00:00:27.159> stitching<00:00:27.699> and<00:00:28.659> you're<00:00:28.810> just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
first line of stitching and you're just

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.090 
first line of stitching and you're just
going<00:00:29.199> to<00:00:29.259> fill<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.789> entire<00:00:31.259> side<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.740> your

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
going to fill the entire side of your

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.840 
going to fill the entire side of your
quilting<00:00:33.820> motif<00:00:34.150> of<00:00:34.630> your<00:00:34.810> quilting<00:00:35.110> space

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
quilting motif of your quilting space

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.720 
quilting motif of your quilting space
with<00:00:36.850> these<00:00:37.060> long<00:00:37.330> Wiggly<00:00:37.750> lines<00:00:37.960> and<00:00:38.620> you<00:00:39.580> can

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
with these long Wiggly lines and you can

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.240 
with these long Wiggly lines and you can
see<00:00:39.760> just<00:00:40.120> how<00:00:40.510> fast<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.290> fills<00:00:41.620> whenever

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
see just how fast this fills whenever

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.380 
see just how fast this fills whenever
you<00:00:42.640> stitch<00:00:43.120> with<00:00:43.720> a<00:00:43.750> nice<00:00:44.110> wide<00:00:44.560> echo<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:46.210> when

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
you stitch with a nice wide echo so when

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.210 
you stitch with a nice wide echo so when
I'm<00:00:46.510> stitching<00:00:46.900> this<00:00:47.020> an<00:00:47.230> inch<00:00:47.380> apart<00:00:47.560> I<00:00:48.010> could

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
I'm stitching this an inch apart I could

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.270 
I'm stitching this an inch apart I could
potentially<00:00:48.880> fill<00:00:49.180> an<00:00:49.780> entire<00:00:50.170> quilt<00:00:50.830> in<00:00:51.160> a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
potentially fill an entire quilt in a

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.570 
potentially fill an entire quilt in a
matter<00:00:51.520> of<00:00:51.610> hours<00:00:52.150> it's<00:00:52.540> very<00:00:52.780> very<00:00:53.020> fast<00:00:53.580> once

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
matter of hours it's very very fast once

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.360 
matter of hours it's very very fast once
you<00:00:54.760> get<00:00:54.940> one<00:00:55.600> side<00:00:55.870> filled<00:00:56.410> then<00:00:57.190> you're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
you get one side filled then you're

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.590 
you get one side filled then you're
gonna<00:00:57.490> branch<00:00:57.790> off<00:00:58.000> in<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.210> opposite

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
gonna branch off in the opposite

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.260 
gonna branch off in the opposite
direction<00:00:58.750> again<00:00:59.680> with<00:00:59.920> nice<00:01:00.160> long<00:01:00.670> Wiggly

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
direction again with nice long Wiggly

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.570 
direction again with nice long Wiggly
lines<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:02.260> you<00:01:02.650> want<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.890> keep<00:01:03.010> your<00:01:03.190> echoes

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
lines and you want to keep your echoes

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.239 
lines and you want to keep your echoes
consistent<00:01:04.210> so<00:01:04.659> on<00:01:04.989> this<00:01:05.170> side<00:01:05.439> I'm<00:01:05.649> traveling

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
consistent so on this side I'm traveling

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.819 
consistent so on this side I'm traveling
about<00:01:06.490> an<00:01:06.640> inch<00:01:06.850> before<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.509> echo<00:01:08.020> just<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
about an inch before I echo just the

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.179 
about an inch before I echo just the
same<00:01:09.039> way<00:01:09.219> I<00:01:09.249> did<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.609> the<00:01:09.729> opposite<00:01:10.149> side<00:01:10.359> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
same way I did on the opposite side and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.130 
same way I did on the opposite side and
this<00:01:12.189> is<00:01:12.369> your<00:01:12.520> foundation<00:01:12.700> this<00:01:13.689> is<00:01:13.869> what<00:01:14.049> you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
this is your foundation this is what you

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.010 
this is your foundation this is what you
set<00:01:14.409> first<00:01:14.770> before<00:01:15.249> going<00:01:15.850> in<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:16.420> filling

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
set first before going in and filling

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.039 
set first before going in and filling
the<00:01:17.950> squares<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.909> little<00:01:19.179> Wiggly<00:01:19.569> squares

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
the squares the little Wiggly squares

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.819 
the squares the little Wiggly squares
with<00:01:21.009> spirals<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.689> let's<00:01:22.899> fast<00:01:23.140> forward<00:01:23.259> here

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:23.829 
with spirals so let's fast forward here

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.669 
with spirals so let's fast forward here
so<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.249> way<00:01:24.399> you<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.729> see<00:01:25.030> how<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.679> second

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
so that way you can see how the second

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.309 
so that way you can see how the second
half<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.069> this<00:01:27.189> design<00:01:27.579> works<00:01:28.109> first<00:01:29.109> you're

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
half of this design works first you're

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.249 
half of this design works first you're
going<00:01:29.469> to<00:01:29.560> travel<00:01:30.189> your<00:01:30.399> way<00:01:30.579> into<00:01:30.969> a<00:01:31.840> square

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
going to travel your way into a square

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.940 
going to travel your way into a square
and<00:01:32.759> Stitch<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:34.119> square<00:01:34.780> spiral<00:01:35.590> you're

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
and Stitch a square spiral you're

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.230 
and Stitch a square spiral you're
basically<00:01:36.369> echoing<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.749> shape<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.909> set

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
basically echoing the shape that is set

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.410 
basically echoing the shape that is set
by<00:01:40.569> the<00:01:40.630> wiggly<00:01:41.499> matrix<00:01:42.009> square<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.850> you're

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
by the wiggly matrix square and you're

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.569 
by the wiggly matrix square and you're
going<00:01:43.719> inside<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.259> filling<00:01:44.649> that<00:01:44.799> with<00:01:45.549> a

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
going inside and filling that with a

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.719 
going inside and filling that with a
spiral<00:01:46.229> once<00:01:47.229> you<00:01:47.380> get<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.679> the<00:01:47.829> center<00:01:48.130> just

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
spiral once you get to the center just

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.020 
spiral once you get to the center just
travel<00:01:49.270> your<00:01:49.479> way<00:01:49.659> all<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.289> way<00:01:50.319> back<00:01:50.679> out

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
travel your way all the way back out

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.459 
travel your way all the way back out
back<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:53.310> gridlines<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:55.229> from<00:01:56.229> there

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
back to the gridlines and from there

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.379 
back to the gridlines and from there
you'll<00:01:56.679> just<00:01:56.740> simply<00:01:57.100> travel<00:01:57.670> along<00:01:58.179> the

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
you'll just simply travel along the

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.899 
you'll just simply travel along the
gridlines<00:01:58.959> to<00:01:59.380> get<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.709> the<00:01:59.829> next<00:02:00.219> square<00:02:00.399> and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
gridlines to get to the next square and

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.289 
gridlines to get to the next square and
I<00:02:01.689> only<00:02:02.170> filled<00:02:02.529> my<00:02:03.340> squares<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.999> kind<00:02:04.240> of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
I only filled my squares I kind of

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.779 
I only filled my squares I kind of
filled<00:02:04.479> them<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.810> checkerboard<00:02:05.469> pattern<00:02:05.789> so

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
filled them in a checkerboard pattern so

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.399 
filled them in a checkerboard pattern so
I<00:02:06.819> would<00:02:07.209> move<00:02:07.389> from<00:02:07.749> here<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.080> would<00:02:08.259> move

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
I would move from here I would move

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.449 
I would move from here I would move
diagonally<00:02:09.340> down<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.780> fill<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:11.920> square<00:02:12.250> that

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
diagonally down to fill the square that

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.399 
diagonally down to fill the square that
is<00:02:12.640> die

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
is die

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.199
