of string cut another long piece glue it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.039 
of string cut another long piece glue it
on<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.700> keep<00:02:19.910> wrapping<00:02:20.329> now<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.870> way

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
on and keep wrapping now this way

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.930 
on and keep wrapping now this way
totally<00:02:21.380> works<00:02:21.769> but<00:02:22.069> each<00:02:22.220> time<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:22.519> wrap<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
totally works but each time you wrap the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.520 
totally works but each time you wrap the
twine<00:02:23.180> around<00:02:23.630> you'll<00:02:23.900> need<00:02:24.109> to<00:02:24.230> put<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
twine around you'll need to put the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.319 
twine around you'll need to put the
entire<00:02:24.859> bunch<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.340> string<00:02:25.639> through<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.030> hole

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
entire bunch of string through the hole

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.089 
entire bunch of string through the hole
so<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.599> don't<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:27.049> ton<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.349> tangled<00:02:27.859> loops

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
so you don't have a ton of tangled loops

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.039 
so you don't have a ton of tangled loops
which<00:02:28.669> can<00:02:28.910> be<00:02:29.030> kind<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.299> time-consuming<00:02:29.780> and

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
which can be kind of time-consuming and

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.690 
which can be kind of time-consuming and
annoying<00:02:30.440> Grayson<00:02:31.069> came<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> little

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
annoying Grayson came up with a little

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.280 
annoying Grayson came up with a little
quicker<00:02:31.970> way<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:32.239> wrap<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.720> ring<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.109> make

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
quicker way to wrap the ring so make

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.319 
quicker way to wrap the ring so make
sure<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.590> watch<00:02:33.769> his<00:02:33.980> version<00:02:34.340> next<00:02:34.519> if<00:02:35.180> you

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
sure you watch his version next if you

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.940 
sure you watch his version next if you
find<00:02:35.569> you<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:35.720> gaps<00:02:35.989> where<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> cereal<00:02:36.769> box

find you have gaps where the cereal box

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.949 
find you have gaps where the cereal box
shows<00:02:37.220> through<00:02:37.549> just<00:02:38.030> go<00:02:38.120> over<00:02:38.299> those<00:02:38.540> areas
