00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hail guys, everyone is fine. 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.990
 to the fishing channel or to the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.040
 video of today we will make a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.429
 shrimp indicator only indicator 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.310
 tunado good in my case the comrades 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.010
 fishing but I use this heat to here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 climb chicken fillet to fish 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.890
 piapara and curimba will need a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.130
 bait 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 you take a stuck bait a bait 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.800
 busted you have this is a new bait 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 only it is a ladder that came from china is 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.340
 very good, this bait is not right 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.309
 A handle nothing is a good quiet because 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.610
 You no longer need if I have it here. 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 two laughs 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.899
 it's them you can use between eight and nine 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 centimeters but will depend on the shrimp 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.649
 that you use as the exclusive use 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 for fillet of chicken does not have to be 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.619
 very big are you studying here? 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.619
 finds if wire is one millimeter and 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.200
 mail only what I think is nice beyond 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 be of nox it is really quite rigid and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.140
 not a normal wire is an area of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.299
 solder and uses it to weld to a weld 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.409
 flame tig this one finds in store of 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.270
 tool wrenches where it sells 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.979
 products for welding 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.290
 Can you buy a cow had come a 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 metro you can do countless things 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.909
 This is a minute and a half right here. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.250
 So you do not need 2 I got one. 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.990
 bit here of two pieces of box 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.070
 and one very important thing is the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.740
 Next this bait is you will need 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.100
 cut a piece here from the back 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.540
 her to put her two 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.460
 wires and what happens 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.689
 The more commands you can see 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.290
 economic 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.350
 so the more you cut is up 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.770
 here for the bigger bait is going to be the hole 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.610
 Then what happens to you? 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 will have a distance between these two 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.590
 wires here the two major safeguards 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 one farther from the other 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.540
 What happens to you, you'll be able to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.390
 put bigger ambitions as a fishing 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.269
 of a sink is very small 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.700
 So I do not need to go far to here. 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.050
 top of what I'm going to cut to a 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.420
 centimeter 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 so I'll give you an opening of 2 or 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.489
 3mm but will cut to 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.760
 little for you not to lose your 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.150
 So I'll cut it with a sawdust 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.670
 I'll mix the powder mix xxi 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.950
 and then we'll come back and stick it here 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.959
 Beauty, I'll take it, I'll have to stay. 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.349
 serrinha was not very smooth here stayed 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.510
 a burr then I can take it out here with 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:03.930
 The little skull and the beauty that we 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.410
 will next step to do your part of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.440
 drilling I'll get a drill bit and 45 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.829
 and I'll make a hole you can 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 handle with pliers so you can 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.910
 protect or with a glove is best not 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.920
 I already made a small hole there to 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:31.730
 to score and now I'm just going to pass the drill 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:37.739
 biggest ever made fury for the two 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:40.500
 the two stems here to enter here and 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.060
 Then I'll find a distance that the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.359
 people are going to make an interesting deal 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.560
 that we can be doing here or 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:53.310
 with one with a line something or 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.780
 it may be until you close the tips 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.419
 here o 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.730
 You shave two balls well 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:07.889
 so little I think a 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:12.870
 ideal quantity and here I made do I did 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:15.780
 a tip on them you can use a sandpaper 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.250
 something like this takes longer but it gives 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:25.320
 to do with the trash too and now I'm going 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.620
 put it here in his account and 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.220
 I want to 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.220
 the space 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:40.870
 so I'm going to push him here oh 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.800
 leave room here to produce sounds 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.360
 that I use such quite then here in the 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
 end should have an opening of the two 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.800
 mm let dry 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.960
 That's the tip of the shrimp indicator. 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.340
 good chicken indicator as well 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.620
 custom 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.440
 another option for those who do not have 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:06.100
 want to use bait is to do with the antenna with 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.150
 a disc with an antenna 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.210
 It's very cool. 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.949

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.820
