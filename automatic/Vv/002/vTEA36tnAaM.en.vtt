looks exactly exactly exactly exactly
the<00:03:33.700> same<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:34.180> don't<00:03:34.720> think<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.139> Mike<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
the same I don't think that Mike the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.220 
the same I don't think that Mike the
real<00:03:35.889> Mike<00:03:35.950> record<00:03:36.609> actually<00:03:37.000> has<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.720> print

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
and this is like a crocodile type print

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.110 
and this is like a crocodile type print
and<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.530> has<00:03:41.680> like<00:03:41.859> these<00:03:42.069> little<00:03:42.250> circles<00:03:42.609> on

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
and it has like these little circles on

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.690 
and it has like these little circles on
it<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.510> don't<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:44.139> the<00:03:44.290> original<00:03:44.799> has<00:03:45.160> on

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
it I don't think the original has on

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
it I don't think the original has on
this<00:03:46.329> print<00:03:46.780> and<00:03:47.850> also<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.030> difference<00:03:49.510> in
