settings you want to go ahead and click
on<00:04:06.150> Wi-Fi<00:04:07.739> there's<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:08.799> bit<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.070> lag<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.720> you

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
on Wi-Fi there's a bit of a lag here you

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.349 
on Wi-Fi there's a bit of a lag here you
can<00:04:10.900> click<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.109> Wi-Fi<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.040> then<00:04:13.000> you'll<00:04:13.150> see

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
can click on Wi-Fi and then you'll see

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.599 
can click on Wi-Fi and then you'll see
all<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> Wi-Fi<00:04:14.019> networks<00:04:14.380> look<00:04:15.310> at<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.489> one

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
all the Wi-Fi networks look at the one

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:16.680 
all the Wi-Fi networks look at the one
you're<00:04:15.730> connected<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.329> hit<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.510> little

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
you're connected to and hit that little

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.590 
you're connected to and hit that little
blue<00:04:17.019> dot<00:04:17.680> next<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.160> it<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:19.329> your<00:04:19.450> IP

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
blue dot next to it and then your IP

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.909 
blue dot next to it and then your IP
address<00:04:19.780> shows<00:04:20.289> up<00:04:20.470> nicely<00:04:20.680> right<00:04:21.039> here<00:04:22.919> sweet

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
address shows up nicely right here sweet

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.830 
address shows up nicely right here sweet
so<00:04:24.820> once<00:04:25.210> you've<00:04:25.330> gone<00:04:25.419> ahead<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.630> get<00:04:25.810> that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
so once you've gone ahead and get that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.570 
so once you've gone ahead and get that
you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.500> can<00:04:26.650> login

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
you can you can login

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.219 
you can you can login
and<00:04:28.030> that's<00:04:28.240> pretty<00:04:28.419> much<00:04:28.569> it<00:04:28.689> you<00:04:29.080> can

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229

and that's pretty much it you can
actually<00:04:29.530> use<00:04:29.740> your<00:04:29.979> your<00:04:30.370> computer<00:04:31.060> mouse<00:04:31.210> to

mouse so I guess you need the the iphone
close<00:04:43.240> by<00:04:45.000> but<00:04:46.000> there<00:04:46.120> are<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> few<00:04:46.509> settings

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
close by but there are a few settings

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.899 
close by but there are a few settings
also<00:04:47.199> for<00:04:47.650> Vince<00:04:47.949> see<00:04:48.219> that<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.639> can

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909

also for Vince see that you can
configure<00:04:50.370> one<00:04:51.370> being<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.180> ability<00:04:52.990> to

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
configure one being the ability to

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.499 
configure one being the ability to
disable<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.280> which<00:04:54.939> I'll<00:04:55.120> show<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.360> right

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
here you can either enable or disable it

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.820 
here you can either enable or disable it
so<00:04:58.000> if<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.360> don't<00:04:58.509> want<00:04:58.629> people<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:59.139> actually

I just hit disabled and it closes the
connection<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:05.650> means<00:05:05.889> if<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.219> don't<00:05:06.430> want

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
connection that means if you don't want

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.029

set<00:05:27.099> a<00:05:27.129> password<00:05:27.370> here<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:28.270> then<00:05:28.389> in<00:05:29.169> chicken

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
set a password here and then in chicken

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.129 
set a password here and then in chicken
of<00:05:29.889> the<00:05:29.919> VNC<00:05:30.279> you<00:05:30.789> just<00:05:31.000> type<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.509> password<00:05:31.659> in

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
of the VNC you just type the password in

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.980 
of the VNC you just type the password in
with<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.500> host<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.159> it<00:05:34.000> lets<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.300> connect<00:05:34.659> so

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
with the host and it lets you connect so

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.990 
with the host and it lets you connect so
it's<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.620> really<00:05:35.770> cool<00:05:36.039> a<00:05:36.099> lap<00:05:36.400> um<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:37.509> I<00:05:39.000> guess

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
it's a really cool a lap um the I guess

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.110 
it's a really cool a lap um the I guess
it's<00:05:40.240> not<00:05:40.449> great<00:05:40.750> as<00:05:40.960> far<00:05:41.199> as<00:05:41.349> like<00:05:41.740> lag<00:05:42.639> so<00:05:43.000> if

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
it's not great as far as like lag so if

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.519 
it's not great as far as like lag so if
you're<00:05:43.240> trying<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.449> show<00:05:43.599> games<00:05:43.930> or<00:05:44.319> things

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:44.529 
you're trying to show games or things

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.589 
you're trying to show games or things
off<00:05:44.740> like<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.129> it<00:05:45.339> probably<00:05:45.580> won't<00:05:45.879> be<00:05:46.000> the

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
off like that it probably won't be the

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.529 
off like that it probably won't be the
best<00:05:46.810> idea<00:05:47.069> I<00:05:48.069> really<00:05:48.580> wish<00:05:48.729> they<00:05:49.150> would<00:05:49.330> come

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
best idea I really wish they would come

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.050 
best idea I really wish they would come
out<00:05:49.659> with<00:05:49.839> like<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.080> video<00:05:50.680> out<00:05:50.860> cable<00:05:51.069> that

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
out with like a video out cable that

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.329 
out with like a video out cable that
would<00:05:52.330> work<00:05:52.629> for<00:05:52.900> everything<00:05:53.650> on<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.919> iphone

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
would work for everything on the iphone

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:55.559 
would work for everything on the iphone
rather<00:05:54.610> than<00:05:54.789> just<00:05:55.000> when<00:05:55.240> you're<00:05:55.389> trying<00:05:55.479> to

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
rather than just when you're trying to

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.329 
rather than just when you're trying to
play<00:05:55.690> movies<00:05:56.199> I<00:05:56.440> think<00:05:56.949> that'd<00:05:57.069> be<00:05:57.190> really

00:05:57.329 --> 00:05:57.339 
play movies I think that'd be really

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:59.059 
play movies I think that'd be really
cool<00:05:57.460> if<00:05:57.669> you<00:05:57.879> could<00:05:58.029> you<00:05:58.240> know<00:05:58.360> hook<00:05:58.569> like<00:05:58.750> a

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 
cool if you could you know hook like a

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.909 
cool if you could you know hook like a
