level now had I selected any others I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.189 
level now had I selected any others I
would<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.840> getting<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.680> first<00:00:50.039> special<00:00:50.550> stage

get to the ending on this one this time

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120

I<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> ending<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.770> level

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I can get to the ending of the level

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.149 
I can get to the ending of the level
without<00:01:20.340> grabbing<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.770> should

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
without grabbing it up here it should

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.679 
without grabbing it up here it should
show<00:01:23.400> us<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.729> weird<00:01:23.970> message<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:26.479> alrighty

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.120 

here<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.780> go

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
here we go

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.300 
here we go
yeah<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.310> area<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.090> completely<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.830> utterly

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
yeah this area is completely and utterly

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.270 
yeah this area is completely and utterly
empty<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.330> there<00:01:37.870> are<00:01:37.960> similar<00:01:38.350> stretches<00:01:38.980> in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
empty and there are similar stretches in

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.530 
empty and there are similar stretches in
first<00:01:39.790> stage<00:01:40.060> as<00:01:40.270> well<00:01:41.610> also<00:01:42.610> for<00:01:43.270> some

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
first stage as well also for some

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.910 
first stage as well also for some
strange<00:01:44.050> reason<00:01:44.200> being<00:01:45.010> now<00:01:45.370> it<00:01:45.550> says<00:01:46.920> three

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
strange reason being now it says three

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.970 
strange reason being now it says three
blue<00:01:48.250> spheres<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.850> go<00:01:49.060> next<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:50.020> guess<00:01:50.950> that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
blue spheres to go next I guess that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.920 
blue spheres to go next I guess that
means<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.640> get<00:01:51.790> to<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.090> next<00:01:52.120> part<00:01:52.690> of<00:01:52.780> the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
means to get to the next part of the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.260 
means to get to the next part of the
stage<00:01:54.810> alrighty<00:01:56.190> well<00:01:57.190> that's<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.730> so<00:01:58.090> I'm

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
stage alrighty well that's that so I'm

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.760 
stage alrighty well that's that so I'm
just<00:01:58.480> going<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:58.870> pull<00:01:59.080> off<00:01:59.290> here<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:02.500> and

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
just going to pull off here and go and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.000 
just going to pull off here and go and
try<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.070> select<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.600> other<00:02:04.870> special<00:02:05.740> stage

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
try to select the other special stage

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.350 
try to select the other special stage
and<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.910> zero<00:02:10.720> blue<00:02:11.230> spheres<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.940> pretty

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
and get zero blue spheres now pretty

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.380 
and get zero blue spheres now pretty
much<00:02:13.450> any<00:02:14.080> time<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.770> actually<00:02:15.360> access<00:02:16.360> the

stage with zero tues to get which means

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.460 
stage with zero tues to get which means
that<00:02:24.700> potentially<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:25.900> sit<00:02:26.140> back

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
him and what the heck did I hit there to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.729 
him and what the heck did I hit there to
start<00:02:35.740> moving<00:02:35.980> backwards<00:02:37.260> also<00:02:38.260> if<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.590> hit

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
start moving backwards also if you hit

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.820 
start moving backwards also if you hit
those<00:02:38.920> things<00:02:39.310> properly<00:02:40.209> they<00:02:41.140> make<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.590> same

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
those things properly they make the same

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.070 
those things properly they make the same
sound<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> bumpers<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:46.080> that

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
sound as one of the bumpers that that

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.530 
sound as one of the bumpers that that
said<00:02:47.440> however<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.340> actually<00:02:48.580> rather

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
said however it is actually rather

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.170 
said however it is actually rather
difficult<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.230> hit<00:02:50.680> them<00:02:50.950> properly<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.790> said

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
difficult to hit them properly and said

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.780 
difficult to hit them properly and said
you<00:02:53.050> end<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.410> falling<00:02:53.680> past<00:02:54.220> them<00:02:54.580> anyway<00:02:56.790> so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
you end up falling past them anyway so

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.000 
you end up falling past them anyway so
yeah<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.250> next<00:03:00.850> part<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.209> stage<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
yeah here is next part of stage as you

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.600 
yeah here is next part of stage as you
can<00:03:03.340> see<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:04.000> bit<00:03:04.920> emptier<00:03:05.920> than<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.250> wasn't

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
can see a bit emptier than it wasn't

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.940 
can see a bit emptier than it wasn't
final<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.300> we<00:03:07.540> still<00:03:07.840> have<00:03:08.110> no<00:03:08.140> requirement

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
final and we still have no requirement

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.300 
final and we still have no requirement
for<00:03:09.010> fear<00:03:09.430> grabbing<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.989> layouts<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.100> little

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
for fear grabbing this layouts a little

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.490 
for fear grabbing this layouts a little
different<00:03:15.700> also<00:03:15.850> things<00:03:16.420> will<00:03:16.660> slow<00:03:16.840> down<00:03:16.930> i'm

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
different also things will slow down i'm

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.860 
different also things will slow down i'm
not<00:03:17.709> sure<00:03:17.950> if<00:03:18.070> thats<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.489> emulator<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:19.390> if

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
not sure if thats the emulator or if

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.210 
not sure if thats the emulator or if
it's<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> game<00:03:20.560> or<00:03:20.920> what<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:23.320> was<00:03:23.620> weird

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.710 

okay<00:03:27.220> we<00:03:27.370> want<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.700> go<00:03:27.790> this

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
okay we want to go this

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680 
okay we want to go this
and<00:03:28.930> yeah<00:03:29.860> this<00:03:30.220> part<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.850> pretty<00:03:31.450> much

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and yeah this part is pretty much

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.800 
and yeah this part is pretty much
completely<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.620> utterly<00:03:32.770> empty<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.450> can

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
completely and utterly empty so you can

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.250 
completely and utterly empty so you can
see<00:03:35.140> how<00:03:35.170> well<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.890> throw<00:03:36.130> some<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:37.750> nothing

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
see how well the throw some if nothing

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.340 
see how well the throw some if nothing
else<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:39.540> guess<00:03:40.540> that's<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.960> thing<00:03:41.200> to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
else I guess that's one thing to

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.800 
else I guess that's one thing to
consider<00:03:44.730> also<00:03:45.730> you'll<00:03:45.940> notice<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.330> at<00:03:46.690> this

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
consider also you'll notice that at this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.290 
consider also you'll notice that at this
point<00:03:47.110> all<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.950> music<00:03:48.100> is<00:03:48.640> pretty<00:03:49.030> much

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
point all of the music is pretty much

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.720 
point all of the music is pretty much
weight<00:03:49.660> is<00:03:49.840> in<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.050> final<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.190> only<00:03:51.490> thing<00:03:51.700> is

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
weight is in the final the only thing is

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.210 
weight is in the final the only thing is
that<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.090> couple<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.540> couple<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.560> titles<00:03:53.860> are

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
that a couple of couple of titles are

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.940 
that a couple of couple of titles are
written<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.930> such<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.290> way<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.530> there<00:03:56.860> are

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
written in such a way that there are

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.990 
written in such a way that there are
slight<00:03:57.300> mistranslations<00:03:58.710> also<00:04:00.000> it's

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
slight mistranslations also it's

possible<00:05:33.070> to<00:05:33.580> get<00:05:33.700> a<00:05:33.760> negative<00:05:33.970> score<00:05:34.330> by

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
possible to get a negative score by

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.400 
possible to get a negative score by
having<00:05:35.350> negative<00:05:35.710> ring<00:05:36.660> now<00:05:37.660> I<00:05:37.960> don't

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
having negative ring now I don't

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.710 
having negative ring now I don't
actually<00:05:38.770> remember<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.760> classification<00:05:40.240> the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
actually remember a classification the

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.050 
actually remember a classification the
final<00:05:41.080> i'll<00:05:41.530> have<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:41.920> check<00:05:42.780> i<00:05:44.880> think<00:05:45.880> that's

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
final i'll have to check i think that's

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.450 
final i'll have to check i think that's
pretty<00:05:46.240> much<00:05:46.450> it<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:47.590> other<00:05:47.740> thing<00:05:48.040> is<00:05:48.070> that

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
pretty much it the other thing is that

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.170 
pretty much it the other thing is that
my<00:05:48.940> T's<00:05:49.120> wall<00:05:49.450> jumping<00:05:50.140> maneuver<00:05:50.620> thing<00:05:51.180> isn't

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
my T's wall jumping maneuver thing isn't

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.200 
my T's wall jumping maneuver thing isn't
quite<00:05:52.750> as<00:05:53.190> elaborate<00:05:54.190> you<00:05:54.340> can't<00:05:54.640> like<00:05:54.910> safe

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
quite as elaborate you can't like safe

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.030 
quite as elaborate you can't like safe
spam<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.840> to<00:05:55.990> climb<00:05:56.230> up<00:05:56.260> a<00:05:56.560> wall<00:05:56.770> or<00:05:56.800> anything

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
spam it to climb up a wall or anything

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.020 
spam it to climb up a wall or anything
so<00:05:57.960> that's<00:05:58.960> really<00:05:59.800> pretty<00:06:00.220> much<00:06:00.490> every

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
so that's really pretty much every

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.470 
so that's really pretty much every
difference<00:06:01.750> in<00:06:01.960> here<00:06:02.380> also<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.760> think<00:06:04.180> that<00:06:04.360> if

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
difference in here also I think that if

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.050 
difference in here also I think that if
we<00:06:04.660> select<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:05.170> level<00:06:05.320> yes<00:06:05.860> they<00:06:06.220> give<00:06:06.670> us<00:06:06.820> the

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
we select a level yes they give us the

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.140 
we select a level yes they give us the
second<00:06:07.480> character<00:06:07.870> select<00:06:08.230> again<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:09.150> we

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
second character select again and we

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.050 
second character select again and we
could<00:06:10.360> say<00:06:10.570> select<00:06:10.900> heavy<00:06:11.250> also<00:06:12.250> amazing

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
could say select heavy also amazing

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.950 
could say select heavy also amazing

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:36.299 

perhaps<00:06:26.530> the<00:06:26.710> button<00:06:27.010> doesn't<00:06:27.370> exist<00:06:27.730> yet

00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:36.309 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.070 

already<00:06:37.309> they<00:06:37.550> should<00:06:37.759> get<00:06:38.059> a<00:06:38.119> hopefully<00:06:38.869> new

top level okay let's see here then if

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:47.799 
top level okay let's see here then if
we're<00:06:45.879> expected<00:06:46.879> to<00:06:46.909> actually<00:06:47.330> hit<00:06:47.479> the<00:06:47.539> thing

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:47.809 
we're expected to actually hit the thing

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:53.859 
we're expected to actually hit the thing
or<00:06:47.929> not<00:06:48.050> oh<00:06:50.830> no<00:06:51.830> I<00:06:51.860> guess<00:06:52.249> not<00:06:52.279> so<00:06:53.029> basically

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:53.869

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 
colors the colors obviously don't change

00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.859 
colors the colors obviously don't change

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:02.269 
irritable you're not forced to go back

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:06.429 
irritable you're not forced to go back
on<00:07:02.479> yourself<00:07:02.929> or<00:07:03.199> anything<00:07:03.709> like<00:07:03.739> that<00:07:05.439> you'll

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:06.439 
on yourself or anything like that you'll

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.649 
on yourself or anything like that you'll
also<00:07:06.589> see<00:07:06.919> that<00:07:06.949> the<00:07:07.369> end<00:07:07.729> of<00:07:07.969> level<00:07:08.149> thing<00:07:08.509> is

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
also see that the end of level thing is

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:14.529 
also see that the end of level thing is
slightly<00:07:08.959> askew<00:07:09.379> and<00:07:13.029> that's<00:07:14.029> really<00:07:14.300> pretty

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
slightly askew and that's really pretty

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.089 
slightly askew and that's really pretty
much<00:07:14.749> it<00:07:14.959> i<00:07:15.050> think<00:07:15.110> i'll<00:07:15.379> end<00:07:15.529> it<00:07:15.649> here<00:07:15.889> so<00:07:16.069> i

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
much it i think i'll end it here so i

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.759 
much it i think i'll end it here so i
don't<00:07:16.309> go<00:07:16.429> over
