00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 before planting this rose of the variety 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 Sevillian to look at it a little 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.290
 closer to the end of its branches has 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.210
 been coated with a layer of red wax 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.050
 it's normal it's a protection he 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 do not remove 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.780
 here as the rose has a little bit 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 waited these buds pierced the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.730
 layer of protection and have issued 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.840
 leaves 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 everything is normal below the bulge 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 indicates the grafting point and lamothe 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.860
 is packed in a plastic layer 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.089
 that will have to be removed started by placing 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.360
 a drainage layer at the bottom of the pot 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:01:02.790
 about 5 cm thick over 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.150
 position 5 to 10 cm of the soil leveling 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.150
 level 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.710
 then put the rose on this layer 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.530
 of course after removing the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.210
 layer of plastic that includes lamotte 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 we see that two young roots are 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.060
 appeared through the mass of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.520
 potting so leave it as is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 rose is in very good health 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 place the rose well vertically in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 leaving the graft point 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.340
 the snoring that we saw while 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.490
 the time the planting itself is 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.590
 very simple fill the space between the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.909
 fashion of the rose bush and the inner wall of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.909
 pot with the potting soil 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.020
 once you have filled all this 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.610
 available space 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 squeeze lightly with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.600
 fingers and tap the edges of the pot so 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.000
 the waters of the rose's fashion appears 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.770
 you have to add potting soil 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.770
 time that it is buried 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.370
 when the pot is well garnished it does not you 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.930
 remains more than watering and in some 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.410
 weeks flower buds 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.410
 appear
