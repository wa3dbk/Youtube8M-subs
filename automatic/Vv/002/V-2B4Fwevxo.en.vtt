00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 the boy is doing well but not counting 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:10.440
 for you the result of that in 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.799
 brokerage I did right 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.220
 the bleeding that I had then thanks to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.529
 God I think like in another video that 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 there was a suspicion of parties of the other 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.019
 brokerage and thank god they were not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 these gestures were not the remains of other 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.949
 it was a polyp is that of evils the smallest 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.640
 I do not think so for me because I 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.100
 I do not have no consultation with my 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 gynecologist here I already told some 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.280
 videos that I could gynecologists will 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.500
 consult it is still only at the end of the month 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.960
 but I returned to the doctor who made the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 my semiotic brokerage she asked that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.570
 to re- score the result and were 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.610
 polyps and she explained to me and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 so choose the ones that are the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.000
 a normal tissue that are born from the uterus 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 are not Josus and that he causes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.159
 bleeding or bleeding or bleeding is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.310
 most right application of the new legislation or 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.400
 among which was my case after 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 I just move there came this 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:28.439
 blood get out that blood a lot of blood and 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.970
 That's when she said that she thinks 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.520
 removed everything I 'm not sure why 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.400
 was done in brokerage is like 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 instrument to see nothing is just for the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.540
 type of armor 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.400
 and she thinks she cleaned everything but I had 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 a bleeding neighbors where it is also 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.790
 only arrive and it was a little zagging half 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 the guards in the rosary know my little 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.869
 so much that will be a little anxious 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.180
 because I did not know the result 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.899
 and there the bow people that good that the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.790
 effect did not feel any pain as it is the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.040
 staff was in Brazil as if it were 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.150
 rech of the other then some people me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.390
 said that 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.710
 I started getting a little anxious to be 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.750
 stressed because because of this 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.700
 guess so diverse they do not 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.290
 it was these polyps and then she told me 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.930
 completed saying he thinks he's taken it all 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.260
 But she asked to wait a few months, right? 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.080
 the next appointment, which is probably 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.050
 My doctor will not let him continue 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 sowing or not I do not know he'll ask 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.400
 a track stories he copies today that is 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.220
 which is a segment that does with a 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.110
 camera line do not know if you know it is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 to see another inside and if you have 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.630
 something and remove that estate that 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.580
 according to her they are not so serious but 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.900
 I talked to my shop does not say 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.130

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.080
 bleeding 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.000
 so when I'm a doctor I go 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.459
