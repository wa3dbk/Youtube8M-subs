00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.790
 it's okay 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.930
 Greetings friends, welcome to this 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.510
 new video finished the event 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.759
 elimination chamber event that had a 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.619
 great return in what fits but not everything 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.230
 what shines is gold and that is why we are 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.939
 here came the time to criticize this 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.300
 event that as he had good things 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.110
 also bad things this is the good thing and 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.120
 the bad of elimination chamber 2015 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.780
 first the bad 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.640
 number 1 triple threat of divas someone 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.949
 he once said that the perfect formula 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.620
 for a divas fight it was a triple 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.510
 threat but that does not apply to me anymore 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.129
 lately they were giving good 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.649
 battles of divas and this was the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.079
 exception fell again in the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.360
 Classic five minute boring fight 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.430
 and without technique although the champion saw 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.560
 strong there was not enough chemistry 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.390
 between her and the challengers to achieve 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.820
 that in this fight it would ignite that 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.619
 spark of emotion I do not know why it happened 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.750
 this if the divas that were 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.610
 facing are some of the best 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.679
 of the division today I had 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.159
 many expectations placed on this 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:24.759
 combat and it was not what I expected 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.770
 number 2 weak against bordalás not 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:30.909
 I expected a lot from this fight though 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.340
 out so it does not take away the fact that wwp2 more 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.259
 of development for this fight to my 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.270
 seem more than stuffed was to raise 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.000
 more to neville because even during the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.619
 fight vou dallas had behaviors 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.079
 quite humiliating to himself that 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.359
 they made Neville look better at least 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.979
 it was a short fight and there was not much 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:50.229
 more filling because again the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.659
 thought that he had of this fight was 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.099
 Wrong as in the previous case as 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.099
 it was by far a good fight 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.040
 number 3 some end of the fighting 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 and the results to start this point 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.790
 I want to exclude the camera by 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 intercontinental championship and the fight 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660
 of champion against champion so 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.660
 any plural comment does not 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.760
 reference to those two combats from the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.860
 victory of snow and I began to distrust 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
 of the event completely something made me 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.330
 think that they would be charged in all 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 struggles I mean they did everything a 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.200
 show they basically did 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.819
 history with this fight they gave 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.220
 opportunity to some of your best 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.290
 teams today and everything so that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.380
 the new day retained the championships 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.510
 that did not mean anything good to me 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.790
 followed by the triple threat of divas and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.830
 far from talking about combat the end was 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.080
 the most banal of all the encounter something 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.459
 already cliché in the triple threats in addition 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.230
 nicky's victory was 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.910
 counterproductive I doubt they're 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.340
 preparing something great for the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.350
 championship of the divas and so they are only 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.380
 delaying the advance of the division with 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.239
 the same champion six months ago already 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.709
 I talked about the struggle of neville and wow and 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.140
 be a fight without something of importance 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.940
 it was unimportant to give it a final 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.030
 relevant or memorable 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.430
 well I expected something more and the event 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.040
 centrally unfortunately had the worst 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.140
 end of the night or not the end 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.450
 up to a certain point it was good I want 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.490
 say for a few seconds thousands of 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.880
 people saw their dream come true 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.410
 but it was too good to be true 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.960
 I really found that form silly 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.000
 to end a battle so dreamed of 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.430
 yes the whole event was overshadowed by the 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.710
 bad end because as such almost all 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.510
 the fighting was very good but it was 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.810
 the same result that ruined the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.860
 respective struggles said this now 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.860
 let's go with the good 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.960
 Number 1 improvement in construction with 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.240
 the announcement of the event that arrived 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.920
 practically of surprise and only 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.050
 two weeks in advance is 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.850
 impressive to see how this event has 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.680
 had a better construction than the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.440
 most of the pay to see everything 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.690
 this year without so much recycling in terms of 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.970
 the fighting you could also say that 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.980
 elimination chamber has a billboard 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.590
 more solid that we have seen throughout the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.750
 2015 was good to see that in so little 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.790
 time have succeeded in offering a product 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.010
 of quality contrary to some other 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.450
 occasions where time is your greatest 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.790
 enemy and fail to connect 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.950
 correctly the rivalries that is what 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.660
 primary in the events was perhaps the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.820
 little time between events what 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.500
 it made rivalries stay 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.660
 on the verge of emotion and did not lose their 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.030
 touch something that does not always work but 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 this time it made great effect now 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.230
 within two weeks it comes again 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.180
 money in the bank and hopefully the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.570
 weather strategy also help 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.570
 this event 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:43.649
 number 2 elimination cameras 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.849
 maybe they were not the best cameras in 

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.309
 the story but in my opinion 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.830
 they fulfilled their main objective the 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:52.199
 which was to entertain first was the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.269
 camera by couples unique in its history 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.789
 and that at least this time it seems 

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:58.860
 be that he did not give everything he could give 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.050
 three members of the new day and the bull 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.909
 gave a total of 14 competitors 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.519
 inside the cage where the fighters 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.709
 they showed off with their aerial moves the 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.360
 ascension totally dominated the fight and 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.639
 but at the end of all the difference 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.009
 numerical won and the champions 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.039
 retained their titles after eliminating 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.019
 to the primetime players later in the 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.629
 night was the second camera by the 

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:23.789
 intercontinental championship for me 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.279
 taste was better than the previous one although 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.289
 it is not saved from having several failures the 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:30.240
 technique was used more during this 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.309
 I met and it went a little aside the 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.860
 use of the structure compared to the 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:36.649
 fight in pairs what gave that touch 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.610
 special to the fight for the championship 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:41.249
 intercontinental was the surprise factor 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.740
 both in the sixth participant and in 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.150
 the winner the rybak victory was seen 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.160
 very emotional and in this 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.610
 he already deserved at least that 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.610
 championship 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:57.029
 number 3 ww nx t the best fight of the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.069
 night and the best I've seen in 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.169
 this year because more than a great fight 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.729
 I mean everything a change in the panorama 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.979
 from ww 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.259
 sponsored by triple h the Canadian 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.479
 kevin owens had the best achievement he has 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.279
 had in his entire career defeat jon 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.080
 fine in his debut fight and so 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.569
 clean thing that not many can 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.969
 be credited both rivals were 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.860
 pushed to the limit and in part this fight 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.990
 owes something of its greatness to the fact that 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.759
 neither of them knew it was going to be 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.649
 his opponent what gave that effect of 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.689
 uncertainty and returned the fight more 

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:29.759
 offensive that defensive where equal 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:32.039
 we could see an arsenal of movements 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.439
 very attractive from kevin owens 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.659
 even quite aerial movements 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.180
 Interesting that they are not very common 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.430
 see in a man the size of owens to 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.499
 end of the night the champion of nx you 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.599
 He surprised everyone and took 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:48.360
 a clean victory against the champion of 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.490
 the us hope we can prevail 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.619
 before his next challenge is to face 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.749
 jon cina again in money in the bank 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.749
 since it seems that his push is serious 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.050
 and good friends this video came to your
