00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.010
 in the heart of one of the best wine regions Germany 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.220
 We want to get the modern war cultures min to the destination Kumiko Scouts sound 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.770
 spread throughout the region 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.059
 from Holland in the west to Russia in the east 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.560
 and so well-known for Till the Miz, we have the Heininger here in the winery 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.580
 set up 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.650
 yes the good thing about who was that and so great support is created 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.430
 and because he stops 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.940
 If you have such good food too much limited this can be a solid place 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.810
 behind the nice weather to Beiersdorfer it's always like that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 That would make our profitability more solid 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.630
 East India way could be chosen freely 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.520
 the farmer is grilling with Webber 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.370
 and percent 4 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.220
 what i mean for my employees 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.970
 the percent showed Florian Bruns in the business on our customers 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.919
 BP will become host and 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.919
 so the choice of words sold almost by itself 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.429
 to bundle the trend at the beginning of this year 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.199

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.579
 best hands ever behind Obermann and indeed with the subscription 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.839
 Holding hands Mr. Weber chicken hall consists of three parts 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:00.019

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.019

 for special occasions like here 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.349
 Of course you also need appropriate specialties 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.229
 There are good reasons for the development which we share with our dealers and 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.360
 have reached the last few years to appreciate accordingly
