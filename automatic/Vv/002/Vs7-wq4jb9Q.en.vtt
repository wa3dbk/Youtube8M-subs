 the aeronautical company of argentina 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.390
 argentina factory of planes fadea 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.630
 presented a new prototype of the plane 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 pampa jean of type ia 63 designed for 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.480
 train air force pilots 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 of the South American country 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.010
 tampa and measures a total of 10 9 meters of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.670
 length and has a wingspan of 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.119
 around 97 meters the weight of the new 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.680
 model is estimated at 282 tons 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.990
 thanks to a more powerful motor than the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.880
 of the previous model the pampa and is capable 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 to reach a maximum speed of 800 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.899
 15 kilometers per hour 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 these characteristics allow the new 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.770
 Argentine aircraft carry out missions 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.260
 of pilot training as well as 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.840
 perform other tasks informs the portal 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 bump the device developers 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.950
 they expect the pampas and have a great 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.780
 commercial success the defense ministry 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 of Argentina and the company there 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 they agreed to supply some 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.539
 units of the new aircraft model of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.420
 training is expected after 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.010
 the several dozen tests of the pampa lll 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 join the air force of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 Argentina also has the FAdeA 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.760
 intention to sell the new version of 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.830
 the aircraft and 63 to foreign customers 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.270
 The potential of the project is estimated in 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.280
 the construction of about 100 aircraft 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.360
 both for Argentina and for others 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.460
 countries 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.690
 the project already 63 is one of the most 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 long in the history of aviation 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
 argentina the development of the first 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.350
 version of the machine started late 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.420
 from the 70s of the last century the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.180
 first prototype of the pampa plane made 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 his first flight in 1984 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.670
 subsequently two more were built 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.110
 prototypes of the aircraft in 1988 it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.370
 It began production in series 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.479
 first version of aircraft 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.670
 pampa training until 1999 strength 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.610
 argentina air received a total of 16 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.740
 machines of this type in 2007 the first 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.270
 pampa airplane model and it was built 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.760
 at the aviation plant in cÃ³rdoba 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.800
 during the creation of the pampa and the 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.479
 engineers redesigned various systems 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.979
 important from the previous model and 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.140
 they changed the set of equipment 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.390
 electronic radio in order to improve 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.890
 the performance the first flights of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.840
 test of the new aircraft prototype 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.240
 pampa lll will be carried out at 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.390
 early next year until 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.010
 2017 fadea plans to build 40 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.600
 training aircraft of this type 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.060
 to incorporate them to the force 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.750
 of Argentina in addition to 22 aircraft 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750
 light attack
