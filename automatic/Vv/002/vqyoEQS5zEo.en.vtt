00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
larger than for commuter rail now we've

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.800 
larger than for commuter rail now we've
got<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.090> chart<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.420> gonna<00:01:54.509> put<00:01:54.689> up

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
got this little chart we're gonna put up

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.520 
got this little chart we're gonna put up
take<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> look<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:57.380> understand<00:01:58.380> that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
take a look at this I understand that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.649 
take a look at this I understand that
the<00:01:58.680> headlines<00:01:59.159> who<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.729> reflect<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the headlines who do not reflect this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
the headlines who do not reflect this
reality<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:01.920> good<00:02:02.009> reasons

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
reality but there are very good reasons

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.010 
reality but there are very good reasons
for<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.210> cover<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
for that that we're going to cover so

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.899 
for that that we're going to cover so
you<00:02:04.079> see<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.860> Motor<00:02:05.490> Vehicles

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
you see here that Motor Vehicles

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.389 
you see here that Motor Vehicles

fatalities per 100 million passenger

Vehicles<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.550> point<00:02:11.849> four<00:02:12.150> fatalities<00:02:12.540> per

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
Vehicles one point four fatalities per

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.460 
Vehicles one point four fatalities per

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
hundred million

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.920 
hundred million
passenger<00:02:13.920> miles<00:02:14.450> objectively<00:02:15.450> low<00:02:15.750> by

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
passenger miles objectively low by

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.960 
passenger miles objectively low by
itself<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.890> man<00:02:17.220> when<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.580> look<00:02:17.730> at<00:02:17.850> things

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
itself but man when you look at things

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.430 
itself but man when you look at things
like<00:02:18.120> commuter<00:02:18.480> rail<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.930> specifically

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
like commuter rail and specifically

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.030 
like commuter rail and specifically
Amtrak<00:02:19.980> they're<00:02:20.490> much<00:02:20.880> larger<00:02:21.620> barely<00:02:22.620> see<00:02:22.920> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
Amtrak they're much larger barely see it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.300 
Amtrak they're much larger barely see it
on<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.430> chart<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.290> why<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.040> that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
on the chart there and so why is it that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.490 
on the chart there and so why is it that
we<00:02:26.700> focus<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.120> much<00:02:27.570> more<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.050> something<00:02:28.410> like

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
we focus so much more on something like

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.980 
we focus so much more on something like
the<00:02:28.650> Spain<00:02:28.920> train<00:02:29.280> crash<00:02:29.580> when<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.450> across

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
the Spain train crash when it across

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.110 
the Spain train crash when it across
America<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:31.890> more<00:02:32.190> people<00:02:32.520> died<00:02:32.790> in

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
America way more people died in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.170 
America way more people died in
automobile<00:02:33.780> accidents<00:02:33.840> uh<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:35.790> some<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.090> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
automobile accidents uh that some of the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.340 
automobile accidents uh that some of the
reasons<00:02:36.330> for<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.870> coming<00:02:37.170> from<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
reasons for this is coming from the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.930 
reasons for this is coming from the
president<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> triple<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.340> foundation<00:02:38.910> for

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.920 
traffic safety this from the New York
Times<00:02:40.380> back<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.830> 2010<00:02:41.250> said<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.600> that's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
Times back in 2010 said and that that's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.720 
Times back in 2010 said and that that's
because<00:02:43.260> motor<00:02:43.470> vehicle<00:02:43.830> fatalities<00:02:43.980> happen

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
because motor vehicle fatalities happen

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
because motor vehicle fatalities happen
in<00:02:44.790> small<00:02:45.030> numbers<00:02:45.060> are<00:02:45.840> geographically

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
in small numbers are geographically

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.900 
in small numbers are geographically
dispersed<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.250> are<00:02:47.400> considered

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
dispersed and are considered

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.150 
dispersed and are considered
headline-grabbing<00:02:48.390> news<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
headline-grabbing news and that's a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
headline-grabbing news and that's a
great<00:02:50.250> point<00:02:50.660> not<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.780> say<00:02:51.959> they<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.320> cover

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
great point not to say they don't cover

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.040 
great point not to say they don't cover
when<00:02:53.250> cars<00:02:53.550> crash<00:02:53.940> but<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.330> doesn't<00:02:54.570> have<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
when cars crash but it doesn't have the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050 
when cars crash but it doesn't have the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
exciting footage of the Spain train
crashing<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.720> we'd<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.290> awesome<00:02:58.530> view

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
crashing is we'd like this awesome view

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.699 
crashing is we'd like this awesome view
of<00:02:59.190> it<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.520> everything<00:02:59.820> it's<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.350> it's<00:03:01.350> it's

so act we once again are bumping up

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.620 
so act we once again are bumping up
against<00:03:07.770> limitations<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.000> human<00:03:09.510> brain

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
against limitations in the human brain

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.780 
against limitations in the human brain
the<00:03:09.900> evolution<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> human<00:03:10.590> brain<00:03:10.950> when

the evolution of the human brain when

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.630 
the evolution of the human brain when
small<00:03:12.630> little<00:03:13.020> things<00:03:13.500> add<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:13.920> over<00:03:14.400> time

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
small little things add up over time

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.610 
small little things add up over time
like<00:03:15.270> pollute<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.140> people<00:03:16.380> dying<00:03:16.560> from

like pollute like people dying from

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.259 
like pollute like people dying from

in<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.630> way<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.989> we<00:03:22.110> do<00:03:22.290> when<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.830> hundred

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
in the way that we do when a hundred

people die in one event and that's not

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.740 
people die in one event and that's not
because<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:26.970> event<00:03:27.180> is<00:03:27.360> more<00:03:27.570> dangerous

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
because the one event is more dangerous

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.780 
because the one event is more dangerous
it's<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.470> because<00:03:28.830> that's<00:03:29.100> how<00:03:29.340> our<00:03:29.489> brain

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
it's just because that's how our brain

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.180 
it's just because that's how our brain
has<00:03:30.120> evolved<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.019> so<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.739> need<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.160> be

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190
