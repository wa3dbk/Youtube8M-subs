00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello everyone, and a kublog 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.580
 Today I will tell you how to cool our 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.099
 aquarium without high costs in the summer 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.849
 no time like feed knows how to cool 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.990
 your aquarium without spending big money on 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.010
 refrigeration is quite simple 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.650
 take a bottle of summer water and put 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 freezer and it turns out we 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 Here is such a bottle and and enough 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.620
 put our aquarium 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:42.960
 it is enough for 3-4 hours it is enough for her 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 2 33 degrees must shine 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 golden root if you see that water 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:55.230
 too drops below 22 degrees then and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 need to pull out and again you can put 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.219
 freezer so on further 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 kept freezing that next 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.740
 again put her mind to parkour 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.700
 your aquarium is less than 100 liters then you 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 the package comes in handy take the usual package 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.820
 pour water into it also freeze 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 only not so much 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.759
 after that we place it and reproached him 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 I think also cools only a little 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:38.579
 less since yell less and for that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:43.640
 it takes less ice on it all like 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.640
