 torn in the attachment would also be pulled through this is for 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.730
 sharper or even info big that is synonymous so I can here 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.520
 that too here 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.149
 the visitors triggered quite normal 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.829
 then the sharpness tightened 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.109

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.529
 that was in principle reject 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.559
