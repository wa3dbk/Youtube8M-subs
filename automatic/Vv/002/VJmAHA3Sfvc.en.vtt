00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.309
 today 's recipe is very simple but 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 it's a delight 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.599
 in fact they are two coconut recipes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.370
 white and black coconut tree everyone likes it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.630
 Who's going to teach us the best? 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.910
 first, he says that the recipe has a 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.560
 secret snow has a secret which has 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.449
 to be cold there when there is no 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 any becomes very dry and design 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 being veiled at the time is no longer 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
 with one on the face of the same body 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.130
 So let's go to the recipe and write down the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.830
 Ingredients 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.160
 we will need 500 grams of coconut and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.829
 grated juice 300 grams of crystal sugar 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.420
 and a can of condensed milk 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.340
 Our first step we will put 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.340
 condensed milk is not 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:52.140
 then sugar and coconut 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.820
 mixing it will get to boil goes 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.620
 melt condensed milk and sugar 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.520
 You can go and see what she's putting together. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.630
 coconut and condensed milk from the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.490
 Your flesh can not stop stirring. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.290
 can stop stirring because otherwise this 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.360
 and the condensed liquid milk and super 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 zoom will burn in the bottom of the pan 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.439
 it will look darker and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.930
 after 15 minutes stirring is in the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.670
 Score 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 he who wants to stop taking focus on that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 point late after leaving leaving leave 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.170
 at this point it's going to be here 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.520
 served as that spoon house now 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 to let it be yes to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
 intention is to establish a little longer to 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.079
 a little more and arrived at the point of 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.540
 Cocada 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 As you can see, it's already okay. 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.829
 almost no condensed milk 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.110
 very proud on the sides and 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.360
 they school not totally pan 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.040
 so has come how much she put the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.579
 cocaine in the form and spread with 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.579
 spatula 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.180
 to make the black coconut the recipe is the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.020
 same but instead of using the 300 grams 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.260
 of sugar 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.390
 we use 200 grams the other 100 grams 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.070
 turn caramel left so it goes 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.560
 started with her sister when she started 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.590
 to bubble, you give a little go 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.140
 leaving her that she is boiling in the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.510
 sides move 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.760
 it will practically cool because she 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 will put the sugar that was not 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.970
 melting it will mix with what 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.760
 it was burnt 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.340
 Can you come back and let me go and see? 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 now she's going to soak deep pink 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.100
 and it's ok if you leave here but it's getting 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.300
 darker and will get to taste 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.620
 burned 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.620
 we come and play in the white mass 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.320
 the point is also a bit different 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.260
 she does not have condensed milk at the end 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.480
 priding practically nothing 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.590
 this is the point she can see that the mass 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.590
 gets more uniform 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.280
 After you cool down, you have a little secret to 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.260
 people are going to beat up and practically 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.460
 realize that even we do not hit 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.950
 condensed milk that is in the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.170
 fund will be in the middle to top that not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.720
 It will not stay all in the bottom of the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.660
 cocaine before cutting has to wait 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.460
 ten hours to stay in the right place and 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.460
 coconut can not go to the fridge
