back<00:02:22.870> resize<00:02:24.670> okay<00:02:25.670> but<00:02:25.850> now<00:02:25.970> we<00:02:26.030> find<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.420> we

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
back resize okay but now we find that we

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.780 
back resize okay but now we find that we
can't<00:02:26.870> see<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.260> very<00:02:27.440> well<00:02:27.590> against<00:02:28.580> that

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.490 
can't see it very well against that
background<00:02:29.000> right<00:02:29.450> so<00:02:30.140> we're<00:02:30.320> going<00:02:30.410> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
background right so we're going to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.180 
background right so we're going to
choose<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.800> text<00:02:31.160> backdrop<00:02:32.620> now<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.980> make

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
choose a text backdrop now we can make

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.600 
choose a text backdrop now we can make
that<00:02:34.490> a<00:02:35.050> gradient<00:02:36.050> with<00:02:36.940> colors<00:02:37.940> let's<00:02:38.390> say

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
that a gradient with colors let's say

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.000 
that a gradient with colors let's say
from<00:02:40.610> dark<00:02:40.940> brown<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:43.430> light<00:02:44.120> brown<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.920> we

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
from dark brown to light brown there we

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.110 
from dark brown to light brown there we
go<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:47.830> instead<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.040> rectangle<00:02:49.670> we<00:02:49.790> want<00:02:50.000> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
go and instead of a rectangle we want to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.420 
go and instead of a rectangle we want to
have<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.600> rounded<00:02:51.290> rectangle<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:52.130> that's<00:02:52.310> our

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
have a rounded rectangle so that's our

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.300 
have a rounded rectangle so that's our
title<00:02:52.790> with<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> backdrop

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
title with a backdrop

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.400 
title with a backdrop

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.690 
path to choose fade now if we click here
we<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:09.050> say<00:03:09.230> crossfade<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.220> means<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.580> will

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
we can say crossfade that means it will

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.530 
we can say crossfade that means it will
fade<00:03:11.030> in<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.510> fade<00:03:11.750> out<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.610> pause<00:03:13.610> we're

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
fade in and fade out and the pause we're

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.800 
fade in and fade out and the pause we're
going<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.930> say<00:03:15.370> user-defined<00:03:16.370> all<00:03:17.360> right<00:03:17.570> so

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
going to say user-defined all right so

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.970 
going to say user-defined all right so
here<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.620> can<00:03:19.209> extend<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:21.290> period<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
here I can extend the period of the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.790 
here I can extend the period of the
pause<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.670> fact<00:03:22.910> in<00:03:23.209> these<00:03:23.810> spots<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.380> shorter

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
pause in fact in these spots are shorter

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.970 
pause in fact in these spots are shorter
that<00:03:24.920> means<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.340> title<00:03:25.940> will<00:03:26.270> fade<00:03:26.600> in<00:03:26.980> faster

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
that means the title will fade in faster

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.110 
that means the title will fade in faster
and<00:03:28.670> regard<00:03:29.030> fades<00:03:29.360> in<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.640> there<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.790> fades

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
and regard fades in and there it fades

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.059 
and regard fades in and there it fades
that

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.759 

now<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.099> can<00:03:36.610> also<00:03:36.959> have<00:03:37.959> multiple<00:03:38.200> title

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
now I can also have multiple title

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.380 
now I can also have multiple title
effects<00:03:39.250> here<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.640> in<00:03:39.730> other<00:03:39.879> words<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.239> I

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
effects here so in other words if I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.199 
effects here so in other words if I
choose<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.110> have<00:03:41.290> another<00:03:41.620> title<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
choose to have another title when it

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:52.140 
choose to have another title when it
says<00:03:43.620> horses<00:03:50.910> okay

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
says horses okay

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.420 
says horses okay
I<00:03:52.360> put<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:52.930> title<00:03:53.319> there<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:54.040> make<00:03:54.250> sure

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
I put that title there and I make sure

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.240 
I put that title there and I make sure
that<00:03:54.580> two<00:03:54.880> are<00:03:55.030> overlapped<00:03:55.599> here<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.250> then

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
that two are overlapped here and then

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.809 
that two are overlapped here and then
the<00:03:57.430> effect<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.150> as<00:03:58.810> follows<00:03:59.319> one<00:03:59.830> goes<00:04:00.670> away

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
the effect is as follows one goes away

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.940 
the effect is as follows one goes away
and<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.450> other<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:01.780> fades<00:04:02.080> in<00:04:02.410> now<00:04:02.739> we're

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
and the other one fades in now we're

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.710 
and the other one fades in now we're
having<00:04:03.069> these<00:04:03.430> tracks<00:04:03.849> also<00:04:04.239> means<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.540> you

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
having these tracks also means that you

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.780 
having these tracks also means that you
can<00:04:04.750> have<00:04:04.900> a<00:04:05.080> subtitle<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.920> runs<00:04:06.489> throughout

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
can have a subtitle that runs throughout

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
of runs out of the frame

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.520 
of runs out of the frame
