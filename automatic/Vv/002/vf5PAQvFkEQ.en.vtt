thing<00:02:14.269> about<00:02:14.360> Photoshop<00:02:14.720> for<00:02:15.200> doing<00:02:15.560> tailor

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
thing about Photoshop for doing tailor

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.680 
thing about Photoshop for doing tailor
designs<00:02:16.040> like<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.000> layer<00:02:17.390> stuff

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
designs like this is you can layer stuff

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.780 
designs like this is you can layer stuff
up<00:02:17.870> which<00:02:18.560> when<00:02:19.310> you're<00:02:19.400> making<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
up which when you're making a

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.240 
up which when you're making a
composition<00:02:20.510> with<00:02:21.110> lots<00:02:21.560> different<00:02:21.920> elements

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
composition with lots different elements

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.940 
composition with lots different elements
that's<00:02:22.430> really<00:02:22.879> handy<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.870> I've<00:02:24.739> separated

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
that's really handy so I've separated

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.610 
that's really handy so I've separated
the<00:02:25.250> bones<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.610> into<00:02:25.790> two<00:02:25.940> separate<00:02:26.269> layers

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
the bones out into two separate layers

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.449 
the bones out into two separate layers
one<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.709> front<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> other<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.340> they're

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
one in front of the other and they're

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.119 
one in front of the other and they're
both<00:02:28.549> behind<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:28.970> skull<00:02:29.290> now<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:30.560> can<00:02:30.709> do<00:02:30.890> is

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
both behind the skull now what can do is

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.440 
both behind the skull now what can do is
just<00:02:31.370> fill<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.670> bit<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.849> white<00:02:32.030> there<00:02:32.299> so

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
just fill in a bit of white there so

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.330 
just fill in a bit of white there so
they<00:02:32.540> didn't<00:02:32.720> show<00:02:32.870> through<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.950> back<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.280> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
they didn't show through the back of the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.460 
they didn't show through the back of the
skull<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.819> just<00:02:35.450> kind<00:02:35.629> of<00:02:35.750> play<00:02:36.140> back<00:02:36.319> with

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
skull and just kind of play back with

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.140 
skull and just kind of play back with
them<00:02:36.590> that's<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> good<00:02:37.610> thing<00:02:37.760> about<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:38.060> you

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
them that's the good thing about it you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.430 
them that's the good thing about it you
don't<00:02:38.209> have<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.450> kind<00:02:38.540> of<00:02:38.660> sketch<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.260> bone

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
don't have to kind of sketch in a bone

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.140 
don't have to kind of sketch in a bone
we<00:02:39.709> are<00:02:39.920> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.459> wrong<00:02:40.579> place<00:02:40.849> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
we are kind of in the wrong place and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.119 
we are kind of in the wrong place and
then<00:02:41.660> rub<00:02:41.930> out<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.319> draw<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> new<00:02:42.709> one<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.010> can

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
then rub out and draw a new one you can

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.339 
then rub out and draw a new one you can
just<00:02:43.160> move<00:02:43.700> them<00:02:43.819> about<00:02:44.120> until<00:02:45.079> they're<00:02:45.260> in

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
just move them about until they're in

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.600 
just move them about until they're in
the<00:02:45.410> right<00:02:45.560> place<00:02:45.799> you<00:02:45.829> know<00:02:46.010> scale<00:02:46.400> them

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the right place you know scale them

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.119 
the right place you know scale them
however<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:46.970> want<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:48.500> know<00:02:48.620> once<00:02:49.040> you

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
however you want and you know once you

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.410 
however you want and you know once you
see<00:02:49.549> I'll<00:02:49.640> put<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.849> other<00:02:49.970> one<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.209> then<00:02:50.329> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
see I'll put the other one and then the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.369 
see I'll put the other one and then the
other<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.599> didn't<00:02:50.900> come<00:02:50.989> look<00:02:51.170> quite<00:02:51.349> right

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
other one didn't come look quite right

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.140 
other one didn't come look quite right
so<00:02:51.980> then<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.190> move<00:02:52.400> back<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.849> move<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> other

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
get your comps like right first time and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.559

so<00:02:58.190> yeah<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:58.549> sticking<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.849> rows<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.269> same

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
so yeah just sticking the rows in same

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.180 
so yeah just sticking the rows in same
thing<00:02:59.599> stick<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.049> layer<00:03:00.260> mask<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.709> and<00:03:00.950> erase

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
thing stick a layer mask on it and erase

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.030 
thing stick a layer mask on it and erase
the<00:03:01.340> edges<00:03:01.670> as<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.590> see<00:03:03.739> it's<00:03:03.859> coming

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
the edges as you can see it's coming

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.099 
the edges as you can see it's coming
together<00:03:04.220> quite<00:03:04.790> nicely<00:03:05.269> already<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.750> mean<00:03:05.900> it

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
together quite nicely already I mean it

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.830 
together quite nicely already I mean it
looks<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.410> crap<00:03:06.739> but<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:08.480> just

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
looks like crap but it's just

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.869 
looks like crap but it's just
composition<00:03:09.680> like<00:03:10.069> that<00:03:10.310> you're<00:03:10.400> doing<00:03:10.549> it

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
composition like that you're doing it

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.190 
composition like that you're doing it
doesn't<00:03:11.030> have<00:03:11.269> to<00:03:11.420> look<00:03:11.510> good<00:03:11.660> at<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.840> moment

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
doesn't have to look good at the moment

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.890 
doesn't have to look good at the moment
and<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.730> know<00:03:13.760> you'll<00:03:14.000> see<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.569> finished

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and you know you'll see the finished

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.020 
and you know you'll see the finished
result<00:03:15.019> at<00:03:15.319> the<00:03:15.349> end<00:03:15.440> just<00:03:16.130> have<00:03:16.280> faith<00:03:16.579> it'll

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
result at the end just have faith it'll

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.099 
result at the end just have faith it'll
be<00:03:17.150> fine<00:03:17.420> and<00:03:19.209> yeah<00:03:20.209> basically<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:20.959> is

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
be fine and yeah basically this is

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.250 
be fine and yeah basically this is
literally<00:03:21.560> just<00:03:22.480> basic<00:03:23.480> basic<00:03:23.870> stuff<00:03:24.079> so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
literally just basic basic stuff so

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.170 
literally just basic basic stuff so
you've<00:03:24.380> got<00:03:24.620> some<00:03:24.859> in<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.790> know<00:03:25.970> where<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you've got some in so you know where the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.390 
you've got some in so you know where the
shapes<00:03:26.419> are<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.709> is<00:03:27.859> really<00:03:28.010> good<00:03:28.250> for

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
shapes are and this is really good for

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.190 
shapes are and this is really good for
swallows<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.150> get<00:03:29.299> photos<00:03:29.599> or<00:03:29.720> swallows<00:03:30.049> and

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
swallows just get photos or swallows and

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.589 
swallows just get photos or swallows and
kind<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.380> trace<00:03:30.560> around<00:03:30.739> them<00:03:31.389> that's<00:03:32.389> if<00:03:32.510> you

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
kind of trace around them that's if you

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.759 
kind of trace around them that's if you
want<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:32.780> do<00:03:32.840> more<00:03:32.989> detailed<00:03:33.349> swallows

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
want to do more detailed swallows

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.020 
want to do more detailed swallows
because<00:03:34.280> this<00:03:34.430> design<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.819> going<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.970> be

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
because this design is going to be

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.400 
because this design is going to be
neo-traditional<00:03:35.810> rather<00:03:36.019> something<00:03:36.290> I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
neo-traditional rather something I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.690 
neo-traditional rather something I
wanted<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.680> mention<00:03:36.859> there's<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.250> big<00:03:37.459> big

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
wanted to mention there's a big big

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.770 
wanted to mention there's a big big
difference<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> lot<00:03:38.480> of<00:03:38.510> people<00:03:38.720> don't

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
difference that a lot of people don't

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.089 
difference that a lot of people don't
realize<00:03:38.989> between<00:03:39.470> traditional<00:03:39.950> and

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
realize between traditional and

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.120 
realize between traditional and
neo-traditional<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:42.010> traditional<00:03:43.010> is

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
neo-traditional and traditional is

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.710 
neo-traditional and traditional is
really<00:03:43.579> basic<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.030> stuff<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.299> do<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.510> all<00:03:44.630> my

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
really basic the stuff I do in all my

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.539 
really basic the stuff I do in all my
videos<00:03:44.989> near<00:03:45.500> traditional<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.099> what<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.489> is

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
videos near traditional is what this is

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.240 
videos near traditional is what this is
going<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:46.910> be<00:03:47.139> and<00:03:48.139> you'll<00:03:48.260> see<00:03:48.500> that<00:03:48.889> there's

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
going to be and you'll see that there's

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.699 
going to be and you'll see that there's
a<00:03:49.310> huge<00:03:49.519> difference<00:03:49.970> between<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:51.560> kind

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
a huge difference between it it's kind

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.099 
a huge difference between it it's kind
of<00:03:51.769> like<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:51.919> modern<00:03:52.250> version<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:53.109> old-school

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
of like a modern version of old-school

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.699 
of like a modern version of old-school
but<00:03:54.880> kind<00:03:55.880> of<00:03:55.970> taken<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.480> more<00:03:57.380> sort<00:03:57.650> of

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
but kind of taken to more sort of

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.629 
but kind of taken to more sort of
detailed<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:59.980> illustration<00:04:00.980> each<00:04:01.160> place<00:04:01.370> I

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
detailed and illustration each place I

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.110 
detailed and illustration each place I
guess<00:04:01.940> but<00:04:03.040> yeah<00:04:04.040> this<00:04:04.190> is<00:04:04.340> basically<00:04:04.970> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
guess but yeah this is basically the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.000 
guess but yeah this is basically the
final<00:04:05.450> thing<00:04:05.629> now<00:04:06.109> you<00:04:06.169> saw<00:04:06.440> me<00:04:06.560> mock-up<00:04:06.859> you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
final thing now you saw me mock-up you

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.379 
final thing now you saw me mock-up you
just<00:04:07.160> draw<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:07.400> few<00:04:07.549> flames<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:07.970> background

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
just draw a few flames in the background

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.339 
just draw a few flames in the background
like<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.599> one<00:04:08.750> on<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.900> left<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.319> then

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
like the one on the left and then

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.670 
like the one on the left and then
the<00:04:10.499> one<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.769> middle<00:04:10.980> is<00:04:12.019> kind<00:04:13.019> of<00:04:13.200> it's

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
the one in the middle is kind of it's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.500 
the one in the middle is kind of it's
got<00:04:13.829> both<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.310> them<00:04:14.609> there<00:04:14.819> so<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.269> see

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
got both of them there so you can see

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.990 
got both of them there so you can see
how<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.810> traced<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.530> through<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.669> can<00:04:17.699> kind<00:04:17.940> of

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
how I traced it through you can kind of

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.520 
how I traced it through you can kind of
see<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.359> rows<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.750> basically<00:04:19.079> followed<00:04:19.440> all

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
see on the rows I basically followed all

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.560 
see on the rows I basically followed all
the<00:04:19.590> lines<00:04:19.889> of<00:04:20.160> skulls<00:04:20.430> same<00:04:20.699> thing<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.299> the

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
the lines of skulls same thing and the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.999 
the lines of skulls same thing and the
bones<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:21.959> literally<00:04:22.380> like<00:04:22.530> exactly<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
bones are literally like exactly the

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.680 
bones are literally like exactly the
same<00:04:23.190> which<00:04:23.340> followed<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:23.789> main<00:04:24.000> lines<00:04:24.389> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
same which followed the main lines in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.140 
same which followed the main lines in
the<00:04:25.139> piece<00:04:25.320> now<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:25.830> would<00:04:26.220> show<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.490> more<00:04:26.759> but

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
the piece now I would show you more but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.270 
the piece now I would show you more but
this<00:04:27.840> video<00:04:28.110> would<00:04:28.320> have<00:04:28.410> been<00:04:28.500> insanely<00:04:28.919> long

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
this video would have been insanely long

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.860 
this video would have been insanely long
if<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.580> had<00:04:29.699> actually<00:04:29.820> drawn<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.449> whole<00:04:30.509> thing

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
if I had actually drawn the whole thing

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
if I had actually drawn the whole thing
on<00:04:31.080> video<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:31.889> can<00:04:32.160> do<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.490> I<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.729> do<00:04:32.849> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
on video but I can do that I can do a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.529 
on video but I can do that I can do a
time<00:04:33.150> lapse<00:04:33.500> if<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:35.639> know<00:04:35.759> you<00:04:35.820> start<00:04:36.360> to

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
time lapse if you know you start to

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.540 
time lapse if you know you start to
finish<00:04:36.690> one<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.169> these<00:04:37.259> I'll<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:38.009> have<00:04:38.160> to<00:04:38.310> do

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
finish one of these I'll just have to do

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.800 
finish one of these I'll just have to do
it<00:04:38.669> really<00:04:38.789> fast<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.300> if<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.509> want<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.720> see

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
it really fast so if you want to see

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.629 
it really fast so if you want to see
that<00:04:39.960> let<00:04:40.139> me<00:04:40.169> know<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:40.620> union<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.340> you'll<00:04:41.460> see

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
that let me know and union it you'll see

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.270 
that let me know and union it you'll see
all<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.970> line<00:04:42.150> work<00:04:42.360> phase<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.810> everything

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
all the line work phase and everything

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.830 
all the line work phase and everything
and<00:04:44.280> then<00:04:44.430> obviously<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:45.150> one<00:04:45.449> on<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.630> right

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
and then obviously the one on the right

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.249 
and then obviously the one on the right
is<00:04:46.050> to<00:04:46.530> finish<00:04:46.680> design<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.780> like<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.930> say<00:04:49.080> is

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
is to finish design and like I say is

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.540 
is to finish design and like I say is
completely<00:04:49.500> different<00:04:49.830> from<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.250> one<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.490> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
completely different from the one on the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.700 
completely different from the one on the
left<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.389> have<00:04:51.539> changed<00:04:51.930> some<00:04:52.110> stuff<00:04:52.289> but

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
left and I have changed some stuff but

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.040 
left and I have changed some stuff but
essentially<00:04:53.490> it's<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.789> same<00:04:53.880> and<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.840> thing

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
essentially it's the same and the thing

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.920 
essentially it's the same and the thing
that<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:57.000> know<00:04:57.120> the<00:04:57.240> kind<00:04:57.449> of<00:04:57.509> hard<00:04:57.690> part

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
that is you know the kind of hard part

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.480 
that is you know the kind of hard part
is<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.229> technique<00:04:58.680> that's<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.099> only<00:04:59.280> bit

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
is the technique that's the only bit

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.900 
is the technique that's the only bit
which<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.990> might<00:05:01.440> stumble<00:05:01.770> on<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> few

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
which you might stumble on a few

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.430 
which you might stumble on a few
problems<00:05:03.300> because<00:05:03.509> the<00:05:03.750> composition<00:05:04.020> is

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
problems because the composition is

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.740 
problems because the composition is
fairly<00:05:04.979> easy<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.479> play<00:05:06.599> about

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
fairly easy because you can play about

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.279 
fairly easy because you can play about
this<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.229> easily<00:05:07.710> on<00:05:08.160> Photoshop<00:05:08.970> but<00:05:09.449> the

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
this so easily on Photoshop but the

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.249 
this so easily on Photoshop but the
technique<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:11.340> literally<00:05:11.849> you<00:05:12.690> know<00:05:12.810> just<00:05:13.110> get

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
technique is literally you know just get

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.610 
technique is literally you know just get
in<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:13.440> line<00:05:13.620> work<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:15.300> look<00:05:16.020> good<00:05:16.199> basically

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
in the line work so look good basically

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.249 
in the line work so look good basically
that<00:05:16.830> does<00:05:17.009> take<00:05:17.250> some<00:05:17.400> practice<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:18.110> as<00:05:19.110> long

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
that does take some practice but as long

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.600 
that does take some practice but as long
as<00:05:19.289> you've<00:05:19.470> got<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.680> decent<00:05:19.979> composition<00:05:20.520> to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
as you've got a decent composition to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.360 
as you've got a decent composition to
work<00:05:20.789> from<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.530> you're<00:05:22.530> good<00:05:22.800> with<00:05:22.949> line<00:05:23.099> ways

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
work from and you're good with line ways

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.700 
work from and you're good with line ways
then<00:05:23.970> you'll<00:05:24.210> be<00:05:24.360> fine<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.870> line<00:05:25.080> weights<00:05:25.320> and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
then you'll be fine and line weights and

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.649 
then you'll be fine and line weights and
you<00:05:26.130> just<00:05:26.280> go<00:05:26.460> around<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:27.060> sort<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.360> main

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
you just go around the sort of main

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.290 
you just go around the sort of main
parts<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.500> design<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.909> very<00:05:30.120> outer

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
parts of the design so the very outer

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.390 
parts of the design so the very outer
edge<00:05:30.479> of<00:05:30.599> the<00:05:30.690> rows<00:05:30.900> for<00:05:31.139> example<00:05:31.590> and<00:05:31.830> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
edge of the rows for example and the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.770 
edge of the rows for example and the
very<00:05:32.610> outer<00:05:32.789> edge<00:05:32.970> of<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.210> skull<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.750> eye

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
very outer edge of the skull and the eye

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.300 
very outer edge of the skull and the eye
sockets<00:05:34.349> and<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:34.590> nose<00:05:34.740> socket<00:05:35.099> and<00:05:35.159> just

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
sockets and the nose socket and just

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.409 
sockets and the nose socket and just
around<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.610> teeth<00:05:35.789> just<00:05:36.000> to<00:05:36.120> kind<00:05:36.300> of

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
around the teeth just to kind of

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.749 
around the teeth just to kind of
accentuate<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:37.320> main<00:05:37.470> features<00:05:37.889> and<00:05:38.190> that

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
accentuate the main features and that

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.370 
accentuate the main features and that
will<00:05:38.849> give<00:05:38.970> you<00:05:39.030> a<00:05:39.060> line<00:05:39.240> work<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.479> lot<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.870> fun<00:05:40.110> a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
will give you a line work a lot of fun a

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.279 
will give you a line work a lot of fun a
lot<00:05:41.159> more<00:05:41.400> that's<00:05:42.210> a<00:05:42.300> name<00:05:42.449> I<00:05:42.900> don't<00:05:42.990> even<00:05:43.139> know

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
lot more that's a name I don't even know

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.749 
lot more that's a name I don't even know
what<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.650> called<00:05:43.710> there's<00:05:44.250> not<00:05:44.400> even<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.610> word

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
what it's called there's not even a word

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.390 
what it's called there's not even a word
for<00:05:44.970> it<00:05:45.090> but<00:05:45.449> it<00:05:45.539> just<00:05:45.630> looks<00:05:45.870> good<00:05:46.110> so<00:05:46.770> that's

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
for it but it just looks good so that's

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.790 
for it but it just looks good so that's
a<00:05:47.490> little<00:05:47.639> tip<00:05:47.849> but<00:05:48.720> let's<00:05:49.020> say<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.199> only<00:05:49.590> do

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
a little tip but let's say I only do

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.110 
a little tip but let's say I only do
that<00:05:49.919> with<00:05:50.009> neo-traditional<00:05:50.639> I<00:05:50.699> don't<00:05:50.909> do<00:05:51.030> it

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
that with neo-traditional I don't do it

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.219 
that with neo-traditional I don't do it
with<00:05:51.240> my<00:05:51.330> traditional<00:05:51.840> stuff<00:05:52.020> because<00:05:52.199> that

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
with my traditional stuff because that

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.740 
with my traditional stuff because that
was<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.530> one<00:05:52.830> single<00:05:53.130> line<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:54.240> lot<00:05:54.630> more

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
was a one single line and a lot more

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.749 
was a one single line and a lot more
basic<00:05:55.139> and<00:05:55.770> one<00:05:56.070> thing<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.340> forgot<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.580> mention

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
basic and one thing I forgot to mention

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.760 
basic and one thing I forgot to mention
is<00:05:57.360> I<00:05:57.630> actually<00:05:57.870> did<00:05:58.110> this<00:05:58.229> with<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.409> graphics

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
is I actually did this with a graphics

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.920 
is I actually did this with a graphics
tablet<00:05:58.830> all<00:05:59.610> their<00:05:59.909> illustrations<00:06:00.659> sort<00:06:00.870> of

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
tablet all their illustrations sort of

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.010 
tablet all their illustrations sort of
line<00:06:01.110> face<00:06:01.349> and<00:06:01.620> I<00:06:02.460> use<00:06:02.849> a<00:06:02.880> Wacom<00:06:03.300> Bamboo<00:06:03.360> and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
line face and I use a Wacom Bamboo and

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.209
