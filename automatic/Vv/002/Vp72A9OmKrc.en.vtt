pocket clips so I basically went to all
my<00:01:06.830> local<00:01:07.010> hardware<00:01:07.430> stores<00:01:07.790> looking<00:01:08.210> for<00:01:08.510> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
my local hardware stores looking for a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.460 
my local hardware stores looking for a
t6<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:09.950> t8<00:01:10.310> bit<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.090> for<00:01:11.299> some<00:01:11.510> reason<00:01:11.930> you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
t6 and a t8 bit and for some reason you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.840 
t6 and a t8 bit and for some reason you
know<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.650> went<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> bunch<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:13.340> them<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.640> for

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
know I went to a bunch of them and for

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.330 
know I went to a bunch of them and for
some<00:01:14.060> reason<00:01:14.450> nobody<00:01:15.320> had<00:01:15.680> anything<00:01:15.890> smaller

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
some reason nobody had anything smaller

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.219 
some reason nobody had anything smaller
than<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.520> t10<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.270> I<00:01:17.299> ordered<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.780> tool<00:01:18.049> and

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
than a t10 so I ordered this tool and

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.039 
than a t10 so I ordered this tool and
it's<00:01:18.380> worked<00:01:18.619> out<00:01:18.770> really<00:01:18.830> good<00:01:19.490> for<00:01:19.549> me<00:01:20.049> so

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.050 
it's worked out really good for me so
here's<00:01:21.409> just<00:01:21.920> to<00:01:22.250> kind<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.490> gauge<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.880> size

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
here's just to kind of gauge the size

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.789 
here's just to kind of gauge the size
here's<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.540> pen<00:01:24.340> normal<00:01:25.340> ink<00:01:25.580> pen<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.650> there's

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
the back though so you just basically

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.539 
the back though so you just basically
take<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:29.930> throw<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:30.950> your<00:01:31.040> range<00:01:31.250> bag

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
take this throw it in your range bag

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.980 
take this throw it in your range bag
throw<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.060> your<00:01:32.150> bug<00:01:32.330> out<00:01:32.479> bag<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:32.750> you're

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
throw it in your bug out bag and you're

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.399 
throw it in your bug out bag and you're
good<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.229> go

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
good to go

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.040 
hell and back so let's see we got inside
here

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
here

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.960 
here
unscrew<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.230> there's<00:02:04.470> cap<00:02:06.080> there's<00:02:07.080> our<00:02:07.290> bits

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
unscrew it there's cap there's our bits

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
unscrew it there's cap there's our bits
while<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.210> fell<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.479> onto<00:02:10.140> my<00:02:10.229> hand

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
while this fell out onto my hand

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.320 
while this fell out onto my hand
perfectly<00:02:10.979> I'm<00:02:11.490> just<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.820> pretend<00:02:12.210> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
perfectly I'm just gonna pretend I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330 
perfectly I'm just gonna pretend I
planned<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:12.990> or<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> did<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.310> on

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
planned it that way or I did that on

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.790 
planned it that way or I did that on
purpose<00:02:14.460> from<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> bottom<00:02:15.870> here<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.590> have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
purpose from the bottom here you have

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.750 
purpose from the bottom here you have
the<00:02:17.010> t8<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.870> middlee<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> t6<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.250> then

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the t8 in the middlee of the t6 and then

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.990 
the t8 in the middlee of the t6 and then
here<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.330> Phillips<00:02:21.750> head<00:02:23.000> basically

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
here you have a Phillips head basically

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.060 
here you have a Phillips head basically
what<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.660> do<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:26.840> on<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.320> tip<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> tool

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
what you do is on this tip of the tool

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.730 
what you do is on this tip of the tool
this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.730> side<00:02:30.050> with<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.230> cavity<00:02:31.710> that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
this is the side with the cavity that

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.340 
this is the side with the cavity that
you<00:02:32.100> can<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.330> store<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> bits<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.080> on

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you can that you store the bits in on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.610 
you can that you store the bits in on
this<00:02:34.590> side<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.550> basically<00:02:36.140> push<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.470> there

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
this side you basically push it in there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.890 
this side you basically push it in there
and<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.130> magnetized<00:02:38.820> as<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.630> see

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and it is magnetized as you can see

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.680 
and it is magnetized as you can see
it'll<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.340> sucked<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.360> so

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it'll kind of sucked it in like that so

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.020 
it'll kind of sucked it in like that so
you<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.830> retention<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.520> good<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.880> that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
you know the retention is good in that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.760 
you know the retention is good in that
aspect<00:02:46.280> you've<00:02:47.280> got<00:02:47.460> some<00:02:47.700> neural<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.210> here

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
aspect you've got some neural in here

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.710 
aspect you've got some neural in here
which<00:02:49.770> does<00:02:50.070> help<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.460> little<00:02:50.580> bit<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.510> one

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
which does help a little bit but the one

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720 
which does help a little bit but the one
gripe<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:53.070> with<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.460> tool

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
gripe that I really have with this tool

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.060 
gripe that I really have with this tool
is<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:55.290> there's<00:02:55.500> no<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:57.630> know<00:02:57.690> lateral<00:02:58.470> part

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
is that there's no you know lateral part

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.590 
is that there's no you know lateral part
I<00:02:59.340> don't<00:02:59.640> know<00:02:59.790> what<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.060> call<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.390> that

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
I don't know what you call it that

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.270 
I don't know what you call it that
sticks<00:03:01.020> out<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.380> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.770> an<00:03:01.950> Allen

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
sticks out here kind of like an Allen

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.220 
sticks out here kind of like an Allen
wrench<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.820> help<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.180> torque<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> screws

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230
