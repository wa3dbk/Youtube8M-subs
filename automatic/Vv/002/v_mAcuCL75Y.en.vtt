 I have long been saying that the tube is very 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.789
 popular heading for people who do not 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.109

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.719
 I am full of full gameplay 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.410
 so there will be something nonsense 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.200
 on the background 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.390
 one of the most interesting for me personally 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000
 last week's news was that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.190
 youtube opens a new service 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.540
 Broadcasting on a particular tube for specific games 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.549
 and now youtube will compete with 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 ball just a few months ago 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
 youtube and its child service 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.369

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.560
 decided that well let's compete with 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.409
 but actually fight with whoever was 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.060

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.540

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.090
 Immediately there were people who started 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.340
 resent the fact that this dota is not 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.560

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.480

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.779
 interested me and many others I 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.539
 I think we too will be interested in the news 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:36.800
 what started crowdfunding 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.900
 campaign to collect money for shooting 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.120
 porn in outer space 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.210
 space course on the space station 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.319
 but still think how much 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.029
 industry stepped forward 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:53.159
 there used to be mechanics electricians mechanics 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.560
 Iâ€™m even afraid of it 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.090
 imagine 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.190

 slowly shoot your spacesuit any 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.910
 case and I think this is a company 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.510
 breaks off because they collected very 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.730
 little money for 1 so to speak boom and hardly 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:16.470
 whether they will collect more so goodbye dreams 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:20.240
 back to earth so to speak 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.440
