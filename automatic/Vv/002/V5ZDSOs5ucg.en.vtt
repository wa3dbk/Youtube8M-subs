the<00:02:54.160> way<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.580> to<00:02:54.610> make<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.850> messy<00:02:55.180> bun<00:02:55.330> is<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
the way I like to make a messy bun is to

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410 
the way I like to make a messy bun is to
fold<00:02:56.050> my<00:02:56.230> hair<00:02:56.470> into<00:02:56.950> thirds<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.670> then<00:02:58.150> take<00:02:58.390> a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
fold my hair into thirds and then take a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.330 
fold my hair into thirds and then take a
hairband<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.440> wrap<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.680> around<00:02:59.920> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
hairband and just wrap it around that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.580 
hairband and just wrap it around that
and<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:01.330> creates<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.720> really<00:03:01.990> really<00:03:02.230> messy

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
and that creates a really really messy

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.650 
and that creates a really really messy
look<00:03:02.830> which<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.180> musting<00:03:04.570> a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
look which I like but it's musting a

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.820 
look which I like but it's musting a
little<00:03:04.870> bit<00:03:04.990> more<00:03:05.230> neat<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.560> could<00:03:05.710> always

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
little bit more neat you could always

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.590 
little bit more neat you could always
wrap<00:03:06.100> your<00:03:06.250> hair<00:03:06.400> into<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.730> bun<00:03:06.820> shape<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.420> then

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
wrap your hair into a bun shape and then

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.640 
wrap your hair into a bun shape and then
wrap<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> hair<00:03:08.050> scrunchie<00:03:08.380> around<00:03:08.590> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
wrap the hair scrunchie around the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.900 
wrap the hair scrunchie around the
bottom<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.640> would<00:03:09.760> look<00:03:09.850> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
bottom of it and that would look a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.030 
bottom of it and that would look a
little<00:03:10.060> bit<00:03:10.210> neater<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.660> that's<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.650> if<00:03:11.830> you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
little bit neater and that's it if you

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.290 
little bit neater and that's it if you
want<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.370> hair<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.640> look<00:03:12.790> more<00:03:13.000> like<00:03:13.060> the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
and then here our scrunchies and fabric

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.580 
and then here our scrunchies and fabric
glue<00:04:58.030> if<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.930> don't<00:04:59.080> want<00:04:59.200> to<00:04:59.260> cut<00:04:59.440> up<00:04:59.500> a

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
glue if you don't want to cut up a

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.990 
glue if you don't want to cut up a
t-shirt<00:04:59.920> you<00:04:59.950> could<00:05:00.220> also<00:05:00.370> use<00:05:00.670> ribbons

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
t-shirt you could also use ribbons

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.330 
t-shirt you could also use ribbons
instead<00:05:01.420> start<00:05:02.260> by<00:05:02.350> measuring<00:05:02.560> around<00:05:03.130> your

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
instead start by measuring around your

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.100 
instead start by measuring around your
head<00:05:03.490> and<00:05:03.640> then<00:05:04.210> hold<00:05:04.450> up<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.690> hair<00:05:04.870> elastic

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
head and then hold up the hair elastic

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.010 
head and then hold up the hair elastic
and<00:05:05.700> take<00:05:06.700> away<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.150> link<00:05:07.390> from<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.870> hair

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
and take away the link from the hair

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.540 
and take away the link from the hair
elastic<00:05:08.200> so<00:05:08.500> basically<00:05:08.830> subtract<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.520> from

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
elastic so basically subtract it from

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.630 
elastic so basically subtract it from
the<00:05:09.820> length<00:05:09.970> around<00:05:10.240> your<00:05:10.510> head<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:11.490> then<00:05:12.490> go

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the length around your head and then go

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.420 
the length around your head and then go
ahead<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.030> cut<00:05:13.270> right<00:05:13.540> there<00:05:14.250> then<00:05:15.250> we're

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
ahead and cut right there then we're

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.920 
ahead and cut right there then we're
going<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.640> attach<00:05:15.940> this<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.570> hair<00:05:16.720> elastic

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
going to attach this to the hair elastic

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.320 
going to attach this to the hair elastic
so<00:05:17.590> go<00:05:17.710> ahead<00:05:17.980> and<00:05:18.190> loop<00:05:18.700> the<00:05:18.880> fabric<00:05:19.210> around

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
so go ahead and loop the fabric around

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.180 
so go ahead and loop the fabric around
placing<00:05:19.960> a<00:05:20.020> little<00:05:20.260> dot<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.470> glue<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.800> hold

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
placing a little dot of glue to hold

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.400 
placing a little dot of glue to hold
that<00:05:21.310> loop<00:05:21.490> in<00:05:21.640> place<00:05:21.900> then<00:05:22.900> do<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.169> on<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
that loop in place then do that on the

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.530 
that loop in place then do that on the
other<00:05:23.500> side<00:05:23.770> as<00:05:23.890> well<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.370> then<00:05:25.270> you're<00:05:25.419> going

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
other side as well and then you're going

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.810 
other side as well and then you're going
to<00:05:25.690> want<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.930> pin<00:05:26.200> these<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:26.590> use<00:05:26.860> bobby<00:05:27.130> pins<00:05:27.220> so

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
to want to pin these I use bobby pins so

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.670 
to want to pin these I use bobby pins so
that<00:05:27.850> while<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.570> dries<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.870> glue<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.470> still

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
that while it dries the glue is still

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680 
that while it dries the glue is still
stuck<00:05:29.950> there<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.400> it<00:05:30.490> won't<00:05:30.580> come<00:05:30.790> apart<00:05:30.910> then

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
stuck there and it won't come apart then

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.180 
stuck there and it won't come apart then
take<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.080> fabrics<00:05:32.470> from<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.740> bottom<00:05:32.980> of<00:05:33.070> the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
take the fabrics from the bottom of the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.680 
take the fabrics from the bottom of the
t-shirt<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.669> cut<00:05:34.000> it<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.210> half

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
t-shirt and cut it in half

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.260 
t-shirt and cut it in half
this<00:05:34.840> makes<00:05:35.080> braiding<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.590> lot<00:05:35.890> easier<00:05:36.490> then<00:05:37.150> go

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
this makes braiding a lot easier then go

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.360 
this makes braiding a lot easier then go
ahead<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.750> make<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.169> knot<00:05:38.410> on<00:05:38.590> one<00:05:38.650> side<00:05:39.040> and

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
ahead and make a knot on one side and

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.980 
ahead and make a knot on one side and
begin<00:05:39.550> braiding<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.270> you're<00:05:40.510> going<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.780> braid

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
begin braiding and you're going to braid

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.470 
begin braiding and you're going to braid
all<00:05:41.230> the<00:05:41.290> way<00:05:41.530> down<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:42.130> found<00:05:42.490> that<00:05:42.820> for<00:05:43.419> some

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
all the way down I found that for some

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.970 
all the way down I found that for some
reason<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.020> half<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.380> fabric<00:05:44.710> of<00:05:44.860> the

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:44.980 
reason and half of the fabric of the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.590 
reason and half of the fabric of the
bottom<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.430> shirt<00:05:45.610> braided<00:05:46.120> was<00:05:46.390> the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
bottom of the shirt braided was the

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.480 
bottom of the shirt braided was the
right<00:05:46.750> amount<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.080> go<00:05:47.290> around<00:05:47.710> my<00:05:47.890> head<00:05:48.070> so

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
right amount to go around my head so

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.580 
right amount to go around my head so
that's<00:05:48.730> what<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:48.940> did<00:05:49.300> and<00:05:49.540> so<00:05:50.200> once<00:05:50.380> you<00:05:50.440> go

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
that's what I did and so once you go

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.990 
that's what I did and so once you go
ahead<00:05:50.680> and<00:05:50.980> you<00:05:51.100> braid<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.550> get<00:05:51.669> all<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:51.940> way

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
ahead and you braid and get all the way

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.640 
ahead and you braid and get all the way
to<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.240> bottom<00:05:52.390> then<00:05:53.080> you're<00:05:53.230> going<00:05:53.350> to<00:05:53.410> tie

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
to the bottom then you're going to tie

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.040 
to the bottom then you're going to tie
it<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:53.980> knot<00:05:54.310> and<00:05:54.610> actually<00:05:55.570> if<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:55.780> want<00:05:55.930> to

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
it and knot and actually if you want to

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.810 
it and knot and actually if you want to
skip<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.350> whole<00:05:56.710> hair<00:05:57.010> scrunchie<00:05:57.430> step<00:05:57.669> you

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
skip the whole hair scrunchie step you

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.250 
skip the whole hair scrunchie step you
could<00:05:58.030> just<00:05:58.270> tie<00:05:58.450> the<00:05:58.510> two<00:05:58.750> ends<00:05:58.930> of<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.110> knot

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
could just tie the two ends of the knot

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.080 
could just tie the two ends of the knot
together<00:05:59.470> and<00:05:59.860> use<00:06:00.070> that<00:06:00.250> on<00:06:00.310> its<00:06:00.580> own<00:06:00.790> for<00:06:01.060> a

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.090 
together and use that on its own for a
headband<00:06:01.450> but<00:06:02.230> if<00:06:02.350> you<00:06:02.440> want<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.680> follow<00:06:02.770> this
