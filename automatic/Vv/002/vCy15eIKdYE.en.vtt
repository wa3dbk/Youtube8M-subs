00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
and that's all that I'm doing is just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.660

security<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.210> hear<00:03:27.450> things<00:03:28.430> this<00:03:29.430> one

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
security but I hear things this one

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.510

especially because it's hot and I do not
like<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.410> my<00:03:43.650> hair<00:03:44.180> down<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:46.020> my<00:03:46.380> neck<00:03:46.680> and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
like to have my hair down on my neck and

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.800 
like to have my hair down on my neck and
I<00:03:46.980> don't<00:03:47.040> want<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.550> continuously<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.450> put<00:03:48.660> my

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
I don't want to continuously to put my

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
I don't want to continuously to put my
hair<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.489> bun<00:03:50.850> all<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.420> time<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:52.800> I
