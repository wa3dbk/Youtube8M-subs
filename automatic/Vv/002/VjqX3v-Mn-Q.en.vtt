00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 do you know many styles of motorcycles and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.639
 certainly already saw the streets models 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.340
 custom sports naked tapping and to the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.650
 three goals but what about motorbikes that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 It has neither bank nor are able to 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 climb walls 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.890
 now know the brave dead of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.890
 trial rendering sharpens the severity 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
 O 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.930
 op 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.950
 the trial is a modality of motorcycling 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.470
 which brings together sports and art in high doses 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.200
 the challenge of overcoming 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.320
 more obstacles without touching the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.320
 floor 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.150
 the requirement of special motorcycles 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 totally different from the usual one in which 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.900
 speed is not important but rather the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 force and control but already paying 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.309
 300 has an integrated tank in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.619
 aluminum frame with shock absorber 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 positioned on the outside for 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 facilitate the maintenance of your 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 lower gravity making life easier 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.710
 of the pilot and the more lightweight 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.710
 only 74 category with this 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.540
 this is perhaps the most beautiful and refined 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.790
 balance expression two hours 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.980
 The trial requires a combination of 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.840
 of technical ability talent and courage 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.480
 to meet the most interested 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.360
 natural and artificial challenges such as 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.400
 this in competitions 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.650
 every time the pilot slaps during 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.200
 the course it marks a corner 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.080
 The funny thing is that whoever has less 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.510
 points and overcame the obstacles in 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.640
 time the sport debuted in brazil he is 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.280
 Today there are 14 automakers in the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.410
 brazil you can practice the material in 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 small spaces we need the bike 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.580
 specific helmet boot and clothing 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.130
 during the pilot's maneuvers. 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.500
 stays all the time and loses or needs the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.460
 bank or even a larger tank. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.530
 capacity 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.480
 the result is that the two were 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.630
 practically eliminated 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.600
 all to dramatically reduce weight and 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.410
 increase agility to facilitate 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.560
 movements 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.630
 the handlebar saw almost 180 degrees 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.510
 the pedals that are well indented to 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.300
 to teach even easier the bikes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.180
 rely on super soft special tires 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.459
 and with low pressure providing much 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.830
 them to produce a lot of force if 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.350
 increase the weight of the most used motors 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.989
 are the type 2 time designed to 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.150
 operate in extremely low doses 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.730
 touches and the lack of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.080
 ventilation at low speeds requires 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.330
 liquid refrigeration 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.850
 In general, motorcycles use two 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.220
 times is specifically when hitting for 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.090
 being more amenable facilitates the introduction of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.090
 pilots in competition 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.660
 to deal with the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.970
 indigestible obstacles 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.430
 the suspensions are surprising 20 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.800
 short is that part of the work 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.570
 cushioning of impacts is done by 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.850
 legs of the pilots themselves 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.310
 the tuning between pilot and machine is 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.140
 capable of challenging the laws of physics as 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.920
 spectacular maneuver known as 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.920
 pepsi 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.970
 a 360-degree turn in the air only performed 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.010
 with moto trial in the rain season by 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.110
 red pilot tiago 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.920
 The cool thing is that the trio is not just a show 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.230
 closed 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.970
 the extreme technical mastery acquired 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.550
 pilot takes any other letter 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.930
 even more safely 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.890
 with street bikes 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.890
 the hole in the day to day
