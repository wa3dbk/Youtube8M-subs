00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.320
 back m do not start explaining our questions in the first five 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.139
 videos we make 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.139
 % and precisely what are we going to do so with thomas who was created 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.230
 so the price was gone to all the people who have a hard time selling themselves 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.249
 released on mac and so 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.310
 the 18-hour man on a plus everyone 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 we can only protoss program socke mozilla once everyone 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.419
 more or less everything that goes with them in kosice 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.450

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.320
 bnm trailers on coursan and mobile 11 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.960
 so I immediately started to show you 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.730
 we saw directly we have several themes proposed according to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.320
 different contexts 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.320
 you have these for example these more for action movies 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.250
 with the partners have cure 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.930
 we will immediately see 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.910
 why so it's super simple priest no knowledge in slipping cut 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.230
 stanley 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.230
 you can see here so for them 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.900
 we can directly put themselves are these little animations of the day 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.900
 that we can see in the big movies 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.769
 that's it too 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.720
 and then downwards one selects in the duel that though of 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:14.809
 rescue sis 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 in this competition 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.809
