00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.650
 when we work with devices 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.600
 mobile phones we should think that their 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.190
 characteristics are not the same as 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.770
 those of fish or consoles 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.330
 videogames so for example we should 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.980
 take into account the shorter duration of the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.529
 battery or lower capacity 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.270
 cpu processing on the other hand 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.920
 we should also think longer term 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.360
 and take into account characteristics like 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.070
 the evolution of the application its 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.370
 scalability or the characteristics of 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.370
 payment 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 one of the first decisions that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.839
 we will have to take it will be if we go to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 develop for a single platform or 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.079
 if on the contrary we will support 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.359
 different platforms and different 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.979
 versions of the operating system in the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.969
 first case we will have the advantage that 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.640
 we can center all our 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 efforts with a specific objective for 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 the disadvantage is that 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 We will decrease the size of the market if 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 We decided to support different platforms 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.580
 and operating system versions 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.619
 we will have to multiply the efforts 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.000
 developing resources and adapting to 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 the particularities of each of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.170
 they also must think if 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.429
 we want to maintain a homogeneous aspect 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.840
 of the application in all 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.220
 platforms or if on the contrary 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.470
 we want to adapt to the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 particularities of each of them in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 the first case we will have to develop 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.390
 our own bookstores while 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.620
 in a second we can use the ones 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.750
 they come with the operating system itself 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.240
 Second, we must decide what 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.120
 types of devices we will support 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.260
 either smartphones tablets or both of 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.000
 it will depend on what we have to 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.980
 develop graphical interfaces for 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.540
 different screen sizes or resources 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.540
 graphics for different resolutions 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.250
 if we are going to equip our applications 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.659
 of novel forms of interaction or if 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 its functionality depends on it 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.469
 we must carefully analyze which 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 of the sensors offered by the 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.130
 different platforms we will use 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.270
 as well as what we will do in case 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 some of them do not have the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 sensors chosen at the best of the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.299
 cases will only suppose to eliminate 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.950
 minor functionalities of the application 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.539
 while in other cases it will mean 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.539
 completely redesign the interaction 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.310
 another aspect to take into account 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.010
 is that mobile devices are more 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540
 limited that desktop computers 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.830
 so for example if the application 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.900
 you need a great capacity 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.610
 processing the result will be less 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.830
 efficient than that of their counterparts in 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.970
 desk on the other hand if our 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.769
 application consumes a lot of memory 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.209
 we will have to take into account that the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.739
 Users without equipment 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.440
 last generation probably not 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.910
 can use it finally you have to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.069
 also take into account the capacity of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.629
 storage of the device although in 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.579
 many cases this can be extended to 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.989
 through the use of memory cards does not 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.819
 it is always like that and if our application 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.920
 needs to receive in internal memory 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.329
 of the phone what can happen is that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.709
 users have to choose between 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.630
 our application and those of our 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.340
 competitors 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.540
 there are other limitations that 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.240
 condition the functioning of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.890
 our applications one of them is the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.390
 battery life since few 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.280
 users are willing to use 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.350
 applications that drastically reduce 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.460
 the battery life this usually 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.780
 constitute one of the main 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.420
 reasons for complaint in stores 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.680
 applications we must also design with 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.000
 watch the behavior of our 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.560
 application when we are not connected 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.240
 to the network either because the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.970
 disabled from the user or because 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.170
 We are in some shade area 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.100
 equally we must be careful with the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.290
 data consumption 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.880
 many users have rates of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.530
 data with limitations and they are not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.800
 willing to expand the only ones to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.320
 to be able to use our application 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.420
 Another characteristic to keep in mind is 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.620
 the speed of the network since if we are 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.880
 working with applications that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.450
 require real- time communications 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.530
 unwanted delays may occur 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.940
 finally you also have to have in 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.860
 account possible problems in the 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.610
 positioning characteristics if 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.440
 For example, we are using 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.750
 applications that require using the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.220
 gps we can usually meet 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.720
 in shadow areas that do not allow us 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.720
 do the positioning properly
