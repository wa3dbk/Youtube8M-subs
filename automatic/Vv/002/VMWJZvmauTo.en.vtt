00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
ah today I'm making ciabatta ciabatta is

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.320 
ah today I'm making ciabatta ciabatta is
a<00:00:26.630> very<00:00:26.930> famous<00:00:27.259> Italian<00:00:27.590> bread<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:28.640> some

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
a very famous Italian bread and some

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.240 
a very famous Italian bread and some
people<00:00:29.720> find<00:00:29.900> it<00:00:30.109> a<00:00:30.199> bit<00:00:30.230> difficult<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.949> make

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
people find it a bit difficult to make

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.850 
people find it a bit difficult to make
because<00:00:31.579> it's<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.210> very<00:00:32.419> soft<00:00:32.809> dog<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:33.410> very

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
because it's a very soft dog and very

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.420 
because it's a very soft dog and very
difficult<00:00:34.399> to<00:00:34.520> handle<00:00:35.079> having<00:00:36.079> said<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:36.430> and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
difficult to handle having said that and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.280 
difficult to handle having said that and
you<00:00:37.850> will<00:00:38.030> find<00:00:38.270> when<00:00:38.510> you<00:00:38.600> watch<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.019> video

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
you will find when you watch the video

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.380 
you will find when you watch the video
it's<00:00:39.739> not<00:00:39.980> all<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.190> difficult<00:00:40.550> as<00:00:41.059> long<00:00:41.269> as

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
it's not all that difficult as long as

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.740 
it's not all that difficult as long as
you<00:00:41.510> follow<00:00:41.750> all<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.260> rules<00:00:42.640> they<00:00:43.640> have<00:00:43.940> never

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
you follow all the rules they have never

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.619 
you follow all the rules they have never
meant<00:00:45.790> that<00:00:46.790> I<00:00:47.059> made<00:00:47.360> twelve<00:00:47.989> hours<00:00:48.260> ahead

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
meant that I made twelve hours ahead

meant that I made twelve hours ahead
contains<00:00:50.629> wholemeal<00:00:51.290> flour<00:00:51.670> white<00:00:52.670> flour

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
contains wholemeal flour white flour

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.170 
contains wholemeal flour white flour
yeast<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:54.140> water<00:00:54.290> that's<00:00:54.829> all<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.850> reason

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
yeast and water that's all the reason

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.720 
yeast and water that's all the reason
for<00:00:56.359> that<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.530> want<00:00:57.770> a<00:00:57.949> really

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
for that is that you want a really

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.189 
for that is that you want a really
strong<00:00:59.000> fermentation<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:01.399> yeast

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
strong fermentation and the yeast

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.710 
strong fermentation and the yeast
doubles<00:01:03.199> off<00:01:03.379> about<00:01:03.739> every<00:01:04.129> twenty<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.820> twenty

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
doubles off about every twenty to twenty

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.130 
doubles off about every twenty to twenty
minutes<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.200> half<00:01:06.380> hour<00:01:06.789> if<00:01:07.789> you<00:01:08.000> put<00:01:08.210> 10,000

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
minutes to half hour if you put 10,000

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.889 
minutes to half hour if you put 10,000
these<00:01:09.289> cells<00:01:09.619> next<00:01:10.009> to<00:01:10.100> each<00:01:10.220> other<00:01:10.570> it's<00:01:11.570> only

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
these cells next to each other it's only

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.639 
these cells next to each other it's only
just<00:01:12.320> over<00:01:12.530> centimetre<00:01:13.280> long<00:01:13.750> so<00:01:14.750> there<00:01:15.500> are

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
just over centimetre long so there are

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.100 
just over centimetre long so there are
lots<00:01:16.160> and<00:01:16.520> lots<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.940> these<00:01:17.119> cells<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
lots and lots of these cells in it that

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.859 
lots and lots of these cells in it that
are<00:01:18.140> working<00:01:18.500> away<00:01:18.830> so<00:01:19.789> putting<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.660> water

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
are working away so putting the water

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.760 
are working away so putting the water
first<00:01:23.410> but<00:01:24.410> not<00:01:24.649> all<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.220> because<00:01:25.780> it<00:01:26.780> might

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
first but not all of it because it might

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.130 
first but not all of it because it might
be<00:01:28.009> a<00:01:28.040> little<00:01:28.340> bit<00:01:28.600> needs<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.780> little<00:01:29.900> bit<00:01:30.079> more

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
be a little bit needs a little bit more

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.160 
be a little bit needs a little bit more
or<00:01:30.500> less<00:01:30.680> sometimes<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.030> flour<00:01:32.299> we<00:01:32.570> turn<00:01:32.869> or

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
or less sometimes the flour we turn or

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.010 
or less sometimes the flour we turn or
say<00:01:33.829> is<00:01:34.100> strong<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.180> will<00:01:35.329> absorb<00:01:35.479> much

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
say is strong and it will absorb much

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.319 
say is strong and it will absorb much
more<00:01:36.350> order<00:01:36.799> otherwise<00:01:37.400> it's<00:01:37.700> not<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.060> strong

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
more order otherwise it's not so strong

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.840 
more order otherwise it's not so strong
so<00:01:38.570> I<00:01:38.600> never<00:01:38.930> put<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.470> water<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.670> we're

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
so I never put all the water but we're

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.499 
so I never put all the water but we're
going<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.329> mix<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.049> consistency<00:01:43.299> here<00:01:44.299> is

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
going to mix it to consistency here is

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.910 
going to mix it to consistency here is
the<00:01:44.799> 12-hour

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the 12-hour

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
the 12-hour
amount

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:10.410 

and<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.910> put<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.240> mixer<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.940> normal

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
and and put it in the mixer in a normal

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.250 
and and put it in the mixer in a normal
rate<00:02:10.660> Toby<00:02:10.990> years<00:02:11.440> about<00:02:12.090> 68<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.570> 70<00:02:14.080> percent

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
rate Toby years about 68 to 70 percent

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.620 
rate Toby years about 68 to 70 percent
of<00:02:14.770> water<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:15.940> flour<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:18.490> dough<00:02:18.790> has

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
of water to the flour way this dough has

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.830 
of water to the flour way this dough has
nearly<00:02:20.100> 80%<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:21.610> will<00:02:21.820> be<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.360> soft

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
nearly 80% so it will be a very soft

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.640 
nearly 80% so it will be a very soft
gold<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:28.030> makes<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:28.510> go<00:02:28.810> somewhere

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
gold so it makes this go somewhere

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.180 
gold so it makes this go somewhere
between<00:02:29.800> 7<00:02:30.489> 8<00:02:30.880> maybe<00:02:31.300> 10<00:02:31.540> minutes<00:02:32.170> then<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.070> is

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
between 7 8 maybe 10 minutes then it is

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.600 
between 7 8 maybe 10 minutes then it is
completely<00:02:33.489> developed<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.800> must<00:02:36.130> come<00:02:36.459> away

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
completely developed it must come away

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.900 
completely developed it must come away
from<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.209> sides<00:02:37.239> of<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.870> bowl<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:39.370> that<00:02:39.400> the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
from the sides of the bowl so that the

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.170 
from the sides of the bowl so that the
gluten<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.370> protein<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.550> completely

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
gluten or protein is completely

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.979 
gluten or protein is completely
developed<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.380> stretch<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.750> see

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
developed so it can stretch you can see

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.300 
developed so it can stretch you can see
quite<00:02:47.320> soft<00:02:47.770> dough

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
quite soft dough

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.030 
quite soft dough
I<00:02:48.340> am<00:02:48.820> going<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.120> add<00:02:49.330> even<00:02:49.570> more<00:02:49.690> water<00:02:50.260> you're

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
I am going to add even more water you're

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.490 
I am going to add even more water you're
going<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.400> use<00:02:51.580> all<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.420> water<00:02:52.810> that's<00:02:53.350> in

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
going to use all of that water that's in

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.089 
going to use all of that water that's in
the<00:02:53.530> recipe

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.949 

all<00:02:58.099> right<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.489> can<00:02:58.700> see<00:02:58.939> now<00:02:59.180> this<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.540> come

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
all right you can see now this is come

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.789 
all right you can see now this is come
out<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.890> clean<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.939> ball<00:03:02.470> coming<00:03:03.470> away

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
out of clean of the ball coming away

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.580 
out of clean of the ball coming away
it's<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.310> sticking<00:03:04.670> anymore<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.959> this<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.409> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's not sticking anymore so this is the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.000 
it's not sticking anymore so this is the
time<00:03:06.860> when<00:03:07.849> we<00:03:08.120> stop<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.349> put<00:03:09.650> it<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:09.920> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
time when we stop it and put it in a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.479 
time when we stop it and put it in a
different<00:03:10.159> Bowl<00:03:13.299> and<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.829> see<00:03:16.099> just<00:03:16.310> how

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
different Bowl and you can see just how

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.520 
different Bowl and you can see just how
soft<00:03:16.879> it<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:18.099> very<00:03:19.099> difficult<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.359> shape<00:03:20.659> the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
soft it is very difficult to shape the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.309 
soft it is very difficult to shape the
normal<00:03:21.980> way<00:03:22.129> that<00:03:22.159> you<00:03:22.579> shape<00:03:22.879> break<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.079> I

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
normal way that you shape break so I

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.259 
normal way that you shape break so I
will<00:03:24.620> show<00:03:24.799> you<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.099> procedure<00:03:25.430> for<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.849> in

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
will show you the procedure for that in

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.020 
will show you the procedure for that in
a<00:03:26.420> minute

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
a minute

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.270 
a minute
this<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.180> very<00:03:29.510> very<00:03:29.659> sticky<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.650> actually

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
this is very very sticky it actually

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.259 
this is very very sticky it actually
helps<00:03:31.639> when<00:03:31.879> you<00:03:32.030> have<00:03:32.060> water<00:03:32.870> on<00:03:33.170> your<00:03:33.319> hands

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
helps when you have water on your hands

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:52.589 
helps when you have water on your hands
to<00:03:35.269> take<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.780> off

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.050 

put<00:03:53.599> some<00:03:53.870> glitter<00:03:54.170> over<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.980> I'll<00:03:55.760> let<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
put some glitter over this I'll let it

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.650 
put some glitter over this I'll let it
ferment<00:03:56.629> for<00:03:57.019> half<00:03:57.290> an<00:03:57.500> hour<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.120> then<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.359> will

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
ferment for half an hour and then I will

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.309 
ferment for half an hour and then I will
knock<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.590> back<00:04:00.790> knocking<00:04:01.790> back<00:04:02.269> means<00:04:03.019> make

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
knock it back knocking back means make

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.949 
knock it back knocking back means make
sure<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.769> all<00:04:03.949> the<00:04:04.099> carbon<00:04:04.549> dioxide<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:05.449> is

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
sure that all the carbon dioxide that is

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.710 
sure that all the carbon dioxide that is
now<00:04:06.169> developing<00:04:06.849> will<00:04:07.849> actually<00:04:08.329> escape

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
now developing will actually escape

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.379 
now developing will actually escape
again<00:04:09.139> and<00:04:09.349> the<00:04:09.980> yeast<00:04:10.190> cell<00:04:10.549> will<00:04:10.760> find<00:04:11.060> new

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
again and the yeast cell will find new

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:15.039 
again and the yeast cell will find new
grounds<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.079> feed<00:04:12.379> on<00:04:12.639> all<00:04:13.639> right<00:04:13.879> so<00:04:14.810> our

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
grounds to feed on all right so our

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.550 
grounds to feed on all right so our
chapati<00:04:15.769> dough<00:04:15.980> has<00:04:16.400> now<00:04:16.609> had<00:04:17.349> nearly<00:04:18.349> an<00:04:18.440> hour

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
chapati dough has now had nearly an hour

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.449 
chapati dough has now had nearly an hour
and<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:18.889> half

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
and a half

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.330 
and a half
to<00:04:19.759> ferment<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.019> meantime<00:04:21.229> I<00:04:21.470> have<00:04:21.829> noted

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
to ferment and the meantime I have noted

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.950 
to ferment and the meantime I have noted
back<00:04:23.300> three<00:04:24.169> times<00:04:24.440> at<00:04:25.340> this<00:04:25.639> stage<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.690> put

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
back three times at this stage you put

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.279 
back three times at this stage you put
some<00:04:27.199> olive<00:04:27.560> oil<00:04:27.710> into<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.580> container<00:04:29.259> quite<00:04:30.259> a

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
beautiful and we put a little bit of

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.900 
beautiful and we put a little bit of
flour<00:05:06.050> just<00:05:06.410> a<00:05:06.979> little<00:05:07.370> bit<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:10.490> just<00:05:10.520> a

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
flour just a little bit and just a

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.020 
flour just a little bit and just a
little<00:05:11.240> bit<00:05:11.389> more<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:13.370> a<00:05:13.610> little<00:05:13.639> bit<00:05:13.910> more<00:05:16.030> no

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
much now hopefully you have put an oil

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.040 
much now hopefully you have put an oil
enough<00:05:21.590> oil<00:05:21.889> so<00:05:22.190> that<00:05:22.370> will<00:05:22.580> come<00:05:22.820> out<00:05:23.050> because

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
enough oil so that will come out because

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.529 
enough oil so that will come out because
this<00:05:24.349> should<00:05:24.560> now<00:05:24.740> go<00:05:24.979> over<00:05:25.849> like<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.270> and

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
this should now go over like that and

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.580 
this should now go over like that and
just<00:05:27.470> come<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:27.979> like<00:05:28.190> this<00:05:28.990> then<00:05:29.990> we<00:05:30.169> put<00:05:30.410> some

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
just come out like this then we put some

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.950 
just come out like this then we put some
flour<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.979> top<00:05:31.009> as<00:05:31.340> well<00:05:31.599> just<00:05:32.599> for<00:05:32.840> good

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
flour on top as well just for good

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.850 
flour on top as well just for good
measure<00:05:36.400> now<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.810> divide<00:05:39.199> them<00:05:40.000> we<00:05:41.000> use<00:05:41.300> a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
measure now to divide them we use a

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.670 
measure now to divide them we use a
scraper

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.790 

you<00:05:49.680> can<00:05:50.009> see<00:05:50.430> this<00:05:50.789> is<00:05:50.970> very<00:05:51.090> delicate<00:05:51.800> it

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
you can see this is very delicate it

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.770 
you can see this is very delicate it
would<00:05:53.009> be<00:05:53.159> very<00:05:53.370> difficult<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:54.030> try<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.539> move

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
would be very difficult to try and move

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.450 
would be very difficult to try and move
them<00:05:55.319> by<00:05:55.560> hand<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:57.590> Chris<00:05:58.590> makes<00:05:58.889> new<00:05:59.129> rules

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
them by hand and Chris makes new rules

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.520 
them by hand and Chris makes new rules
like<00:05:59.699> that<00:06:00.000> I<00:06:00.560> am<00:06:01.560> putting<00:06:01.830> this<00:06:02.219> on<00:06:03.530> baking

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
like that I am putting this on baking

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:13.670 
like that I am putting this on baking
paper<00:06:05.599> and<00:06:07.370> we're<00:06:08.370> going<00:06:08.759> to<00:06:09.710> bake<00:06:10.710> them<00:06:12.680> under

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
paper and we're going to bake them under

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:23.709 
paper and we're going to bake them under
stone<00:06:14.009> and<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.610> pizza<00:06:14.879> skull<00:06:15.330> in<00:06:16.050> the<00:06:16.259> oven<00:06:16.560> okay

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:26.540 

so<00:06:24.719> ready<00:06:25.590> to<00:06:25.710> put<00:06:25.889> them<00:06:26.039> in<00:06:26.159> the<00:06:26.250> oven<00:06:26.280> now

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
so ready to put them in the oven now

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.649 
so ready to put them in the oven now
they're<00:06:27.030> proof<00:06:28.460> and<00:06:29.460> I'll<00:06:30.300> put<00:06:30.509> you<00:06:30.599> straight

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:30.659 
they're proof and I'll put you straight

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:39.040 
they're proof and I'll put you straight
on<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.229> stones<00:06:31.650> like<00:06:31.949> that

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.780 

as<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.320> said<00:06:40.590> before<00:06:40.940> you<00:06:41.940> can<00:06:42.210> easily<00:06:42.450> do<00:06:42.930> that

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 
as I said before you can easily do that

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.000 
as I said before you can easily do that
on<00:06:44.790> a<00:06:44.850> try<00:06:45.300> to<00:06:45.360> start<00:06:45.780> afraid<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.440> I<00:06:46.560> also<00:06:46.770> give

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
on a try to start afraid and I also give
