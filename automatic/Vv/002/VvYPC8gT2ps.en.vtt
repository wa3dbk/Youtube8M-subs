now comes the real stuff

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.740
the laptop feels very sturdy in hand , i love the texture added on the top cover which really enhances the look of it

00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:20.468
basically its a fingerprint magnet

usb 2.0 hub, memory card reader, and headphone jack

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.720
below the thing which i don't like about is the air vents are down, which mean it will get

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.000
hot soon if not kept on flat surface , which is very common standard in laptops
