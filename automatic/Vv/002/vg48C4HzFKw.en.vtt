me but i did move the lever and it
caused<00:04:58.300> this<00:04:58.600> star<00:04:59.380> pattern<00:04:59.800> to<00:04:59.950> move<00:05:00.130> could

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
caused this star pattern to move could

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.930 
caused this star pattern to move could
see<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.510> stars<00:05:01.840> oh<00:05:02.200> well<00:05:03.040> they<00:05:03.700> could<00:05:03.850> have

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
see the stars oh well they could have

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.580 
see the stars oh well they could have
just<00:05:03.970> been<00:05:04.240> points<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.690> light<00:05:04.840> one<00:05:05.350> like<00:05:05.560> a

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
just been points a light one like a

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.250 
just been points a light one like a
window<00:05:06.040> is<00:05:06.280> like<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.700> could<00:05:06.940> like<00:05:07.630> like<00:05:08.080> the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
window is like you could like like the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.230 
window is like you could like like the
stars<00:05:08.590> were<00:05:08.800> either<00:05:08.920> projected<00:05:09.730> on<00:05:09.850> or

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
stars were either projected on or

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.850 
stars were either projected on or
somehow<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.660> could<00:05:10.990> see<00:05:11.260> through<00:05:11.530> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
somehow you could see through the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.000 
somehow you could see through the
surfaces<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:14.080> floor<00:05:14.320> walls<00:05:14.680> and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
surfaces of the the floor walls and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.400 
surfaces of the the floor walls and
seeing<00:05:15.220> like<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.460> hologram<00:05:15.970> almost<00:05:16.420> yeah<00:05:16.930> some

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
seeing like a hologram almost yeah some

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.080 
seeing like a hologram almost yeah some
sort<00:05:17.650> of<00:05:17.710> some<00:05:17.920> kind<00:05:18.070> of<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.310> projection<00:05:18.820> or

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
sort of some kind of a projection or

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.740 
sort of some kind of a projection or
reviewing<00:05:19.620> method<00:05:20.620> did<00:05:21.460> let<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:21.640> respond<00:05:22.390> at

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
reviewing method did let it respond at

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.650 
reviewing method did let it respond at
all<00:05:22.930> here<00:05:23.350> moving<00:05:24.190> me<00:05:24.400> yeah<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:25.000> leather<00:05:25.180> the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
all here moving me yeah the leather the

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.930 
all here moving me yeah the leather the
leather<00:05:25.690> caused<00:05:26.200> that<00:05:26.410> to<00:05:26.620> move<00:05:26.800> but<00:05:27.790> these

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
leather caused that to move but these

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.750 
leather caused that to move but these
other<00:05:27.970> buttons<00:05:28.620> was<00:05:29.620> mainly<00:05:29.920> hoping<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.610> open

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
other buttons was mainly hoping to open

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.620 
other buttons was mainly hoping to open
a<00:05:31.030> door<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:33.000> know<00:05:34.000> something<00:05:34.330> didn't<00:05:34.540> do

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
a door and know something didn't do

a door and know something didn't do
anything<00:05:34.900> some<00:05:35.500> of<00:05:35.650> them<00:05:35.740> cause<00:05:36.210> this<00:05:37.210> little

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
anything some of them cause this little

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.600 
anything some of them cause this little
screen<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:38.230> change<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.740> little<00:05:38.860> bit<00:05:39.270> but<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:42.190> was

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
screen to change a little bit but it was

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.550 
screen to change a little bit but it was
the<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:43.090> was<00:05:43.240> moving<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.720> lever<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.200> really

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
the it was moving that lever that really

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.580 
the it was moving that lever that really
you<00:05:44.860> know<00:05:45.010> kind<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:46.110> did<00:05:47.110> was<00:05:47.290> it<00:05:47.470> was

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
you know kind of did was it was

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.000 
you know kind of did was it was
disoriented<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:48.850> have<00:05:49.000> those<00:05:49.360> that's<00:05:50.230> the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
disoriented to have those that's the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.770 
disoriented to have those that's the
star<00:05:51.340> pattern<00:05:51.730> move<00:05:51.940> all<00:05:52.180> simultaneously

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
star pattern move all simultaneously

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.410 
star pattern move all simultaneously
like<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.190> resolved<00:05:55.060> I<00:05:55.120> wasn't<00:05:55.330> going

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
like that so I resolved I wasn't going

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.390 
like that so I resolved I wasn't going
to<00:05:55.510> mess<00:05:55.660> with<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.960> anymore<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.280> was

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
to mess with that anymore and it was

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.730 
to mess with that anymore and it was
about<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.610> time<00:05:57.790> that<00:05:58.920> I<00:06:01.230> somehow<00:06:02.230> sensed

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
about that time that I somehow sensed

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.910 
about that time that I somehow sensed
that<00:06:03.070> there<00:06:03.280> was<00:06:03.490> somebody<00:06:04.060> watching<00:06:04.360> me<00:06:04.920> and

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
that there was somebody watching me and

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.330 
that there was somebody watching me and
I<00:06:06.040> turned<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.520> see<00:06:07.410> that's<00:06:08.410> what<00:06:09.040> I<00:06:09.070> took<00:06:09.190> to

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340 
I turned the see that's what I took to
