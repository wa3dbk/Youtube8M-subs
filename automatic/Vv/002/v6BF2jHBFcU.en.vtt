00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.930
 more to our application program and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 games for them prepare to see 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.170
 Today's selection is not 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.170
 I entertain and we begin 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.450
 the remake of total rical movie 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.400
 noventera with futurist airs is a 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.550
 point to premiere in movie theaters 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.830
 of half the world the film starred in 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.870
 this occasion by colin farrell is the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.390
 basis of the plot of the official game that 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.230
 in this case unlike other 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:44.540
 movies do not develop it gameloft no 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 total rival lord for iphone and ipad 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.880
 is developed by young james this 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.890
 means that we can not enjoy 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.519
 all the graphic spectacularity of 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.800
 other fps however with full recall 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.559
 we have taken a joy to start 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.989
 to play it since it offers a setting 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.750
 very faithful to the movie a section 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.650
 very good 3d graphic and a complete 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.650
 weapons arsenal 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.820
 now unlike most of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.579
 schutter for total rays rical no 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.009
 offers a free gameplay which for 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.590
 true is sometimes even annoying in 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.770
 touch screens but it's about 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.479
 a game on rails this allows us 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.149
 leave aside having to control 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.860
 a pack of movement to focus 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.860
 just have a point and shoot 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.520
 for lovers of total history 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.950
 rical introduces a kind of 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.410
 story comic style that is going 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.630
 telling how the character suffers a 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.910
 substitution of memories and how it goes 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.580
 recovering his true identity with 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.650
 certain situations a game that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.480
 you can download to relive the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.480
 story in an entertaining way 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.300
 sure you will remember the games of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.100
 aircraft of the arcade machines those 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.229
 where we had to shoot down everything 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.410
 enemy vehicle whether it was another plane 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
 tanks trucks turrets then with the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.770
 track 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.350
 hdi returns to this exciting genre at 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.570
 ipad an airplane game made for 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:27.300
 entertain you for hours the goal 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.970
 in the hd attack it is simple to get 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.970
 knock down the more enemies the better 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.180
 they will try to stop us from any 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.530
 way shooting over us 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.190
 bombing us by throwing waves of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.860
 vehicles in the adac hd we have a 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.260
 control system is bestial so much that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.270
 With just one finger we can control everything 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.760
 the system of displacement of the plane 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.420
 in fact, you do not have to go shooting 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.820
 because it is automatic and constant 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.280
 analyzing a bit the adac hd we can 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.500
 highlight three super important points 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.230
 On the one hand we have a graphic section 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.020
 very good with 3d textures and a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.740
 very careful atmosphere also we 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.410
 like 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.270
 playability that offers and how not the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.340
 system of challenges and achievements that we 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.200
 allows to make stops in military bases 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 and buy new weapons 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.969
 with summer over it is very normal 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.579
 get to September and get to order 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:31.620
 the thousands of photos taken during the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.230
 vacation in the terraced pool 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.049
 summer a very original way is 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.000
 organize them through collapse or what 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.409
 which is the same photos grouped in a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.209
 same frame forming geometric boundaries 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.549
 well an application to create 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.250
 collage of photos on the ipad very good is 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.409
 diptych with this app that is among the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.079
 most downloaded from the app store 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.680
 we can create incredible queues in just 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.049
 a few minutes its operation is 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.970
 really simple, you just have to 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.099
 enter and choose the type of collage that 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.290
 more suits our idea to click 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.840
 about each box and lg in the photo to 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.180
 place and export it or to the album 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.829
 photos or any web service like 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.860
 instagram facebook twitter flickr 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.620
 etc 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.510
 now bing in addition to the basic collage 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.030
 diptych allows us to do some 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.460
 modifications such as changing the thickness or 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.950
 color of the separating edges give them 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.110
 a curved touch to the corners or even 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.390
 modify some aspects of the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.800
 images used as saturation 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.800
 contrast or tone 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.710
 one of the things we do with each 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.200
 new device that we buy either 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.840
 a mobile a pc a laptop or a tablet 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.990
 is to customize its appearance and change the 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.270
 screen wallpaper well despite 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.220
 that does not allow us to do so many 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.350
 modifications like android with the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.080
 Appropriate resources and a little taste 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.970
 we can completely change the looks 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:08.400
 from the screen of our ipad or iphone 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:11.220
 thanks to tunear your screen is 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.410
 application is basically a catalog of 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.140
 wallpapers and themes for ipad and 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.720
 iphone the good thing is that we can find 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.510
 thousands of combinations of more styles 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.460
 we can also find dozens of 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.380
 virtual shelves for our 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.110
 icons designs that enhance these 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.940
 In short tune to your screen we 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.160
 allows to change the appearance of the 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.050
 screen of our iphone or ipad without 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.230
 have to stop to design the 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.120
 us or what fits everything therefore 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.030
 I advise downloading tune to your screen 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.670
 because it is amazing how many 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.460
 options that we have 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.320
