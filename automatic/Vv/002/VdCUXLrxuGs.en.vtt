00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:29.650 
these are the parts you'll need to
construct<00:00:08.160> this

and now for the fifth attempt at

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.290 
and now for the fifth attempt at
recording<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.070> faster<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.250> light<00:00:34.489> mr.

petabyte<00:00:36.010> subbed<00:00:37.010> I<00:00:37.370> set<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.699> line<00:00:37.850> like

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
petabyte subbed I set that line like

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.259 
petabyte subbed I set that line like
three<00:00:38.510> times<00:00:38.750> already<00:00:39.050> it's<00:00:39.290> angled<00:00:40.269> anyway

that<00:01:26.600> kind<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.840> stinks<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:28.670> yeah<00:01:28.850> for

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
that kind of stinks so yeah for

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.580 
that kind of stinks so yeah for
poseability<00:01:29.600> he<00:01:30.259> rolls<00:01:30.439> pretty<00:01:31.430> well<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:32.590> like

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
poseability he rolls pretty well I like

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.059 
poseability he rolls pretty well I like
the<00:01:33.740> fact<00:01:33.770> he's<00:01:34.549> not<00:01:35.210> completely<00:01:35.659> flat<00:01:36.069> that's

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
the fact he's not completely flat that's

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.190 
the fact he's not completely flat that's
the<00:01:37.340> fact<00:01:37.549> like<00:01:37.729> it's<00:01:38.420> not<00:01:38.539> a<00:01:38.600> generic<00:01:38.960> like

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
the fact like it's not a generic like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.139 
the fact like it's not a generic like
flat<00:01:39.499> car<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:39.920> two<00:01:40.069> wheels<00:01:40.310> no<00:01:40.579> it's<00:01:40.819> it's

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
flat car with two wheels no it's it's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.749 
flat car with two wheels no it's it's
more<00:01:41.390> angled<00:01:41.749> up<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:42.429> gives<00:01:43.429> it<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.609> bit

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
more angled up like this gives it a bit

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.190 
more angled up like this gives it a bit
more<00:01:43.939> character<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.450> guess<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:45.049> like<00:01:45.170> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
more character I guess it's like a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.730 
more character I guess it's like a
boxcar<00:01:45.679> Derby<00:01:46.130> type<00:01:46.850> of<00:01:46.999> deal<00:01:47.380> okay<00:01:48.380> I<00:01:48.409> dig<00:01:48.649> it
