think<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.540> team<00:02:16.690> approaches<00:02:17.230> 60<00:02:17.680> if<00:02:17.830> they

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
think this team approaches 60 if they

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.820 
think this team approaches 60 if they
win<00:02:18.160> 58<00:02:18.730> 59<00:02:19.150> games<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.810> am<00:02:20.260> NOT<00:02:20.470> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.710> be

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
win 58 59 games I am NOT going to be

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.040 
win 58 59 games I am NOT going to be
surprised<00:02:21.250> at<00:02:21.460> all<00:02:21.550> that's<00:02:21.850> why<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.060> feel<00:02:22.420> even

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
surprised at all that's why I feel even

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.150 
surprised at all that's why I feel even
though<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.200> could<00:02:23.410> have<00:02:23.500> got<00:02:23.560> forty<00:02:23.890> nine<00:02:24.010> and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
though you could have got forty nine and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.740 
though you could have got forty nine and
a<00:02:24.190> half<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.430> couple<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.760> weeks<00:02:24.880> ago<00:02:24.970> that<00:02:25.510> win

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
a half a couple of weeks ago that win

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.750 
a half a couple of weeks ago that win
total<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.110> 51<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:27.130> they<00:02:27.220> cover<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.640> by

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
total of 51 I think they cover that by

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.910 
total of 51 I think they cover that by
eight<00:02:27.940> or<00:02:28.090> nine<00:02:28.210> games<00:02:28.560> final<00:02:29.560> thought<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
eight or nine games final thought of the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.740 
eight or nine games final thought of the
Denver<00:02:30.160> Nuggets<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:30.460> me<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.270> they

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
Denver Nuggets for me is this if they

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.020 
Denver Nuggets for me is this if they
have<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.990> healthy<00:02:32.290> year<00:02:32.710> out<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.030> gallinari

Gallinari<00:02:47.740> from<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> deep<00:02:48.310> perimeter<00:02:48.820> when

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
Gallinari from the deep perimeter when

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.150 
Gallinari from the deep perimeter when
this<00:02:49.300> team<00:02:49.510> has<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.810> drain<00:02:50.050> those<00:02:50.290> three<00:02:50.860> point

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
this team has to drain those three point

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.250 
this team has to drain those three point
shots<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.760> long<00:02:52.030> distance<00:02:52.330> two<00:02:52.690> pointers<00:02:53.110> I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
shots and long distance two pointers I

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.540

think<00:02:53.620> Denver<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:53.950> going<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.160> be<00:02:54.250> much

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
think Denver is going to be much

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.460 
think Denver is going to be much

experience going to the next level last

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.680 
experience going to the next level last
year<00:05:18.010> in<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.250> playoffs<00:05:18.520> like<00:05:18.970> I<00:05:19.090> said<00:05:19.300> they

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
year in the playoffs like I said they

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.630 
year in the playoffs like I said they
got<00:05:19.840> knocked<00:05:20.530> out<00:05:20.710> in<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:20.890> first<00:05:21.100> round<00:05:21.280> of

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
got knocked out in the first round of

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.640 
got knocked out in the first round of
the<00:05:21.670> Clippers<00:05:22.090> it<00:05:22.420> was<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.690> seven-game<00:05:23.140> series

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
the Clippers it was a seven-game series

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.070 
the Clippers it was a seven-game series
and<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.370> really<00:05:24.700> do<00:05:24.880> think<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.330> matchup<00:05:25.840> in<00:05:25.990> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
and I really do think the matchup in the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.530 
and I really do think the matchup in the
chemistry<00:05:26.380> with<00:05:27.100> rudy<00:05:27.490> Gay<00:05:27.610> coming<00:05:27.940> back<00:05:28.120> kind

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
chemistry with rudy Gay coming back kind

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.720 
chemistry with rudy Gay coming back kind
of<00:05:28.630> was<00:05:28.800> more<00:05:29.800> of<00:05:29.890> a<00:05:29.950> hindrance<00:05:30.160> than<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.640> help

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
of was more of a hindrance than a help

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.110 
of was more of a hindrance than a help
for<00:05:31.630> them<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.080> think<00:05:32.860> this<00:05:33.070> team<00:05:33.310> out<00:05:33.700> of<00:05:33.760> the

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
for them I think this team out of the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.420 
for them I think this team out of the
gate<00:05:34.330> you've<00:05:35.260> got<00:05:35.500> all<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.800> attention<00:05:35.890> on<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430

they had last year always going to
garner<00:05:43.150> attention<00:05:43.270> but<00:05:44.200> we<00:05:44.350> say<00:05:44.530> it<00:05:44.680> every

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
garner attention but we say it every

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
forty nine wins I grabbed a little bit

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.150 
forty nine wins I grabbed a little bit
of<00:06:18.940> them<00:06:19.090> at<00:06:19.360> fifteen<00:06:20.050> to<00:06:20.200> one<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.740> win<00:06:20.950> the

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160
