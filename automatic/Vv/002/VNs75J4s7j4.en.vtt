00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
right well that's something of a paradox

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.230 
right well that's something of a paradox
the<00:01:36.080> paradoxes<00:01:36.860> are<00:01:36.980> a<00:01:37.040> part<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.460> nature<00:01:37.700> it

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
the paradoxes are a part of nature it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.870 
the paradoxes are a part of nature it
would<00:01:38.510> think<00:01:38.720> about<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.930> light<00:01:39.890> now<00:01:40.610> if<00:01:40.760> you

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
would think about a light now if you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.000 
would think about a light now if you
look<00:01:41.030> at<00:01:41.150> Huygens<00:01:41.870> light<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> wave<00:01:42.500> as

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
look at Huygens light is a wave as

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.710 
look at Huygens light is a wave as
confirmed<00:01:43.040> by<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.580> double-slit<00:01:44.090> experiments

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
confirmed by the double-slit experiments

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.750 
confirmed by the double-slit experiments
but<00:01:44.870> then<00:01:44.990> along<00:01:45.260> comes<00:01:45.590> Albert<00:01:45.770> Einstein<00:01:46.520> and

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
but then along comes Albert Einstein and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.250 
but then along comes Albert Einstein and
discovers<00:01:47.060> that<00:01:47.570> light<00:01:47.750> behaves<00:01:48.050> like

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
discovers that light behaves like

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.390 
discovers that light behaves like
particles<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:49.960> need<00:01:50.960> before<00:01:53.800> so<00:01:54.800> how<00:01:55.070> do<00:01:55.130> you

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
particles to need before so how do you

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.450 
particles to need before so how do you
resolve<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:56.090> too

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
resolve it too

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.320 
resolve it too
now<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.610> write-up<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.060> can't<00:02:00.330> help<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:02.330> so

now your write-up I can't help you so

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.030 
now your write-up I can't help you so
what<00:02:03.510> are<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.690> going<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.960> now<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.440> don't
