Atlanta Falcons this upcoming weekend do

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.570 
Atlanta Falcons this upcoming weekend do
I<00:01:11.080> think<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.410> chance<00:01:11.680> can<00:01:11.860> beat<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.130> Falcons

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
I think the chance can beat the Falcons

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.910 
I think the chance can beat the Falcons
yes<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.020> think<00:01:14.110> they're<00:01:14.410> gonna<00:01:14.500> have<00:01:14.770> to

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
yes so I think they're gonna have to

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.160 
yes so I think they're gonna have to
outscore<00:01:15.250> them<00:01:15.720> absolutely<00:01:16.720> i<00:01:16.750> mean<00:01:16.840> that's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
outscore them absolutely i mean that's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.930 
outscore them absolutely i mean that's
the<00:01:17.320> only<00:01:17.500> way<00:01:17.620> they<00:01:17.830> would<00:01:18.040> win<00:01:18.280> will<00:01:18.760> they<00:01:18.910> be

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
the only way they would win will they be

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.180 
the only way they would win will they be
capable<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.900> yes<00:01:20.140> but<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.620> don't<00:01:20.710> think<00:01:20.980> it's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
capable of it yes but I don't think it's

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.280 
capable of it yes but I don't think it's
easy<00:01:21.400> by<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.910> long<00:01:22.240> shot<00:01:22.270> i'm<00:01:22.750> actually<00:01:22.960> going

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
to go with the Falcons to win and I know

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.600 
to go with the Falcons to win and I know
matt<00:01:25.390> ryan<00:01:25.690> hasn't<00:01:26.050> had<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.560> best<00:01:26.830> postseason

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
out with the Falcons what do you guys

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.800 
out with the Falcons what do you guys
think<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.860> Giants<00:01:33.490> if<00:01:34.000> they<00:01:34.210> don't<00:01:34.420> beat<00:01:34.630> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810
