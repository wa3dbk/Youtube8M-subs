okay<00:00:01.680> rebound<00:00:02.129> damping<00:00:03.110> is<00:00:04.110> done<00:00:04.529> through

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay rebound damping is done through

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.900 
okay rebound damping is done through
these<00:00:05.040> screws<00:00:05.940> at<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.180> top<00:00:06.859> you<00:00:07.859> turn<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.760> all

these screws at the top you turn it all

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.110 
these screws at the top you turn it all
the<00:00:08.940> way

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.179

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.130 
really soft that's why my ride was kind
of<00:00:24.290> funky<00:00:24.650> so<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:26.680> turn<00:00:27.680> it<00:00:27.800> clockwise<00:00:28.010> to

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
of funky so you turn it clockwise to

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.689 
of funky so you turn it clockwise to
hardest<00:00:30.140> setting<00:00:30.380> but<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:30.980> don't<00:00:31.190> you<00:00:31.550> don't

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
hardest setting but you don't you don't

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.119 
hardest setting but you don't you don't
want<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:33.230> don't<00:00:33.260> want<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.620> turn<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.920> too

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
want to you don't want to turn it too

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.369 
want to you don't want to turn it too
hard<00:00:34.400> because<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.180> book<00:00:35.390> says<00:00:35.629> it<00:00:35.870> damages

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
hard because the book says it damages

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.520 
hard because the book says it damages
the<00:00:36.500> thread<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:36.800> once<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:37.550> stops<00:00:37.960> you<00:00:38.960> stop<00:00:39.290> as

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
the thread so once it stops you stop as

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.920 
the thread so once it stops you stop as
well<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.100> then<00:00:40.910> the<00:00:41.030> standard<00:00:41.449> setting<00:00:41.840> is

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
well and then the standard setting is

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.579 
well and then the standard setting is
turn<00:00:42.170> turning<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.860> out<00:00:44.170> three<00:00:45.170> times<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:47.589> let

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
turn turning it out three times to let

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.280 
turn turning it out three times to let
on<00:00:48.860> left-hand<00:00:49.760> side<00:00:50.000> but<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.940> magazine

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
on left-hand side but the magazine

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.750 
on left-hand side but the magazine
recommends<00:00:54.290> using<00:00:54.470> two<00:00:54.890> clicks<00:00:55.250> instead<00:00:55.610> of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
recommends using two clicks instead of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.420 
recommends using two clicks instead of
three<00:00:56.059> for<00:00:57.049> rebound<00:00:57.530> typing<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.070> that's<00:00:58.250> what

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
three for rebound typing so that's what

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.990 
three for rebound typing so that's what
I'll<00:00:58.519> do

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
I'll do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:12.289 
I'll do
one<00:01:00.909> two

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.469 

and<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.960> repeat<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> other<00:01:13.829> side<00:01:17.479> okay

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and we repeat it on the other side okay

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.050 
and we repeat it on the other side okay
here's<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> book<00:01:19.350> says<00:01:19.909> turn<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
here's what the book says turn the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.179 
here's what the book says turn the
rebound<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.630> into<00:01:21.960> standard<00:01:22.380> sitting<00:01:22.740> or<00:01:22.950> from

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
rebound up into standard sitting or from

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.499 
rebound up into standard sitting or from
the<00:01:23.280> following<00:01:23.580> turn<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> rebounding

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the following turn the rebounding

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.840 
the following turn the rebounding
adjuster<00:01:25.020> clockwise<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.470> flip<00:01:25.770> stubs<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
adjuster clockwise on flip stubs this is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.060 
adjuster clockwise on flip stubs this is
the<00:01:26.970> hardest<00:01:27.270> setting<00:01:27.720> turn<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.619> adjuster

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the hardest setting turn the adjuster

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.810 
the hardest setting turn the adjuster
clockwise<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> out<00:01:30.509> three<00:01:30.960> clicks

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
clockwise and back it out three clicks

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
clockwise and back it out three clicks
the<00:01:32.820> rebound<00:01:33.149> damping<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.630> now<00:01:33.780> adjusted<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the rebound damping is now adjusted to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
the rebound damping is now adjusted to
standard<00:01:35.220> setting<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.330> just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
standard setting and that's what I just

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.160 
standard setting and that's what I just
did

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
did

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.850 
did
so<00:01:38.360> repeat<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> same<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.830> other

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
so repeat the same thing on the other

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:52.859 
so repeat the same thing on the other
side<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.610> well

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.690 

so<00:01:53.289> let's<00:01:53.590> see<00:01:53.770> I'm<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.070> count<00:01:54.490> the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
so let's see I'm going to count the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.609 
so let's see I'm going to count the
clicks<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.299> see<00:01:55.539> where<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.780> was<00:01:56.079> at<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:57.520> two

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
clicks to see where I was at one two

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:14.470 
clicks to see where I was at one two
three<00:01:59.619> four<00:02:00.479> five<00:02:01.679> six<00:02:02.880> seven<00:02:03.880> eight<00:02:04.649> nine

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.620 

one

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
one

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:25.380 
one
-<00:02:18.330> dang<00:02:19.330> okay

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.070 

that's<00:02:25.990> it<00:02:26.320> mine<00:02:26.710> was<00:02:27.270> really<00:02:28.270> really<00:02:28.900> loose

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that's it mine was really really loose

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.760 
that's it mine was really really loose
rebounding<00:02:30.070> was<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.520> as<00:02:33.640> my<00:02:33.820> bike<00:02:34.060> was<00:02:34.770> coming

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
rebounding was so as my bike was coming

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.990 
rebounding was so as my bike was coming
off<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:37.030> compression<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:38.460> damping<00:02:39.460> was<00:02:39.760> not

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
off the compression the damping was not

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.920 
off the compression the damping was not
there<00:02:40.270> at<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.340> bouncy

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
there at all so it was that bouncy

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.630 
there at all so it was that bouncy
Jhansi<00:02:43.930> feeling<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.410> had<00:02:44.620> which<00:02:44.830> was<00:02:44.980> not<00:02:45.190> cool

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
Jhansi feeling I had which was not cool

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.750 
Jhansi feeling I had which was not cool
all<00:02:46.120> right<00:02:46.300> that's<00:02:46.570> it
