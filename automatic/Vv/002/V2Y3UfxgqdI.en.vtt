00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.850 
because then you'll have a backup then
you<00:01:45.270> could<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.140> obviously<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you could just do that so obviously it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.289 
you could just do that so obviously it's
set<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.729> need<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
set up and I you really need to use the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.389 
set up and I you really need to use the
fov<00:01:48.810> real<00:01:48.990> quick<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> video<00:01:49.740> settings<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
fov real quick and the video settings to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.999 
fov real quick and the video settings to
that<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.600> change<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that and then change that to that and it

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.710 
that and then change that to that and it
looks<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.250> lot<00:01:53.310> better<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
looks a lot better now so I'm going to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160 
looks a lot better now so I'm going to
do<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.189> so<00:01:56.189> once<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.079> The<00:01:58.079> Meters

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
do that so once you do that The Meters

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.420 
do that so once you do that The Meters

almost<00:02:40.350> like<00:02:40.470> Forge<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.069> don't<00:02:41.220> have<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.459> use

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
almost like Forge you don't have to use

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.860 
almost like Forge you don't have to use
modloader<00:02:43.950> any<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.030> stuff<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.420> my

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
modloader any of that stuff like my
