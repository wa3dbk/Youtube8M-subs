00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:22.089
 on June 16 beekeepers organization moruna rural world in again to 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.089
 they began to climb until it separates us from the Palencia mountain 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.539
 mobile prevention stations 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.579
 to compensate for the disappearance 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.220
 of the wild old 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.620
 by the plague of clay 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.700
 these mobile pollination stations are called happy mobile 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.920
 and consisting of a car with hives that allows the honey bee 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.490
 domestic 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.160
 sidewalk high altitude outcrops where the traditional beehives of the villages of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 mountain does not arrive 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.220
 its function which is to polemicize key points for the protected area 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.760
 what plant species that depend on bees to fructify 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.400
 as the blueberry the rowan and the mostajo and that are source of food for 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.110
 threatened species like the capercaillie and they 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.500
 in the blueberry pollination old age the deciding insect as well as 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
 in most varieties of apple 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.130
 it is known that the greater the number of visits 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.490
 please more and better fruit produced 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.330
 reaching up to six times its production 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 A bee can find or mars visit 45 flowers at each exit 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.720
 to produce a kilo of honey 60 thousand bees will visit 3 million flowers 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.580
 in full season those 60 thousand bees 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.130
 They will take 5 kilos of metal daily to the hive that will be transformed into a 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.140
 kilo of honey 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.760
 in this action it is taken into account that the population density of the bee 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 domestic remains similar to wild 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.530
 preventing it from affecting populations of other insects 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 that perform this reproductive function in other plants 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.400
 the mobile api allows mobility the hives to take advantage of the front 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.270
 explorations that occurs on the mountain and can multiply up by 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.039
 three the production of honey the management of the simple odila 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.619
 because you can tow with the driving license plus I have incorporated 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:17.129
 an electric pastor 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.829
 to slow something down the signs or 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.479
 so that they do not destroy the key hives for pollination and for their 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.999
 prevention of many species
