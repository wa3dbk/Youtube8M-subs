peeps supposed to work sunrays no

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:52.130 
peeps supposed to work sunrays no
reverse<00:05:49.790> it's<00:05:50.790> like<00:05:51.060> if<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.330> bow<00:05:51.510> choose

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
reverse it's like if the bow choose

00:05:52.140 --> 00:06:08.410

himself<00:05:52.590> to<00:05:53.310> go<00:05:53.490> in<00:05:54.050> sport<00:05:55.050> mode

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.900 

alright<00:06:09.420> so<00:06:09.570> that<00:06:09.720> was<00:06:09.810> a<00:06:09.840> total<00:06:10.200> fail<00:06:10.910> I'm

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
alright so that was a total fail I'm

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.090 
alright so that was a total fail I'm
thinking<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.780> because<00:06:13.230> the<00:06:13.440> capacity<00:06:14.070> of

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
thinking that because the capacity of

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.680 
thinking that because the capacity of
the<00:06:14.280> batteries<00:06:14.670> is<00:06:14.700> not<00:06:14.970> big<00:06:15.210> enough<00:06:15.240> like

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
the batteries is not big enough like

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.020 
the batteries is not big enough like
5000<00:06:16.470> mAh<00:06:16.830> it's<00:06:17.040> only<00:06:17.220> a<00:06:17.310> two<00:06:17.490> thousand<00:06:17.940> three

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
5000 mAh it's only a two thousand three

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.110 
5000 mAh it's only a two thousand three
hundred<00:06:18.150> and<00:06:18.330> fifty<00:06:18.630> each<00:06:19.010> that<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.610> boat<00:06:20.820> or

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
hundred and fifty each that the boat or

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.000 
hundred and fifty each that the boat or
the<00:06:21.390> speaking<00:06:21.840> role<00:06:22.050> automatically<00:06:22.620> detects

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
the speaking role automatically detects

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.150 
the speaking role automatically detects
that<00:06:23.160> there's<00:06:23.490> not<00:06:23.700> enough<00:06:23.970> juice<00:06:24.300> or

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
that there's not enough juice or

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.620 
that there's not enough juice or
something<00:06:26.160> going<00:06:26.340> on<00:06:26.580> so<00:06:26.910> it's<00:06:27.090> putting<00:06:27.360> it<00:06:27.480> in

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
something going on so it's putting it in

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.490 
something going on so it's putting it in
lipo<00:06:27.990> cutoff<00:06:28.170> mode<00:06:28.650> which<00:06:29.490> kind<00:06:29.760> of<00:06:29.850> sucks<00:06:30.500> but

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
lipo cutoff mode which kind of sucks but

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.800 
lipo cutoff mode which kind of sucks but
I<00:06:31.860> think<00:06:32.760> when<00:06:32.850> I<00:06:32.880> get<00:06:33.090> home<00:06:33.300> I'm<00:06:33.480> gonna<00:06:33.570> go

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
I think when I get home I'm gonna go

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.350 
I think when I get home I'm gonna go
online<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.470> I'm<00:06:34.590> gonna<00:06:34.800> order<00:06:35.070> a<00:06:35.550> new<00:06:36.240> ESC<00:06:36.960> and

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
online and I'm gonna order a new ESC and

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.330 
online and I'm gonna order a new ESC and
probably<00:06:39.360> batteries<00:06:39.720> to<00:06:39.840> go<00:06:39.990> with<00:06:40.170> it<00:06:40.350> I'm

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
probably batteries to go with it I'm

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.730 
probably batteries to go with it I'm
