all<00:00:25.230> kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.650> thermal<00:00:26.099> printer<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
all kind of thermal printer like it

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
all kind of thermal printer like it
cable<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.640> how<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.880> will<00:00:30.090> work<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
cable and how it will work these are the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.920 
cable and how it will work these are the
few<00:00:31.619> things<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.219> should<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.450> printer

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
few things we should be with the printer

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.369 
few things we should be with the printer
first<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.770> label<00:00:35.190> older<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:37.010> older

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.529 

this<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> ribbon<00:00:44.280> holder<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> rewinder

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this is ribbon holder and the rewinder

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.410 
this is ribbon holder and the rewinder
with<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> cable<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> doctor<00:00:50.210> this<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
with the cable this is a doctor this is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.930 
with the cable this is a doctor this is
a<00:00:51.840> label<00:00:52.410> holder<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.219> USB<00:00:56.219> cable<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
a label holder this is USB cable and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.250 
a label holder this is USB cable and
this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> main<00:00:57.809> unit<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.280> printer

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
this is the main unit that is printer

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
this is the main unit that is printer
now<00:01:01.260> our<00:01:01.620> technical<00:01:01.949> person<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.670> some

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
now our technical person with some

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759 
now our technical person with some
maneuvers<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.359> tell<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.559> use

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
maneuvers will tell you how you can use

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.810 
maneuvers will tell you how you can use
this<00:01:05.129> printer<00:01:05.960> now<00:01:06.960> he<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.320> use<00:01:07.820> another

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this printer now he will use another

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.179 
this printer now he will use another
printer<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> 2<00:01:09.990> 4<00:01:10.260> 5<00:01:10.470> which<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.830> bigger

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
printer that is 2 4 5 which is bigger

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.730 
printer that is 2 4 5 which is bigger
than<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.540> difference<00:01:12.869> between<00:01:12.990> 2<00:01:13.260> 4<00:01:13.500> 4

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
than this the difference between 2 4 4

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
than this the difference between 2 4 4
and<00:01:14.040> 2<00:01:14.310> 4<00:01:14.549> 5<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.479> 1<00:01:15.990> inch<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and 2 4 5 is just 1 inch that is the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.780 
and 2 4 5 is just 1 inch that is the
speed<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> printer<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:20.610> inch

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
speed of the printer will be one inch

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.170 
speed of the printer will be one inch
more<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:22.020> mr.<00:01:22.500> Manoj<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.640> tell<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
more now mr. Manoj will tell you about

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.399 
more now mr. Manoj will tell you about
the<00:01:24.710> technology<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:27.409> label

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the technology and the label

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.150 
the technology and the label
installation<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> ribbon<00:01:29.460> installation

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.340 

just<00:01:37.160> focus<00:01:37.490> on

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
just focus on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.560 
just focus on
it's<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:40.070> label<00:01:40.610> on<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.090> recipe<00:01:41.480> you<00:01:41.900> can<00:01:42.080> use<00:01:43.570> it

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
it's a label on a recipe you can use it

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.950 
it's a label on a recipe you can use it
like<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.340> which<00:01:46.340> holds<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.880> label<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:47.930> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
like this which holds the label so that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.020 
like this which holds the label so that
it<00:01:48.380> will<00:01:48.530> not<00:01:48.740> move<00:01:49.100> from<00:01:49.940> left<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.300> right<00:01:52.030> it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
it will not move from left to right it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.190 
it will not move from left to right it
have<00:01:53.300> to<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:54.910> fitted<00:01:55.910> here<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.950> this<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
have to be fitted here and this is the

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.980 
have to be fitted here and this is the
page<00:02:00.200> adjuster<00:02:01.190> which<00:02:01.790> will<00:02:02.000> also<00:02:02.450> hold<00:02:02.630> from

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
page adjuster which will also hold from

page adjuster which will also hold from
the<00:02:03.200> page<00:02:03.910> so<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:04.940> it<00:02:05.330> will<00:02:05.479> not<00:02:05.630> move<00:02:05.900> from

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
the page so that it will not move from

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.000 
the page so that it will not move from
left<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.530> right<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:10.600> drippin

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
left to right there is a drippin

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.900 
left to right there is a drippin
rewinder<00:02:13.010> basically<00:02:13.459> which<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.540> useful<00:02:15.910> hold

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
rewinder basically which is useful hold

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.380 
rewinder basically which is useful hold
and<00:02:17.120> rewind<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.720> very<00:02:18.470> one<00:02:18.970> which<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.120> always
