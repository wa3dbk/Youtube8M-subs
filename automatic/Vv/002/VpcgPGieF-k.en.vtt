00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
that when we use lasers for resurfacing

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.200 
that when we use lasers for resurfacing
we're<00:01:01.859> burning<00:01:02.010> we're<00:01:02.370> injuring<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> skin

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.170 
but what retin-a does as we discussed is
it<00:01:55.020> makes<00:01:55.259> those<00:01:55.530> dead<00:01:55.890> epithelial<00:01:56.880> cells

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it makes those dead epithelial cells

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.420 
it makes those dead epithelial cells
more<00:01:57.780> likely<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> separate<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.340> can

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
more likely to separate so what can

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
more likely to separate so what can
happen<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> wax<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.229> pull

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
happen when you wax is that you can pull

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
happen when you wax is that you can pull
off<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:02.250> outer<00:02:02.460> layer<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> skin<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
off the outer layer of skin and that's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
off the outer layer of skin and that's
equivalent<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> burn<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> avoid

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
equivalent to a burn so we like to avoid

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.270 
equivalent to a burn so we like to avoid
that<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.729> can<00:02:05.939> however<00:02:06.500> thread<00:02:07.500> even<00:02:08.099> when

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that you can however thread even when

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.469 
that you can however thread even when
you're<00:02:08.429> using<00:02:08.610> retina

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you're using retina

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.850 
you're using retina

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
I don't understand it exactly but they

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.750 
I don't understand it exactly but they
do<00:02:19.379> something<00:02:19.709> about<00:02:19.799> twisting<00:02:20.310> threads<00:02:20.610> with

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
do something about twisting threads with

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
do something about twisting threads with
their<00:02:20.879> fingers<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.390> they<00:02:21.780> catch<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.319> hairs

their fingers and they catch the hairs

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.839 
their fingers and they catch the hairs
and<00:02:22.769> they<00:02:22.860> pull<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.159> hairs<00:02:23.340> out<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:23.819> can

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
and they pull the hairs out so they can

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.210 
and they pull the hairs out so they can
do<00:02:24.090> some<00:02:24.269> really<00:02:24.510> elegant<00:02:24.840> shaping<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.980> takes

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
do some really elegant shaping it takes

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.970 
do some really elegant shaping it takes
a<00:02:26.400> little<00:02:26.549> bit<00:02:26.760> longer<00:02:26.970> than<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.989> waxing<00:02:28.530> but

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
a little bit longer than just waxing but

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.530 
a little bit longer than just waxing but
you<00:02:29.069> can't<00:02:29.310> wax<00:02:29.549> when<00:02:29.819> you're<00:02:29.940> using<00:02:30.060> retin-a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
you can't wax when you're using retin-a

about what you would do well it depends

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.619 
about what you would do well it depends
on<00:03:10.859> what<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> lines<00:03:11.400> are<00:03:11.609> from<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:12.150> again<00:03:12.480> we

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
on what the lines are from and again we

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.740 
on what the lines are from and again we
talked<00:03:12.870> about<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.620> botulinum<00:03:14.609> toxin<00:03:15.269> a<00:03:15.419> as

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
talked about the botulinum toxin a as

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.629 
talked about the botulinum toxin a as
being<00:03:15.989> something<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.349> relaxes<00:03:16.709> muscles<00:03:17.190> so

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
being something that relaxes muscles so

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.039 
being something that relaxes muscles so
if<00:03:17.700> patients<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.150> getting<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.450> lot<00:03:18.630> of<00:03:18.660> lines

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
if patients are getting a lot of lines

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.379 
if patients are getting a lot of lines

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
together for whatever reason we can

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.229 
together for whatever reason we can
often<00:03:23.970> improve<00:03:24.329> that<00:03:24.510> by<00:03:24.750> using<00:03:25.489> some<00:03:26.489> muscle

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
often improve that by using some muscle
