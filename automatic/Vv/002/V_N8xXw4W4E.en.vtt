brutalities<00:05:53.350> overhead<00:05:54.350> stream<00:05:54.680> it's<00:05:55.340> a<00:05:55.430> combo

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
brutalities overhead stream it's a combo

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.760 
brutalities overhead stream it's a combo
again<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.360> losing<00:05:56.780> them<00:05:56.900> in<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.140> standing

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.480 
again and losing them in a standing
position

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
position

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.370

so<00:05:58.760> he<00:05:58.880> cannot<00:05:59.270> do<00:05:59.540> wake<00:05:59.720> up<00:05:59.750> attack<00:06:00.140> that

so he cannot do wake up attack that

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.770 
so he cannot do wake up attack that
overhead<00:06:00.920> string<00:06:01.310> that<00:06:01.580> he<00:06:01.700> does<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.910> two<00:06:02.360> fist

overhead string that he does a two fist

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.110 
overhead string that he does a two fist
I<00:06:03.050> think<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.830> string<00:06:04.130> is<00:06:04.250> unsafe<00:06:04.790> but<00:06:05.060> I

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
I think that string is unsafe but I

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.460 
I think that string is unsafe but I
