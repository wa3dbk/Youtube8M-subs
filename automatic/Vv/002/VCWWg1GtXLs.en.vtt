00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.459 
which is a shame because there's so much
more<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.790> recommend<00:04:07.790> about<00:04:07.939> this<00:04:08.209> title<00:04:08.659> such

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
more to recommend about this title such

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.309 
more to recommend about this title such
as<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.949> music<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:11.150> fact<00:04:11.359> that<00:04:11.449> it<00:04:12.139> looks

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
as the music and the fact that it looks

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.319 
as the music and the fact that it looks
so<00:04:12.500> bright<00:04:12.799> and<00:04:13.129> it<00:04:13.340> seems<00:04:13.549> to<00:04:13.639> capture<00:04:13.909> the

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
so bright and it seems to capture the

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.349 
so bright and it seems to capture the
essence<00:04:14.689> of<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.870> movie<00:04:15.139> well<00:04:15.729> albeit<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:17.150> it

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
essence of the movie well albeit that it

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.990 
essence of the movie well albeit that it
only<00:04:17.570> does<00:04:17.870> so<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.829> limited<00:04:19.130> sense<00:04:19.489> because

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
only does so in a limited sense because

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.210 
only does so in a limited sense because
it's<00:04:20.150> only<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:21.049> here's<00:04:21.259> my<00:04:21.440> final<00:04:21.680> verdict

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's only so here's my final verdict

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.520 
it's only so here's my final verdict
it's<00:04:23.060> definitely<00:04:23.570> above<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.960> standard<00:04:24.349> that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
it's definitely above the standard that

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.129 
it's definitely above the standard that
THQ<00:04:25.130> puts<00:04:25.400> out<00:04:25.580> regularly<00:04:26.419> for<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.810> movie

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
THQ puts out regularly for the movie

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.290 
THQ puts out regularly for the movie
games<00:04:27.349> that's<00:04:27.680> for<00:04:27.919> sure<00:04:28.099> but<00:04:28.970> that's<00:04:29.060> not

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
games that's for sure but that's not

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.740 
games that's for sure but that's not

saying much at all I give this game 60%

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.260

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
as its brightly colored sounds awesome

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.570 
as its brightly colored sounds awesome
and<00:04:35.419> captures<00:04:36.080> the<00:04:36.500> theme<00:04:36.710> of<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:37.039> game<00:04:37.070> well

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
the only shortcoming is yep you guessed

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.320 
the only shortcoming is yep you guessed
it<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.880> it's<00:04:41.479> extremely<00:04:41.930> tedious<00:04:43.330> enjoyed
