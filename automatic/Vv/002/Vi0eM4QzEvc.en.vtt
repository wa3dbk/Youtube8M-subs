Jeremy Maclin and Riley Cooper in the
passing<00:00:50.789> game<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.690> really<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.260> they're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
and I think they might win the division
but<00:00:56.100> defensively<00:00:56.699> they're<00:00:57.390> relying<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.899> Trent
