00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.479
 and me what the mister meta rains him 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.339
 I was in here again in the survival 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.250
 craft and this time I have a video that 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.170
 they were asking me a lot and it's a 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.150
 craft guide eo where all will come 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.880
 the pro active that there is in the survival 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.970
 craft and well let's do it fast so 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.210
 Come on guys, come first 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.640
 It is the coal iron iron cube 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.380
 forgiveness is made with nine very charcoal 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
 fast shoppings are made 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.860
 simply with the leaves that fall 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.390
 They grab the tables and put them on the table 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.730
 Kraft and Caesar open them all the same 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.219
 the craft eo this is in the oven is with 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.460
 the man east of german yum gets into 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.460
 oven and it gives you the ore or the mineral here 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.109
 is to make gunpowder just be 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.249
 place those 3 minerals here come the 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.710
 names above because you do not 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.510
 they know what you 're not to do 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.280
 iron ingot are the most the most 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.199
 basic first come come super fast 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.160
 this this is to make the copper 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.690
 simply put the gold of this mother 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.949
 that is in the mines obviously 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.830
 that's to make any block here 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.049
 It can also be made of wood stone 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.720
 this one of copper so many of 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.369
 many this is to make the crystal 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.690
 obviously I think I put some things 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.190
 too basic that we should all 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.350
 know but in case someone does not 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.049
 I knew that's to make the marble 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 does with a ribbon and with sants are I say 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.490
 with sant forgiveness with pure good sand 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.080
 come if we burn the ribbon will give us 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 this white powder that I want it 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.430
 call lime is to paint white 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 here is to do the stone brics 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.980
 can be made with baked stone or 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.530
 fulfill normal forgiveness 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.190
 this is the clay it burns and they will be the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 brics we already know all 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.260
 this is the cube of the bric 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.870
 simply 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.810
 come on 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.060
 These are crystals to decorate I put 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 two good there is one more but then here 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 are two later I put the other one are 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.950
 the stairs this can be done with 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 Many materials study is everything 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.450
 check is good wood stone many 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.380
 things this is to do the slaps 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.910
 It can also be done with many 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.870
 materials this one is made with marble 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.960
 but it can be done with many 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.060
 materials also 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.920
 that's the door you can do well 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.110
 if we change it for metal you 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.270
 the metal door comes out and ready like that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.620
 easy is to make the door this is for 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.520
 make a metal gate and then 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.270
 come here we have right away this the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.770
 wooden tractor and metal tractor 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.590
 that is done a little different here is 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.320
 you see it, you facilitate facilitates 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.200
 it facilitates not guys if then we follow nothing 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.430
 we follow these are the stairs I hope 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.110
 Do not make them too tedious this 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.450
 video because I'm just going to be 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.460
 saying this kind of nonsense good 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.190
 this is another lamp to decorate that the 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.500
 net is very hot and I like it 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.380
 I like me to have it that is a 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.270
 antorchista or mister meta grape not manches 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.610
 it's the best video comes to bastard 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.920
 you're the best 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.110
 no no mister beta you have not already won with 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.460
 sticks that yes is the best of all and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.040
 Well, guys, these are the sticks 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.379
 come on come on 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.390
 to craft table I think this everything 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.640
 they have to know this is where they 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.469
 raises all this and in the clear oven 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.790
 is here is the oven I think that also 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.170
 can be made with baked stone the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.220
 truth is that I 've never tried it but 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.890
 I think you can also 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.940
 the chest these characters I want it 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.680
 pay but I wanted to do the guide 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.960
 totally so complete where where 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.270
 come all is the Christmas pine for 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.610
 if someone did not know how to do it and here 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.890
 we have the Christmas pine come come 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.750
 this is to make the traps are the 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.600
 slaps that go with spikes this is also 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.760
 can activate with electrical systems 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.010
 these are the grass of traps where 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.420
 put on top of those of the peaks and there 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.430
 you are walking and falling 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.860
 these are simply the fences 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.830
 to make the big the farms and 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.030
 all those animals are very cool 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.950
 signs or guys the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.989
 update and many things are going to come 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.930
 new but good we continue with the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.260
 crafter this is to make them gunpowder 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.700
 the median the girl and the big one so 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.410
 come from scratch then a little more 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.280
 fast this is simply the lamp of 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.070
 pumpkin is very well the truth come 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.660
 this is the saddle what is done 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.829
 with five of rope and with two sticks the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.220
 truth is that it is very easy and it is very 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.860
 useful for riding horses the shovels of 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.750
 different materials I also put in 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.220
 The peaks can also be made 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.190
 with wood and stone and everyone 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.630
 you know and you make them equal that's why 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.980
 I put it faster so that you no longer 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.090
 I was so tedious this good video 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.700
 here are the buckets are made with 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.889
 copper copper because it happened as it is done 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.139
 also here is the bucket for many 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.520
 useful and these are the different dyes 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.200
 what if they can not see them 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520
 just pause in the video please 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.500
 is that I put them very fast because they are 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.810
 too many and then the truth was not going to be 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.400
 very long the video so I put this 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.900
 this kind of inks so very slowly 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.340
 but well they are the truth they are 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.840
 enough and can be done in several 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.060
 forms some manes repeated because it 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.919
 can do one of two three ways and 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.600
 Well nothing guys the truth is that this 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.520
 is to paint the wood and it is very very 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.110
 very cool the painted houses are all 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.270
 the dyes that there could also be 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.340
 as an achievement not having one of each of 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.750
 wood so that it looks chingÃ³n this 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.750
 then the lighter that actually 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.100
 they are matches but good gives you four 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.870
 this is the compass so as not to get lost 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.860
 demands like the mister meta that is a 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.050
 Hey, and it gets lost every time but come 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.689
 the thermometer you already know the thermometer 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.669
 for the saplings the hydrometer also 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.400
 to plant saplings these are very very 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.780
 basic and very useful the whistle is for 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
 call the horses when you have 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.990
 a horse with saddle say 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.280
 blades serve them with the whistle and well 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.009
 these are the spears that are also 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.340
 they can do like the swords with this 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.750
 with different materials 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.800
 those are the swords or machetes that 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.120
 You can also be with different 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.250
 materials that we already know what are 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.350
 these to make electric wires 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.930
 this is the one that serves as the network this 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.849
 come this is to make the door 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.229
 logic not 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.899
 in the logical door nand and sorry the 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:05.709
 logic door org the truth is that they are 

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:07.479
 complicated circuits the exxon and then the 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:09.490
 right there I'll be seeing them to see 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:13.660
 yes to see if I can get something useful 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.220
 the like of the sr 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.470
 here are all the components with the 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.100
 what the signal generator does is 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.070
 this 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.280
 the battery or battery here we have it very 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.790
 easy 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.470
 this is another the light panels that are 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.900
 they light with electricity is the 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.990
 electric detonator detonator from there 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.360
 follow the Swiss the lever exists 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.100
 and here follows the very easy button too 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.800
 of character and very useful very nice to 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.470
 the doors 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.930
 the expression plate of wood and stone 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.210
 the photo of is to make the lamps 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.830
 automatic that is doing it and these 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.960
 LEDs are red and green 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.580
 that more than more there are these blocks are 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.250
 for are electrified blocks for 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.650
 put anywhere without wires and 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.170
 come on guys this was all I hope 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.360
 that you liked my video if you 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.120
 I like it so let me like it does not cost you 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.250
 nothing the truth is that with that I feel that 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.770
 if they appreciate my work and then there is the 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.430
 mister meta joe and until next time 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.430
 Thank you
