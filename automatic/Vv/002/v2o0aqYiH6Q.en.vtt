00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.780
 if you want to advertise a service if I 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.309
 write related texts that may 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 help the people 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.940
 and there in the middle of the text you include your 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.279
 advertising 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.260
 avoid creating texts the content 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.189
 solely to advertise 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.890
 your service 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.199
 think first of all of the benefit you 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 can offer in that text that is 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 really useful from the reader and then you 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.590
 includes its propaganda in the middle 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.649
 offering a benefit beyond 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 your text will have an audience and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.280
 can be shared precisely by 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 account of this benefit 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.370
 the simple technique and uses the famous 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 principle of the 8020 principle in the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.860
 your texts facebook publications your 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.750
 videos in press release 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 devote 80% for good content and 20% for 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.850
 your advertisement what will guarantee 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.659
 success and sharing of your 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.070
 material is precisely 80% of the content 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.530
 the 20% of hitchhiking and ended up 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.439
 benefiting from this to create 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 a good content the rule is very simple 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.280
 write as if you were helping 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.090
 solve your audience's problems 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 target and in fact you will be helping this 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 when choosing topics that I have 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.159
 your audience more doubts and offer 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.579
 in this content 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.130
 some solutions in the middle of the way or 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.770
 so in the end also speak as your 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.259
 work can help in the solution of that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.939
 problem that you mention using a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.060
 I die a good strategy after all who 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.640
 who does not like to laugh is even cause 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.250
 a pleasant feeling in the reader and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.979
 facilitate empathy it you the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 content is a post with a blog or network 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.399
 Social 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.799
 mention from time to time links 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.350
 related to your texts and products 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.630
 already in the videos you do the following you 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.860
 You're not going to advertise. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.660
 explicit 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.209
 You will try to teach a class about the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.710
 explaining the problem and proposing 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.660
 solutions 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.790
 works much more than a simple 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 propaganda with great potential for 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.150
 sharing and publishing your 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.540
 court hearing 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.470
 so the tip is instead of doing 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.080
 advertising only product 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.190
 offer a benefit that may in fact 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.220
 help the viewer and in the end relate 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.130
 product to the benefit referred to in 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.800
 content without spending anything with advertising 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 your content will be shared 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:49.880
 of course and your advertisement goes from 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.880
 ride to the next video
