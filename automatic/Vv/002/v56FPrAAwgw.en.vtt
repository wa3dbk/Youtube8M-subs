called a nasal trumpet and maybe you'll

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.900 
called a nasal trumpet and maybe you'll
see<00:00:29.820> why<00:00:30.090> when<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:30.930> me<00:00:31.140> insert<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.680> a

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
see why when you see me insert it a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.200 
see why when you see me insert it a
nasal<00:00:32.910> trumpet<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.809> just<00:00:34.739> I've<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.520> several

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
nasal trumpet is just I've got several

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.320 
nasal trumpet is just I've got several
sizes<00:00:36.420> here<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:39.260> silicone<00:00:40.260> tube<00:00:41.130> with<00:00:42.060> a<00:00:42.090> wide

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
sizes here a silicone tube with a wide

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.370 
sizes here a silicone tube with a wide
end<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:44.180> insert<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.990> Nerys

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
end that you can insert down the Nerys

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.030 
end that you can insert down the Nerys
and<00:00:46.880> suction<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.540> client<00:00:49.080> repeatedly<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
and suction the client repeatedly and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.819 
and suction the client repeatedly and
this<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:51.030> helps<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> protect<00:00:52.200> the<00:00:52.560> nasal

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this really helps to protect the nasal

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.370 
this really helps to protect the nasal
mucosa<00:00:53.329> because<00:00:54.329> every<00:00:54.780> time<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.350> down

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.380 
mucosa because every time you go down

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.200 
mucosa because every time you go down
with<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.130> suction<00:00:56.340> catheter

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
with the suction catheter

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.300 
with the suction catheter
you're<00:00:57.780> doing<00:00:58.079> some<00:00:58.410> trauma<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> nose<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
you're doing some trauma to the nose and

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.260 
you're doing some trauma to the nose and
you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.910> often<00:01:00.570> get<00:01:00.690> nosebleeds<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.620> will

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
you can often get nosebleeds this will

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.109 
you can often get nosebleeds this will
decrease<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.510> amount<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.339> rigid<00:01:05.670> ones

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
decrease that amount the more rigid ones

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.130 
decrease that amount the more rigid ones
like<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.640> maybe<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.720> one

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
like this one maybe not this one

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.760 
like this one maybe not this one

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
because remember that in the unconscious

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.740 
because remember that in the unconscious
or<00:01:53.020> barely<00:01:53.650> conscious<00:01:53.860> client<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.479> most

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
or barely conscious client the most

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.460 
or barely conscious client the most
common<00:01:56.550> obstructive<00:01:57.600> mechanism<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
common obstructive mechanism is the

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.830 
common obstructive mechanism is the
tongue<00:01:59.680> when<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.760> become<00:02:01.060> unconscious<00:02:01.420> if

tongue when you become unconscious if

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.450 
tongue when you become unconscious if
you<00:02:01.960> can't<00:02:02.200> control<00:02:02.500> your<00:02:02.649> tongue<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:03.100> falls

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you can't control your tongue it falls

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.370 
you can't control your tongue it falls
back<00:02:03.759> into<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.479> back<00:02:04.660> of<00:02:04.690> your<00:02:04.930> airway<00:02:05.200> and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
back into the back of your airway and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.550 
back into the back of your airway and
can<00:02:05.770> completely<00:02:06.369> obstruct<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.560> keeps

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
can completely obstruct it this keeps

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.499 
can completely obstruct it this keeps
the<00:02:08.739> tongue<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.790> right<00:02:09.970> position<00:02:10.420> and

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the tongue in the right position and

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.150 
the tongue in the right position and
keeps<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.869> airway<00:02:11.110> open<00:02:11.140> which<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.739> pretty

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
keeps the airway open which is pretty

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.199 
keeps the airway open which is pretty
darn<00:02:12.310> cool<00:02:12.580> okay<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> patient<00:02:15.340> who<00:02:16.180> I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
have had to suction nasotracheal II now

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.830 
have had to suction nasotracheal II now
three<00:02:20.680> times<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.100> shift<00:02:21.420> she's<00:02:22.420> barely

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
multiple sizes I'm going to show you how

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.640 
multiple sizes I'm going to show you how
to<00:04:17.700> measure<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.180> if<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.170> were<00:04:19.290> you<00:04:19.440> were<00:04:19.530> going

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
to measure it if it were you were going

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.340 
to measure it if it were you were going
to<00:04:19.709> put<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.040> me<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:21.030> going<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.690> measure

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
to put it in me I'm going to measure

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.400 
to put it in me I'm going to measure
from<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:23.010> corner<00:04:23.520> of<00:04:23.730> my<00:04:24.300> mouth<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:25.260> my

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
from the corner of my mouth to my

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
from the corner of my mouth to my
earlobe<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:27.320> if<00:04:28.320> it<00:04:28.680> reaches<00:04:29.100> which<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.370> don't

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
earlobe and if it reaches which I don't

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.600 
earlobe and if it reaches which I don't
think<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.790> does<00:04:29.910> well<00:04:30.630> does<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:31.400> not<00:04:32.400> quite

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
think it does well does it not quite

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.640 
think it does well does it not quite
it'd<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.690> right<00:04:33.810> size<00:04:34.110> for<00:04:34.140> me<00:04:34.470> but

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
it'd be the right size for me but

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.840 
it'd be the right size for me but
hopefully<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:35.310> going<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.490> be<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.700> right

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
hopefully it's going to be the right

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.610 
hopefully it's going to be the right
size<00:04:36.090> for<00:04:36.440> my<00:04:37.440> mannequin<00:04:38.990> if<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.170> put<00:04:40.440> this

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
size for my mannequin if I put this

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.550 
size for my mannequin if I put this
thing<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:41.310> straight<00:04:42.240> I'm<00:04:42.600> going<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.080> catch<00:04:43.290> the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
thing in straight I'm going to catch the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.680 
thing in straight I'm going to catch the
tongue<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.070> shove<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.850> tongue<00:04:45.090> right<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:45.630> the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
tongue and shove the tongue right in the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.390 
tongue and shove the tongue right in the
back<00:04:45.840> of<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.020> airway<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:46.290> do<00:04:46.500> me<00:04:46.650> absolutely

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
back of the airway and do me absolutely

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.260 
back of the airway and do me absolutely
no<00:04:47.610> good<00:04:47.640> so<00:04:48.570> this<00:04:49.169> goes<00:04:49.620> in<00:04:51.260> upside<00:04:52.260> down<00:04:52.500> and

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
no good so this goes in upside down and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.880 
no good so this goes in upside down and
then<00:04:54.270> when<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.480> get<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.230> place<00:04:55.500> where<00:04:55.530> I'm

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
then when I get to the place where I'm
