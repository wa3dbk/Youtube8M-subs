00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.009
 serves boys and well found in a 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
 new test mod 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.609
 today we are here again with a test 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:26.180
 fast fashions we are here for a spyer 61 e 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:29.099
 95 hp you have the chance to have let's say it 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.250
 practically the forks in front however not 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.530
 they give us let's say his 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.350
 lifts so I think we can go 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.480
 but reuse some other lifts 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.530
 hands certainly not those seas defends 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.920
 things like that, however, similar seas and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 if someone tries again 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.030
 leave a comment 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.370
 I have not tried to store only queue is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.930
 busy with other fashions that I will make you 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.809
 let's say the videos then go to it 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.390
 it would be to discover future video is fine 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.890
 then I have to say they give you 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.630
 basically what they give you that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.700
 then maybe you put yourself a breeder is but 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.670
 I can't find the lift that's the one 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.590
 which basically give me the style 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:20.270
 this 1000 kg ballast is also a 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.659
 front clasp 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.659
 yes the very nice tractor we anchovies 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.610
 the possibility of opening is the doors 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.039
 we have an internal cabin that 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.590
 you practically see when you turn towards 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.539
 behind you get up to go to 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.710
 see what you have behind I must say that 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.209
 this is really something really 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.950
 beautiful because we say marin certain fashions 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.340
 when you turn around you find the seat 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.959
 in front but you have to use the wheel 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.060
 mouse to go up and down with the 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:51.979
 visual here while circling here 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.689
 practically compare will have become more 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.829
 back and then you can understand 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.829
 much better 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.610
 you saw the key gave a first 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.489
 around and then turned around completely 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.739
 let's give it we say for the opening of 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.400
 two doors 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.420
 sorry for the door window 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.660
 these here substantially and 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:25.660
 this back door there is a 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.660
 moment 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.060
 you see totality closes you bordellone 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.000
 stay a little further in and this one 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.030
 window here is basically a bit 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.130
 boiled we have the hand brake let's say 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.800
 to our left we have some 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 console commands that we say are not 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.370
 in movement 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:54.040
 we have the pedals that move this 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:56.460
 yes also the lever on the steering wheel as you have 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.460
 could see 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.489
 normal flashing lights and let's say I saw 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.030
 which seems like a good cabin to me 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.459
 amortized are yes yes compared to 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:14.189
 cab wheels but managed to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.930
 get up a little expected slightly but yes 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:22.859
 sees no obviously so-called species 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.200
 jump but if you see that the cabin is not 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.969
 moves a little compared to the wheels 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.579
 hence the amortized effect 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:34.230
 pity from not having mall within the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:38.069
 furrow but okay that will beat against 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.049
 for the rest I say it's a lot 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:46.049
 we are very nice to do 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.150
 crazy I ca n't 6 say you can't see 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.790
 even that white doesn't have that though 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.019
 however the light we say we see it 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:00.629
 the same key is also noted 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:03.180
 we have the rest of the headlights then we see 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.739
 under tow of a dear one since I have it 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.680
 one here having used for old purposes 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:14.519
 meanwhile of the massing we say of 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.269
 cage for the mountain tell us what a beautiful 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:22.139
 powerful sound we say that big 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.400
 in short it is not bad we know already 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.620
 I see it with a departure 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.210
 here now we can clearly see the cabin said 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.210
 when you give up and accelerate 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.860
 beautiful beautiful there is a beautiful world made 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.259
 good chance that in the future there will be the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.419
 62 something seems to me because it seems to us 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.729
 have seen it if I can have a moment 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.889
 never more time even from within and 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.150
 strabello looks like reality na1 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:55.810
 accelerates after spring goes down 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.439
 pity not functions noted things 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.750
 internal internal display we do not say not 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:04.210
 it's don't work good on non numbers 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.800
 so there is no odometer 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.509
 internal c1 removes let 's say things to ai 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.669
 sides do not know how much we say 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.960
 basically how much is going well 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.449
 so I would say that also for this test e 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.860
 motorcycle and all fashions valid 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:29.809
 visas also give a nice ballast in 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.939
 this led to a good idea 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:35.360
 movements that are very good too 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.389
 exhaust is you're pure is nothing 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.389
 bad 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:44.599
 good as a souvenir I hastily text the fashions 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.919
 I don't say who made kiko to those who have it 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.370
 in short, therefore, the versions have been 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.770
 stolen 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.199
 I have downloaded the text mode the fashion is 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.930
 how they brought changes that don't 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.999
 they had to be brought they could do to 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.009
 less to do if they did at least 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:03.199
 advise let's say fashion cometary e 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.550
 maritn herling private anyway oh well 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:07.070
 forget it for what one will do 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:12.590
 war every time 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:15.260
 well also heard a beautiful sound of war in 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.410
 fuel oil so I would say that also for 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:22.190
 this head all the way the usual 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:24.220
 link dismissal good bye to all to 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.220
 next
