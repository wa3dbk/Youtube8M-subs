you can see you don't get a time there
and<00:03:21.760> also<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:23.349> can't<00:03:23.560> fast<00:03:23.859> forward<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.280> that

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
and also you can't fast forward it that

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.159 
and also you can't fast forward it that
way<00:03:24.579> if<00:03:24.849> I<00:03:25.030> course<00:03:25.510> let's<00:03:25.720> see<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.930> middle

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
way if I course let's see the middle

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.539 
way if I course let's see the middle
you'd<00:03:26.410> expect<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.919> to<00:03:27.040> start<00:03:27.250> at<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.400> middle

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
you'd expect it to start at the middle

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.130 
you'd expect it to start at the middle
of<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.790> episode<00:03:28.239> but<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:31.239> doesn't<00:03:31.599> do<00:03:31.689> that<00:03:31.870> it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
of the episode but it doesn't do that it

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.160 
of the episode but it doesn't do that it
goes<00:03:32.409> I<00:03:32.739> have

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
goes I have

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.070 
goes I have
through<00:03:33.440> there<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.360> that's<00:03:35.480> all<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.780> can<00:03:35.930> fast

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
through there so that's all you can fast

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.729 
through there so that's all you can fast
forward<00:03:36.200> really<00:03:37.000> which<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.150> really<00:03:38.330> annoying

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
forward really which is really annoying

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.820 
forward really which is really annoying
but<00:03:39.739> and<00:03:40.069> that's<00:03:40.520> all<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:40.819> really<00:03:40.970> get<00:03:41.270> there

but and that's all you really get there

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.199 
but and that's all you really get there
just<00:03:42.830> no<00:03:43.010> time<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.670> can't<00:03:43.849> really<00:03:43.940> fast

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
just no time you can't really fast

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.350 
just no time you can't really fast
forward<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:44.930> good<00:03:45.110> quality<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.360> and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360
