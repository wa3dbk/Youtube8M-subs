00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.750
 My people say that the guilherme of the channel 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.820
 66 events and I'm here today with one 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.880
 different video to make an ad 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.670
 For you , many may have already seen 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.650
 the title of what it is but leaves me 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.230
 start explaining a little before 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.990
 You understand, that's fine. 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.510
 We are currently in the saga of nerds 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.580
 Geeks pds already coming in with 13 is that there 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.699
 with pokémon xey 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.630
 but what I meant by the purpose 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.940
 This hack is what it is and games are 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.359
 very difficult to obtain the complete 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.069
 they are complex, it's a beating 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.289
 decoding the ten most difficult to be 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.629
 altered set of gba 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.149
 so what happens we do not have 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.579
 many reasons for nintendo ds 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.399
 the mouths we have are faster to 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.370
 in rock calling or to increase and 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.559
 I can do everything and this is the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.370
 purpose of the new Odessa rackets 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.140
 monde 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:04.050
 Only thing happens. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.440
 we have platinum pokémon radios and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.320
 gold soul silver and black white and black 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.010
 2 white and have no decent mahaki of 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 new rock plus ida and montpellier 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.340
 So I'm creating this rock now. 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 purpose is that it creates a rack in batches 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.440
 gl very dangerous idea 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 initially only condá is much more the father 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.190
 Come forward if you want too. 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 I'll leave this question open there 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.420
 this is it, the project is called 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.149
 pokémon ex daemon ex the extreme 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.270
 exactly ex-time the game will suffer 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.590
 increase of drastic levels all 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 coaches of the game and add 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.619
 wild pokémon on maps so all 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.810
 the 493 is because we will be up until then 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.110
 captured six and I'm trying 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.509
 making a way that goes until the fourth 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 we have seen 80% of the time 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.200
 ex 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.650
 this is the goal of rac hitherto 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.660
 and it's up to the gym room we 're with 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390
 the nearly full politec are giving a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.299
 possibility for us to capture and 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.420
 see many pokémons only month of the huge 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:23.470
 of team formation and also 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.540
 is to balance when invading we had the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.700
 challenge that we can all have 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.989
 levels and leading gyms will 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:36.720
 suffering bush for example is free flight 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.160
 eighth of a swim in the fla is with a level 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.880
 8590 I have not decided yet I have to see 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.190
 that 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.810
 the synth league I put all the 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.670
 nielsen pokémons 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.760
 so let's see simple and offers a mix 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.040
 end up in the league, you will not come back 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.780
 increasing a lot not 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.430
 What I intend is doing in this 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.450
 area also pretend not to know if I go 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.900
 get 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 It's because of the complexity, it's changing the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.540
 characters and edit 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.160
 some texts giving the illusion of what the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.080
 character that is already participating in 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 excel word and excel 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.890
 is not the character of death and the loss of 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.019
 mandate is that it is the presence of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.030
 original game protagonists 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.910
 I 'll be trying to put the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.530
 characters and edited in some 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.070
 parts of the text seems like the story 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.780
 It's no different you have to do what the 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.630
 characters of the fine for having heard the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.230
 platinum story and game 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.380
 platinum and dj sorry i used the foot mount 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.120
 who is living is the new character I 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.440
 I've tried more or less what the purpose 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.190
 that I want 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.230
 I think so, right. So this is it. I made one. 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.269
 small blog is also there in the description 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.720

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
 world tuned in where I'm that'm 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.980

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.200
 I'll be bringing new videos well. 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.959
 This is what I had to tell the crowd. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.620
 this rapidity the second to second series 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.690

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 second fortnight of august 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.040
 if everything works out right I think to 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.919
 before that if it's because I have others 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.699
 parallel jobs that I can not 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:32.030
