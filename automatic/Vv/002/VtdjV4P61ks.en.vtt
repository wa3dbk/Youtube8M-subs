00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 typical of Lebanese cuisine 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.549
 falafels are made with peas 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.049

 coriander is unavoidable in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 this recipe just like flat parsley 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.470
 of which we are thin also the stems and the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.510
 leaves the coriander seeds have 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.640
 not at all the same flavor as the plant 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.050
 they will bring a sweet little note 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 bitter to our rada touil 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
