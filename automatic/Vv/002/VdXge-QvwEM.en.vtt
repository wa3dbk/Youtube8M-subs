assumed that it was Matt and I I should
have<00:01:36.659> looked<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.320> better<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have looked at it better but it's it's a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
have looked at it better but it's it's a
matte<00:01:39.000> shadow<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.960> glitter<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.740> if

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
matte shadow but it has glitter in it if

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
matte shadow but it has glitter in it if
that<00:01:41.040> makes<00:01:41.100> sense<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.570> odd

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that makes sense so it's really odd

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
that makes sense so it's really odd
because<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.680> know<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.920> matte<00:01:44.070> shadows<00:01:44.430> are

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
because you know that matte shadows are

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.149 
because you know that matte shadows are
usually<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.030> drier<00:01:45.930> than<00:01:46.409> shimmery

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
usually a bit drier than shimmery

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.310 
usually a bit drier than shimmery
shadows<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.670> shadows<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.479> more<00:01:48.810> machine<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
shadows or shadows with more machine to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.789 
shadows or shadows with more machine to
them<00:01:49.470> uh<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:51.049> matte<00:01:52.049> shadows<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.530> generally

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
them uh and matte shadows are generally

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.170 
them uh and matte shadows are generally
just<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.460> difficult<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.970> work

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just a little more difficult to work

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
just a little more difficult to work
with<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.960> fact<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.560> when

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
with because of that fact so then when

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
with because of that fact so then when
you<00:01:55.799> add<00:01:56.009> chunks<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.969> glitter<00:01:57.210> into<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.630> it's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
you add chunks of glitter into it it's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.929 
you add chunks of glitter into it it's
just<00:01:57.840> kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> odd<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.490> ended<00:01:59.700> up<00:01:59.790> getting

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
just kind of odd and I ended up getting

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.170 
just kind of odd and I ended up getting
glitter<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.659> over<00:02:00.719> my<00:02:00.930> face<00:02:01.290> um<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.670> fell

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
glitter all over my face um it just fell

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
glitter all over my face um it just fell
I<00:02:03.210> didn't<00:02:03.509> even<00:02:03.659> stay<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.439> eyelids<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.390> not

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I didn't even stay on my eyelids so not

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
I didn't even stay on my eyelids so not
using<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.960> shadow<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> love

using this shadow at all if you love

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.400 
using this shadow at all if you love
glitter<00:02:08.759> um<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> want<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.020> take<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.229> time

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
to work with it i'm sure you can use

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.809 
to work with it i'm sure you can use
glitter<00:02:11.959> glue<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.040> go<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.220> more<00:02:13.760> extreme

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
glitter glue and go to more extreme

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.210 
glitter glue and go to more extreme
lengths<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> get<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.930> work<00:02:14.959> uh<00:02:15.500> on

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
lengths to get this to work uh on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.710 
lengths to get this to work uh on
everyday<00:02:16.610> basis<00:02:17.030> i'm<00:02:17.209> just<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.450> willing<00:02:17.600> to

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
everyday basis i'm just not willing to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.050 
everyday basis i'm just not willing to
do<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.370> one<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.520> other<00:02:19.670> sheets<00:02:19.940> that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
do that so one of the other sheets that

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.400 
do that so one of the other sheets that
i<00:02:20.120> was<00:02:20.209> most<00:02:20.360> excited<00:02:20.450> about<00:02:20.750> working<00:02:21.050> with<00:02:21.170> us

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
i was most excited about working with us

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.680 
i was most excited about working with us
as<00:02:21.560> gold<00:02:21.830> shade<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.760> really<00:02:22.940> does<00:02:23.270> swatch

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
as gold shade and it really does swatch

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.080 
as gold shade and it really does swatch
very<00:02:24.110> beautifully<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.980> just<00:02:25.640> find<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:25.940> when

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
very beautifully I just find that when

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640 
very beautifully I just find that when
i'm<00:02:26.180> working<00:02:26.300> with<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.720> on<00:02:26.810> my<00:02:26.840> actual<00:02:27.290> lid

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
i'm working with it on my actual lid

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.000 
i'm working with it on my actual lid
that<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.730> gets<00:02:28.910> pretty<00:02:29.239> dry<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.140> crumbly<00:02:30.739> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that it gets pretty dry and crumbly and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.729 
that it gets pretty dry and crumbly and
it<00:02:31.610> also<00:02:32.060> has<00:02:32.330> some<00:02:32.780> glitter<00:02:32.989> in<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.410> would

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
it also has some glitter in it I would

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.710 
it also has some glitter in it I would
say<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.190> bad<00:02:34.400> as<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.640> shadow<00:02:34.970> up<00:02:35.239> here<00:02:35.510> but

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
say not as bad as a shadow up here but

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.170 
say not as bad as a shadow up here but
definitely<00:02:36.500> some<00:02:36.680> glitter<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.180> transfers

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
definitely some glitter that transfers

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.270 
definitely some glitter that transfers
and<00:02:38.450> gets<00:02:38.600> everywhere<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.230> when<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.770> have<00:02:40.069> been

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and gets everywhere so when I have been

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 
and gets everywhere so when I have been
using<00:02:40.400> this<00:02:40.670> I've<00:02:40.819> been<00:02:41.000> using<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.569> mostly<00:02:42.080> wet

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
using this I've been using it mostly wet

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.060 
using this I've been using it mostly wet
us<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.760> don't<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.090> issue<00:02:44.390> which

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.229 
us that I don't have that issue which
may<00:02:46.070> or<00:02:46.100> may<00:02:46.310> not<00:02:46.340> bother<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.030> just

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
may or may not bother you but just

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.540 
may or may not bother you but just
letting<00:02:47.570> you<00:02:47.750> know<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.200> then<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:49.250> shade<00:02:49.280> that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
letting you know and then the shade that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.580 
letting you know and then the shade that
I<00:02:49.640> was<00:02:49.760> most<00:02:50.150> excited<00:02:50.390> about<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.959> beautiful

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
I was most excited about this beautiful

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.120 
I was most excited about this beautiful
like<00:02:51.769> burnt<00:02:52.070> orange<00:02:52.489> shade<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:54.350> love<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.950> but

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
like burnt orange shade I I love it but

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.240 
like burnt orange shade I I love it but
it<00:02:55.400> also<00:02:55.670> has<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:57.110> like<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.470> tiny<00:02:57.860> bit<00:02:58.160> of

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
it also has just like a tiny bit of

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.100 
it also has just like a tiny bit of
these<00:02:58.370> little<00:02:58.640> micro<00:02:58.850> glitter<00:02:59.390> particles<00:02:59.750> in

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
these little micro glitter particles in

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.470 
these little micro glitter particles in
there<00:03:00.319> definitely<00:03:01.250> not<00:03:01.519> as<00:03:01.640> bad<00:03:01.850> as<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.209> gold

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
there definitely not as bad as the gold

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.410 
there definitely not as bad as the gold
or<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.080> shade<00:03:03.110> up<00:03:03.470> here<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.550> something<00:03:05.269> to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
or this shade up here but something to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.540 
or this shade up here but something to
note<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.380> was<00:03:06.530> slightly<00:03:06.800> disappointing

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
note so it was slightly disappointing

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.680 
note so it was slightly disappointing
that<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.700> shades<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.180> was<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> most

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
that the shades that I was the most

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.020 
that the shades that I was the most
excited<00:03:09.200> about<00:03:09.290> um<00:03:09.739> had<00:03:10.670> some<00:03:10.700> of<00:03:10.940> those

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
excited about um had some of those

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030 
excited about um had some of those
glitter<00:03:11.330> issues<00:03:11.810> but<00:03:12.140> overall<00:03:12.410> this<00:03:12.620> is<00:03:12.680> still

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
glitter issues but overall this is still

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.380 
glitter issues but overall this is still
a<00:03:13.069> really<00:03:13.400> nice<00:03:13.580> palette<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.150> would

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
a really nice palette and I would

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.229 
a really nice palette and I would
recommend<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:15.050> but<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.769> warning<00:03:16.760> about

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
recommend it but with a warning about

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.819 
recommend it but with a warning about
the<00:03:17.420> glitter<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.230> if<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.650> very

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
the glitter because if you have very

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.729 
the glitter because if you have very
sensitive<00:03:19.010> eyes<00:03:19.459> or<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.790> just<00:03:20.000> hate<00:03:20.269> glitter

you may find that this isn't as easy to

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.250 
you may find that this isn't as easy to
work<00:03:23.600> with<00:03:23.660> as<00:03:24.049> some<00:03:24.769> other<00:03:24.920> palettes<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.670> I

with glitter for me now I have talked to
some<00:04:00.079> of<00:04:00.109> my<00:04:00.170> friends<00:04:00.260> who<00:04:00.560> have<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:00.890> palette

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
some of my friends who have this palette

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.380 
some of my friends who have this palette
and<00:04:01.220> they<00:04:01.310> said<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.519> they<00:04:01.730> did<00:04:01.880> not<00:04:01.910> have<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
and they said that they did not have the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.910 
and they said that they did not have the
same<00:04:03.250> issues<00:04:04.250> with<00:04:04.400> glitter<00:04:04.640> so<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.799> don't<00:04:06.799> know

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
same issues with glitter so I don't know

same issues with glitter so I don't know
but<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.790> think<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.329> is<00:04:08.359> something

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
but I think that it is something

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.449 
but I think that it is something
important<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.709> note<00:04:09.859> because<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.190> know<00:04:10.310> that

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
important to note because I know that

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.830 
important to note because I know that
some<00:04:10.609> people<00:04:10.640> I<00:04:10.940> absolutely<00:04:11.420> hate<00:04:11.660> glitter
