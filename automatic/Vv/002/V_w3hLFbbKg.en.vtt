things that I have out is a jar this is

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.790 
things that I have out is a jar this is
what<00:00:43.460> this<00:00:43.820> is<00:00:43.879> what<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.149> store<00:00:44.660> my<00:00:45.170> simple

what this is what I store my simple

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.639 
what this is what I store my simple
vanilla<00:00:46.160> syrup<00:00:46.370> in<00:00:46.640> and<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.870> also<00:00:47.989> have<00:00:48.289> a<00:00:48.320> pan

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649

that<00:00:49.370> I'm<00:00:49.489> going<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.730> cook<00:00:50.269> this<00:00:50.449> on<00:00:50.719> the<00:00:51.079> stove

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
that I'm going to cook this on the stove

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.770 
that I'm going to cook this on the stove
with<00:00:51.620> as<00:00:51.829> well<00:00:52.309> as<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.909> whisk<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.539> stir<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:55.780> so

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
with as well as a whisk to stir it so

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.059 
with as well as a whisk to stir it so
I'm<00:00:56.839> going<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:56.989> go<00:00:57.079> ahead<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.440> turn<00:00:57.589> my<00:00:57.620> stove

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
I'm going to go ahead and turn my stove

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:05.500 
I'm going to go ahead and turn my stove
on<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.699> a<00:00:58.999> medium<00:00:59.510> medium-high<00:01:00.469> heat<00:01:04.510> I'm

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
on to a medium medium-high heat I'm

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
on to a medium medium-high heat I'm
going<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.020> pour<00:01:06.260> my<00:01:06.290> water<00:01:06.620> in<00:01:06.950> again<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:07.909> is

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
going to pour my water in again this is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:25.210 
going to pour my water in again this is
one<00:01:08.360> cup<00:01:16.390> next<00:01:17.390> I'm<00:01:17.660> going<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:17.990> add<00:01:18.290> my<00:01:18.620> sugar

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:37.580 

ah

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920 

so<00:01:38.590> right<00:01:38.800> now<00:01:38.950> I'm<00:01:39.190> continuing<00:01:39.580> to<00:01:40.030> whisk<00:01:40.510> my

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
so right now I'm continuing to whisk my

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.609 
so right now I'm continuing to whisk my
mixture<00:01:41.409> on<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:42.100> medium<00:01:42.520> high<00:01:42.700> heat<00:01:42.729> and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mixture on a medium high heat and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.840 
mixture on a medium high heat and
basically<00:01:44.619> we<00:01:44.740> want<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.040> continue<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.640> cook

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
basically we want to continue to cook

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.040 
basically we want to continue to cook
this<00:01:46.090> until<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:47.080> becomes<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.740> very<00:01:48.280> clear

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
this until it becomes a very clear

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.080 
this until it becomes a very clear
liquid<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:51.070> when<00:01:51.310> we'll<00:01:51.490> know<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.910> the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
liquid that's when we'll know that the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.560 
liquid that's when we'll know that the
sugar<00:01:52.509> has<00:01:52.720> completely<00:01:52.810> dissolved<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.360> we

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
sugar has completely dissolved and we

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.330 
sugar has completely dissolved and we
can<00:01:55.750> remove<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.050> from<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.380> heat<00:01:56.530> at<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.830> time

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.950 

so<00:02:00.340> now<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.490> can<00:02:00.700> see<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.150> our<00:02:01.360> mixture<00:02:01.930> is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
so now you can see that our mixture is

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560 
so now you can see that our mixture is
crystal<00:02:02.770> clear<00:02:03.039> that's<00:02:03.250> exactly<00:02:03.940> how<00:02:04.119> we<00:02:04.180> want

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
crystal clear that's exactly how we want

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.930 
crystal clear that's exactly how we want
it<00:02:04.660> so<00:02:05.530> it<00:02:05.680> only<00:02:05.830> takes<00:02:06.100> about<00:02:06.250> five<00:02:06.399> minutes

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
it so it only takes about five minutes

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.790 
it so it only takes about five minutes
for<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.690> reach<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:08.110> point<00:02:08.440> maybe<00:02:08.679> a

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
for it to reach this point maybe a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.060 
for it to reach this point maybe a
little<00:02:08.950> less<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.640> I'm<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:11.080> take<00:02:11.769> my<00:02:12.010> two

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
little less and I'm going to take my two

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.330 
little less and I'm going to take my two
tablespoons<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.300> vanilla<00:02:13.780> extract<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
tablespoons of vanilla extract and I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.270 
tablespoons of vanilla extract and I
want<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.550> pour<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.820> in<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.980> also<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.250> to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
want to pour it in I also want to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.280 
want to pour it in I also want to
mention<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.880> did<00:02:19.209> turn<00:02:19.420> off<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.750> heat<00:02:19.959> so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
mention that I did turn off the heat so

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.430 
mention that I did turn off the heat so
this<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.310> no<00:02:21.489> longer<00:02:21.519> on<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:22.900> am<00:02:22.989> going<00:02:23.019> to

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
this is no longer on and I am going to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.590 
this is no longer on and I am going to
remove<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.890> from<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.160> stove<00:02:24.459> here<00:02:24.790> as<00:02:25.000> well<00:02:25.269> so

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
remove it from the stove here as well so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.060 
remove it from the stove here as well so
now<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> set<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.350> aside<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.950> we'll

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
now I'm going to set it aside and we'll

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.310 
now I'm going to set it aside and we'll
allow<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.580> cool<00:02:27.910> completely<00:02:28.260> until<00:02:29.260> I

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
allow it to cool completely until I

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.920 
allow it to cool completely until I
transfer<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.890> into<00:02:30.070> my<00:02:30.910> more<00:02:31.239> permanent<00:02:31.690> jar

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
transfer it into my more permanent jar

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.780 
transfer it into my more permanent jar
which<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:32.320> showed<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.860> beginning
