00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:52.949

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:13.590
 this one also finds is you can agree from weekly 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.330
 its Italian now just very taste 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.310
 it is difficult to make the shoe often 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.370
 men's snacks 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.130
 they Italian inside are just whole 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.740
 very narrow and this is quite strict and duo 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.020
 book then become special heels for 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.350
 ordered before but I make a good one 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.180
 shoemaker make sure you have a little finger that i 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.920
 can handle and is good with green 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.210
 Once I can make even good as 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.520
 should 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.020
 then they can do a lot with it 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.700
 look after your shoes really well 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:47.060
 they do go that schedule for a very long time 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.060
 because you have more 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.420
 cheap is expensive they are ls i think 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.100
 that it is so you can I want cheap 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.410
 find something nice you could find often 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.030
 yes you are lucky not to have such before 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:04.890
 to pay when a couple I slender 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.230
 such an expression green but yes look this 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.530
 shoes these cost 400 euros 500 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.940
 Increases it you feel in notes too 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.080
 If you are up to me I have a new musical 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.090
 not always they allow you to wear shoes too 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.500
 buy but also think it's important 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.630
 were shoes made and are they 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.880
 handmade in italy spain england 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.600
 that he is the more expensive his are 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.860
 worth 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.660
 but then you also know for sure what is right 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.430
 have shoes and shoes that are now 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.510
 darcy the kids church and I think so 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.530
 very important 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.600
 That does not depend on the brand being the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.260
 Most brand and the country or countries in 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.750
 Italy or Spain made a monkey and like 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.310

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.350
 broker and see those selfies and that ones 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.160
 Then you also know that you are not made ali 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.050

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.180
