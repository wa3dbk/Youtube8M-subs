00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.080
 hello everyone I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.029
 whites 2 in the zombies the noma for 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
 buried and was in this game with cs 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.529
 there as you see we are going to do a trick with 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.509
 the trampoline or with the steamrolling 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 this one had put it wrong justly 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.020
 that placing it in this position is worth 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.789
 right here and the little corner has to 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.590
 excel inside this house that is the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.600
 house where all the pieces are 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 that we usually take to ride the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.820
 trampoline and all this goes and as you see 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.280
 just make that jump and it did not come like this 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.809
 that we think about putting for a steam 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.309
 overwhelming here and jumping from one to the other 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 I had a bug that was 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.600
 crouch on the court arm as you see 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.430
 transfer and I go to the other street is not 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.019
 I transfer all the walls in this 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.960
 moment c was again put on the 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.280
 steamrolling steam and he stands up 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 standing will make the double jump 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.309
 will jump from one trampoline and then to the other 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.070
 and it will stay trapped and create a good 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.409
 barrier right here is true 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 that he is not going to give any 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.860
 create in a good barrier and next 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.540
 has a sofa the sofa we can open it 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 but it's better not to open it because that way 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 zombies will only come for a site and we 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.120
 we save so that the other player 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.950
 not this 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.040
 do not come more zombies not the other 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.480
 player in this case was me for example 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 and I started spinning there looking 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.650
 somewhere to not come but 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.540
 they also came to kill me so 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.090
 well, basically, it 's for him to stay 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 a player as you see is the moment in the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.260
 that jumps and makes the double jump and 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.760
 it remains there 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.170
 and now you will see how good they are going to be 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.960
 a lot of zombies there is a good 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.930
 barrier although as I say the others 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.980
 players then we're not going so 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.890
 least we have not found anywhere 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.480
 where the zombies did not come 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.980
 you will see what I put there near the sofa 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.080
 that on the other hand but I came 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.940
 equally the zombies although good cessation 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 I think there is a good barrier and simply 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.310
 in this it is worth so good I hope that you 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.630
 I liked it if you liked to vote for me 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.890
 like favorites and see you next 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.890
 video greetings to all 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.490
 and
