plastic a because it's got this plastic
back<00:00:21.990> construction<00:00:22.400> but<00:00:23.400> when<00:00:23.580> I've<00:00:23.699> looked

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

off so we put the finger on the camera
here<00:00:35.880> which<00:00:36.000> seems<00:00:36.210> strange<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.690> first<00:00:36.719> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
here which seems strange at first and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470 
here which seems strange at first and
then<00:00:37.890> we<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.129> push<00:00:38.370> through<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.329> back

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
long as you didn't smash the screen if

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.500 
long as you didn't smash the screen if
you<00:00:55.410> scratch<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.100> back<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.390> buy

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

another<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.289> same<00:00:58.500> colour<00:00:58.829> or<00:00:59.039> a

different color for an about twenty
pounds<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.160> great

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
makes the phone feel really nice in the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
makes the phone feel really nice in the
hand<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.409> too<00:01:07.619> slippery<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> just

hand it's not too slippery and it's just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
hand it's not too slippery and it's just
a<00:01:09.030> good<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.479> designing<00:01:09.840> things<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> lot

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
a good way of designing things so a lot

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.490 
a good way of designing things so a lot
of<00:01:10.830> thought<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.490> gone<00:01:11.580> into<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
of thought has really gone into it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.990 
of thought has really gone into it
the<00:01:13.500> other<00:01:13.650> thing<00:01:14.369> that's<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.610> great

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the other thing that's really great

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.380 
the other thing that's really great
about<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.810> lumia<00:01:16.140> 620<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.939> price<00:01:18.150> point

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
about the lumia 620 is the price point

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
about the lumia 620 is the price point
now<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> comes<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.400> 140<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> 150<00:01:21.000> pounds

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
now it comes in at 140 to 150 pounds

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
now it comes in at 140 to 150 pounds
that<00:01:22.200> sim<00:01:22.530> free<00:01:22.860> unlocked<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.610> you're<00:01:23.970> not

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that sim free unlocked so you you're not

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.870 
that sim free unlocked so you you're not
committed<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> contract<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.880> that's

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
extremely windy day when I took that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
particular video but overall just a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.930 
particular video but overall just a
really<00:02:58.500> good<00:02:58.950> experience<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.580> look<00:02:59.700> at<00:02:59.790> some

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
at this price point now it's a 5

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.259 
at this price point now it's a 5
megapixel<00:03:10.230> camera<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:11.040> captures<00:03:11.790> really<00:03:12.090> nice

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269
