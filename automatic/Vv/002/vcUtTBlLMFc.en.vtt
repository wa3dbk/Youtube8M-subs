00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.330
 boiled eggs floating in blood of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.880
 pork is one of the typical foods of 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.490
 hungary if you go there you can not 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.220
 lose the disgusting taste of this 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:42.040
 curious mix the truth is that I do not 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.730
 Surprise because there are other cases 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.309
 examples of countries that are dedicated to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.950
 mix food with blood for example 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.170
 in china we have the blood of ducks 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.200
 is used to develop a type of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.740
 gelatin and in Sweden we also have a 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.160
 Very peculiar food blood cake 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.160
 reindeer 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.229
 but let's focus on hungary 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.409
 because it 's what we come to talk about 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.560
 now they catch and bleed the pig like 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.950
 you know well the pigs when they are 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.100
 dying emit some little ones 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.159
 incredible 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.369
 Well, they kill them, they bleed 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.100
 and then boil them or they 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.650
 boil eggs in the blood puts in the 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.810
 blood a pot they throw the eggs and what 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 they leave about ten minutes 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.610
 approximately once they have boiled 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.210
 in the blood they just have to leave 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.360
 and throw them over the blood 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.130
 eat like that, no more to do 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.200
 the truth is that it gives a bit of repel 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 not because pig blood is very 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.670
 similar to human blood indeed 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 anyone who saw this dish would think 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.440
 that a person that the person who 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 is eating is a vampire nothing more 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.080
 far from reality and is that the pig 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.390
 an adn saves a genome 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.040
 similar to the human and specifically 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 the blood then has an appearance 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.070
 quite similar to the human is a plate 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 that gives a lot of grimace but it's a plate 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.630
 which is mainly used in the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.740
 cold countries mainly not 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.620
 just for let's say increase the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.420
 heat to preserve the heat is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.810
 Warms up a kind of sopita 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.260
 of blood and things are thrown over 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.140
 in short things that seem incredible 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.319
 They look like lies but they are dishes that 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.150
 they are recognized to exist and it is good 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.940
 as simple as going to the internet 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 look for it in google and you will get the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.920
 recipe how to prepare this fabulous 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.920
 delicacy of blood and eggs 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.270
