hi<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:00.930> Jo<00:00:01.170> camp<00:00:01.500> and<00:00:01.860> today's<00:00:02.310> question<00:00:02.820> is

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi I'm Jo camp and today's question is

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.059 
hi I'm Jo camp and today's question is
why<00:00:03.210> are<00:00:03.540> all<00:00:03.689> of<00:00:03.720> our<00:00:03.929> horses<00:00:04.230> barefoot<00:00:04.859> and

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
why are all of our horses barefoot and

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.460 
why are all of our horses barefoot and
the<00:00:05.549> short<00:00:05.790> answer<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.359> not<00:00:06.810> long<00:00:07.020> after

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the short answer is that not long after

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.620 
the short answer is that not long after
we<00:00:07.500> stumbled<00:00:08.429> into<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.760> crazy<00:00:09.030> world<00:00:09.240> of

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
we stumbled into this crazy world of

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.020 
we stumbled into this crazy world of
horses<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.620> discovered<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> horse's<00:00:11.790> hoof

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
horses we discovered that a horse's hoof

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.810 
horses we discovered that a horse's hoof
is<00:00:12.269> supposed<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.870> flex<00:00:13.259> with<00:00:13.620> every<00:00:14.370> step<00:00:14.639> it

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
is supposed to flex with every step it

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.210 
is supposed to flex with every step it
takes<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.450> hoof<00:00:15.660> wall<00:00:15.900> flexes<00:00:16.560> outward<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
takes the hoof wall flexes outward and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
takes the hoof wall flexes outward and
sucks<00:00:17.550> an<00:00:17.760> enormous<00:00:18.090> amount<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> blood<00:00:18.660> down

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
sucks an enormous amount of blood down

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
sucks an enormous amount of blood down
into<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> hoof<00:00:19.680> capsule<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.640> circulates

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
into the hoof capsule that circulates

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
into the hoof capsule that circulates
through<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> capsule<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> gives<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
through the capsule and gives it the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.670 
through the capsule and gives it the
ability<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.490> keep<00:00:24.150> itself<00:00:24.539> healthy<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> all

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
ability to keep itself healthy and all

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.339 
ability to keep itself healthy and all
that<00:00:25.859> liquid<00:00:26.130> also<00:00:26.820> provides<00:00:27.300> they<00:00:27.570> hydraulic

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that liquid also provides they hydraulic

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.800 
that liquid also provides they hydraulic
like<00:00:28.560> shock<00:00:28.859> absorption<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> ligaments

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
like shock absorption for the ligaments

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.330 
like shock absorption for the ligaments
and<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> tendons<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> joints<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.279> the

and the tendons and the joints of the
leg<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.969> then<00:00:33.390> when<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> hoof<00:00:33.780> comes<00:00:34.050> off<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
leg and then when the hoof comes off the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.090 
leg and then when the hoof comes off the
ground<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.040> snaps<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.989> action<00:00:37.500> help

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
ground and snaps back that action help

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.310 
ground and snaps back that action help
shoot<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.730> blood<00:00:39.030> back<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.780> leg<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
shoot that blood back up the leg and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
shoot that blood back up the leg and
take<00:00:40.469> load<00:00:40.770> off<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> heart<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:42.120> course<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
take load off the heart and of course it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.959 
take load off the heart and of course it
can't<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:43.110> any<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.680> with<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.280> metal<00:00:44.700> chute

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
can't do any of that with a metal chute

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.930 
can't do any of that with a metal chute
nailed<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> nail<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.700> bottom<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
nailed to the nail to the bottom of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.139 
nailed to the nail to the bottom of the
hoof<00:00:48.239> wall<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
hoof wall and and and so that that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
hoof wall and and and so that that
circulation<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.199> severely<00:00:52.800> restricted<00:00:53.340> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
circulation is severely restricted and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.069 
circulation is severely restricted and
there's<00:00:53.879> no<00:00:54.149> benefit<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> shock

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
there's no benefit from the shock

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.450 
there's no benefit from the shock
absorption<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:55.980> certainly<00:00:56.280> not

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
absorption and it's certainly not

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.849 
absorption and it's certainly not
helping<00:00:57.120> shoot<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.989> blood<00:00:58.199> back<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
helping shoot the the blood back up the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.479 
helping shoot the the blood back up the
leg<00:00:59.359> one<00:01:00.359> study<00:01:00.660> showed<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.489> barefoot

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
leg one study showed that a barefoot

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.509 
leg one study showed that a barefoot
horses<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.059> average<00:01:03.600> actually<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.799> 10

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
horses on average actually have a 10

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
horses on average actually have a 10
percent<00:01:05.760> lower<00:01:06.210> heart<00:01:06.659> rate<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
percent lower heart rate because it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
percent lower heart rate because it
doesn't<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> work<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.280> hard<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.820> shod

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
doesn't have to work as hard as shod

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.440 
doesn't have to work as hard as shod
horses<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.430> with<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.729> information<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
horses and with all this information you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
horses and with all this information you
know<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> logic<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.520> how<00:01:15.439> horses<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.549> wild

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
know the logic of how horses in the wild

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
know the logic of how horses in the wild
have<00:01:18.210> survived<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:19.020> 50<00:01:19.439> million<00:01:19.799> years<00:01:20.009> on

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
have survived for 50 million years on

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
have survived for 50 million years on
this<00:01:20.490> planet<00:01:20.700> without<00:01:21.060> any<00:01:21.330> help<00:01:21.600> from<00:01:21.689> us

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this planet without any help from us

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.370 
this planet without any help from us
because<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.159> need<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:24.240> solid<00:01:24.720> sound

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
because they need that good solid sound

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980 
because they need that good solid sound
healthy<00:01:25.920> hoof<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.729> order<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.509> escape<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
healthy hoof in order to escape the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.050 
healthy hoof in order to escape the
predators<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.650> they<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> escape<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
predators that they have to escape so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
predators that they have to escape so
it's<00:01:30.390> obviously<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.530> complex

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it's obviously it's a bit more complex

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.679 
it's obviously it's a bit more complex
than<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.400> pulling<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> shoes<00:01:33.270> off<00:01:33.540> the
