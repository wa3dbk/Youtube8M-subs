00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.050
 good to have in our hands the 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:10.310
 smartphone that would have 769 of the company 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:14.290
 I had an American company 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:18.490
 that produces tablets and you can also 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.960
 tablet like the one I have on hand 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.119
 For those who do not know what is a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.610
 affable is simply a hybrid of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.920
 concepts between what a tablet is and 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.790
 a smartphone 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.850
 then all you see is what difference 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.640
 of normal cell phones is that after 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:42.610
 from a big screen as you can see 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:46.180
 5.5 inches corresponding to measure 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.480
 from corner to corner 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.430
 and there also that he has an entrance to 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.490
 a special pen that is this 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.080
 I do not know how to write notes and it is 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.760
 composed of aluminum and therefore has a 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.650
 rubber to handle the cell phone 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.220
 and good in terms of specifications 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.470
 physical we find ourselves first with the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.290
 entry 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.490
 a standard mini jack for hearing aids the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.050
 standardized of all of the most 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.750
 cell phones and a speaker for listening 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.650
 of the call a camera of 0.3 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.650
 megapixels for video calls 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.650
 of course the super screen that 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.860
 they have that really is pretty big 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.190
 and then the menu touch buttons 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.190
 and back 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.460
 we find dimensions of 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 15 x 8 x 9 millimeters thick then 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.780
 more or less you can make the idea of 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.080
 what the cell phone looks 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.119
 besides a weight of 197 grams that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.670
 really not much but it is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.760
 little to make that big place 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 really make a big weight then 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.340
 in the capable hand below we 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.200
 we find the microphone as they can 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.600
 see the little hole is the little one who comes 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.280
 next to the entrance I grow up in 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.890
 micro micro micro usb for then the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.350
 transmission of data and then to give it 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.450
 charge to the cell phone and then as you can see 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.100
 the entrance of the pen 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.040
 I'm going to show you how it goes 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.640
 let's see how I do to put the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.640
 pencil and scream 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.580
 ready very putting it we have putting it 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.670
 Y 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.920
 and is completely adjusted 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.760
 and then they have no problem 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.550
 on the right side of the cell phone as 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.840
 can see the big toe we find with 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.840
 the suspend button 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.849
 as you can see or turn off we want to turn off 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.000
 the cell phone but possibly 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.470
 I will show then what are the 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.170
 software specifications I handle 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.290
 of the cellular operating system but 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.019
 for now I will focus on the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.599
 physical impressions from the in the part 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.829
 left of we find with the powers 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.720
 normal volume of the camera in 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.299
 the back part we find then with 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.849
 a loudspeaker speaker what is the 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.790
 name of the company a camera of 8 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:55.270
 megapixels very good on the day in the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.240
 night for the taking of 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.310
 of pictures at night this camera 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.950
 the flash is very basic really 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.560
 Then later, really, they 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.880
 I will show what it is 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.880
 taking the photos
