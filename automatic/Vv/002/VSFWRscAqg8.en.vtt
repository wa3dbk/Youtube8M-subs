00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
for spring so you'll need some tissue

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.740 
for spring so you'll need some tissue
paper<00:00:10.290> some<00:00:10.800> scissors<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.460> glue<00:00:11.880> gun<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.450> some

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.519 
glue sticks and then of course you'll
need<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.820> branch<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.780> attach<00:00:16.289> the

blossoms to so I got a variety of
different<00:00:21.270> tissue<00:00:21.660> papers<00:00:22.080> they're<00:00:22.410> really

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
different tissue papers they're really

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.529 
different tissue papers they're really
fun<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> make<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.699> tutorial<00:00:24.359> we're

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
your tissue paper and it doesn't need to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370 
your tissue paper and it doesn't need to

be perfect you just want to fold it up
into<00:00:37.680> some<00:00:37.829> squares<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.969> cut<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.329> into

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
into some squares and then cut it into

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.299 
into some squares and then cut it into
manageable<00:00:40.050> size<00:00:40.379> pieces<00:00:40.680> you're<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
manageable size pieces you're going to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.869 
manageable size pieces you're going to
be<00:00:41.399> cutting<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.850> petals<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.500> part

have too many piled on top of each other

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
have too many piled on top of each other
because<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.180> impossible<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.809> cut<00:00:48.960> them<00:00:49.140> so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
those are about three and a half inches

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.850 
those are about three and a half inches
and<00:01:23.330> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.869> greens<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.470> bit

and you can see our greens a little bit

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
and you can see our greens a little bit
smaller<00:01:26.189> because<00:01:26.580> we're<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> cut<00:01:27.240> our

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
smaller because we're going to cut our

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.710 
smaller because we're going to cut our
leaves<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
the next step is to create a pattern now

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.480 
the next step is to create a pattern now
I'm<00:01:33.510> just<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> draw<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.680> flower<00:01:34.950> onto

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
some card stock it doesn't need to be

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900 
some card stock it doesn't need to be

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.790 
flower pattern cut out you're going to
use<00:01:47.910> the<00:01:48.150> side<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.630> flower<00:01:48.870> pattern<00:01:49.440> to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
use the side of the flower pattern to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.070 
use the side of the flower pattern to
create<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.580> pattern<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.210> leaves<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
create the pattern for your leaves so

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.390 
create the pattern for your leaves so
just<00:01:52.290> take<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.530> same<00:01:52.830> piece<00:01:52.980> of<00:01:53.010> card<00:01:53.370> stock

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
just take the same piece of card stock

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.930 
just take the same piece of card stock
trace<00:01:54.330> three<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.410> petals<00:01:55.800> onto<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.730> card

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
trace three of the petals onto the card

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.400 
trace three of the petals onto the card
stock<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.360> gives<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> perfect<00:01:57.930> leaf

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
stock and it gives you a perfect leaf

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.280 
stock and it gives you a perfect leaf
pattern<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.670> then<00:01:59.880> take<00:02:00.330> your<00:02:00.570> flower<00:02:00.810> pattern

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
pattern so then take your flower pattern

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.320 
pattern so then take your flower pattern
put<00:02:01.980> it<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.220> your<00:02:02.370> pink<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.240> be

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
put it on your pink which is going to be

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.840 
put it on your pink which is going to be
the<00:02:03.420> outside<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.870> your<00:02:03.990> flowers<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.820> trace<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the outside of your flowers and trace it

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210 
the outside of your flowers and trace it
on<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.300> then<00:02:06.420> cut<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.410> and<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.010> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
on and then cut them out and do this in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
on and then cut them out and do this in
smaller<00:02:08.490> batches<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.179> try<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.570> layer<00:02:09.720> too

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
smaller batches if you try and layer too

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
smaller batches if you try and layer too
many<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.320> top<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.649> each<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.980> the<00:02:11.820> tissue

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.360 
paper doesn't cooperate in it terrorism
is<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.940> difficult<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.920> we're<00:02:17.130> going<00:02:17.280> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
is more difficult now we're going to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.340 
is more difficult now we're going to
assemble<00:02:17.700> our<00:02:17.910> flowers<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.720> take<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.080> pink

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
assemble our flowers so take a pink

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.500 
assemble our flowers so take a pink
flower<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.010> yellow<00:02:20.190> flower<00:02:20.460> put<00:02:21.270> them<00:02:21.390> on

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
flower and a yellow flower put them on

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.180 
flower and a yellow flower put them on
top<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.750> each<00:02:21.990> other<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.680> want<00:02:22.980> them

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
top of each other you don't want them

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.210 
top of each other you don't want them
perfectly<00:02:24.180> lined<00:02:24.420> up<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.810> then<00:02:25.500> fold<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.980> half

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
you'll see I just use one dab of glue

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.490 
you'll see I just use one dab of glue
which<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.150> plenty<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.810> hold<00:02:30.900> them<00:02:31.080> together<00:02:31.230> if

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
which is plenty to hold them together if

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.380 
which is plenty to hold them together if
you<00:02:31.590> pinch<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> tight<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.550> then<00:02:32.610> you're<00:02:33.270> gonna

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
you pinch it tight and then you're gonna

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.420 
you pinch it tight and then you're gonna
do<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.750> same<00:02:33.990> thing<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.620> your<00:02:34.830> leaves<00:02:35.010> so

see how they all turn out a little bit

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
see how they all turn out a little bit
different

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
different

boys got excited and went and found me a

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
boys got excited and went and found me a
whole<00:02:55.410> bunch<00:02:55.590> more<00:02:55.680> you're<00:02:56.520> gonna<00:02:56.610> take<00:02:56.850> your

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
whole bunch more you're gonna take your

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.820 
whole bunch more you're gonna take your
branch<00:02:57.239> kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.690> look<00:02:57.870> at<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.380> see<00:02:58.680> where

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
branch kind of look at it and see where

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.400 
branch kind of look at it and see where
you<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.670> blossom<00:03:00.600> would<00:03:00.780> most

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
you think that a blossom would most

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.250 
you think that a blossom would most
likely<00:03:01.680> we're<00:03:02.070> out<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.840> there's<00:03:03.840> no<00:03:03.900> test

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
likely we're out of it there's no test

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.990 
likely we're out of it there's no test
later<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.920> if<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:05.250> don't<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.670> exact

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
later so if you don't get it exact

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.210 
later so if you don't get it exact
totally<00:03:06.510> fine<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.110> kind<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.040> them<00:03:08.130> where

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
totally fine just kind of put them where

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.100 
totally fine just kind of put them where
you<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.489> they're<00:03:08.640> pretty<00:03:08.810> put<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> dab<00:03:10.080> of

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
you think they're pretty put a dab of

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.960 
you think they're pretty put a dab of
glue<00:03:10.350> down<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.070> put<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> blossom<00:03:11.850> on

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
glue down and then I put the blossom on

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.840 
glue down and then I put the blossom on
top<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.720> branch<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.580> kind<00:03:14.790> of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
top of the branch and then just kind of

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.090 
top of the branch and then just kind of
pinch<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.510> blossom<00:03:15.930> around<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.560> branch<00:03:16.800> so

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
pinch the blossom around the branch so

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.460 
pinch the blossom around the branch so
it<00:03:17.220> stays

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
it stays

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.670 
it stays
so<00:03:20.310> once<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.270> the<00:03:21.720> amount<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.170> blossoms

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
so once you have the amount of blossoms

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.590 
so once you have the amount of blossoms
you<00:03:22.830> want<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:23.280> on<00:03:23.520> your<00:03:23.700> branches<00:03:24.120> kind<00:03:24.480> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
you want like on your branches kind of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.300 
you want like on your branches kind of
take<00:03:24.990> a<00:03:25.020> look<00:03:25.170> at<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:26.010> think<00:03:26.160> it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
take a look at it if you think it's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.040 
take a look at it if you think it's
pretty<00:03:26.610> go<00:03:27.090> ahead<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.540> start<00:03:27.720> adding<00:03:28.020> your

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
pretty go ahead and start adding your

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.920 
pretty go ahead and start adding your
leaves<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.070> add<00:03:29.610> leaves<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.420> some<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.810> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
leaves so I add leaves to some of the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.330 
leaves so I add leaves to some of the
blossoms<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.890> kind<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.130> just

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
blossoms and then I kind of just

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.040 
blossoms and then I kind of just
sporadically<00:03:32.850> add<00:03:33.120> some<00:03:33.420> leaves<00:03:33.630> on

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.500 
sporadically add some leaves on
different<00:03:34.770> parts<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.190> branches<00:03:35.670> once

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
different parts of the branches once

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.180 
different parts of the branches once
again<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.990> kind<00:03:37.200> of<00:03:37.290> where<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> think<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
again just kind of where I think it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.540
