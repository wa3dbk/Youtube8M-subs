00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.220 
out is to just enhance akin he needs
more<00:03:07.630> if<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.900> want

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.060 

okay<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:13.620> kind<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.920> make<00:03:14.040> sure

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
okay and then just kind of make sure

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.670 
okay and then just kind of make sure
it's<00:03:14.370> tight<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.540> can<00:03:15.750> curl<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.290> bottom

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's tight and you can curl the bottom

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.250 
it's tight and you can curl the bottom
which<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.250> lot<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.580> people<00:03:17.670> usually<00:03:17.970> do<00:03:18.300> but<00:03:18.510> we

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
which a lot of people usually do but we

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.450 
which a lot of people usually do but we
thought<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.560> would<00:03:19.650> take<00:03:19.770> too<00:03:19.980> long<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.130> curl

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
thought it would take too long to curl

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.220 
thought it would take too long to curl
it<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.790> we're<00:03:20.940> just<00:03:20.970> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.270> leave<00:03:21.390> what<00:03:21.630> but

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it so we're just going to leave what but

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.540 
it so we're just going to leave what but
we<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> curl<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:24.020> okay<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:25.680> then<00:03:25.920> you're<00:03:26.460> on

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
we as a curl it okay so then you're on

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.290 
we as a curl it okay so then you're on
the<00:03:26.580> same<00:03:26.940> thing<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.570> other<00:03:27.920> side<00:03:28.920> take<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.220 

brushed<00:03:33.300> out<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.750> smooth<00:03:34.230> hold<00:03:34.920> on<00:03:35.750> goes<00:03:36.750> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
brushed out the smooth hold on goes and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.590 
brushed out the smooth hold on goes and
then<00:03:37.650> make<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:40.820> loop<00:03:43.040> look<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.970> hard<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.360> do<00:03:45.480> it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
then make a loop look it's hard to do it

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.380 
then make a loop look it's hard to do it
on<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.990> side<00:03:46.050> and<00:03:46.430> there<00:03:47.430> we<00:03:47.520> go<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.150> I'm

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
on one side and there we go so I'm

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.690 
on one side and there we go so I'm
holding<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.900> right<00:03:49.050> here<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.770> I'm<00:03:50.250> making<00:03:50.610> I'm

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
holding it right here and I'm making I'm

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.810 
holding it right here and I'm making I'm
going<00:03:51.240> under<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.870> making<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.290> loop<00:03:52.500> like<00:03:52.560> that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
going under and making a loop like that

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.810 
going under and making a loop like that
make<00:03:53.820> sure<00:03:53.850> they're<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.330> same<00:03:55.640> through<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
make sure they're the same through the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:08.060 
make sure they're the same through the
same<00:04:01.670> same<00:04:02.670> one<00:04:03.180> I<00:04:05.090> want<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.420> same<00:04:06.800> big<00:04:07.800> mint

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
same same one I want the same big mint

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.880 
same same one I want the same big mint
or<00:04:08.250> whatever<00:04:08.490> gets<00:04:09.420> inside<00:04:09.960> right<00:04:10.710> hand<00:04:11.430> side

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
or whatever gets inside right hand side

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.849 
or whatever gets inside right hand side
so<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.280> all<00:04:15.380> lucky<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.890> then<00:04:18.859> again

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
so that was all lucky and then again

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.430 
so that was all lucky and then again
make<00:04:20.130> sure<00:04:20.160> it's<00:04:20.430> tight<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.870> news<00:04:22.049> going

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
make sure it's tight and the news going

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.170 
make sure it's tight and the news going
to<00:04:22.500> hold<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.860> two<00:04:23.450> weapons<00:04:24.450> down<00:04:24.660> my<00:04:25.470> arm<00:04:25.680> away

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
to hold the two weapons down my arm away

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.570 
to hold the two weapons down my arm away
pull<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.300> down<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:27.480> then<00:04:29.990> push<00:04:30.990> it<00:04:31.200> out<00:04:31.580> but

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
pull it down and then push it out but

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.870 
pull it down and then push it out but
then<00:04:32.820> um<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:33.960> again<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:34.260> want<00:04:34.320> to<00:04:34.410> make<00:04:34.470> sure

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
then um so again you want to make sure

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.620 
then um so again you want to make sure
tie<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.360> night<00:04:36.780> fall<00:04:37.080> out<00:04:37.880> okay<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.180> then
