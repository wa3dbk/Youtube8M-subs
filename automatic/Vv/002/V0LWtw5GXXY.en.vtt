00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
 whether against water towers, they knew that there was much more water in France 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.639
 Coelho explains why this is so it is 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.240
 an important clue on the French map 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.910
 a blue dot with a blue circle through it is what the 2 1 am 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.970
 Turn right at the water tower 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.640
 or drive past the Graz Cathedral and they offer 300 meters to the right 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.060
 Abt says that has doors in the brain in France to the landscape as well 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.290
 Chapels like being crossed or castle to them 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.830
 For the French, there are even locksmiths 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.530
 For the hot year of Shatton moated castle is perhaps ten thousand 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.880
 there are some of it in the whole of France against ridiculous two to three thousand on 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.790
 German soil 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.639
 the Germans 

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:57.039
 Manon these did not build castle SAF they call themselves plain and simple 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.310
 lead a lot of water 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.820
 if you look closer 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.570
 prevents some German water so it is a connection 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 as many French moated castle do 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.910
 I give you 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.900
 but back to the origin of these buildings 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.910
 in France and in Germany they are given at the beginning of the nineteenth 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.729
 century 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310
 what did she substantiate? 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.860
 for many reasons 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 the increasing industrialization instead of stayed with us 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.879
 making water supply a big problem 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.969
 the rapid development of the industry 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.680
 from the agreed traffic with his thanks to achieve effect 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.940
 he claimed to have made in the name 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.759
 it seems 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.810
 "No hair in Germany a little earlier started to build the Satio 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.730
 than in France 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.759
 They are made of brick cylinders 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.890
 the reservoir 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 he is not visible from the outside 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.679
 and then when it just threatened on a list of steel struts 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.549
 bitter 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.479
 No no 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.249
 Children still believe that 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:04.800
 that the water tower feels directly from the rainwater 4 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.140
 the drinking water 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.190
 get the bargain is go 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.749
 in the reservoir 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.139
 they are closed daily f 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.330
 the water tower is higher than the customers 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.579
 enough if this principle of gravity house 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.149
 to create a constant pressure at the tap 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.119
 Basel strikers are technical marvels 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.709
 It was not easy to develop the Danish design 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.739
 Thumb water masses they had to bear to withstand 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.620
 first water towers 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.919
 the people still through refined architecture 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.040
 Early twentieth century 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.919
 However, no ride is the construction 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:45.260
 bit by bit 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.629
 relocate the Germans 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.189
 the reservoir then to the Elbe because the engineers are missing a system with 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.559
 where the water pressure at the customer remains constant 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.559
 without the water tower having to be higher 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.090
 France is almost covered by an EPS of water doors 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.230
 especially in the twentieth century 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.810
 as brick and metal are slowly being replaced by reinforced concrete 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.370
 The city searches sprout the huge crib on the ground 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.769
 and terribly sorry like the French countryside every ten years 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.889
 with a new style of construction 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.959
 there is no official typology or there are several 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.579
 one differentiates between the memory Beckmann and that creates 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.049
 There are three models of storage tanks 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.219
 against publisher cylinder Farmiga 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.809
 spherical 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.809
 The shafts have four models 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.639
 they may lie 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.449
 Against votes for 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.939
 becomes the bullish stems 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.500
 for a water zol 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.950
 If you need one creates a reservoir so every community can 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.140
 their creativity 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.769
 let free rein 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.169
 However, the most popular are the champagne corks 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.599
 logical and pushed in and the hourglass 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.950
 "Let Ernie, there are also engineers the signs of modernity 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.110
 Müller foolhardy and why want to create Beijing so flying saucer 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.070
 Late twentieth century 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.239
 then you go in France to the construction of Perth Paris 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.239
 although most of the water towers continue to be used 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.990
 after World War II it was a good thing 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.120
 iPad ugly to find these big board water towers 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:35.199
 in the countryside 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.780
 bit by bit 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.810
 therefore the French paint them with frescoes 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.260
 that should beautify the landscape 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.919
 with the 2 0 on 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.150
 should 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.770
 in Germany the water towers are considered meanwhile 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.249
 as untrue and monuments 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:51.740
 you have to say that 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.659
 that the Germans are a little trained in throwing at them 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.650
 since Bernd and Hilla Becher 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.409
 which they have ennobled in the sixties through their photographs 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.309
 when it is shut down 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.580
 when some converted into luxury hotels 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.159
 like this one in Hamburg 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.339
 others to tenement houses 

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.180
 others to museums i advise here in d 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.189
 others to the planetarium and so on 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.410
 if you feel like buying one 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.129
 some are negotiable 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.199
 300000 euros 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.159
 in France, too, there are converted water doors like this one here in Basel 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.259
 St flew out of which became a convention center 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.809
 or this input Anneliese so in the Brücker one because as you see one 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:40.409
 Great panorama Cadbury was 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.409
 but it supports that the French water towers with their closed Big 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:46.419
 Blue shafts 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.610
 hard to build and build 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.050
 therefore, the disused shaft and you often lead a dull and 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.590
 lonely existence 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.750
 if not simple
