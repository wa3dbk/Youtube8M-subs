00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
different FCS has a different basement

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.130 
different FCS has a different basement
future<00:00:23.880> these<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> future<00:00:24.539> fins<00:00:24.869> right

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
future these are the future fins right

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
future these are the future fins right
here<00:00:25.350> these<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> shortboard<00:00:26.369> fin<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.760> we

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
here these are the shortboard fin so we

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.029 
here these are the shortboard fin so we
put<00:00:27.029> them<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> stand<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> two<00:00:27.990> but<00:00:28.949> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
put them on the stand up to two but you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.999 
put them on the stand up to two but you
see<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> base<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.730> solid<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:30.990> FCS<00:00:31.590> has<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
see the base is solid and FCS has the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.030 
see the base is solid and FCS has the
one<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:33.050> two<00:00:34.050> stubs<00:00:34.380> coming<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.890> at<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
one with the two stubs coming out at the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.750 
one with the two stubs coming out at the
bottom<00:00:36.110> okay<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> screws<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> side

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
bottom okay I screws in from the side

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
bottom okay I screws in from the side
yes<00:00:39.030> yes<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.050> future<00:00:40.290> fame<00:00:40.620> demo

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
yes yes so this is the future fame demo

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.260 
yes yes so this is the future fame demo
Center<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.239> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Center and what you can do is you can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.979 
Center and what you can do is you can
take<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.230> any<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.590> fins<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.040> trying

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
take out any of these fins and trying

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
take out any of these fins and trying
most<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.140> those<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.469> side<00:00:46.950> biters<00:00:47.340> or

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
most of those look like side biters or

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
most of those look like side biters or
something<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> side<00:00:48.660> bite<00:00:48.870> so

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
something now they would be side bite so

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
something now they would be side bite so
these<00:00:49.140> are<00:00:49.289> short<00:00:49.500> board<00:00:49.739> fins<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.370> some

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
these are short board fins we have some

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
these are short board fins we have some
longboard<00:00:51.000> fins<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.539> demo<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
longboard fins you can demo so do you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.170 
longboard fins you can demo so do you
use<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> future<00:00:53.280> fins<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> stuff<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
use the future fins on the stuff you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.459 
use the future fins on the stuff you
just<00:00:54.210> change<00:00:54.840> them<00:00:54.899> out<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.289> side

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just change them out for your side

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
just change them out for your side
biters<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.070> you're<00:00:56.219> using<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.670> um<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
biters and then you're using a um a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.930 
biters and then you're using a um a
different<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.579> what<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
different kind of thing for what what is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
different kind of thing for what what is
but<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.600> still<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> thing<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
but there's still this kind of thing is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
but there's still this kind of thing is
still<00:01:02.100> yet<00:01:02.760> we're<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:03.870> one

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
still yet we're well the two first one

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200 
still yet we're well the two first one
you<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> big<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:04.949> center<00:01:05.250> these

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you have a big one in the center these

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.800 
you have a big one in the center these
on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> side<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.080> our<00:01:07.290> quads<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.830> used<00:01:08.040> suvs

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
on the side or in our quads we used suvs

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.880 
on the side or in our quads we used suvs
shortboard<00:01:09.810> things<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.200> our<00:01:10.320> quad<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
shortboard things in our quad do you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.289 
shortboard things in our quad do you
notice<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.220> big<00:01:11.340> difference<00:01:11.400> between<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
notice a big difference between the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.460 
notice a big difference between the
fiberglass<00:01:12.869> fins<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.310> plastic<00:01:14.520> ones

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
fiberglass fins and the plastic ones

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
fiberglass fins and the plastic ones
yeah<00:01:16.470> yeah<00:01:16.920> sorry<00:01:17.369> drastically<00:01:18.060> feels<00:01:18.360> better

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
yeah yeah sorry drastically feels better

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
yeah yeah sorry drastically feels better
more<00:01:18.869> high<00:01:18.990> performance<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.799> plastic<00:01:20.640> ones

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
more high performance that plastic ones

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
more high performance that plastic ones
are<00:01:20.939> little<00:01:21.180> flex<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.830> these<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
are little flex here these are the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.950 
are little flex here these are the
vector<00:01:23.400> tools<00:01:23.610> which<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.000> use<00:01:24.180> inside<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
vector tools which we use inside of the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.340 
vector tools which we use inside of the
stand-up<00:01:25.470> quads<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:27.810> can<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.049> those

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
stand-up quads so how can we use those

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
stand-up quads so how can we use those
ones<00:01:28.619> well<00:01:28.860> how<00:01:28.979> big<00:01:29.130> are<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
ones well how big are they these are I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
ones well how big are they these are I
think<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.680> four<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> half<00:01:32.299> but<00:01:33.299> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
think they're four and a half but you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.819 
think they're four and a half but you
notice<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.799> little

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
notice in the back there's a little

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.460 
notice in the back there's a little
curve<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.540> fan<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> gives<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.380> little

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
curve in the fan so it gives a little

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.540 
curve in the fan so it gives a little
more<00:01:37.820> squirt<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> turn

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.530 

so<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.300> we<00:01:44.390> use<00:01:44.540> these<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:46.270> on<00:01:47.270> our

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
so that we use these and then on our

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.290 
so that we use these and then on our
quads<00:01:48.490> I'll<00:01:49.490> just<00:01:49.640> go<00:01:49.790> through<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.090> quad

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
quads I'll just go through the quad

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.810 
quads I'll just go through the quad
first<00:01:50.630> okay<00:01:51.050> for<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.470> positive<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.490> is

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
first okay for the positive so this is

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.210 
first okay for the positive so this is
the<00:01:52.970> quad<00:01:53.180> set<00:01:53.480> of<00:01:53.600> what<00:01:53.720> we<00:01:53.840> usually<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.320> well

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
the quad set of what we usually do well

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.430 
the quad set of what we usually do well
these<00:01:55.310> are<00:01:55.490> special<00:01:55.550> made<00:01:56.000> fit<00:01:56.480> your<00:01:56.870> pre<00:01:57.320> made

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
these are special made fit your pre made

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.110 
these are special made fit your pre made
things<00:01:57.770> or<00:01:57.950> something<00:01:58.160> for<00:01:58.310> modi's<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
things or something for modi's this is a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.330 
things or something for modi's this is a
standard<00:01:59.480> actually<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.110> quad<00:02:00.530> set<00:02:00.800> but<00:02:01.130> they're

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
standard actually a quad set but they're

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.150 
standard actually a quad set but they're
a<00:02:01.370> little<00:02:01.520> bigger<00:02:01.820> Oh<00:02:02.620> work<00:02:03.620> on<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.830> stand<00:02:04.070> was

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
a little bigger Oh work on the stand was

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.500 
a little bigger Oh work on the stand was
pretty<00:02:04.370> good<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.700> put<00:02:04.880> these<00:02:05.090> two<00:02:05.300> in<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
pretty good so we put these two in the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.030 
pretty good so we put these two in the
front<00:02:05.690> end<00:02:05.930> used<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.230> in<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> background<00:02:06.860> I'll

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
front end used to in the background I'll

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.859 
front end used to in the background I'll
she<00:02:07.190> put<00:02:07.460> you<00:02:07.670> actually<00:02:08.000> put<00:02:08.180> bigger<00:02:08.570> things

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
she put you actually put bigger things

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.440 
she put you actually put bigger things
in<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.860> front<00:02:10.550> young<00:02:10.790> smaller<00:02:11.150> things<00:02:11.330> in

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
in the in front young smaller things in

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.540 
in the in front young smaller things in
the<00:02:11.540> bed<00:02:11.660> that's<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> whole<00:02:12.710> hard<00:02:12.950> idea<00:02:13.340> so

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
the bed that's the whole hard idea so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.060 
the bed that's the whole hard idea so
the<00:02:13.670> board<00:02:13.910> gets<00:02:14.780> more<00:02:15.080> positive<00:02:15.590> turn<00:02:15.770> out<00:02:15.950> on

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
the board gets more positive turn out on

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.030 
the board gets more positive turn out on
the<00:02:16.160> front<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.150> back<00:02:17.270> doesn't<00:02:17.920> make<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the front and the back doesn't make it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.970 
the front and the back doesn't make it
so<00:02:19.220> Sofia<00:02:19.820> mm-hmm<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.530> you're<00:02:21.680> writing<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
so Sofia mm-hmm is that you're writing a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.940 
so Sofia mm-hmm is that you're writing a
clot<00:02:22.160> yeah<00:02:23.500> what's<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.620> difference<00:02:24.740> between

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
clot yeah what's the difference between

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.670 
clot yeah what's the difference between
a<00:02:25.220> quad<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.700> then<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.030> three<00:02:26.450> fins<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.410> quad

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
a quad and then the three fins the quad

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
a quad and then the three fins the quad
is<00:02:27.860> faster<00:02:28.610> down<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.940> line<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:31.580> a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
is faster down the line it's it's a

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.890 
is faster down the line it's it's a
little<00:02:31.970> more<00:02:32.770> snappy<00:02:33.770> on<00:02:33.800> off<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.460> top<00:02:34.900> works

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
little more snappy on off the top works

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.500 
little more snappy on off the top works
really<00:02:36.080> good<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.440> stand<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.300> if

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
really good on a stand up and then if

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.330 
really good on a stand up and then if
the<00:02:38.960> waves<00:02:39.140> are<00:02:39.320> big<00:02:39.560> what<00:02:39.800> we<00:02:39.920> do<00:02:40.100> actually

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the waves are big what we do actually

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.250 
the waves are big what we do actually
make<00:02:40.760> them<00:02:40.880> five<00:02:41.240> scenes<00:02:41.540> or<00:02:41.720> stand<00:02:41.990> up<00:02:42.140> our

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
make them five scenes or stand up our

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.830 
make them five scenes or stand up our
custom<00:02:42.590> stand<00:02:42.860> up<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.880> 15<00:02:44.300> box<00:02:44.570> in<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
custom stand up in the 15 box in the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.150 
custom stand up in the 15 box in the
back<00:02:44.960> when<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.320> big<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.620> put<00:02:45.830> one<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> these

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
back when it's big we put one of these

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.390 
back when it's big we put one of these
trailers<00:02:46.640> in<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:48.470> have<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.830> does<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.310> make

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
trailers in so we have that does it make

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.460 
trailers in so we have that does it make
a<00:02:49.430> difference<00:02:49.670> yeah<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.900> helps<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.230> hold<00:02:51.350> a

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
a difference yeah it helps it hold a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.750 
a difference yeah it helps it hold a
little<00:02:51.530> better<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.040> we<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:54.760> those

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
little better so we have that those

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.880 
little better so we have that those
vectors<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.840> quad<00:02:57.050> set<00:02:57.350> up<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.709> put

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
vectors in the quad set up and we put

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.010 
vectors in the quad set up and we put
this<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> fifth<00:02:58.550> box<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.480> if<00:02:59.750> it<00:02:59.840> holds

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
this in the fifth box so if it holds

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.300 
this in the fifth box so if it holds
your<00:03:00.230> bed<00:03:00.350> doesn't<00:03:00.530> make<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.830> tail<00:03:01.010> kind<00:03:01.250> of

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
your bed doesn't make it a tail kind of

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.490 
your bed doesn't make it a tail kind of
um<00:03:01.489> stiff<00:03:01.970> yeah<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.540> makes<00:03:02.690> us<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:03.050> but<00:03:03.290> if<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
um stiff yeah it makes us do but if the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.590 
um stiff yeah it makes us do but if the
waves<00:03:03.680> are<00:03:03.830> bigger<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.640> open<00:03:04.940> oh<00:03:05.120> yeah

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
waves are bigger you can open oh yeah

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.229 
waves are bigger you can open oh yeah
we're<00:03:05.870> holding<00:03:06.200> fire<00:03:06.410> yuh-huh<00:03:06.880> but<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.030> is

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
we're holding fire yuh-huh but this is

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.060 
we're holding fire yuh-huh but this is
I'm<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.050> see<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.290> big<00:03:09.470> variety<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.920> your

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
I'm you can see the big variety of your

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.620 
I'm you can see the big variety of your

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
fins we have your walk on you got a lot

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.770 
fins we have your walk on you got a lot
of<00:03:11.660> things<00:03:11.840> yeah<00:03:13.030> which<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.270> most<00:03:14.360> popular

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
of things yeah which is the most popular

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
of things yeah which is the most popular
for<00:03:15.020> stand<00:03:15.320> ups<00:03:17.200> how<00:03:18.200> do<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.470> want<00:03:18.620> something

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
for stand ups how do you want something

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.560 
for stand ups how do you want something
like<00:03:19.040> this<00:03:19.220> we<00:03:19.520> put<00:03:19.760> in<00:03:19.850> because<00:03:19.970> most<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
like this we put in because most of the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.960 
like this we put in because most of the
stand-ups<00:03:21.050> are<00:03:21.200> either<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.860> +1<00:03:22.190> or<00:03:22.340> single<00:03:22.790> so

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
stand-ups are either to +1 or single so

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.750 
stand-ups are either to +1 or single so
we<00:03:23.120> be<00:03:23.480> stupas<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.020> we<00:03:24.110> put<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> smaller<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:25.730> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
we be stupas and we put a smaller like a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.930 
we be stupas and we put a smaller like a
smaller<00:03:26.209> what<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.410> like<00:03:27.590> 17<00:03:28.070> Phineas<00:03:28.670> we

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
smaller what is that like 17 Phineas we

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.600 
smaller what is that like 17 Phineas we
goes<00:03:29.150> between<00:03:29.510> seven<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.110> nine<00:03:30.350> for<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:31.400> main

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
goes between seven and nine for the main
