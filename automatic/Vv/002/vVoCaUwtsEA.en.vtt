America figure in it and then it took

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.970 
America figure in it and then it took
three<00:02:09.789> hours<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:10.119> melt<00:02:10.660> really<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.650> that<00:02:11.770> was<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
three hours to melt really so that was a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.380 
three hours to melt really so that was a
pretty<00:02:12.250> great<00:02:12.459> day<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.670> thought<00:02:12.850> I'd<00:02:12.970> milk<00:02:13.209> is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
pretty great day I thought I'd milk is

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
pretty great day I thought I'd milk is
like<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.410> hundred<00:02:14.680> degrees<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> was<00:02:15.489> in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
like a hundred degrees and I was in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.010 
like a hundred degrees and I was in
Missouri<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.209> was<00:02:16.300> still<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.660> 90<00:02:16.930> degrees

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
Missouri but it was still is 90 degrees

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.990 
Missouri but it was still is 90 degrees
there<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> thought<00:02:18.550> it'd<00:02:18.670> melt<00:02:18.820> pretty

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
there and so I thought it'd melt pretty

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.610 
there and so I thought it'd melt pretty
fast<00:02:19.239> but<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.570> took<00:02:19.690> about<00:02:19.870> three<00:02:20.200> hours<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
fast but it took about three hours the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.010 
fast but it took about three hours the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
giant ice ice block yeah took about

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.229 
giant ice ice block yeah took about
seven<00:02:23.200> hours<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.680> do<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.950> rest<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.489> a<00:02:24.820> lot
