that<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.299> don't<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> give<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:18.810> anything

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
that you don't have to give me anything

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.140 
that you don't have to give me anything
just<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.220> win<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.520> have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.820> give<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
just if you win i have to give you the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.940 
just if you win i have to give you the
card<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.659> pretty<00:01:21.780> simple<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.890> it'd

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
