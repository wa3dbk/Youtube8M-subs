there you go that's how technique I use
with<00:02:01.300> dandy<00:02:01.600> bread<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:01.960> chumming<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.830> water

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
with dandy bread on chumming the water

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.330 
with dandy bread on chumming the water
and<00:02:03.280> how<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.430> catch<00:02:03.670> carp<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:05.110> I'll<00:02:06.040> show<00:02:06.310> you

and how to catch carp now I'll show you
how<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:08.550> put<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.750> bread<00:02:10.750> on<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.020> hook

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.680 

basically<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.880> size<00:02:16.120> hook<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.540> would

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
basically this is a size hook you would

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.290 
basically this is a size hook you would
like<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.960> use<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.130> said<00:02:18.310> it's<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.610> probably

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
like to use like I said it's a probably

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.050 
like to use like I said it's a probably
like<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.450> size<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.800> looks<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.310> 1o

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like a size it looks like a 1o

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.810 
like a size it looks like a 1o
or<00:02:22.270> maybe<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> 6<00:02:23.640> ok<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.730> half<00:02:27.730> a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
or maybe like a 6 ok so you get half a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.610 
or maybe like a 6 ok so you get half a
piece<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.090> bread<00:02:29.910> right<00:02:30.910> here

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.990 

-<00:02:34.370> huh<00:02:35.230> see<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.560> about<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.190> about<00:02:37.370> right<00:02:37.760> so

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
- huh see this about this about right so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:50.690 
- huh see this about this about right so
you<00:02:38.630> grab<00:02:38.900> this

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.290 

this<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> hook<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.830> middle

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.040 

okay<00:02:57.340> also<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.550> gotta<00:02:58.700> use<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:59.060> light<00:02:59.780> line

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
okay also you gotta use a light line

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.890 
okay also you gotta use a light line
this<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.590> about<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.490> think<00:03:02.210> it's<00:03:02.360> like<00:03:02.450> 10<00:03:02.660> pound

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
this is about I think it's like 10 pound

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.410 
this is about I think it's like 10 pound
test<00:03:03.110> like<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.460> heavier<00:03:04.760> line<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.090> use<00:03:05.210> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
test like the heavier line you use the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.170 
test like the heavier line you use the
less<00:03:05.720> hit<00:03:05.990> you're<00:03:06.170> likely<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.530> get<00:03:06.770> so<00:03:07.760> go<00:03:08.030> with

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
less hit you're likely to get so go with

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.160 
less hit you're likely to get so go with
a<00:03:08.240> lighter<00:03:08.510> line<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.460> just<00:03:10.610> grab<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.880> and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
a lighter line so you just grab it and

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.920 
a lighter line so you just grab it and
you<00:03:12.170> fold<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.620> over<00:03:12.740> and<00:03:12.980> just<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:14.270> gently

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
you fold it over and just like gently

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.390 
you fold it over and just like gently
squeeze<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.440> because<00:03:15.740> if<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:15.920> squeeze<00:03:16.160> it<00:03:16.280> too

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
squeeze it because if you squeeze it too

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.120 
squeeze it because if you squeeze it too
hard<00:03:16.430> it'll<00:03:16.820> roll<00:03:17.120> up<00:03:17.270> into<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.540> ball<00:03:18.130> and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
hard it'll roll up into a ball and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.800 
hard it'll roll up into a ball and
they'll<00:03:19.280> sink<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:19.820> like<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.420> will<00:03:20.480> float

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
they'll sink so like this it will float

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.110 
they'll sink so like this it will float
so<00:03:21.740> you<00:03:21.830> see<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> hook<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.460> there<00:03:22.730> pretty

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
so you see the hook is in there pretty

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.000 
so you see the hook is in there pretty
well<00:03:23.210> hidden

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
well hidden

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.920 
well hidden
squeeze<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.190> softly<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:28.300> this<00:03:29.300> will<00:03:29.570> flow<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
squeeze it softly and this will flow I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.650 
squeeze it softly and this will flow I
think<00:03:30.440> I'd<00:03:30.530> use<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.830> little<00:03:31.480> little<00:03:32.480> bit<00:03:32.630> of

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
think I'd use a little little bit of

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.030 
think I'd use a little little bit of
bread<00:03:32.930> I<00:03:32.960> think<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.260> need<00:03:33.380> a<00:03:33.440> little<00:03:33.650> more<00:03:33.830> but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
bread I think I need a little more but

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.160 
bread I think I need a little more but
basically<00:03:34.880> that's<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.270> just<00:03:35.720> fold<00:03:35.960> it<00:03:36.080> over

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
basically that's it just fold it over

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.530 
basically that's it just fold it over
just<00:03:36.580> toss<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.730> out<00:03:37.850> there<00:03:38.060> leave<00:03:38.210> it<00:03:38.390> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
just toss it out there leave it and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.420 
just toss it out there leave it and
don't<00:03:38.720> come<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:38.990> get<00:03:39.140> in

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.959 

there<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> go<00:03:45.239> that's<00:03:45.659> how<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.969> hide

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:47.969 
there you go that's how you do it hide

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.149 
there you go that's how you do it hide
the<00:03:48.090> hook<00:03:48.269> very<00:03:48.480> well<00:03:48.689> just<00:03:49.650> toss<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.069> out

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
the hook very well just toss it out

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.229 
the hook very well just toss it out
there<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:52.140> I'm<00:03:53.099> gonna<00:03:53.310> go<00:03:53.700> ahead<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.969> toss<00:03:54.090> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
there now I'm gonna go ahead and toss it

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.369 
there now I'm gonna go ahead and toss it
out<00:03:54.329> there<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.629> see<00:03:54.750> what<00:03:54.900> happens

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
out there and see what happens

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.989 
out there and see what happens
if<00:03:56.189> I<00:03:56.370> catch<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.670> carp<00:03:57.120> I'll<00:03:57.450> get<00:03:57.629> back<00:03:57.750> on
