in this section I want to talk about
clickers<00:00:09.800> clickers<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.830> clicker<00:00:11.190> training

clickers clickers and clicker training

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.470 
clickers clickers and clicker training
maybe<00:00:11.730> you've<00:00:11.880> heard<00:00:11.969> about<00:00:12.120> clicker

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
maybe you've heard about clicker

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.629 
maybe you've heard about clicker
training<00:00:12.660> maybe<00:00:13.019> part<00:00:13.320> about<00:00:13.440> clickers<00:00:13.860> maybe

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
training maybe part about clickers maybe

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.670 
training maybe part about clickers maybe
a<00:00:14.730> little<00:00:14.790> confused<00:00:15.389> about<00:00:15.540> clickers<00:00:15.990> so<00:00:16.529> all

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
a little confused about clickers so all

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380 
a little confused about clickers so all
I<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.010> want<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> teach<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.090> them

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
I do is I want to teach you about them
and<00:00:18.600> then<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.960> show<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.230> how<00:00:19.560> to

and then I'm going to show you how to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.550 
and then I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.189> clicker<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.240> teach<00:00:21.930> your<00:00:22.140> dog<00:00:22.289> for

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
use a clicker to teach your dog for

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.480 
use a clicker to teach your dog for
house<00:00:22.710> training<00:00:23.119> so<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.330> clicker<00:00:25.340> it's<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
house training so a clicker it's just

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.509 
house training so a clicker it's just
basically<00:00:27.470> this<00:00:28.470> little<00:00:28.800> box<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.310> get

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
basically this little box that you get

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.790 
basically this little box that you get
with<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.820> games<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.300> were<00:00:30.420> kidding<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.900> what

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
with some games we were kidding and what

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.080 
with some games we were kidding and what
you're<00:00:31.949> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.700> you're<00:00:32.910> going<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.229 
you're going to do is you're going to
pair<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.380> sound<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> clicker<00:00:35.239> with

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
pair the sound of the clicker with

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.959 
pair the sound of the clicker with
something<00:00:36.540> positive<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.440> tree<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.520> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
something positive like a tree so the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.810 
something positive like a tree so the
clicker<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> beginning<00:00:40.440> has<00:00:41.100> absolutely

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
clicker in the beginning has absolutely

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.619 
clicker in the beginning has absolutely
no<00:00:42.149> value<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.350> dog<00:00:43.559> nothing<00:00:44.280> none<00:00:44.700> dr.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
no value to your dog nothing none dr.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.750 
no value to your dog nothing none dr.
care<00:00:45.840> less<00:00:45.989> about<00:00:46.020> sound<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:47.219> once<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.520> start

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
care less about sound but once you start

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.810 
care less about sound but once you start
to<00:00:47.820> pair<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.629> something<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> tree

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to pair it with something like a tree

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
to pair it with something like a tree
now<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> starts<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> take<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.649> value<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
now it starts to take on some value so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.680 
now it starts to take on some value so
you're<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.789> start<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.149> tree<00:00:55.340> tree<00:00:56.340> tree<00:00:57.270> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you're gonna start to tree tree tree you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000 
you're gonna start to tree tree tree you
can<00:00:57.780> do<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> over<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.469> over<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.859> you

was<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.409> beginning<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.820> classical

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
was the beginning of classical

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.160 
was the beginning of classical
conditioning<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.750> now<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:00.899> his

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
conditioning but we now know his

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.510 
conditioning but we now know his
classical<00:02:01.560> conditioning<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.310> what

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
classical conditioning and that's what

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.480 
classical conditioning and that's what
you<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:03.000> clicker<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.049> as<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.920> classically

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you use clicker for as you classically

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540 
you use clicker for as you classically
conditioned<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.390> dog<00:02:07.009> you're<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> click<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
conditioned the dog you're the click and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.180 
conditioned the dog you're the click and
think<00:02:09.209> oh<00:02:09.420> good<00:02:10.170> stuff<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.590> happening<00:02:10.770> good

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
think oh good stuff is happening good

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.690 
think oh good stuff is happening good
things<00:02:11.400> are<00:02:11.459> going

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
things are going

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.089 
things are going
happen<00:02:11.970> okay<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:13.110> once<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.530> classically

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
happen okay so once it's classically

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.550 
happen okay so once it's classically
conditioned<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:15.120> you're<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> do<00:02:15.660> call

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
conditioned then you're going to do call

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.290 
conditioned then you're going to do call
operant<00:02:17.069> conditioning<00:02:17.129> you're<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.239> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
operant conditioning you're going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.740 
operant conditioning you're going to
start<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.569> use<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.560> shape<00:02:19.970> behaviors<00:02:20.970> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
start to use it to shape behaviors is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.190 
start to use it to shape behaviors is
where<00:02:22.019> BF<00:02:22.290> Skinner<00:02:22.590> comes<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:24.200> operant

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
where BF Skinner comes in and operant

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.589 
where BF Skinner comes in and operant
conditioning<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:26.040> basically<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.060> operator

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
conditioning is basically the operator

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.839 
conditioning is basically the operator
which<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:29.040> conditioning<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
which is you it's conditioning the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.150 
which is you it's conditioning the
subject<00:02:30.269> which<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.599> your<00:02:30.780> dog<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.800> you're

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
subject which is your dog so you're

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.860 
subject which is your dog so you're
going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.310> start<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.670> use<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.970> clicker<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
going to start to use the clicker the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.890 
going to start to use the clicker the
teacher<00:02:34.140> dog<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:35.160> outside<00:02:35.599> alright<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:36.870> again

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
teacher dog go outside alright so again

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.600 
teacher dog go outside alright so again
you<00:02:37.470> have<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.709> go<00:02:37.830> back<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.160> your<00:02:38.250> management

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
you have to go back to your management

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.650 
you have to go back to your management
skills<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.180> make<00:02:39.299> sure<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.569> your

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
skills you have to make sure that your

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.150 
skills you have to make sure that your
dog<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.080> crate<00:02:40.290> keep<00:02:40.680> an<00:02:40.799> eye<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:40.950> them

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
dog is in a crate keep an eye on them

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.070 
dog is in a crate keep an eye on them
but<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:41.910> when<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.209> get<00:02:42.299> them<00:02:42.450> outside<00:02:42.540> you

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
but now when you get them outside you

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.680 
but now when you get them outside you
have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.620> communication<00:02:44.549> tool<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
have a communication tool that is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.390 
have a communication tool that is
excellent<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.380> dog<00:02:46.769> training<00:02:47.190> really

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
excellent because dog training really

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.970 
excellent because dog training really
comes<00:02:47.700> down<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.940> timing<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.829> times

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
comes down to timing and a lot of times

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
comes down to timing and a lot of times
our<00:02:50.130> timing<00:02:50.730> if<00:02:50.849> it's<00:02:51.000> off<00:02:51.180> even<00:02:51.690> by<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.840> couple

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
our timing if it's off even by a couple

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.500 
our timing if it's off even by a couple
of<00:02:52.380> seconds<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.519> dog<00:02:53.760> doesn't<00:02:54.180> quite

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
of seconds the dog doesn't quite

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.940 
of seconds the dog doesn't quite
understand<00:02:55.110> what<00:02:55.319> are<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.470> trying<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.799> get<00:02:55.890> me

to do here okay and that's what happens
with<00:02:58.349> house<00:02:58.530> training<00:02:58.829> as<00:02:59.040> we<00:02:59.459> discussed<00:02:59.819> in

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
with house training as we discussed in

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.520 
with house training as we discussed in
other<00:03:00.060> parts<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.750> dog<00:03:00.959> starts<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.349> pee<00:03:01.500> and

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
the second they're done you reach in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
the second they're done you reach in
your<00:03:09.720> pocket<00:03:09.810> pull<00:03:10.380> out<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> treat<00:03:10.829> break<00:03:11.099> it<00:03:11.250> in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
your pocket pull out a treat break it in

your pocket pull out a treat break it in
half<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.790> give<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.120> dog<00:03:12.299> even<00:03:12.959> though

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
half and give it to your dog even though

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.870 
half and give it to your dog even though
it's<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.260> only<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.560> couple<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.950> seconds<00:03:14.370> that's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's the only a couple of seconds that's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's the only a couple of seconds that's
still<00:03:15.209> enough<00:03:15.900> time<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.620> go<00:03:17.040> by<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.880> not<00:03:18.090> get

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
still enough time to go by to not get

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.770 
still enough time to go by to not get
the<00:03:19.100> communication<00:03:20.100> clearly<00:03:20.670> across<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.630> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
the communication clearly across to the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.280 
the communication clearly across to the
dog<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:23.370> clicker<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:24.480> speeds<00:03:24.900> up<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.170> whole

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
dog the clicker this speeds up the whole

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.990 
dog the clicker this speeds up the whole
process<00:03:25.560> because<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.130> second<00:03:26.730> your<00:03:26.850> dog

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
process because the second your dog

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.580 
process because the second your dog
knows<00:03:27.269> something<00:03:27.660> that<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.930> want<00:03:28.139> them<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.350> do

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
knows something that you want them to do

knows something that you want them to do
you<00:03:29.549> click<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.239> let<00:03:30.480> them<00:03:30.510> know<00:03:30.690> you're

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
you click and you let them know you're

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.990 
you click and you let them know you're
communicating<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.769> them<00:03:31.889> it's<00:03:32.220> that's<00:03:32.549> that's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
communicating to them it's that's that's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.660 
communicating to them it's that's that's
exactly<00:03:33.569> what<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> want<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.319> do<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.340> now

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
you give them the treat you know the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.059 
you give them the treat you know the
tree<00:03:36.989> comes<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.260> few<00:03:37.440> seconds<00:03:37.739> later<00:03:37.920> you

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069
