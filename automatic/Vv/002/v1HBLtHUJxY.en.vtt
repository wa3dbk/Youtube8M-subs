00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
hit the like button so basically I was

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.850 
hit the like button so basically I was
thinking<00:00:34.540> of<00:00:34.720> doing<00:00:34.870> comparisons<00:00:35.650> between

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
thinking of doing comparisons between

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
thinking of doing comparisons between
the<00:00:36.130> different<00:00:36.610> Cintiq<00:00:37.000> tablets<00:00:37.480> or<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the different Cintiq tablets or the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.890 
the different Cintiq tablets or the
software<00:00:41.230> version<00:00:42.120> 4<00:00:43.120> &amp;<00:00:43.360> 5<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:49.000> a<00:00:49.390> little<00:00:49.780> bit

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
software version 4 &amp; 5 so a little bit

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.150 
software version 4 &amp; 5 so a little bit
about<00:00:50.140> how<00:00:50.530> I<00:00:50.559> work<00:00:51.480> basically<00:00:52.480> I<00:00:52.780> always<00:00:53.320> have

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
about how I work basically I always have

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.119 
about how I work basically I always have
two<00:00:54.460> words<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.750> dial<00:00:55.989> up<00:00:56.140> first<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.769> then<00:00:56.980> the

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
two words to dial up first and then the

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.100 
two words to dial up first and then the
panels<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.019> have<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.350> sketch<00:01:01.110> sketch

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
panels then I have the sketch sketch

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.100 
panels then I have the sketch sketch
layer<00:01:02.409> so<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.040> this<00:01:03.190> new<00:01:03.430> version<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:04.720> panels

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
layer so in this new version the panels

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.210 
layer so in this new version the panels
work<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.470> bit<00:01:05.590> differently<00:01:06.100> from<00:01:06.720> ex4<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.740> over

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
work a bit differently from ex4 so over

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.910 
work a bit differently from ex4 so over
here<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.520> am<00:01:09.790> trying<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.840> fill<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.740> up<00:01:11.860> with

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
here I am trying to fill it up with

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.469 
here I am trying to fill it up with
white<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:13.170> wanted<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.290> avoid<00:01:14.409> working<00:01:14.920> with

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
white I wanted to avoid working with

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:25.649 
white I wanted to avoid working with
multiple<00:01:16.479> layers<00:01:18.180> masks<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.610> here<00:01:25.060> I<00:01:25.090> use

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
multiple layers masks so here I use

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.420 
multiple layers masks so here I use
mainly<00:01:26.110> Naji<00:01:26.620> pan<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:28.299> do<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> outline<00:01:28.719> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mainly Naji pan to do the outline and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.889 
mainly Naji pan to do the outline and
