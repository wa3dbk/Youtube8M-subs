00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:04.899
 but it happened to record on video 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.760
 as you use the tablet 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:12.259
 to the icon for 500 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.139
 over android 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.139
 that's what I can say hard 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.460
 in comparison with the past 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.789
 itar tass 101 model was also 10 inches 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.319
 difference of course trial bristle subpoena 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.569
 i.e 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.340
 this tablet from 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.510
 and even gray of course 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.580
 all good but 750 grams and how much he hangs 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.040
 hold in my hand sometimes start already turned out 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.390
 heavy 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.180
 her input 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.680
 That of course was 450 grams much easier and 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.520
 Well, like 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.960
 more wear it was comfortable then of these here 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.850
 traveled by subway 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 and 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 for best debut 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.810
 although cruise was banned as it were called 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.250
 must absorb 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.980
 only in the capital but in 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.540
 tablet volume was pretty high 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.870
 and the sound at least in the movies he was no longer 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.270
 so sweet 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.320
 the volume margin is sufficient 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.850
 there is a metro ret as cut 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.850
 and sometimes even had to turn down 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.690
 that is why 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.450
 if good headphones for example 100 meters 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.410
 it is quite possible to listen 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.910
 Here is such a screen saver 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.030
 Desktop 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 i.e. active 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 budget 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.010
 budget by mail a year 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.970
 m 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.140
 Smirnov 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 note taking program 3 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.020
 Wings site favorite calendar 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.020
 fifth victim of the year watch 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.920
 I put this program here 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 and esquire 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.100
 because the standard native 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.000
 17 18 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.099
 twice astana 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.309
 that's focused 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.629
 n the standard program is 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.389
 very small window not for 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.589
 tablet she 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.589
 program 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.819
 It seems to me the most convenient 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.939
 for the tablet because it is made 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.719
 specifically for the third android and 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.189
 here for example 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.419
 messages that is how was mention where 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.609
 elected that is 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.189
 everything is very convenient 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.719
 in this plan 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.759
 Here again, such a moment 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.759
 what 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.119
 connects to TV through 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.509
 driven adapters 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:52.749
 expected 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.939
 no problem and please we see 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.740
 same picture 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.379
 March is extremely TV 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.569
 that is, here we have a tablet 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.889
 which show this picture the same 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:05.809
 the most 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.799
 turns on the TV 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.469
 here with this tablet 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.619
 does not turn off the layers picture 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.299
 that is, if you click on the disconnect button 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.659
 the crane just went out in the morning 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.659
 so included here studied here 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.259
 unlock screen 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.879
 but if there 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.599
 in fact one to one in quality 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.769
 very good 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.399
 expected 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:40.179
 very high quality this hysteria everyone is looking for 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.489
 most likely through the Crimea 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.459
 no questions in this regard we are very 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 love 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.260
 made up glory 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.509
 last thing updated 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.249
 in the program 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.609
 this button is the exit to the desktop 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.819
 that is, since there are no mechanical buttons 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.499
 tons 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.189
 this button is back 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.639
 on the table 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.499
 idea last launched 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.409
 applications that you can immediately there 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.369
 choose that is here for example 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:11.469
 in the browser 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 open site 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.739
 that is, the browser account via bp is connected all 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.739
 it works quite quickly peak 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.340
 there is no problem 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:30.840
 it turned again 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.479
 I'm afraid of the book program 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.729
 what did not like the train program 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.840
 what is she not for 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.879
 tablet that is she 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.770
 whatever simplified years 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.370
 for 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.289
 that you yourself to whom 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.349
 for a regular phone screen i.e. 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:50.719
 tablets it all looks pretty 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.039
 boring primitive as labor 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.749
 pustovato 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.749
 so 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.300
 let's say we have to wait for another version 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.249
 most likely that will be exactly under 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:08.349
 tablet already 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.349
 VKontakte application 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.379
 workers, that is, here's a new TEC
