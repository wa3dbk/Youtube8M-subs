00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 so and welcome to follow back 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.560
 number two follow poqué tenants and 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.599
 Today I have chosen only my topic 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 Everybody was there as a little child 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.410
 the first generation has played 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 asked why is it like that today 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.449
 why it was wise before his 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.119
 mega development with above all no 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 now with the dragon 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.080
 nowak he has two sixth generation 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.210
 mega developments get one of which 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.849
 escape and stay fire or others yes 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.470
 dragon fire but I am busy 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.170
 today times why was wise 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.940
 actually the generation before that no 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 dragon type 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.250
 although he looks more like a dragon 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.540
 as some other pokémon and there are 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 a few little things that are 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.030
 actually quite clearly why wise 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 kite and that is the most important thing 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.480
 just balancing for yourself 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.109
 know kite types have always been 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.820
 pretty much as the strongest meet 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.989
 So the strongest pokémon seen because 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.150
 the kite club too pretty 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.799
 strong what is the meaning wemmer of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.360
 november at a pokémon game begins 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.850
 you actually have the choice between the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.860
 fire pokémon in the water pokémon one 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.299
 plant pokémon but deal with us 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.130
 with the first generation 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.600
 and there was a pokemon yellow, too 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.810
 still the electro type with pikachu 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.700
 got diamonds what was the point 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.979
 from dragon pokémon dragon pokémon 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.590
 Should be the strongest pokemon in the game 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.630
 represent 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.860
 that means strong pokemon should too 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.750
 To be rare that is called the kite 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.799
 pokémon subscribed here for free 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:43.200
 Koran were extremely rare extremely extreme 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.869
 rare in lhasa fari zone or man 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 Had to shit a lot of money in the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.960
 buy game hall 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.880
 that means it was extremely heavy in the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.610
 to get on and especially until he almost 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.829
 from the end of the game 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.130
 there you have reached the dragon pokémon 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.290
 should be the challenge 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.939
 would wise up or you would have them 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.670
 later become a pluradent encounter 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.750
 been a kite type 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.759
 On the one hand, that would be fun 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.030
 taken out that the kite type so 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.450
 It's just rare to get it 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.040
 so that he was in the mind when you 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.930
 so makes a strong page guy and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.760
 then as a starter same kite 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 he does not get that cool somehow 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.750
 and especially jurack was with it 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 actually even more exaggerated of the two 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.410
 been reported among the states 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.160
 Water Dragon resistance plant brought 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.980
 ristic elektro jurack would have almost everyone 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.440
 others start hybris and who is to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.470
 still very effective against plant 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.760
 and had been with the kite 300 good 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.540
 Dragon boat also water neutral 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.450
 met 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.300
 that is to say simply in the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.220
 first generation no kite type 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.720
 because it's just a lot on the one hand 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.030
 been to europe 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.970
 Everyone would be right the first time 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.319
 Law completely through and just 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.050
 everything perfect yes I'm just two words 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.480
 and that's why it just went crazy 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.879
 balancing wanted the game about 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.750
 balanced is clear there were the things 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.370
 with in superstructured psycho types but that 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.690
 has , among other things, the second 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.599
 generation changed with the and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.670
 Glazing in steel types statistics 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.959
 psycho and on and i had that 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.659
 No action is needed and not yet 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.940
 very effective against psycho pokémon though 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.260
 would have jurack in the first generation 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 get the kite type 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.879
 it would have been too overpriced 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.180
 been too strong about that and the 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.739
 complete mind the dragon pokémon 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.849
 that they are rare we are also lucky 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:53.250
 been just idiotic at all 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.680
 and that's pretty good, of course 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.349
 my guess there was never one 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.150
 Confirmation of game freak because of that 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.069
 which would just interest me 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.349
 you think that sounds logical because 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.400
 in my opinion, I just have a lot 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.689
 had been too overboard and wanted game 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.010
 The game is not just freaking out 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.480
 to interpret that you just pure 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.230
 decreases and thus complete play 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.769
 going through 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.820
 because there were also 150 others 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.109
 could play pokémon and that's why 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.180
 Just wanted the kites 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.520
 the guy only gets towards the end that is 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.460
 also the reason why wear now 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.020
 developed on a 55 so you drago 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.310
 ran maybe for the top 4 can use 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.720
 and then in the game and not so early 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.000
 So strong pokémon gets and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.370
 that's why jurack only got through his 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.160
 mega development to the mega clorox the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.460
 dragon types on the one hand so the pity 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.050
 On the other hand , it was cool too 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.660
 it was already the second episode 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.970
 by poker myth I am currently 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.770
 So, what could I do? 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.940
 thinks about concepts for series 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.199
 which I do I have in mind 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.780
 secure pocket reader 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.500
 Maybe I'll play let's play 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.610
 start 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.180
 I have a really funny one 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.820
 idea but since it would then have to so 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.430
 I'll pick it up at the weekend 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.770
 enough videos for the week have so 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.750
 I'll see if I have an idea 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.460
 as I said poke myth and phuket 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.900
 if you do not have what I should do 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.460
 is also top ten lists 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.200
 Do not worry, I already have those too 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.320
 First I'm writing and writing 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.710
 so today I would say I have the 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.710
 next time
