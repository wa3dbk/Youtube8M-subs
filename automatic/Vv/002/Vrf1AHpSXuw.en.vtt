00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
all that stuff and I remember thinking

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490 
all that stuff and I remember thinking
what<00:02:01.060> was<00:02:01.210> he<00:02:01.360> thinking<00:02:01.390> during<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.110> time<00:02:02.320> I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
what was he thinking during that time I

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.490 
what was he thinking during that time I
mean<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.830> would<00:02:02.950> have<00:02:02.979> been<00:02:03.070> done<00:02:03.340> by<00:02:03.400> them<00:02:04.500> but

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
mean I would have been done by them but

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.109 
mean I would have been done by them but
I'm<00:02:05.650> sure<00:02:06.009> something<00:02:06.430> was<00:02:06.640> telling<00:02:06.790> me<00:02:06.910> he<00:02:07.090> was

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
I'm sure something was telling me he was

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.389 
I'm sure something was telling me he was
thinking<00:02:07.540> about<00:02:07.600> that<00:02:07.930> vision<00:02:08.140> my<00:02:08.920> small
