00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:31.740

 very good armor so shoot 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 to your head but now it's your turn today 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.670
 Kapets, I welcome everyone. I hope you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.199
 liked my new idea in style 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 lord of the rings and in general I expect 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.120
 still shoot a couple of cartoons on the same 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.780
 I am making some funny themes 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.740
 situations that could be taken from 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.520
 film and here are 5 do with humor 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 In general, I'm sorry for so long I honestly 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.840
 say lately not very much 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.330
 line but honestly I did not forget 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.759
 channel and therefore in contact 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.650
 but surely everyone heard about VKontakte and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.630
 on this very last heard about 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.759
 in contact with 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 In general, I created a group there about 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.770
 league that is 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.460
 discussion of competition that is all Voting 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.570
 so I will leave a link to this group 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.180
 below in the description and in the general sense of this 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.799
 groups I have already told you but the most 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.079
 the main point is that when you 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:56.729
 sign up you can ask in person 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.920
 I have and generally see in the group when I 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.110
 I post new cartoons 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.759
 that is, in this group I will write 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.220
 the release of a new cartoon to let you know 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.400
 when to go to youtube on my channel 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.879
 that is, I understand how uncomfortable 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.590
 you don't know when you come in and out 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.680
 there is nothing new 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.470
 that's the point of this group and of course 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.420
 as I said at the beginning only coordination 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.319
 Well, in general a cool group for those who 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.069
 likes the league hopefully subscribe because 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:42.000
 that people still need to type well 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:44.420
 in general, okay, I can show you exactly 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 what I was shooting 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:59.790
 Yes, it is now so better, but I did not see 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.400
 on the display as you can see okay too 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.250
 I will not show much 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.909
 Iâ€™ll do this review later 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.579
 seen now there are already three sets that is 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.129
 when I bought it I immediately counted 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.709
 what I gather from this healthy castle 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.430
 in fact this is not one for three integers 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.889
 three sets that is, there is provided so 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.069
 that you collect these three sets and of them 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.620
 completely you can like healthy parts 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.690
 of the castle to collect one healthy castle and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.530
 I had a total of almost 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.099
 a copy of the second part of the lord of the rings two 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.829
 towers 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.310
 Well, in general, okay, I'm already very long here 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.859
 I speak 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.299
 cartoon is less turned out well in general 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.879
 i really just wanted 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.919
 warn about the band and about 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.349
 to make cartoons start shooting again 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:55.769
 said wrong if being shot means 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.030
 they themselves are shot then better so i 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.050
 started shooting cartoons again 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.420
 and the school started walking again so that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:08.590
 Okay it does not matter in my time not all the same 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:12.060
 will be enough well in general kin with you 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.580
 see time soon see you later 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 Well, again, the third time I remind you about the group 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.200
 because for me it is really 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.919
 it is very important how you respond that is 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:28.570
 if there are quite a few in the group 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.750
 subscribers, I understand that you have responded 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:36.850

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.310
 it will be more convenient to everyone I will constantly be you 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.640
 notify about new cartoons that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.590
 I just downloaded and you immediately 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:48.520
 can go and see do not waste 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.300
 Well, actually my time here I'm still 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:55.120
 very long washing talk but me 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.550
 now I have an incentive to shoot cartoons 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.450
 constantly talk okay no kidding 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.229

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.840

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.530
 viewing thanks for the cartoon thanks for that 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.770
 stay with me i saw that pretty 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:19.000
 much has been described but now 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:23.320
 on the contrary even the subscribers took off so 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:27.820
 i'm glad but hope after that my 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.750

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.550

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.590
 so to speak fresh streams such as 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.860

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.950
