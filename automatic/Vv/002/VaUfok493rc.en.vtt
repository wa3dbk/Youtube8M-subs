00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.520 

and<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.760> that's<00:04:49.940> how<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> turned<00:04:50.450> on<00:04:50.690> allow<00:04:51.290> an

don't want them making purchases without
your<00:04:58.190> knowledge<00:04:59.050> but<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.230> is<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.620> way<00:05:00.770> to

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
your knowledge but this is one way to

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:12.460 
your knowledge but this is one way to
get<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.520> in-app<00:05:02.090> purchasing<00:05:02.690> off<00:05:11.470> and

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.080 
get the in-app purchasing off and
there's<00:05:12.680> also<00:05:12.860> another<00:05:13.280> setting<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:15.080> here<00:05:15.140> and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
there's also another setting in here and

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.610 
there's also another setting in here and
if<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.270> look<00:05:17.450> under<00:05:17.750> parental<00:05:18.050> controls

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
if you look under parental controls

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.810 
if you look under parental controls
right<00:05:19.340> now<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.550> have<00:05:19.850> them<00:05:20.000> enabled<00:05:21.730> when<00:05:22.730> you

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
right now I have them enabled when you

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.730 
right now I have them enabled when you
enable<00:05:23.030> this<00:05:23.360> it<00:05:23.630> locks<00:05:23.900> it<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.230> basically

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
enable this it locks it and basically

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.620 
enable this it locks it and basically
brings<00:05:25.010> up<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.280> notification<00:05:25.550> so<00:05:26.180> if<00:05:26.240> they<00:05:26.360> try

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
brings up a notification so if they try

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.170 
brings up a notification so if they try

there will be other apps like that right

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.190 
there will be other apps like that right
now<00:06:04.580> I've<00:06:04.850> quite<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.150> bit<00:06:05.330> of<00:06:05.420> stuff<00:06:05.690> running

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
now I've quite a bit of stuff running

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.610 
now I've quite a bit of stuff running
this<00:06:06.830> is<00:06:07.070> another<00:06:07.430> thing<00:06:07.670> you<00:06:07.790> need<00:06:08.000> to<00:06:08.030> do<00:06:08.330> is

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
this is another thing you need to do is

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.250 
this is another thing you need to do is
your<00:06:09.620> kids<00:06:09.860> will<00:06:10.040> constantly<00:06:10.600> open<00:06:11.600> apps<00:06:11.840> and

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
your kids will constantly open apps and

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.380 
your kids will constantly open apps and
you'll<00:06:12.740> think<00:06:13.010> they're<00:06:13.190> not<00:06:13.310> running<00:06:13.610> but

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
you'll think they're not running but

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.340 
you'll think they're not running but
they're<00:06:14.540> actually<00:06:14.660> running<00:06:14.990> in<00:06:15.260> the

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
they're actually running in the

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.470 
they're actually running in the
background<00:06:15.560> so<00:06:16.490> what<00:06:16.610> you<00:06:16.760> need<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.000> do<00:06:17.150> is<00:06:17.330> go

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
background so what you need to do is go

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.570 
background so what you need to do is go
to<00:06:17.540> your<00:06:17.690> two<00:06:17.900> rectangles<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:19.130> close<00:06:19.400> them

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
to your two rectangles and close them

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.520 
to your two rectangles and close them
down<00:06:19.730> and<00:06:20.000> this<00:06:20.570> is<00:06:20.780> what<00:06:20.930> actually<00:06:21.080> causes

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
down and this is what actually causes

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.750 
down and this is what actually causes
the<00:06:21.800> freezing<00:06:22.550> to<00:06:23.540> occur<00:06:24.520> because<00:06:25.520> you<00:06:25.640> have

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
the freezing to occur because you have

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.840 
the freezing to occur because you have
too<00:06:25.910> many<00:06:26.000> optioning<00:06:26.600> in<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.810> background

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
too many optioning in the background

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.310 
too many optioning in the background
it's<00:06:28.850> also<00:06:29.030> gonna<00:06:29.300> slow<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:29.780> tablet<00:06:30.170> down

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
it's also gonna slow the tablet down

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.450 
it's also gonna slow the tablet down
significantly<00:06:32.620> so<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:33.830> is<00:06:33.980> Angry<00:06:34.250> Birds

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
significantly so this is Angry Birds

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.850 
significantly so this is Angry Birds
Star<00:06:34.700> Wars<00:06:34.760> -<00:06:35.240> and<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:36.200> just<00:06:36.380> want<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.650> show<00:06:36.800> you

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 
that they cannot make purchases if you

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:49.960 
that they cannot make purchases if you
set<00:06:39.770> it<00:06:39.800> up<00:06:39.980> the<00:06:40.100> way<00:06:40.220> I<00:06:40.250> just<00:06:40.340> showed<00:06:40.610> you

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:49.970 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.570

so when you're on a board you can make

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.400 
so when you're on a board you can make
purchases<00:06:53.850> from<00:06:54.330> this<00:06:54.480> little<00:06:54.750> shopping<00:06:55.020> cart

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
not saying it's 100% gonna work but it

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.990 
not saying it's 100% gonna work but it
should<00:07:24.560> you<00:07:25.560> can<00:07:25.680> see<00:07:25.860> right<00:07:26.070> there<00:07:26.100> it<00:07:26.820> went

ahead and denied the the in-app purchase

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.240 
ahead and denied the the in-app purchase

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
so they were not able to buy anything

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.340 
so they were not able to buy anything
now<00:07:33.000> if<00:07:33.180> you<00:07:33.330> were<00:07:33.480> gonna<00:07:33.630> let<00:07:33.840> them<00:07:34.020> get<00:07:34.140> some

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.870 
now if you were gonna let them get some
coins<00:07:34.560> or<00:07:34.830> something<00:07:35.190> you<00:07:35.340> could<00:07:35.550> have<00:07:35.670> hit

coins or something you could have hit
allow<00:07:36.660> it<00:07:36.900> and<00:07:37.020> then<00:07:37.410> Amazon<00:07:37.980> would<00:07:38.190> ask<00:07:38.400> for

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.670 
allow it and then Amazon would ask for
