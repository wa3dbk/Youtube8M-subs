00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.770
 hello everyone I hope you 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.960

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.060
 I decided for the next 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.349
 tutorial to tackle a problem 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.450
 specific 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.160
 lately I visited a forum 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.369
 of them and a facebook page 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.529
 and on the 200 voices have laid exactly 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.649
 the same question that was to know 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 how to place decorative devils 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:38.220
 or evenings what if you prefer and 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.980
 that these remain glossy during the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.929
 finish and that the customer can 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.440
 wear all the time of the loud break 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:48.059
 that he fell without being hooked 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.679
 I looked at the question and I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.149
 I told myself why not make a 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:57.390
 tutorial on how to adjust these two 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.309
 this very simple problem so here is everything 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.969
 immediately the tutorial on the application 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.949
 decorative stones to start 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.460
 I stuck with glue stitch is a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 natural prosthesis directly on that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 here I apply a layer of gel or 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.920
 brush and I tremble in a powder 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.619
 cover ping 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.820
 because here I was looking for a style look 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 baby boomer but no more then I 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.520
 continued with my break steps with 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.280
 the resin technique and for once 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.950
 the completed steps I proceed or 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.600
 the necessary image and I'm finally 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.590
 ready to glue my decorative stones 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.899
 or the stones tonight at the skis here I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 chose to work with stones of 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.210
 various sizes as well as beads 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 for a more chic look 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.689
 firstly I apply a layer of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.719
 brush gel over the entire surface of 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.240
 the nail and then with a stick of wax 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.789
 provided for this purpose I will look for the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.109
 stones and pearls one is one that I 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.579
 place at the desired places note that 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:04.859
 it's the most sticky surface 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.820
 simply added to places 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.399
 strategic 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.649
 a little gel or brush and continue 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.520
 the placement of the stones repeat this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.110
 trick as needed here there is no 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.150
 limit on the amount of stones to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.870
 apply and lose it's you who 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.080
 decide 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.790
 it's your claim 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.400
 small stones large stones 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.560
 clerks of the roses of the little pearls 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.780
 the biggest pearls you go according to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.420
 your taste and taste of the customer well 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.910
 I heard now finished 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.920
 place fantasy so I apply a 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.230
 another gel layer with a brush on all 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.080
 the surface of the nail taking well 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.060
 care to coat each of the pearls and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.070
 decorative stones 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.380
 I perfectly covered my fantasy 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.340
 so I can now harden it all 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.560
 with catalysis a spray 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.510
 once I missed a dry bucket I 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.300
 think the surface with a soft block 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.090
 do not use lyme too much 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.390
 abrasive because you risk so deby me 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.250
 stone and pearls 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.500
 I finished thinking I can 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.060
 now apply the two layers of 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:17.090
 uv resin finish is essential 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.270
 and here are some decorative stones 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.190
 cool is ready to challenge the time it is 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.709
 important to know that you have to 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.200
 choose glass or good stones 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.390
 quality in order to make sure that it does not 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.940
 will not need when applying the gel 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.489
 with a brush which results in a 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.130
 dull stone without luster that can 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.120
 change shape and even color this 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.190
 which would be really unpleasant 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.930
