00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 turn out put on the plate plate 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.539
 deep bread sliced â€‹â€‹for example not on 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 button he glasses then water some water 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 inactive circle on the field is useful and add 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.079
 take open our spices personally 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 open can be opened so your thoughts 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.420
 our spice cup 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.899
 here is our favorite 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.559
 she gave herself away 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.940
 so we add a little guess 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.880
 water for 2 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.880
 to add 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 what do we do next get a man 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.180
 paint on the sky above what's next 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:55.460
 did will cut the barrier in about 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.460
 the same. we cut in half ours and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.420
 then cut the uniformity 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.880
 so we will succeed or 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.880
 he 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.070
 and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.700
 you stood that ball in the house and me in it 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:26.730
 case bottom first letters and now 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:30.680
 we have this spoon and now this 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.680
 seasoning we all take away 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.599
 I 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.310
 scatter 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.310
 package 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.280
 fairly evenly 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.030
 still forwarding 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.610
 now it's all 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.430
 mix it all up 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.430
 lot 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.620
 we 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.490
 click here 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.629
 right 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280
 Here we have such here 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 power 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.530
 and now this one did not give after two 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.310
 minutes 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.340
 our readiness example we will get 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.770
 this formula 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.770
 now we are all going to change now 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.439
 or so we are all mixed up because 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.480
 in two minutes 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:18.979
 their readiness they stuck together 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.979
 and starts to burn 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.130
 and tightly like these kirieshki we 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:35.009
 stirred you put them again 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:40.660
 microwave as it is sad after another 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:46.930
 they are again perhaps i should aim them again 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:48.760
 survive as they once again let the blind 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.720
 the world too 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.350
 but you then kirieshki microwave on 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.770
 a door 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.410
 minutes it will be lower 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:04.050
 maya and they should already cross the finish line 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.539
 hell we made kirieshki which 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:16.050
 giving birth there is a microwave 6 minutes now 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:16.050
