00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:06.410
 with each drilling process the 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.719
 cutting from drilling tools blunt 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.700
 an elaborate sharpening or 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.829
 Replacing the drill is necessary 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.850
 as soon as the drilling quality is affected 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:19.460
 will not do so at the guarantee home 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.050
 crown drills of the hoffmann group 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.330
 this high performance tool for 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.770
 must produce medium-sized holes 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.450
 only the cutting insert 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.870
 or the crown changed 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.760
 become 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.760
 while the base remains intact 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.120
 after wear, the cutting insert 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.650
 just out of the body 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.200
 taken out and by a new one 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.600
 schneider replaces the screw connection of the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.239
 crown in the plate seat of the drill ensures 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.850
 for a lasting accurate and stable 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.280
 fortification at what with how kempten 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.380
 Crowns can be 15 to 20 changes 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.260
 be made because the holding power of 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.090
 clamping quickly subsides 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.430
 At home , crowns can drill 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.500
 this number of tones change due to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.089
 the screwed clamping mechanism ever 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.380
 according to application and tool 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.380
 be clearly exceeded 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.330
 after the change of the crown has the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.220
 garant home wants crowns drill over 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.270
 the same time and the same 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 length as before 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.979
 what a simple handling and a 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.049
 Consistently high process reliability 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:29.090
 guaranteed with its double-edged 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.920
 The guarantee is hyper three 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.299
 Crowns drill not only twice as 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 effective as a dashing one 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.630
 indexable drills but 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.630
 also tells a higher accuracy 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.840
 this accuracy of the holes lies 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.070
 at up to 9 something comparable with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.050
 Solid carbide drills is the hss 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.180
 and inserts drills recoverable 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.180
 tolerances are more generous 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.060
 in addition to the great efficiency 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.520
 as well as the high surface quality 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 the guarantee hyper three crowns drill too 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.480
 very flexible 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.850
 the shaft is made of a high-strength 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.800
 Tool steel and is suitable for this 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.480
 reason better for the standing use 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.780
 on a lathe as a 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.120
 Solid carbide drills the cutting edge 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
 Deposits are variable due to holders 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.920
 different length but equal in 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.330
 diameter can be used 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.850
 This allows a processing 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.620
 varying materials with the same 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.600
 basic body through easy exchange 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.460
 everyone can wear it 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.920
 a diameter jump of one 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.450
 millimeter bridge 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 only the crown has to be exactly the same 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.550
 desired diameter correspond to the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.709
 garant home wants to stands out 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.750
 from that the core hole diameter for 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.050
 all common thread standards stock 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.560
 are available are available but may be 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.320
 on request realized with a 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.450
 maximum over stand of 0 5 mm per 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.370
 side remains the efficiency of the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.370
 received in full 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.050
 because the guarantee has no desire 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.940
 cut is necessary with the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.500
 shipping related costs as well as the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.760
 appropriate logistic and 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.760
 in-house expenses 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.600
 our practice tip about the accuracy too 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.580
 received and a premature carrier 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.560
 wear should be prevented 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.440
 Change screws to 8 kroner 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.250
 to be exchanged in this way remains 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.020
 the tension of the screws received 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.710
 The guarantee home is crowns bora 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:45.380
 offers you a simple handling one 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.320
 high process reliability flexibility 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.000
 regarding different materials 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.370
 as well as high cost efficiency through 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 reduced material and shipping costs 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.660
 because highest efficiency requires premium 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.660
 tools 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.240
