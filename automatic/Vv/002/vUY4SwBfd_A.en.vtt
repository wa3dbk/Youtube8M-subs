00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
whole car I've been doing with just an

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.220 
whole car I've been doing with just an
old<00:00:23.550> screwdriver<00:00:23.910> isn't<00:00:24.390> really<00:00:24.570> liking<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
old screwdriver isn't really liking the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.890 
old screwdriver isn't really liking the
little<00:00:25.830> hammer<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.720> did

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
little hammer that I have and I did

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.179 
little hammer that I have and I did
preach<00:00:28.199> everything<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.830> only<00:00:28.949> take<00:00:29.130> out

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
preach everything and you only take out

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
preach everything and you only take out
long<00:00:29.460> maybe<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.210> couple<00:00:31.140> hours<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:32.450> think

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
long maybe a couple hours but I think

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
long maybe a couple hours but I think
it's<00:00:33.570> only<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:33.870> possible<00:00:34.440> when<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.520> like

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
it's only really possible when it's like

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.389 
it's only really possible when it's like
thinner<00:00:35.969> stuff<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.280> know

I'm<00:01:19.439> already<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> here<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> do

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a little bit without it but but the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
a little bit without it but but the
whole<00:01:25.890> car<00:01:26.460> I've<00:01:26.580> been<00:01:26.700> using<00:01:26.850> safety<00:01:27.180> glasses

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
whole car I've been using safety glasses

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.719 
whole car I've been using safety glasses
because<00:01:27.920> stuff<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.130> eyes<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.430> very

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
because stuff in your eyes is not very

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.929 
because stuff in your eyes is not very
fun<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:31.380> works<00:01:31.530> better<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.850> of

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
fun so it works better when it's some of

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
fun so it works better when it's some of
it<00:01:33.000> thinner<00:01:33.240> stuff<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.689> really<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.200> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it thinner stuff this really doesn't it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
it thinner stuff this really doesn't it
takes<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.310> longer<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.270> thicker<00:01:36.600> like

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
takes a lot longer but just thicker like

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.450 
takes a lot longer but just thicker like
a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.200> bit<00:01:37.320> thicker<00:01:37.530> stuff<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> bottom

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
a little bit thicker stuff on the bottom

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
a little bit thicker stuff on the bottom
comes<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.509> bigger<00:01:39.689> pieces<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.470> I've

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
totally good idea but this doesn't seem

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.839 
totally good idea but this doesn't seem
like<00:05:34.439> it's<00:05:35.399> more<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:37.860> might<00:05:38.009> be<00:05:38.129> more<00:05:38.309> work<00:05:38.610> but

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
like it's more it might be more work but

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.339
