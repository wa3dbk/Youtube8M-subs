00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:48.030
 century a storm wore a base ranging from 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.310
 inner corner and sleep is the road to 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.810
 with our help with synthetic flow 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.810
 blend with fingers 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.099
 I will use the next step 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.069
 milky tint I will put it inside 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.999
 this eye also on the zone to build 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.999
 medications him 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.220
 we will continue to use tender tomorrow 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.410
 shade shadows and apply it in two 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 third moving century slightly 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.040
 shade 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:33.420
 take advantage of the perks she carries named 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.430
 folds calmly how much feathers 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.390
 we will use it as eyeliner 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.390
 by a darker shade 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:48.910
 sunglasses and put it on the outside 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.880
 the corner of the eye is slightly shaded 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.690
 me without lighter shades 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.150
 slowed down 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.110
 eyelash growth is not descriptively good 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.110
 shade an example 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.220
 emphasize the line of parting these when 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.049
 help black eyeliner I use it 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.049
 as at the junction mowed with a small brush 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.569
 I put it to about the highest point 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.569
 lightly shade the tip of our eyes 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.900
 I recently did the eyebrows correction 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.310
 so it is not much I need but for 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.130
 in order to make the eyebrows more 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.500
 saturated I just let you down and the remnants 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.020
 the poet of the selection which remained on the brush 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.060
 makes it light dashed movements 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.100
 even offering a little by 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.620
 fingers and of course do not forget from 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.840
 I already put it in two layers and a clear 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.840
 the focus is just the same on the upper eyelash 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.090
 go to lip makeup 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.590
 as I promised we will do with you 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.930
 amber style cup 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.500
 To do this, first trace the outline when 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.800
 using the dark ready shade center 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.280
 cube we move the world from the opposite 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.280
 up 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.830
 further expand our pencil 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.780
 density and fill pupae our cube 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.780
 make it easy movements 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.009
 I will use the next step 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.409
 Ashkenazi Raspberry Carats 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.169
 his countries line 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:33.639
 so I no longer have a father that colors 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.639
 Thai tempted 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.210
 and the center cube add a little white 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.180
 shade something to do makeup doll yet 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.040
 brighter and on top of the drawing was 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.720
 translucent cropping in order to 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.720
 add to the effect itself 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.900
 face added a little freshness 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.900
 pink blush relief 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.570
