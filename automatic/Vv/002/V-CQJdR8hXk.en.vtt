00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.959
 Hi, look, I present my cat and I 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.860
 I come to say something that has 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:15.340
 learned that if you put acetone in your 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.740
 in his little nose the kitten then 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.529
 sleeps you start to sleep a little bit or 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.369
 enamel with nails do not do not create do not 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:27.159
 that poor little cats that I was going to tell you 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.249
 so it has not happened to them that sometimes 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:34.390
 they make a tremendous ridiculous that they do not 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:37.000
 they fit so either that a ridiculous 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.520
 that you know of those that you throw 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 encourage you not to walk here doing the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.810
 ridiculous age and for that of that live from 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.220
 that live so that it is accepted that it is done 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.470
 and so I do not know whether it's a ridiculous or something 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.490
 Ugly good that happens to you or that makes you 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.470
 someone angry or something sad me that you 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.040
 have rejected or they send you to the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.040
 scrubbed and 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.690
 and love and I'm going to die but what happens 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:10.200
 after agreement if it does not say Sahin or 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.170
 This bad happened to me but I learned not to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 they did me a favor I did myself a favor no 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.470
 I know and right now I'm a better person, things like that 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.050
 that sometimes you get anguished too 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 for things that have not even happened that 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.240
 you're there is not that if this happens there 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.150
 is that if he leaves me there is that if 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.710
 they get mad at me because of this you do not know 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.870
 hurry for things that have not even 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.940
 gone by and I enjoy the moment 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.190
 are you living or for example when 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.140
 you are with your partner or with a friend and 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.110
 you say there are clouds that if one day it leaves me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.210
 talk and I do not know what, what does it matter? 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.820
 if one day happens that sometimes happens to me or 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.280
 times and it happens but you do not enjoy the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.430
 present for being there thinking what 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.160
 it's going to happen that maybe it happens to me and another 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.500
 thing also that many people say I 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.810
 I forgive but I do not forget then that's not 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.760
 is to forgive to forgive is not to make a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.620
 please the other person because many 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.000
 you think there's going to be a favor with 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.070
 tell him I forgive him 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 sorry before doing yourself a favor 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.960
 same because you are the one who is 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.610
 doing harm remembering things because if 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.710
 you are remember and remember the mistake 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.700
 then you keep hurting 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.280
 then when you forgive the person 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.110
 it is not necessary that you find out 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.620
 forgive someone after remembering 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.200
 what happened but without courage or even go 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.330
 forgetting that you forget 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.400
 overcoming and already no way has passed 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.150
 I'm fine I'm calm like that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.459
 simply because that is making you a 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.709
 favor yourself tranquility with you 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.650
 not with the other people but 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.660
 with you and nothing but you and another 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 what I learned is that jealousy in 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:57.260
 extreme are horrible 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.420
 it's not good to be thinking or to be 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.640
 I say if it's always going to happen that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.250
 feel jealous that you do not invent see what 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.030
 what 's going on and so on and do a drama 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.190
 true but there are those who in excess already of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.870
 that you can not rhyme, no, and your sister 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.130
 because you're already grabbing the 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.130
 scrubbed you really 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.550
 I say that if a person loves you 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.820
 more whore or fucking who is your friend or your 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.880
 friend that brings you out there or that 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.880
 have you will not cheat if he wants you in 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.510
 Serious if I love you if it really is not going 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.910
 to cheat and if it cheats you is that you're 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.410
 insisting already then if he does not want me anymore 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.350
 a person who deceives you then 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.050
 obviously he does not love you because someone 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.860
 so no no, there is so easy here 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.990
 in another person like that they want you serious 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.620
 believe me, believe me when you like someone 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.710
 that says this today so what do you 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.680
 like it a lot and so everything is fine 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:03.040
 difficult to look at another person very 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.440
 difficult and if you already started to fix 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.390
 another person is because simply in 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.380
 You were not really interested in the person 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.180
 you were at your side and that's what happens 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.269
 joseba is not so easy the advice that 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.669
 I'm giving them, I had to learn them 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.490
 they almost grab me from the hair I think 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.840
 so that he understands that and I had to 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.840
 learn because as each who 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.050
 Learning depends on how you are doing 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.810
 things that happen to you in life 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.360
 simply because one thing I tell them is not 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.280
 necessary to hate someone I sometimes 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.830
 Grasps people by certain 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.650
 and I say things as what to do 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.840
 remember I thank those people 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.180
 because thanks to that the people who 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.389
 right now I know the truth I 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.430
 I consider much more than much more 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.169
 what I expected, I mean, I'm very 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.479
 grateful to the people I know 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.060
 now and I thank the people who 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.430
 they went through my life because because I 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.050
 they did learn and I'm not going to 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.380
 wrong in the same way with those who 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.479
 I have now and I love them very much and I'm 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.969
 very happy of that to have learned this 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.130
 and that's all I had to tell you 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.130
 yes and it's all
