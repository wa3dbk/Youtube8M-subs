00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
set let me just pull a set out here so

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.429 
set let me just pull a set out here so
you<00:03:34.870> can<00:03:34.959> see<00:03:35.049> what<00:03:35.139> you're<00:03:35.260> getting<00:03:35.590> cat5

you can see what you're getting cat5

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.960 
you can see what you're getting cat5
we're<00:03:38.439> hope<00:03:38.650> that's<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.979> six<00:03:39.939> and<00:03:41.699> every<00:03:42.699> 17

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
we're hope that's the six and every 17

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.170 
we're hope that's the six and every 17
so<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.840> get<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:43.989> full<00:03:44.379> set<00:03:44.709> on<00:03:45.449> a<00:03:46.859> d6<00:03:47.859> addy<00:03:48.669> for<00:03:48.699> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
so you get a full set on a d6 addy for a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.289 
so you get a full set on a d6 addy for a
d12<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:50.139> d20<00:03:50.949> a<00:03:51.599> d8<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:53.129> 2d<00:03:54.129> tens<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.030> know<00:03:55.090> one

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
d12 a d20 a d8 and 2d tens you know one

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.710 
d12 a d20 a d8 and 2d tens you know one
with<00:03:55.449> a<00:03:55.479> tens<00:03:56.229> digit<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.859> one<00:03:57.819> with<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.389> ones

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
with a tens digit and one with the ones

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.420 
with a tens digit and one with the ones
digit<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.229> between<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.650> two<00:03:59.799> of<00:03:59.919> them<00:04:00.069> you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
digit so between the two of them you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.399 
digit so between the two of them you
actually<00:04:00.639> have<00:04:01.030> you<00:04:01.299> know<00:04:01.359> like<00:04:01.479> a<00:04:01.540> d100<00:04:02.259> like

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
actually have you know like a d100 like

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.339 
actually have you know like a d100 like
I<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.620> rolled<00:04:02.919> a<00:04:03.009> 48<00:04:03.519> whoo<00:04:03.879> so<00:04:04.629> this<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.229> what

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
I just rolled a 48 whoo so this is what

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.879 
I just rolled a 48 whoo so this is what
you<00:04:05.439> get<00:04:05.560> but<00:04:05.979> you<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.639> actually<00:04:06.989> back<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.709> get

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
you get but you can actually back to get

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.949 
you get but you can actually back to get
as<00:04:09.040> many<00:04:09.340> sets<00:04:09.729> as<00:04:09.849> you<00:04:10.030> want<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.780> know<00:04:10.870> the

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
as many sets as you want you know the

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.360 
as many sets as you want you know the
same<00:04:11.169> color<00:04:11.439> or<00:04:11.620> different<00:04:11.979> color<00:04:12.129> there's<00:04:12.340> a

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
same color or different color there's a

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.099 
same color or different color there's a
lot<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:12.609> flexibility<00:04:13.120> with<00:04:13.239> this<00:04:13.329> and<00:04:13.479> in<00:04:13.810> fact

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
lot of flexibility with this and in fact

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.909 
lot of flexibility with this and in fact
the<00:04:14.319> more<00:04:14.560> successful<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:15.250> project<00:04:15.849> is<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the more successful the project is the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.430 
the more successful the project is the
cheaper<00:04:17.919> shipping<00:04:17.979> becomes<00:04:18.759> and<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.810> cheaper

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
cheaper shipping becomes and the cheaper

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.769 
cheaper shipping becomes and the cheaper
the<00:04:20.530> dice<00:04:20.680> get<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.489> he's<00:04:22.180> actually<00:04:22.360> worked<00:04:22.659> out

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:22.779 
the dice get so he's actually worked out

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:24.209 
the dice get so he's actually worked out
all<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.020> math<00:04:23.169> so<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:23.409> know<00:04:23.590> it's<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.950> really

all the math so you know it's a really

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.680 
all the math so you know it's a really
nicely<00:04:24.460> put<00:04:24.729> together<00:04:24.849> web<00:04:25.150> page<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.539> see
