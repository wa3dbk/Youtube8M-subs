00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
compared to John um I think I'm a bit

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.180 
compared to John um I think I'm a bit
higher<00:01:35.250> than<00:01:35.550> than<00:01:36.150> John<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.990> mean<00:01:37.800> I<00:01:37.830> think<00:01:37.920> he

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
higher than than John I mean I think he

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.830 
higher than than John I mean I think he
likes<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> sit<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.820> although<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.570> does<00:01:39.660> like

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
likes to sit more although it does like

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.570 
likes to sit more although it does like
to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.050> goals<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.530> assists<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
to get goals and assists I think it's

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.360 
to get goals and assists I think it's
been<00:01:41.730> very<00:01:41.760> good<00:01:42.090> for<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.050> club<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.410> far<00:01:43.650> so
