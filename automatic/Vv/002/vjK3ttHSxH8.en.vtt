on<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.909> Fort<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.540> filmed<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:57.840> 24<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.350> you

on to Fort this was filmed on 24 if you
didn't<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.689> however<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.079> think

didn't know and however I don't think
that<00:02:01.380> add-on<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:03.030> available<00:02:03.799> when<00:02:04.799> he<00:02:04.890> made

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that add-on was available when he made

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.370 
that add-on was available when he made
this<00:02:05.189> video<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.330 

now<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.440> can<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:11.740> they're<00:02:11.920> just<00:02:11.950> a<00:02:12.310> little

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
now you can see they're just a little

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.790 
now you can see they're just a little
sound<00:02:12.880> effect<00:02:13.240> like<00:02:13.420> his<00:02:13.600> head<00:02:13.840> hitting<00:02:14.110> his

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
sound effect like his head hitting his

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.340 
sound effect like his head hitting his
chest<00:02:15.220> really<00:02:15.640> adds<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> people<00:02:17.080> just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
chest really adds a lot and people just

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.270 
chest really adds a lot and people just
starting<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.770> they<00:02:17.890> don't<00:02:18.040> really<00:02:18.160> think

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
starting out they don't really think

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.820 
starting out they don't really think
about<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.270> really<00:02:19.450> enhances<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
about that and it really enhances the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.059 
about that and it really enhances the

slowly easing it you are weak you are on

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.460 
slowly easing it you are weak you are on
there<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.630> see<00:02:46.720> there<00:02:47.019> is<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.170> lips

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470

you are on watch this animation frame by

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.850 
you are on watch this animation frame by
frame<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.750> think<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.200> most<00:03:08.260> important

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860

part when i'm reviewing these is just

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.430 
part when i'm reviewing these is just

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
ragdolls at the same time and then he

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:33.360 
ragdolls at the same time and then he
adds<00:03:23.820> sound<00:03:24.820> effects<00:03:31.680> there<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:32.829> can<00:03:32.860> hear<00:03:33.190> he

got some echo and quieted it so it

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.420 
got some echo and quieted it so it
sounds<00:03:40.090> like<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.750> should

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
it really was you when you see it the

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.960 
it really was you when you see it the
first<00:05:22.850> time

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.220 

here<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.060> have<00:05:29.240> it<00:05:29.419> looks<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.750> another<00:05:29.870> depth

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
here we have it looks like another depth

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.830 
here we have it looks like another depth
of<00:05:30.380> field<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.770> looks<00:05:30.980> like<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:32.150> foreground<00:05:32.630> is

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
of field it looks like the foreground is

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.260 
of field it looks like the foreground is
blurred<00:05:33.139> so<00:05:33.919> you<00:05:33.980> can<00:05:34.100> see<00:05:34.220> the<00:05:34.370> end<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:35.180> the

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
blurred so you can see the end of the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.420 
blurred so you can see the end of the
sword<00:05:35.570> is<00:05:35.750> blurred<00:05:38.770> again<00:05:39.770> it's<00:05:39.919> easy<00:05:40.190> now

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
sword is blurred again it's easy now

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.409 
sword is blurred again it's easy now
here<00:05:41.270> we<00:05:41.360> have<00:05:41.389> a<00:05:41.540> reveal<00:05:42.230> what<00:05:42.800> the<00:05:42.830> focus

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
here we have a reveal what the focus

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.000 
here we have a reveal what the focus
reveal<00:05:44.419> mean<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:44.930> focus<00:05:45.290> on<00:05:45.440> one<00:05:45.620> thing<00:05:45.650> and

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
reveal mean to focus on one thing and

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.670 
reveal mean to focus on one thing and
then<00:05:46.100> it<00:05:46.639> switches<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.720> focus<00:05:48.350> on<00:05:48.440> another

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
then it switches to focus on another

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.379 
then it switches to focus on another
thing<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:50.180> I<00:05:51.139> think<00:05:51.169> this<00:05:51.530> was<00:05:51.710> done<00:05:51.980> in<00:05:52.389> the

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
thing and I think this was done in the

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.450 
thing and I think this was done in the
editing<00:05:53.750> program<00:05:54.260> he<00:05:54.500> just<00:05:54.680> blurted<00:05:54.950> out<00:05:55.130> half

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
editing program he just blurted out half

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.120 
editing program he just blurted out half
the<00:05:55.639> screen<00:05:55.840> either<00:05:56.840> that<00:05:57.290> or<00:05:57.320> he<00:05:57.680> took<00:05:57.889> two

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
the screen either that or he took two

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.159 
the screen either that or he took two
different<00:05:58.300> screens<00:05:59.300> with<00:05:59.630> different<00:05:59.990> depth

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
different screens with different depth

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.780 
different screens with different depth
of<00:06:00.380> fields<00:06:00.830> not<00:06:01.729> sure<00:06:02.000> I'm<00:06:02.870> gonna<00:06:03.139> go<00:06:03.290> with

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
of fields not sure I'm gonna go with

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.300 
of fields not sure I'm gonna go with
excuse<00:06:04.790> me<00:06:05.200> I'm<00:06:06.200> gonna<00:06:06.380> go<00:06:06.470> with<00:06:06.710> he<00:06:06.889> did<00:06:07.040> it<00:06:07.160> in

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
excuse me I'm gonna go with he did it in

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.629 
excuse me I'm gonna go with he did it in
editing<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:09.680> can<00:06:09.710> see<00:06:09.919> it's<00:06:10.070> blurry<00:06:10.310> then

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
editing you can see it's blurry then

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:17.970 
editing you can see it's blurry then
it's<00:06:10.880> focused<00:06:14.410> focus
