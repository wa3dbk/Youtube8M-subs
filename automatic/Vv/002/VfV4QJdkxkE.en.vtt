00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.460
 it is an alter gesa treadmill 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.800
 antigravity the one she was developed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.720
 by for Americans using 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730
 technologies that have been developed 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.650
 by NASA and which allow 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.280
 the user so here to the sportsmen in 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.890
 our case of decreasing the body weight 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.180
 especially at the race and work 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.980
 to work any exercise 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.270
 but reducing the impact each time 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 that the athlete could have at the level 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 of the carpet by increasing or decreasing I 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.230
 see a guy like that at the level of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.589
 pressures that we put inside the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.589
 box 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.570
 we take the example of demo who has a lesion 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.879
 muscular here to allow him to resume 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.309
 the race a lot earlier and not to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.680
 lose for example in aerobic capacity 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 we can still start again 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.280
 more easily their conditioning 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.500
 physical with him it's really a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.060
 feeling of stealing a little bit of being 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.760
 a little bit in the clouds to be a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 little bit on the moon since we 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.530
 reduces the weight of the body that reduces the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.470
 gravity we will decrease the intensity of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.660
 the ground impact and therefore have a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 feeling I climb a little 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.750
 more and I feel like I'm not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.260
 have more body weight 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.260
 control that 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:51.670
 jivo from 9h in the morning until 4 5 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.729
 afternoon hours when we have a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.189
 first session in the morning usually or 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.729
 in the room we have we all exercises 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.770
 whether it is cardio or reinforcement 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.600
 muscular 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.069
 we come down here in the treatment room 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.989
 where we work a little bit with 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.940
 otherness just trying to their 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:14.079
 take a little bit of running 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.360
 quickly and we have isokineticism where they 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.650
 start work again 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.810
 eccentric and it's to reinforce a 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.019
 little bit of muscle and then we have 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.140
 the care part on table with with 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.430
 manipulation with primo massages it's 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.290
 always the same thing it's 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.760
 join the field and the group the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.370
 as soon as possible there are other very 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.900
 good conditions here at the academy so 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.819
 for him it's all going well he 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 came in the morning and left in the evening without 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.370
 no problem he knows he has to 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.750
 work to get back as soon as possible 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.359
 possible to resume matches on 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:53.819
 as soon as possible for him to see everything at 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:53.819
 omeyer at the ferry
