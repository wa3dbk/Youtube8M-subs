00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
really easy here's how they go draw a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.299 
really easy here's how they go draw a
shape<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.599> comes<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> point<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
shape like this comes to a point a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.799 
shape like this comes to a point a
little<00:00:32.759> bit<00:00:32.940> wide<00:00:33.210> here

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
little bit wide here

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.709 
little bit wide here
comes<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> little<00:00:34.469> bit<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> bottom<00:00:35.719> maybe

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
comes in a little bit the bottom maybe

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.000 
comes in a little bit the bottom maybe
like<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> tongue<00:00:37.290> hmm

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
like a tongue hmm

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.880 
like a tongue hmm
the<00:00:38.489> tongue<00:00:38.670> sticking<00:00:38.940> out<00:00:39.440> next<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.680> we'll

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the tongue sticking out next up we'll

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.209 
the tongue sticking out next up we'll
draw<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> around<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.829> make<00:00:43.829> sure<00:00:43.860> it's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
draw you around it and make sure it's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.040 
draw you around it and make sure it's
kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.700> rounded<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.329> almost<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
kind of a rounded you almost like a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.330 
kind of a rounded you almost like a
c-shape<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> guess<00:00:47.360> like<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.160> then<00:00:50.160> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
c-shape I guess like that and then this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.959 
c-shape I guess like that and then this
will<00:00:50.579> cut<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> will<00:00:52.410> cut<00:00:52.649> in

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
will cut in and then this will cut in

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.569 
will cut in and then this will cut in
that's<00:00:53.969> one<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> our<00:00:54.690> tulips<00:00:55.430> we'll<00:00:56.430> draw

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
that's one of our tulips we'll draw

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.950 
that's one of our tulips we'll draw
another<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.210> little<00:00:57.270> bit<00:00:57.539> lower<00:00:57.719> because

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
another one a little bit lower because

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
another one a little bit lower because
all<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> flowers<00:00:58.859> aren't<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
all the flowers aren't going to be the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.920 
all the flowers aren't going to be the
same<00:00:59.699> height<00:01:01.070> do<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> same<00:01:02.430> thing<00:01:02.930> draw

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
same height do the same thing draw

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.230 
same height do the same thing draw
tongue<00:01:04.670> hmm<00:01:05.780> what<00:01:06.780> else<00:01:06.930> could<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.140> be<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
tongue hmm what else could that be I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
tongue hmm what else could that be I
can't<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.510> anything<00:01:09.720> else<00:01:09.900> right<00:01:10.110> now

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
can't think of anything else right now

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.210 
can't think of anything else right now
maybe<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.729> wide<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:13.080> know

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
maybe it's a really wide a I don't know

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.530 
maybe it's a really wide a I don't know
then<00:01:14.220> we'll<00:01:14.340> draw<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> shape<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.330> goes

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
then we'll draw you shape that goes

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.520 
then we'll draw you shape that goes
around<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:17.869> then<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.900> Cup<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.979> Boop<00:01:21.530> now

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
around it and then the Cup in Boop now

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.109 
around it and then the Cup in Boop now
this<00:01:22.710> would<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> great<00:01:23.369> giant<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.030> your

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this would make a great giant for your

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.399 
this would make a great giant for your
mom<00:01:24.470> or<00:01:25.470> maybe<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:25.950> dad<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.140> maybe<00:01:28.140> great

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
mom or maybe your dad and maybe great

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.679

for Valentine's Day too and then we're

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
for Valentine's Day too and then we're
going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> more<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.590> again<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.520> not

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
going to do one more and again it's not

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.770 
going to do one more and again it's not
going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> same<00:01:33.119> height<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
going to be the same height it's going a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
going to be the same height it's going a
little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:33.990> lower<00:01:34.170> than<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.680> even<00:01:35.150> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
little bit lower than this one even so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.460 
little bit lower than this one even so
we<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:39.210> one's<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.140> fat

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we do the that one's a little not as fat

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.380

as<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.829> ones<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.220> wish<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.670> was<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.210> I'll

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
as these ones I wish it was but I'll

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.050 
as these ones I wish it was but I'll
just<00:01:42.630> roll<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.700> because<00:01:44.700> that's<00:01:44.909> what

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
just roll with it because that's what

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.550 
just roll with it because that's what
you<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.329> when<00:01:45.540> you're<00:01:45.689> drawing<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> doesn't

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
you do when you're drawing if it doesn't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.139 
you do when you're drawing if it doesn't
quite<00:01:46.740> turn<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> way<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.460> hope<00:01:47.820> just
