00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.009
 hello people in the previous day we saw how final drummer or and we're going to 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:07.890
 to dedicate 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.969
 to the fools 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.049
 in the same way that in order the drummer the first thing I do is 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.339
 once put the patch 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.970
 to prime in a cross shape the screws until bento 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.609
 I'm going to start with the counterpart because 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.109
 in the sound the fools is very very very obvious 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630
 if the counterpart 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.310
 it is out of tune 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.970
 is from gondra patch is the condor part comes from series with this fool is a 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.800
 silly 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 the Moroccan afternoon 13 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 what I did with that counterpart 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.990
 put a little more freight 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.740
 of plastic 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.920
 which is actually an old cut patch 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.080
 inside 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.700
 and left approximately 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.480
 half a centimeter into the post 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.590
 inside the patch 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.420
 that way he said what I get is that my serial part 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.870
 be a patch 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.610
 a little bit thicker and that loses harmonics a bit I like that 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.850
 the gift 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.460
 go up in the one that is a singer but I do not like that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.520
 have a lot of salmon 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 as we said, we got close to the cross 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.460
 and we are going to do 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 the same as we did with the drummer 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.260
 small turns 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 screw by cross screw 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.790
 until beginning to give stop 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.510
 min 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.320
 I particularly like the counterpart a little loose 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.650
 because that way I can get a little more liberation if only 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.560
 just a lot 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
 will be very sharp especially because it is a serious game and is very fine 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.940
 I will be bothered when it comes to tuning the patch 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 the bench 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.459
 what I do is rather a somewhat loose case 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.959
 I'm looking for the note that I like more or less 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.429
 I'm not really crazy because if I do not 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.429
 the resonance is minimal 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.929
 and once I have the sound that I want 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:29.759
 He passed 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.629
 to me 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.309
 smoothie 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:34.820
 like the snare drum technique 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.619
 what I do 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.150
 bring him screws 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.339
 cross to wind 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:45.889
 in this case I have an evans generates g2 this is a patch 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.779
 double-layer hydraulic 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:51.229
 it's a pretty hard patch that 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:53.889
 the tomba get a serious percent sound 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.350
 I could take some but 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.750
 will be half real and the record or little measure that best fits the patch 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.139
 harder it gets 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.529
 and it loses vibration 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:09.469
 all the match the bodies have a point at which the resonance is the 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.469
 maximum and the most appropriate 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:14.709
 that depending 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.339
 d the package using 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:22.349
 The type of helmet of the size and depth can not pretend that a helmet 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.579
 yesterday like this 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.679
 sound still 13 super serious helmet 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.570
 He was able to carry a serious but he will never get to do 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.449
 one of three 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.060
 well in fact this starts although ar my sound 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.840
 in the same way that 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.799
 we saw it with the drummer 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.209
 from a point 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.919
 small turns 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.829
 that is all the tournaments are on top 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.839
 cross 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:50.819
 ferrando 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.869
 let's stretch the patch 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.649
 little by little 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:58.649
 as it is and gtb previous and the patch is new we do a little pressure 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:00.869
 so that it goes pulling 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.559
 we already know that in any case as we go playing it will go stretching 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.559
 little bit more and you have to touch up 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:11.309
 I return to the same point 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.600
 I already have a little memory of the pressure exerted by the screws and 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.309
 how much I like the sound that this 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.860
 that's how many times 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.669
 they are more or less to I am aware of the avtur is 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.150
 of the bull started at the point where it is 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.659
 the sound that will give me at this point enough wage races but 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.449
 with a serious sound 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.529
 being so loose has a vibration 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.599
 that I do not like it 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.710
 Thus 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.939
 raising but less and less because I'm almost getting a sound that I want 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.240
 peras a vueltita 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.120
 thing that you want to mar that way is we throw even the whole partial 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 and few 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.319
 I have another vibration 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.150
 that out there in the video is not going to notice much but that I'm feeling 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.979
 here 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.289
 that may be 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.249
 I left my musu participate the cto or failing that my counterpart this museum 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.699
 for that today has returned the review counterparts very loose appointment and if not 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.699
 I continue with this 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.509
 you have to get the sound that I wanted to say in my hotel orfeo not 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.709
 I put any type will only go because I like that hello 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.639
 sing 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:53.710
 full 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.030
 that has a sound and a complete sustenance that has 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.729
 the helmet 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.830
 If I had a sandblasted patch here 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.210
 percent to half as and rising will be going much sharper and the 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.119
 arromonic are much more pronounced 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:13.639
 but like this one is a double-layer, double-layer hydraulic patch 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.499
 oil in the middle 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:18.659
 it will sound almost always serious 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.099
 as well 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.309
 ain 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.309
 so much 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.069
 well 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:36.400
 one 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.400
 do not 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.410
 later I will upload another video 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.169
 the taking into account 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.360
 all this constitutes 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.889
 all alerted to a why in each one influences 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:58.319
 the sound of the other 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:02.610
 because when we are all together we have to try to have a joint sound 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:04.999
 if you want 

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:07.270
 look for some artery 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.149
 some chorus that we like 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.489
 make each one of them sound like each one of those notes 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.529
 I hope it serves you and we see it in the next
