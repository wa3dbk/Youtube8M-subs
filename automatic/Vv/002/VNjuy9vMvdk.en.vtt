00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
like into the last half of the program

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.770 
like into the last half of the program
is<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.800> verify<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.459> final<00:03:22.150> number

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
is just to verify that final number

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.770 
is just to verify that final number
earned<00:03:23.470> for<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.099> element<00:03:24.340> would<00:03:25.060> be<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
earned for that element would be the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.530 
earned for that element would be the
base<00:03:25.989> value<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> element<00:03:27.190> plus<00:03:27.910> or<00:03:28.150> minus

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
base value of the element plus or minus

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.009 
base value of the element plus or minus
the<00:03:28.690> grade<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:28.930> its<00:03:29.140> execution<00:03:30.810> plus<00:03:31.810> any

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
the grade of its execution plus any

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.570 
the grade of its execution plus any
bonus<00:03:32.410> mark<00:03:32.650> soon<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:34.599> it<00:03:34.750> was<00:03:34.870> worth<00:03:35.050> like

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
bonus mark soon so it was worth like

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.210 
bonus mark soon so it was worth like
it'd<00:03:36.790> be<00:03:36.970> worth<00:03:37.200> quite<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.320> bit<00:03:38.410> more<00:03:38.710> than<00:03:39.010> just

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
it'd be worth quite a bit more than just

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.400 
it'd be worth quite a bit more than just
the<00:03:39.700> triple<00:03:40.060> loop<00:03:40.210> like<00:03:40.690> if<00:03:40.810> he<00:03:40.900> opened<00:03:41.230> with

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
the triple loop like if he opened with

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.610 
the triple loop like if he opened with
it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640 

he<00:03:47.159> has<00:03:47.640> chosen<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.629> use<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.200> one<00:03:49.349> foot

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
he has chosen not to use the one foot

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.440 
he has chosen not to use the one foot
section<00:03:50.010> or<00:03:50.099> this<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.430> his<00:03:50.580> choreography<00:03:50.909> step

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
section or this is his choreography step

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.520 
section or this is his choreography step
is<00:03:51.599> it<00:03:51.750> yeah<00:03:51.900> this<00:03:52.140> would<00:03:52.379> be<00:03:52.470> his

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
is it yeah this would be his

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:04.090 
is it yeah this would be his
choreography<00:03:52.950> static
