thing that said it's also true that fear

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.340 
thing that said it's also true that fear
is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> dynamic<00:00:19.850> that<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.270> lead<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.539> distorted

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
is a dynamic that can lead to distorted

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.130 
is a dynamic that can lead to distorted
behavior<00:00:22.800> patterns<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> I'll<00:00:24.689> just<00:00:24.840> give<00:00:25.019> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
behavior patterns and I'll just give you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
behavior patterns and I'll just give you
a<00:00:25.170> brief<00:00:25.500> glimpse<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:26.670> theory<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
a brief glimpse of some theory that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
a brief glimpse of some theory that
might<00:00:27.449> help<00:00:27.630> sort<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.590> personally

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
might help sort that out I personally

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
might help sort that out I personally
like<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.179> revaluation<00:00:30.539> counseling<00:00:31.349> theory

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
like the revaluation counseling theory

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250 
like the revaluation counseling theory
and<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.090> simple<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> explains<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and it's very simple and it explains a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260 
and it's very simple and it explains a
lot<00:00:34.410> there's<00:00:35.399> other<00:00:35.520> approaches<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> could

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
lot there's other approaches you could

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
lot there's other approaches you could
use<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.350> our<00:00:37.500> safety<00:00:37.920> area<00:00:38.129> basically

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
use but in our safety area basically

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
use but in our safety area basically
says<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.239> point<00:00:39.480> zero<00:00:39.930> inherent

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
says we start with point zero inherent

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
says we start with point zero inherent
nature<00:00:41.510> well<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> true<00:00:42.899> nature<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
nature well the true nature of a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
nature well the true nature of a
misunderstanding<00:00:43.950> kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.730> some<00:00:44.969> of

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
misunderstanding kind of like some of

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.650 
misunderstanding kind of like some of
this<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:46.039> moons<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.129> inherently

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
this out moons are inherently

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.529 
this out moons are inherently
brilliantly<00:00:48.660> intelligent<00:00:50.539> zestfully

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
brilliantly intelligent zestfully

affection intensely relational right but

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.789 
affection intensely relational right but
then<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.760> hurt<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.420> causes<00:01:03.660> distress<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
then we get hurt it causes distress a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
then we get hurt it causes distress a
pretty<00:01:05.430> simple<00:01:05.790> idea<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.869> we're<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
pretty simple idea and when we're in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.039 
pretty simple idea and when we're in
distress<00:01:08.030> upset<00:01:09.030> hurt<00:01:09.390> physically<00:01:09.900> or
