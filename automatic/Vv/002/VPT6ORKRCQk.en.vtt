thought<00:01:06.500> he<00:01:06.620> would<00:01:06.710> go<00:01:06.860> for<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:07.460> Bishop

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
thought he would go for that but Bishop

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.569 
thought he would go for that but Bishop
c4<00:01:08.480> also<00:01:08.870> he<00:01:09.020> played<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.439> before<00:01:10.030> um<00:01:11.030> I<00:01:12.430> guess<00:01:13.430> I

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
c4 also he played it before um I guess I

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.789

I<00:01:13.610> didn't<00:01:14.090> mind<00:01:14.270> playing<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.659> quiet<00:01:15.259> quiet

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
I didn't mind playing a quiet quiet

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.410 
I didn't mind playing a quiet quiet
opening<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:18.500> course<00:01:18.829> in<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.939> end<00:01:19.970> he<00:01:20.210> went

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
opening and of course in the end he went

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.179 
opening and of course in the end he went
for<00:01:20.659> complications<00:01:21.380> are<00:01:21.710> envisioned<00:01:21.920> it

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
for complications are envisioned it

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.410 
for complications are envisioned it
because<00:01:22.460> that's<00:01:22.670> what<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:22.850> won't<00:01:23.060> talk<00:01:23.270> about

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
because that's what I won't talk about

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.109 
because that's what I won't talk about
it<00:01:23.540> didn't<00:01:23.899> stay<00:01:24.079> quiet<00:01:25.070> for<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.369> long<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:25.759> bury

long no he wanted I think he wanted to
avoid<00:01:28.759> Yuri<00:01:29.090> for<00:01:29.720> any<00:01:29.990> thought<00:01:30.710> of<00:01:30.740> Bishop<00:01:31.189> b5

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
avoid Yuri for any thought of Bishop b5

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.200 
avoid Yuri for any thought of Bishop b5

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
but um it also didn't give him an

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.399 
but um it also didn't give him an
advantage<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.700> um<00:01:37.700> yeah<00:01:38.630> ken<00:01:38.960> happy<00:01:39.290> with

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
their sort of the game yeah because you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.929 
their sort of the game yeah because you
get<00:01:42.409> a<00:01:42.439> pair<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.009> bishops<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.820> then<00:01:44.320> yeah<00:01:45.320> and

get a pair of bishops and then yeah and
at<00:01:46.939> some<00:01:46.969> point<00:01:47.450> he<00:01:47.780> took<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.229> poem<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.649> he

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
at some point he took a poem that he

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.819 
at some point he took a poem that he
should<00:01:49.460> not<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.729> taken<00:01:49.880> right<00:01:50.240> ah<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.350> c7

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
should not have taken right ah the c7

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.789 
should not have taken right ah the c7
Poland<00:01:52.450> no<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:53.840> was<00:01:53.960> fine<00:01:54.259> to<00:01:54.320> take

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
Poland no I think it was fine to take

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:55.990 
Poland no I think it was fine to take
the<00:01:54.920> field<00:01:55.130> seven<00:01:55.430> point<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.759> think<00:01:55.939> he

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
the field seven point I think he

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.779 
the field seven point I think he
shouldn't<00:01:56.299> have<00:01:56.329> taken<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.840> d6<00:01:57.200> bone<00:01:57.409> maybe

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
shouldn't have taken the d6 bone maybe

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.069 
shouldn't have taken the d6 bone maybe
he<00:01:58.789> should<00:01:59.060> probably<00:01:59.210> show<00:01:59.479> up<00:01:59.509> went<00:01:59.750> back<00:01:59.899> to

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
he should probably show up went back to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.069 
he should probably show up went back to
CT<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:01.009> defend<00:02:01.340> his<00:02:01.460> opponent<00:02:01.969> deter<00:02:02.270> but<00:02:02.630> he

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
CT the defend his opponent deter but he

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.090 
CT the defend his opponent deter but he
took<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.469> d6<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:04.369> they<00:02:05.119> probably<00:02:05.420> made<00:02:05.719> some

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
took on d6 and they probably made some

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.470 
took on d6 and they probably made some
mistakes<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:09.460> he<00:02:10.460> had<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.789> sacrifice<00:02:11.090> on

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
tournament for example Fabian even

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.170 
tournament for example Fabian even
though<00:03:02.230> he<00:03:02.440> lost<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:03.069> think<00:03:03.639> two<00:03:03.730> games<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
though he lost I think two games in a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.500 
though he lost I think two games in a
row<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.480> mean<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.620> believe<00:03:05.920> he'll<00:03:06.310> still<00:03:06.609> come

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
row I mean I believe he'll still come

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.240 
row I mean I believe he'll still come
back<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:07.720> mean<00:03:07.900> person<00:03:08.409> just<00:03:08.560> my<00:03:08.709> opinion<00:03:09.069> and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
back I mean person just my opinion and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.280 
back I mean person just my opinion and
so<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:09.849> do<00:03:10.209> believe<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:10.659> everybody<00:03:10.959> has

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
so I do believe that everybody has

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.099 
so I do believe that everybody has
chances<00:03:11.829> just<00:03:12.510> still<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.079> very

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
chances just still a very it's a very

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.930 
chances just still a very it's a very
long<00:03:14.739> term<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.129> it's<00:03:15.280> one<00:03:15.459> one<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.849> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
long term and it's one one of the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.210 
long term and it's one one of the
longest<00:03:16.239> tournaments<00:03:16.569> in<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.780> world<00:03:17.220> okay
