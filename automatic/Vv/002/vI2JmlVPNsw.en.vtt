to you can import them as once to follow
on<00:01:25.890> youtube<00:01:26.369> gaming<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.180> separate<00:01:27.720> so

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
on youtube gaming so it's separate so

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
on youtube gaming so it's separate so
you're<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.799> your<00:01:29.009> followers<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.030> be

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you're so your followers will be

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
you're so your followers will be
separate<00:01:30.570> i<00:01:30.780> guess<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:32.040> regular<00:01:32.220> YouTube

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
separate i guess on your regular YouTube

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.580 
separate i guess on your regular YouTube
videos<00:01:33.000> versus<00:01:33.360> your<00:01:33.540> streaming<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.470> it's

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
videos versus your streaming so it's

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.719 
videos versus your streaming so it's
basically<00:01:34.740> starting<00:01:35.220> from<00:01:35.250> scratch<00:01:35.460> for

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
basically starting from scratch for

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.600 
basically starting from scratch for
everyone<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.140> guess<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.009> guess<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.579> goes

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
they probably because no one cares about

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.140 
they probably because no one cares about
that<00:06:01.350> game<00:06:01.560> but<00:06:01.919> then<00:06:02.070> anytime<00:06:02.669> video<00:06:03.060> was

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
that game but then anytime video was

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.700 
that game but then anytime video was
uploaded<00:06:03.330> or<00:06:03.840> some<00:06:04.050> was<00:06:04.200> training<00:06:04.470> with<00:06:04.500> that

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
uploaded or some was training with that

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.800 
uploaded or some was training with that
you<00:06:05.430> would<00:06:05.550> be<00:06:05.640> alerted<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.030> that<00:06:06.210> so<00:06:06.390> i<00:06:06.660> think

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
you would be alerted to that so i think

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.050 
you would be alerted to that so i think
that's<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.169> cool<00:06:07.350> idea<00:06:07.410> as<00:06:07.979> if<00:06:08.880> you're<00:06:09.030> a

you might be alert i could probably get

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.010

to<00:06:14.250> be<00:06:14.370> too<00:06:14.520> much<00:06:14.550> but<00:06:15.000> if<00:06:15.390> you<00:06:15.510> want<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.780> do<00:06:15.870> it

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
to be too much but if you want to do it

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.990 
to be too much but if you want to do it
why<00:06:16.560> not<00:06:16.590> neither<00:06:17.280> that's<00:06:17.550> really<00:06:17.820> neat

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
why not neither that's really neat

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.100 
why not neither that's really neat
actually<00:06:18.600> um<00:06:19.200> so<00:06:19.470> I<00:06:19.800> will<00:06:20.250> start<00:06:20.340> using<00:06:20.640> this

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
actually um so I will start using this

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.719 
actually um so I will start using this
at<00:06:22.110> some<00:06:22.350> point<00:06:22.560> probably<00:06:22.770> when<00:06:23.070> my<00:06:23.220> one<00:06:23.520> the

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
at some point probably when my one the

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.460 
at some point probably when my one the
books<00:06:23.910> finished<00:06:24.240> we<00:06:24.750> might<00:06:24.930> use<00:06:25.110> this<00:06:25.229> if<00:06:25.380> we

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
books finished we might use this if we

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.080 
books finished we might use this if we
do<00:06:25.560> another<00:06:25.740> marathon<00:06:26.039> charity<00:06:26.580> marathon<00:06:26.729> and

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
do another marathon charity marathon and

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.340 
do another marathon charity marathon and
his<00:06:27.180> marathon<00:06:27.419> we<00:06:27.690> might<00:06:27.870> use<00:06:28.020> this<00:06:28.169> because

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
his marathon we might use this because

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.610 
his marathon we might use this because
it<00:06:28.530> makes<00:06:28.620> sense<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:28.890> use<00:06:29.100> it<00:06:30.050> yeah<00:06:31.050> which<00:06:31.440> did

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
it makes sense to use it yeah which did

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.620 
it makes sense to use it yeah which did
fine<00:06:31.830> but<00:06:32.250> also<00:06:32.460> why<00:06:32.910> do<00:06:32.970> like<00:06:33.270> though<00:06:33.419> is<00:06:33.450> that

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
fine but also why do like though is that

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.120 
fine but also why do like though is that
the<00:06:34.470> one<00:06:34.590> thing<00:06:34.620> we<00:06:34.770> didn't<00:06:34.950> like<00:06:35.039> about

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
the one thing we didn't like about

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.800 
the one thing we didn't like about

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
I think streaming is going to be

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.160 
I think streaming is going to be
streaming<00:07:17.760> and<00:07:18.090> over<00:07:18.420> time<00:07:18.600> as<00:07:18.870> long<00:07:19.020> as

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
streaming and over time as long as

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.630 
streaming and over time as long as
YouTube<00:07:19.500> can<00:07:19.710> keep<00:07:19.890> it<00:07:20.010> up<00:07:20.100> and<00:07:20.280> running<00:07:20.550> and

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
YouTube can keep it up and running and

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.010 
YouTube can keep it up and running and
going<00:07:20.970> you're<00:07:21.540> going<00:07:21.660> to<00:07:21.750> get<00:07:21.840> the<00:07:21.990> same

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
going you're going to get the same

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.620 
going you're going to get the same
audiences<00:07:22.740> everywhere<00:07:22.880> but<00:07:23.880> I<00:07:24.060> mean<00:07:24.270> it'll<00:07:24.480> be

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:24.630 
audiences everywhere but I mean it'll be

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.730 
audiences everywhere but I mean it'll be
interesting<00:07:24.810> to<00:07:24.990> see<00:07:25.080> what<00:07:25.230> does<00:07:25.500> as<00:07:25.710> a

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
interesting to see what does as a

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.380 
interesting to see what does as a
different<00:07:26.220> option<00:07:26.520> i<00:07:26.610> like<00:07:26.790> the<00:07:26.910> ability<00:07:27.090> to

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
different option i like the ability to
