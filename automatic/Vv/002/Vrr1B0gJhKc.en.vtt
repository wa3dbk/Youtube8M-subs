00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
can vent it otherwise the tops going to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.820

blow<00:02:16.770> off<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> lid<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.390> start<00:02:18.630> off<00:02:18.750> slow

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.160 

so<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> flip<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.600> lamb<00:02:27.780> chops

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.460 
so I'm just going to flip the lamb chops
they've<00:02:28.410> got<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> nice<00:02:28.800> char<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:30.120> side

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
they've got a nice char on the one side

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.900 
they've got a nice char on the one side
so<00:02:31.470> that's<00:02:31.590> good<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.640> leave<00:02:32.730> those

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
so that's good just going to leave those

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.110 
so that's good just going to leave those
there<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> second<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.990> while<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.500> I
