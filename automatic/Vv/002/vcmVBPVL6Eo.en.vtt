stanchion<00:00:13.529> kits<00:00:13.740> work<00:00:15.710> first<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.890> I'll<00:00:16.949> do

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
stanchion kits work first what I'll do

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.070 
stanchion kits work first what I'll do
is<00:00:17.250> talk<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.490> what's<00:00:18.300> included<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> kit

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
is talk about what's included in the kit

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.500 
is talk about what's included in the kit
and<00:00:19.260> then<00:00:20.070> I'll<00:00:20.189> talk<00:00:20.430> about<00:00:20.460> all<00:00:21.360> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and then I'll talk about all the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
and then I'll talk about all the
different<00:00:21.600> ways<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.170> use<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.670> kit

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
different ways you can use it so the kit

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.990 
different ways you can use it so the kit
includes<00:00:24.210> two<00:00:24.590> stanchion<00:00:25.590> halves<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:26.760> made

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
includes two stanchion halves which made

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.350 
includes two stanchion halves which made
together<00:00:27.200> at<00:00:28.200> one<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> three<00:00:28.619> locations<00:00:29.360> to

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
together at one of three locations to

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.990 
together at one of three locations to
create<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.619> aluminum<00:00:32.099> stanchion<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
create one aluminum stanchion and what I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
create one aluminum stanchion and what I
mean<00:00:33.239> by<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.449> is<00:00:33.870> depending<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.100> holes

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
mean by that is depending on which holes

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.419 
mean by that is depending on which holes
we<00:00:35.670> use<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.079> line<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
we use and how we line them up we can

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.459 
we use and how we line them up we can
get<00:00:38.519> different<00:00:38.969> interior<00:00:39.629> widths<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.199> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
get different interior widths on the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.309 
get different interior widths on the
stanchion<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.179> preset<00:00:42.600> holes<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:43.079> four

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.319

metal<00:01:10.860> stanchions<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.759> so<00:01:12.509> rather<00:01:12.630> than

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
metal stanchions and so rather than

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
metal stanchions and so rather than
throughout<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> whole<00:01:13.469> thing<00:01:14.060> they<00:01:15.060> can

throughout the whole thing they can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.260 
throughout the whole thing they can
replace<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.990> stanchions<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.270> because

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
replace just the stanchions so because

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
replace just the stanchions so because
of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> way<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:18.719> designed<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.289> being<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> half

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
of the way we designed this being a half

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.440 
of the way we designed this being a half
inch<00:01:20.840> larger<00:01:21.840> than<00:01:22.399> most<00:01:23.399> stocks<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.090> example

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

a 48 inch dock this is 40 48 and a half
inches<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.170> it'll<00:01:28.320> fit<00:01:28.469> over<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.740> top<00:01:29.659> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
inches so it'll fit over the top you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.209 
inches so it'll fit over the top you
could<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:31.020> scrap<00:01:31.469> those<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.859> and<00:01:31.950> replace

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
could just scrap those out and replace

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:33.469 
could just scrap those out and replace
them<00:01:32.399> with<00:01:32.430> these<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:32.850> new<00:01:32.880> ones<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
them with these nice new ones and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.760
