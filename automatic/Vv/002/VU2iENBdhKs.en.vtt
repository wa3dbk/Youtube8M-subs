in<00:03:14.340> some<00:03:14.550> better<00:03:14.730> video<00:03:15.090> equipment<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:16.200> that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
in some better video equipment so that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.290 
in some better video equipment so that
we<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:16.770> get<00:03:17.040> some<00:03:17.490> great<00:03:17.790> shots<00:03:18.090> of
