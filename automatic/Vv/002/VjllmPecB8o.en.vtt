how to work with chilies to fresh

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.560 
how to work with chilies to fresh
chilies<00:00:48.519> to<00:00:48.670> get<00:00:48.790> the<00:00:48.909> flavor<00:00:49.180> but<00:00:49.540> not

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
chilies to get the flavor but not

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.899

head<00:00:52.089> off<00:00:52.119> heat<00:00:52.869> now<00:00:53.409> jalapenos<00:00:54.369> in<00:00:54.640> my

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
head off heat now jalapenos in my

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.399 
head off heat now jalapenos in my
opinion<00:00:55.180> are<00:00:55.299> some<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.659> milder<00:00:55.989> chilies

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
opinion are some of the milder chilies

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.640 
opinion are some of the milder chilies
however<00:00:57.339> on<00:00:57.610> occasion<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:58.180> get<00:00:58.330> one<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.930> think

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
can be in Anaheim I mean jalapeno can be

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.460 
can be in Anaheim I mean jalapeno can be
serrano<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:19.000> is<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.330> flavor<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
serrano this is the flavor of the

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.010 
serrano this is the flavor of the
distinct<00:01:20.860> chili<00:01:21.160> but<00:01:21.910> the<00:01:22.060> heat<00:01:22.360> the

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
distinct chili but the heat the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.100 
distinct chili but the heat the
capsaicin<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.850> seeds<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:25.990> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
capsaicin is in the seeds and the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.560 
capsaicin is in the seeds and the
membrane<00:01:26.530> okay<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.030> think<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.360> really

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
membrane okay actually I think it really

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.540 
membrane okay actually I think it really
is<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:28.930> membrane<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.680> seeds<00:01:29.950> carry

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
is in the membrane but the seeds carry

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.570 
is in the membrane but the seeds carry
the<00:01:30.940> heat<00:01:31.360> with<00:01:31.570> it<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.380> if<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.860> want<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
the heat with it so if you want the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.850 
the heat with it so if you want the
highest<00:01:33.790> level<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.390> heat<00:01:34.630> chop<00:01:35.409> it<00:01:35.560> up<00:01:35.650> and

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
highest level of heat chop it up and

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.230 
highest level of heat chop it up and
leave<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.190> seeds<00:01:36.370> in<00:01:36.490> them<00:01:36.610> right<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:37.030> there

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
leave the seeds in them right in there

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.700 
leave the seeds in them right in there
but<00:01:37.659> if<00:01:37.720> you<00:01:37.810> want<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.020> capture<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> flavor

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
but if you want to capture the flavor

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.600 
but if you want to capture the flavor
and<00:01:39.310> get<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> rounder<00:01:40.330> more<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.620> richness<00:01:42.370> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
and get a rounder more you richness and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.610 
and get a rounder more you richness and
depth<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.970> flavor<00:01:43.210> get<00:01:43.600> rid<00:01:43.750> of<00:01:43.780> those<00:01:43.930> here's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
depth of flavor get rid of those here's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.219 
depth of flavor get rid of those here's
the<00:01:44.770> easiest<00:01:44.979> way<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.159> do<00:01:45.370> it<00:01:45.520> now<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.659> will<00:01:46.960> get

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
the easiest way to do it now it will get

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.290 
the easiest way to do it now it will get
on<00:01:47.290> your<00:01:47.409> hands<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.159> don't<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.729> know<00:01:48.850> go<00:01:49.060> doing

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
on your hands so don't you know go doing

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.580 
on your hands so don't you know go doing
this<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:49.659> then<00:01:49.750> scratch<00:01:49.960> your<00:01:50.140> eye<00:01:50.170> because

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
this and then scratch your eye because

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.710 
this and then scratch your eye because
I've<00:01:50.800> done<00:01:51.010> that<00:01:51.220> and<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.610> really<00:01:51.940> regretted<00:01:52.390> it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
I've done that and I really regretted it

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.940 
I've done that and I really regretted it
but<00:01:53.080> take<00:01:53.260> a<00:01:53.290> spoon<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.070> just<00:01:55.710> pull<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.799> down

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
but take a spoon and just pull it down

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.300 
but take a spoon and just pull it down
through<00:01:56.979> where<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.520> rib<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:58.000> and<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.890> is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
through where that rib is and that is

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
through where that rib is and that is

to the problem is is the capsaicin is

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.129 
to the problem is is the capsaicin is
water<00:03:24.040> soluble<00:03:24.310> meaning<00:03:25.239> that<00:03:25.389> you're<00:03:25.930> going

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
and you need to cool off and you want a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.699 
and you need to cool off and you want a
dairy<00:03:35.049> product<00:03:35.379> sour<00:03:36.129> cream<00:03:36.489> yogurt<00:03:37.180> milk<00:03:38.109> ice

cream whatever this is just hold it okay
now<00:03:42.459> this<00:03:43.060> will<00:03:43.329> actually<00:03:43.840> dissolve<00:03:44.319> the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
now this will actually dissolve the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.680 
now this will actually dissolve the
capsaicin<00:03:44.799> I'm<00:03:45.489> allowing<00:03:45.729> me<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:45.970> wash<00:03:46.510> it
