put the milk in the batter and the
cornmeal<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.129> then<00:02:43.459> I<00:02:43.879> did<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.599> couple

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
cornmeal and then I did that a couple

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.720 
cornmeal and then I did that a couple
times<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.409> he's<00:02:45.739> saying<00:02:45.950> that's<00:02:46.190> not<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.549> good

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730

so you let these draw from the wall to
the<00:05:16.330> food<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.680> can<00:05:17.830> suck<00:05:18.100> up<00:05:18.130> some<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.640> the
