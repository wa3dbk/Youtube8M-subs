00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.630
 I'll do it that way 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.259
 finally get a htc hands 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.880
 that's the job you get here now 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:31.480
 top down in the much desired htc 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.580
 brings you see here so this is yes 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.760
 I would say checkout as here so 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.070
 arranged that you be there the whole 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.780
 get it together then always 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.060
 currently on the beach to say if you 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.660
 usually the message jumps on it 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.380
 in like the other wages of htc wants 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.410
 should then have here in Germany 340 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.960
 content provider to be with him 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.230
 Of course, content provides the big ones 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 are there like for example the dpa 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.200
 Gruner Jahr and so before was the magazine 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 and so on 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.250
 Of course that's a nice thing 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.320
 you can always do that a proper one 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.730
 of course sort that out 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.190
 Here are currently German 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.900
 press agency so say the gbr and 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.490
 the star is served but you can also 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.840
 I'll tell others 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.090
 content provider there to add one 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.230
 Of course you can also use his social network 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.960
 be more or less even in 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:31.360
 give this view something at some point 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:35.500
 so luck had he known so far 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.610
 Clock and weather status the second 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.990
 Highlight is more or 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.210
 less on the back that's the one 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.460
 the camera you hear and be amazed has 4.3 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 megapixel 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.520
 4 3 megapixel 40 is very much on however 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.380
 htc has content here ultra pixel 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.659
 used and rob change are the jokes 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.690
 bigger so much more light 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.479
 recorded and will then stop in 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.490
 its diminutive environment better 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.710
 generate image results 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.489
 in addition is also still in the camera 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.310
 htc and had fitted with seesen 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.440
 function if you take photos when 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.690
 you do not click on it then you see 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.220
 you already have a red status both there 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 will be in my little one at the same time 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.760
 video recorded with that you say then 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.260
 I can use for the htc sony 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.060
 that simply means that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.760
 content is being recorded and then 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.940
 can one from it nice videos then market 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.320
 but he had limited 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.160
 our sport everything with one 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.600
 video source active 1920 1080 and that 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.200
 whole display is of course also 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.910
 full hd club pressure we look 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.450
 times the outer dimensions 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.530
 here comes the sympathy mr a 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.489
 difficult to recognize the otherwise no 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.650
 holes more come in here 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.370
 HTC Federal Office Stereo Speaker 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.690
 once here and once there behind it 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 there is also a small one 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.610
 status led then lights up when 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.049
 look then get in news 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.880
 we'll see you soon after 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.060
 somewhere a mediaplayer in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.340
 semi-open media 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.670
 but what music and unfortunately no music 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.880
 and what else is there for them 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.020
 say front camera is 1 megapixel and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.610
 you look in the frame are the two 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.430
 ski back once and left 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.540
 once content a homebutton otherwise 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.590
 about 5 -display buttons at least 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.410
 are the display when you look at it 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.610
 the black looks is very very 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.920
 ingenious 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.880
 that's a really deep stuff 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 black and soon has everything 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.900
 housing made of aluminum that is milled 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 completely milled 100 other manufacturers 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.799
 always say full metal case where should 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.739
 let in the antenna 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.470
 we are plastic things but we do 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.080
 hardly feels a seam of the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.530
 third best time completely seamless and 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.160
 of course very nice form what it is 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.539
 stop and in hand 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.010
 For comparison , I would now again 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.720
 from my other pants pockets that are 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.370
 not even other smartphones 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.410
 out that for example that then 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.410
 someone the samsung galaxy s3 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.030
 It's easy from the thick 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.410
 we can look again about 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.410
 similarly thick and similarly tall and built 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.560
 actually almost identical the day before 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.760
 was the galaxy s3 and if i am now 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.880
 still the predecessor of the htc watch 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.550
 extract 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.550
 that's the htc evo ix 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.650
 actually identical big displays 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.300
 but in the display of ktc vanessa one 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.130
 been put on it 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:20.650
 a small highlight is at the top 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:23.050
 still in there is the headphones and here 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.510
 is namely the other off then 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:30.990
 The switch also serves as infrared 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:33.610
 sender that is in this app at tv 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.039
 you could theoretically too 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.120
 I use your television and 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.340
 In addition, yes, it's never been 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.650
 that means when you integrate the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.330
 has configured tv and then one 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.280
 broadcast here you see like you want to see 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.410
 then just hit it and the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.340
 The transmitter will be on your TV immediately 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.330
 I changed 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.010
 Here you can have one again 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.030
 remote Control 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.110
 the tv is not there now me 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.820
 can switch off now also one 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.780
 here is also for example on it 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.750
 samsung tv is also supported htc 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.420
 also supports a collector very much 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.930
 interesting otherwise my first 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:12.020
 impression of HTC onyx a great device 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.460
 a very fancy device and above all 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.570
 things; matters 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.850
 I think it's worth the wait 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.940
 until march when it starts 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.880
 of course available from us and also 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.010
 imaginable that's just a color that 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.400
 is the silver it will be in there too 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:32.140
 black give memory execution 32 gb 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 4 core processor with 1 gigahertz 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.570
 all further technical information 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.340
 Of course you can join us on the 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.310
 website of today picked up 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.260
 and yes I 'm already curious if 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.200
 we already get stuck around that 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.090
 content in detail to test it 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.360
 has some things such as htc 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.870
 ii and also flashing feed times in the 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.310
 configuration can show and it is so 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.260
 many things in it also comparative images 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.200
 with other cameras would be natural 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.960
 interesting are at 3 megapixel in it 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.660
 that's the mega pixel southeast of 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.760
 htc always speaks it does not mean that 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.000
 more and more megapixels too 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.200
 synonymous with better pictures 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.340
 Of course, you can also contribute everything else 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:19.930
 read us on our website 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.930
 maybe video too 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:33.650
 Hofbieber and Consti one for everything
