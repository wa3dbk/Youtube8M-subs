the<00:00:07.680> car<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.580> um<00:00:10.340> I<00:00:11.340> had<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.969> get<00:00:12.090> it

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
the car as I got it um I had to get it

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.509 
the car as I got it um I had to get it
running<00:00:12.330> car<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.650> car<00:00:13.889> hadn't<00:00:14.190> been<00:00:14.280> ran

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
running car the car hadn't been ran

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.159 
running car the car hadn't been ran
since<00:00:14.960> 2003<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.610> had<00:00:17.790> old<00:00:18.119> stale<00:00:18.509> gasoline

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
since 2003 and it had old stale gasoline

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.670 
since 2003 and it had old stale gasoline
in<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.210> pumped<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.140> gasoline

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
in it so I pumped it all the gasoline

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.070 
in it so I pumped it all the gasoline
out<00:00:22.859> through<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> fuel<00:00:23.970> pump<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.960> has

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
out through the fuel pump because it has

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.390 
out through the fuel pump because it has
a<00:00:25.109> continuously<00:00:25.920> run

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
a continuously run

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.250 
a continuously run
fuel<00:00:26.580> pump<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.359> external<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:30.230> basically<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
fuel pump on it external and basically I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.160 
fuel pump on it external and basically I
got<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> car<00:00:31.740> running<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.340> since<00:00:33.239> then<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
got the car running and since then the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.430 
got the car running and since then the
air<00:00:34.710> pump<00:00:34.980> has<00:00:35.190> gone<00:00:35.400> out<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:36.750> fan<00:00:37.019> clutch

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
air pump has gone out the fan clutch

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.829 
air pump has gone out the fan clutch

and go ahead and replace all those parts
moveable<00:00:50.220> parts<00:00:50.430> because<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> rotary

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
moveable parts because it is a rotary

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.200 
moveable parts because it is a rotary
engine<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.589> and<00:00:53.010> we'll<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.909> goes

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
engine so and we'll see how that goes

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.719 
engine so and we'll see how that goes
but<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.799> what<00:00:56.220> it<00:00:56.339> look<00:00:56.489> like

somebody had an aftermarket radio in

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.220 
somebody had an aftermarket radio in
here<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.850> just<00:03:00.000> didn't<00:03:00.360> do<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> good<00:03:00.690> job<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:01.200> it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
here and just didn't do a good job on it

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.789 
here and just didn't do a good job on it
so<00:03:01.910> I'm<00:03:02.910> gonna<00:03:03.060> put<00:03:03.330> new<00:03:03.480> carpet<00:03:03.540> in<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.230> cheap

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
so I'm gonna put new carpet in it cheap

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.479 
so I'm gonna put new carpet in it cheap
carpet<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:06.600> go<00:03:06.810> ahead<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:08.250> know<00:03:08.310> like

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
carpet and go ahead and you know like

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.370 
carpet and go ahead and you know like
that<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.910> won't<00:03:09.120> run<00:03:09.390> right<00:03:09.630> now<00:03:09.660> because<00:03:10.200> it's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that it won't run right now because it's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.699 
that it won't run right now because it's
got<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> smog<00:03:10.950> pump<00:03:11.190> problem<00:03:12.109> and<00:03:13.109> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
got a smog pump problem and the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.780 
got a smog pump problem and the
alternator

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
alternator

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.110 
alternator
going<00:03:15.659> out<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.310> fan<00:03:17.310> clutch<00:03:17.579> seized<00:03:18.799> so<00:03:20.120> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
going out and fan clutch seized so it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.080 
going out and fan clutch seized so it
kind<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.510> will<00:03:22.200> not<00:03:22.379> start<00:03:22.849> so<00:03:23.849> I<00:03:23.879> might

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
kind of will not start so I might

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.869 
kind of will not start so I might
replace<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.989> that's<00:03:25.260> probably<00:03:25.650> about

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
replace all that that's probably about

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.530 
replace all that that's probably about
$300<00:03:26.879> worth<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.390> parts<00:03:27.799> I'm<00:03:29.000> guessing<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.269> know

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
$300 worth of parts I'm guessing I know

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.420 
$300 worth of parts I'm guessing I know
