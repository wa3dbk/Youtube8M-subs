00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.500

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.220

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.890
 chic 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.560
 I want to immediately say that the film is very 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 dynamic funny character animations 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 the scenery around is just amazing 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
 before 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.980
 I do not want you to spoil because this movie 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.780
 has a pretty good plot for 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.610
 which is interesting to watch but if 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.680
 talk about a little background 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.960
 the essence of the film that is one artifact 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.240
 who want to get everything in that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.700
 including and our guardians of the galaxy and after 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.970
 small scuffles in the city they 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.710

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.980
 moving forward to adventure 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.230
 Consider it a business partnership and 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.210
 In general, the plot is very dynamic in two 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.730
 hours I spent watching 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.230

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 doubts 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.030
 by the way i caught myself thinking after 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.280
 out of the movie showing the guardians of the galaxy 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.439
 that this film is really cooler than 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.689
 the avengers because the film is really cool for 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.749

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.689

 starring drax the destroyer and mr 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.879
 anabolic david batista and he's enough 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.159
 copes well with its role as 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.829
 for wrestler 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.419

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.879
 the blood is also played here by the actress zoe 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.280
 saldana is the woman who has the screen in 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.769
 avatar but his guardians of the galaxy she 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.239
 decided to try on the mask evil

 killers and homomors 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.729
 but she is pretty good 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:28.080
 it turns out and she is well accustomed to the role 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:31.140
 which is worth applause 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.540

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.450

 diesel engine which voiced the group tree 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.190
 it was quite colorful character 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.100
 but it is a pity that throughout the film 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.290
 he has very few words and a character 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.970

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.080

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.570
 rocket bodyguards 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.060
 well, the most important and funny character 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.460
 a raccoon called rocket voiced him 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.910
 bradley cooper is the dude who played 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.560
 bachelor party in vegas and with the help of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.980
 motion capture sensors and facial expressions 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.270
 so cool conveyed all the emotions and but 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.680
 the fact that there is simply no word rocket wanted 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.850
 for fifty and more hijackings escaped 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.269

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.470

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.830
 but damn seriously this is the best cameo Stan 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.840
 vive films from marvel 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.540

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.210

 In general, my result will not lie 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.340
 the movie didnâ€™t like this one very much 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.160
 the film is really cooler than the avengers on him 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.160
 be sure to go to the cinema like 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.200
