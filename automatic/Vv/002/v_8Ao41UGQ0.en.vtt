00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.170 

you<00:00:04.319> can<00:00:04.500> use<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.830> high<00:00:05.009> sample<00:00:05.549> setting<00:00:06.000> in

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
you can use the high sample setting in

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.419 
you can use the high sample setting in
the<00:00:06.750> mental<00:00:07.080> ray<00:00:07.200> area<00:00:07.620> light<00:00:07.830> section<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
the mental ray area light section of the

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.700 
the mental ray area light section of the
attribute<00:00:08.880> editor<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.870> improve<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.469> quality

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
attribute editor to improve the quality

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860 
attribute editor to improve the quality
of<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> shadows<00:00:11.610> cast<00:00:11.910> by<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> area<00:00:12.690> light

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
of the shadows cast by the area light

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.079 
of the shadows cast by the area light
I'm<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> do<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.830> test<00:00:14.160> render<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.639> using

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
I'm going to do a test render here using

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.980 
I'm going to do a test render here using
the<00:00:15.179> default<00:00:15.540> settings<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:18.510> we<00:00:18.539> can<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.810> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the default settings so we can see that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140 
the default settings so we can see that
the<00:00:19.080> shadow<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.740> soft<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.490> also<00:00:20.670> fairly

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
the shadow is soft but it's also fairly

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.410 
the shadow is soft but it's also fairly
grainy<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.699> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.470> save<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.710> image

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
grainy so I'm going to save this image

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.609 
grainy so I'm going to save this image
minimize<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.320> double

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
minimize this and I'm going to double

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
minimize this and I'm going to double
this<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.910> 16<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.669> create<00:00:32.669> another<00:00:32.940> test

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
this to 16 and create another test

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.660 
this to 16 and create another test
render<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> add<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> little<00:00:35.370> bit<00:00:35.489> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
render it's going to add a little bit to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
render it's going to add a little bit to
render<00:00:35.969> time<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> start<00:00:37.200> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
render time but it is going to start to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.940 
render time but it is going to start to
improve<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.920> quality<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.000> shadow<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
improve the quality of the shadow so we

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.850 
improve the quality of the shadow so we
can<00:00:41.100> compare<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> looks<00:00:42.030> like<00:00:42.149> before<00:00:42.860> -

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
can compare what it looks like before -

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.529 
can compare what it looks like before -
after<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.850> subtle<00:00:47.270> I'm<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
after it's a bit subtle I'm going to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.910 
after it's a bit subtle I'm going to
zoom<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.379> make<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.649> bit<00:00:49.770> more

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
zoom in here to make it a bit more

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
zoom in here to make it a bit more
obvious<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.600> what<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> high<00:00:51.989> sample<00:00:52.469> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
obvious this is what the high sample is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
obvious this is what the high sample is
set<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> 16<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> high<00:00:54.390> sample<00:00:54.870> set<00:00:55.079> to

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
set to 16 and this is high sample set to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.479 
set to 16 and this is high sample set to
aid<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.739> can<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
aid so you can see that there is a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.279 
aid so you can see that there is a
difference<00:00:56.910> there

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
difference there

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
difference there
so<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.410> you're<00:00:58.649> tuning<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.340> shadows<00:00:59.820> you're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
so as you're tuning your shadows you're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
so as you're tuning your shadows you're
gonna<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:00.510> want<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> increase<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
gonna probably want to increase this

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
gonna probably want to increase this
slowly<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.870> test<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> go<00:01:04.460> area<00:01:05.460> lights<00:01:05.700> by

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
slowly and test as you go area lights by

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
slowly and test as you go area lights by
their<00:01:06.510> very<00:01:06.689> nature<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.409> usually<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
their very nature are usually going to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
their very nature are usually going to
take<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.909> longer<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.479> render<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.960> other

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
take a bit longer to render than other

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
take a bit longer to render than other
light<00:01:10.560> types<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.310> something<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> be

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
light types so that's something to be

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
light types so that's something to be
aware<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.210> when<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> start<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> add<00:01:13.110> them<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
aware of when you start to add them to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.890 
aware of when you start to add them to
your<00:01:13.470> scene<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.640> more<00:01:14.790> area<00:01:15.150> lights<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> use

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
your scene the more area lights you use

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
your scene the more area lights you use
the<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.680> you're<00:01:16.979> gonna<00:01:17.100> add<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> render

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the more you're gonna add to the render

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
the more you're gonna add to the render
time<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.650> already<00:01:19.830> starting<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
time but this is already starting to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.789 
time but this is already starting to
look<00:01:20.549> very<00:01:20.580> nice<00:01:21.140> then<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.350> even<00:01:22.500> see<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
look very nice then we can even see the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.370 
look very nice then we can even see the
shadows<00:01:23.130> cast<00:01:23.400> by<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.750> chairs<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.049> look

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
shadows cast by the chairs here look

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
shadows cast by the chairs here look
pretty<00:01:25.619> good<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:28.170> other<00:01:28.200> settings<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
pretty good the other settings here the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.920 
pretty good the other settings here the
high<00:01:29.369> sample<00:01:29.850> limit<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> low<00:01:30.659> sample

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
high sample limit and the low sample

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
high sample limit and the low sample
limit<00:01:31.350> these<00:01:31.500> are<00:01:31.710> both<00:01:31.890> related<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.549> how<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
limit these are both related to how the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.630 
limit these are both related to how the
shadow<00:01:33.180> appears<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.930> reflections<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> have

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
shadow appears in reflections so I have

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
shadow appears in reflections so I have
a<00:01:35.670> mirror<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.540> scene<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
a mirror in the scene and I'm going to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.450 
a mirror in the scene and I'm going to
unhide<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.100> by<00:01:38.310> pressing<00:01:38.970> shift<00:01:39.390> age<00:01:40.460> it's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
unhide it by pressing shift age it's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.120 
unhide it by pressing shift age it's
just<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.700> polygon<00:01:42.090> plane<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.720> has<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
just a polygon plane and has a

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.219 
just a polygon plane and has a
reflective<00:01:44.130> Blinn<00:01:44.729> shader<00:01:45.450> applied<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.110> it

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
reflective Blinn shader applied to it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.319 
reflective Blinn shader applied to it
reflectivity<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.159> set<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> 1<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.060> I'm<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.299> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
reflectivity is set to 1 so I'm going to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
reflectivity is set to 1 so I'm going to
make<00:01:48.479> sure<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.979> everything<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.070> reflected

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
make sure that everything is reflected

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.319 
make sure that everything is reflected
on<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> plane<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> I'm<00:01:53.369> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.579> create

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
on the plane and I'm going to create

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.580 
on the plane and I'm going to create
another<00:01:54.420> test<00:01:54.960> render<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> common

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
another test render so this is a common

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.740 
another test render so this is a common
mistake<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.100> make<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> forget<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> adjust

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
mistake to make is to forget to adjust

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
mistake to make is to forget to adjust
the<00:02:01.140> settings<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> shadow<00:02:02.430> appears

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the settings so that the shadow appears

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.690 
the settings so that the shadow appears
in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.719> reflection<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
in the reflection so what I'm going to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.469 
in the reflection so what I'm going to
do<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.939> I'm<00:02:06.030> going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> minimize<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.869> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
do is I'm going to minimize this and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.020 
do is I'm going to minimize this and
scroll<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.649> Ray<00:02:10.950> depth<00:02:11.280> limit<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
scroll up here to Ray depth limit and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
scroll up here to Ray depth limit and
I'm<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.360> to

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
I'm going to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.460 
I'm going to
set<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.800> -<00:02:13.010> -<00:02:13.280> which<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.060> ensure<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
set this - - which will ensure that the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.500 
set this - - which will ensure that the
shadow<00:02:15.710> does<00:02:16.010> appear<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.730> reflection<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
shadow does appear in the reflection and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.640 
shadow does appear in the reflection and
I'm<00:02:17.630> gonna<00:02:17.780> render<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.230> region<00:02:18.560> again<00:02:20.590> now<00:02:21.590> we

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
I'm gonna render the region again now we

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.080 
I'm gonna render the region again now we
can<00:02:21.860> see<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.130> shadow<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.670> can<00:02:22.820> clearly

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
can see the shadow and you can clearly

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.810 
can see the shadow and you can clearly
see<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.750> shadow<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:25.340> bit<00:02:25.520> lower

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
see that this shadow is a bit lower

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.930 
see that this shadow is a bit lower
quality<00:02:26.120> than<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.290> shadow<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.580> reason

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
quality than this shadow and the reason

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.340 
quality than this shadow and the reason
for<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.750> actually<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> more

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
for this is this is actually a more

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.680 
for this is this is actually a more
efficient<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:30.980> render<00:02:31.370> because<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.420> many

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
efficient way to render because in many

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.660 
efficient way to render because in many
scenes<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.620> might<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:34.010> be<00:02:34.160> necessarily

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
scenes you might not be necessarily

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.790 
scenes you might not be necessarily
concerned<00:02:35.270> with<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.990> quality<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> shadow

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
concerned with the quality of the shadow

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
concerned with the quality of the shadow
and<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.070> reflections<00:02:37.550> now<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.030> case<00:02:38.209> I'm

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
and the reflections now in this case I'm

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.630 
and the reflections now in this case I'm
using<00:02:38.450> something<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.020> 100%<00:02:39.860> reflective

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
using something that's 100% reflective

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.699 
using something that's 100% reflective
so<00:02:40.850> it's<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.090> mirror<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.230> if<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.470> was

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
so it's a mirror but if this was

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.340 
so it's a mirror but if this was
something<00:02:43.130> like<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.310> window<00:02:43.820> or<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.780> metal<00:02:45.200> piece

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
something like a window or a metal piece

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.170 
something like a window or a metal piece
like<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.920> candlestick<00:02:46.550> or<00:02:46.730> something<00:02:47.090> like

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
like the candlestick or something like

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.960 
like the candlestick or something like
that<00:02:47.239> probably<00:02:48.080> don't<00:02:48.620> want<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.610> worry<00:02:49.880> about

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
that probably don't want to worry about

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.060 
that probably don't want to worry about
getting<00:02:50.300> absolutely<00:02:50.989> perfect<00:02:51.470> shadows<00:02:51.860> in

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
getting absolutely perfect shadows in

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.680 
getting absolutely perfect shadows in
the<00:02:52.160> reflections<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:52.910> things<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:53.330> metal

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the reflections of things like metal

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.840 
the reflections of things like metal
objects<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.830> this<00:02:54.950> case<00:02:55.220> having<00:02:55.670> a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
objects so in this case having a

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.350 
objects so in this case having a
separate<00:02:56.570> control<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.520> quality<00:02:59.060> is

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
separate control for that quality is

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.350 
separate control for that quality is
very<00:02:59.750> useful<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.190> basically<00:03:01.700> says<00:03:02.000> how

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
very useful and this basically says how

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.020 
very useful and this basically says how
many<00:03:02.420> times<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:04.220> shadow<00:03:04.520> going<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:04.940> be

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
many times is this shadow going to be

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.620 
many times is this shadow going to be
reflected<00:03:05.720> before<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:07.100> uses<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.760> low<00:03:08.030> samples

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
this to two and do a test render what

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.810 
this to two and do a test render what
it's<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.290> say<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.830> okay<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.310> can<00:03:19.459> cast

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
it's going to say is okay you can cast

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.840 
it's going to say is okay you can cast
that<00:03:19.970> shadow<00:03:20.299> on<00:03:20.390> two<00:03:20.570> surfaces<00:03:21.140> one<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:21.950> two

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
that shadow on two surfaces one and two

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.150 
that shadow on two surfaces one and two
and<00:03:23.420> each<00:03:23.660> time<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.230> use<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.980> high

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and each time you do that use the high

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.820

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
samples limit which is set to 24 so this

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.470 
samples limit which is set to 24 so this
is<00:03:28.010> going<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.190> make<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.549> render<00:03:29.299> take<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
is going to make the render take a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.550 
is going to make the render take a
little<00:03:29.690> bit<00:03:29.810> longer<00:03:30.049> but<00:03:30.260> you're<00:03:30.410> going<00:03:30.500> to

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
little bit longer but you're going to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.740 
little bit longer but you're going to
see<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.130> shadow<00:03:31.400> quality<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.239> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
see that the shadow quality in the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.780 
see that the shadow quality in the
reflected<00:03:33.230> surface<00:03:33.680> looks<00:03:34.100> very<00:03:34.370> nice<00:03:34.519> it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
reflected surface looks very nice it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.699 
reflected surface looks very nice it
looks<00:03:35.000> just<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.630> good<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.140> if<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:36.530> had<00:03:36.680> a

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
looks just as good as this if I had a

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.130 
looks just as good as this if I had a
third<00:03:37.040> reflective<00:03:37.700> surface<00:03:38.120> in<00:03:38.299> here<00:03:38.330> like

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
third reflective surface in here like

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.780 
third reflective surface in here like
another<00:03:39.500> mirror<00:03:39.830> over<00:03:40.040> here<00:03:40.190> or<00:03:40.459> something

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
another mirror over here or something

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.539 
another mirror over here or something
like<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:42.049> mirror<00:03:42.590> these<00:03:43.130> shadows

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
like that that mirror these shadows

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.550 
like that that mirror these shadows
would<00:03:43.850> look<00:03:44.120> lower<00:03:44.450> quality<00:03:45.019> they<00:03:45.230> would<00:03:45.380> have

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
would look lower quality they would have

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.890 
would look lower quality they would have
a<00:03:45.590> sample<00:03:46.070> limit<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.489> 1<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.630> if<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.810> increase

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
a sample limit of 1 so if I increase

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.640 
a sample limit of 1 so if I increase
this<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.530> 3<00:03:48.890> then<00:03:49.640> all<00:03:50.209> three<00:03:50.810> services<00:03:51.049> the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
this to 3 then all three services the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.949 
this to 3 then all three services the
table<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.280> two<00:03:52.459> mirrors<00:03:52.790> would<00:03:53.690> use<00:03:53.930> a

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
table and the two mirrors would use a

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.979 
table and the two mirrors would use a
high<00:03:54.350> samples<00:03:54.799> limit<00:03:55.070> of<00:03:55.220> 24<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.870> is

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
high samples limit of 24 so this is

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.420 
high samples limit of 24 so this is
important<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.440> know<00:03:57.590> because<00:03:57.829> it's<00:03:58.160> tempting

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
important to know because it's tempting

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.340 
important to know because it's tempting
when<00:03:58.670> you're<00:03:58.790> trying<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.150> tune<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.049> look<00:04:00.200> of

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
when you're trying to tune the look of

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.530 
when you're trying to tune the look of
the<00:04:00.410> shadows<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:00.860> just<00:04:01.370> start<00:04:01.610> pumping<00:04:02.420> up

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
the shadows to just start pumping up

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.270 
the shadows to just start pumping up
anything<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:02.989> says<00:04:03.290> samples<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.040> high

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
anything that says samples to a high

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.580 
anything that says samples to a high
level<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.820> if<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.450> do<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.170> there's<00:04:06.350> no

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
level and if you do that and there's no

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.949 
level and if you do that and there's no
reflective<00:04:07.130> surfaces<00:04:07.670> in<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.510> scene<00:04:08.750> you're

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
reflective surfaces in the scene you're

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.210 
reflective surfaces in the scene you're
not<00:04:09.110> going<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.350> see<00:04:09.530> any<00:04:09.650> difference<00:04:09.680> no

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
not going to see any difference no

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.130 
not going to see any difference no
matter<00:04:10.370> how<00:04:10.610> high<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.060> said<00:04:11.420> this<00:04:11.630> or<00:04:11.930> how

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
matter how high you said this or how

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.870 
matter how high you said this or how
high<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:12.440> said<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:13.010> this<00:04:13.250> is<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.459> only

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
high you said that this is the only

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.520 
high you said that this is the only
control<00:04:14.329> that's<00:04:15.110> going<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.350> make<00:04:15.500> a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
control that's going to make a

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.750 
control that's going to make a
difference<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.190> way<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.489> your<00:04:16.579> shadow

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
difference in the way that your shadow

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.060 
difference in the way that your shadow
looks<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.359> initial<00:04:17.720> surface<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.620> only<00:04:18.769> use

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
looks on the initial surface so only use

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.099 
looks on the initial surface so only use
these<00:04:19.400> two<00:04:19.729> settings<00:04:20.180> when<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.870> have

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
these two settings when you have

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.140 
these two settings when you have
reflective<00:04:21.919> surfaces<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.910> scene

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
reflective surfaces in the scene

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.570 
reflective surfaces in the scene
otherwise<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.960> are<00:04:23.990> just<00:04:24.229> basically<00:04:24.620> wasting

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
otherwise you are just basically wasting

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.760 
otherwise you are just basically wasting
time
