of a power strip over the UPS is that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
of a power strip over the UPS is that
the<00:00:54.660> UPS<00:00:55.230> draws<00:00:55.800> additional<00:00:56.610> power<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.629> order

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the UPS draws additional power in order

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.590 
the UPS draws additional power in order
to<00:00:57.989> keep<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> batteries<00:00:58.649> charged<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.600> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
to keep the batteries charged and to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
to keep the batteries charged and to
regulate<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> power<00:01:01.489> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> don't<00:01:02.879> need

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
regulate the power if you don't need

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
regulate the power if you don't need
regulated<00:01:04.170> power<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:04.799> you're<00:01:04.949> running

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
regulated power because you're running

your<00:01:05.430> blender<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.450> power<00:01:07.439> strip<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> much

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
your blender a power strip is a much

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
your blender a power strip is a much
better<00:01:08.310> choice<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.770> may<00:01:10.890> need<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> better

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
better choice now you may need a better

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
better choice now you may need a better

that I held up is just a power strip it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
that I held up is just a power strip it
doesn't<00:01:52.979> offer<00:01:53.130> any<00:01:53.430> surge<00:01:53.640> protection<00:01:54.060> it's

doesn't offer any surge protection it's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.410 
doesn't offer any surge protection it's
a<00:01:54.360> cheap<00:01:54.630> three<00:01:54.990> dollar<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:55.680> Ikea<00:01:56.100> and

a cheap three dollar one from Ikea and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.580 
a cheap three dollar one from Ikea and
so<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.780> doing<00:01:58.049> anything<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> protect

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so it's not doing anything to protect

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.830 
so it's not doing anything to protect
you<00:01:58.920> from<00:01:59.040> lightning<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.850> high<00:02:00.360> voltage

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
power strip or a surge protector is also

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.089 
power strip or a surge protector is also
important<00:02:08.599> do<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> need<00:02:09.899> noise<00:02:10.560> reduction

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
important do you need noise reduction

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.199 
important do you need noise reduction
the<00:02:11.910> particular<00:02:12.390> ups<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.290> picked

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the particular ups that I picked

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.600 
the particular ups that I picked
doesn't<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.450> noise<00:02:16.200> reduction<00:02:16.620> built<00:02:17.189> into

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
doesn't have noise reduction built into

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.920 
doesn't have noise reduction built into
it<00:02:18.049> noise<00:02:19.049> reduction<00:02:20.150> filters<00:02:21.150> all<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.750> power

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it noise reduction filters all the power

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.619 
it noise reduction filters all the power
basically<00:02:22.530> through<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.129> batteries<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.360> is

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
basically through the batteries this is

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.589 
basically through the batteries this is
great<00:02:25.379> if<00:02:25.620> you've<00:02:25.860> got<00:02:26.189> a<00:02:26.489> home<00:02:27.090> theater

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
great if you've got a home theater

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
good ground but the problem with it is

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.640

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
time according to their statistics I'm

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.270 
time according to their statistics I'm
going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.579> use<00:04:02.669> a<00:04:02.730> lot<00:04:03.000> less<00:04:03.030> power<00:04:03.599> than<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
going to use a lot less power than I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.030 
going to use a lot less power than I
would<00:04:05.639> have<00:04:05.819> used<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.109> traditional<00:04:07.319> UPS

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
would have used with a traditional UPS

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.860 
would have used with a traditional UPS
so<00:04:09.379> there<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.590> no<00:04:10.859> for<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.609> win<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.599> need<00:04:12.780> to

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
so there is no for the win you need to

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.000 
so there is no for the win you need to
have<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.139> right<00:04:13.319> tool<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.949> right

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
have the right tool for the right

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.280 
have the right tool for the right
application
