00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.450
 all hunter presses and in this video 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.670
 I will tell about various subjects and shit 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.160
 craft will show how beautiful they work and 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.050
 so I'll start with the rest on anyone not for 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.990
 so that the spark is needed very much 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.070
 steel 4 steel ingots and three 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.560
 steel block 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 blocks of beautiful in this way of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.000
 nine steel bars and she 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.400
 practically no different from 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.930
 the usual anvil of minecraft one 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.500
 only difference is that it is much 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.660
 stronger no more differences in general 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.589
 is it worth spending a lot of stalin in order 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.659
 to make or not you decide so 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.870
 next we have an engraving workbench 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:44.050
 to craft you need 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.670
 piston steel plate workbench book 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.620
 and diamond pickaxe 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.149
 in order to get steel 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.989
 plates must be used 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.459
 rolling mill 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.109
 4 steel ingots 4 steel plates 

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:58.749
 then you need to submit it to the Russian Federation 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.699
 energy that is connect either closely 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.969
 engine or electric pipes 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.710
 more precisely energy pipes 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.400
 open inventory inner right 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.010
 mouse click 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.110
 then choosing the more mu further court 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 must be placed either gold bar 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.290
 either steel and make engrave 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.980
 after this dream the creation process began 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.140
 and you get vodka from the emblem if its 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.710
 take in hand you will see a full-sized 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.190
 then that sword can then be framed 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 come right click 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.490
 I can right click it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.160
 twist for those who do not know how 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.640
 crafted this frame needed skin and 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:45.020
 shelves here it is 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 hang up just right click 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.470
 click to remove the left mouse button 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.330
 press and the emblem disappears so 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.000
 By the way there are other emblems that 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.630
 need to unlock i know current 2 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.670
 where the radiation sign is drawn and yet 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.490
 I donâ€™t remember exactly what kind of emblem 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.920
 Looks like I found these codes in Russian 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.690
 wiki im therefore in describing these codes 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:17.209
 so on two chests one chests 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.070
 for metals another hollow chest 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.730
 we will probably start with this chest 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.430
 to craft you need 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.959
 steel hex piston and anvil 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 the anvil usually 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.500
 from minecraft which for those who are not 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.880
 knows how to croc so stop 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.100
 photodiode steel gears I already 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.230
 told but let's see 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.880
 steel ingot tin bushing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.340
 gears 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.610
 sleeve of four tin ingots i 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.760
 I think you understand me so that's what 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.620
 do yeah well the chest he turns here 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.640
 these in gold bars or any other 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.600
 ingots in the block throws here we see 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.310
 he collects them that is, given the chest he 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.680
 how would you save space just 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.960
 toss and cage ships and he himself 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.970
 automatically turns them like this 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.300
 here are the blocks 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.890
 and if cells from another fashion he 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.220
 first, in theory, should do exactly 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.490
 pond of this mod. so we see 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.510
 wellcraft 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.550
 copper ingot he did differently made 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.570
 but how if disassemble this copper block 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.180
 what happens there we see bars zara 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.490
 Ukravto that is, he seems to be prescribed 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.450
 you can even take your ingots 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.080
 eg 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.220
 tin ingots from another mod so though 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:49.560
 no hell 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 tin there are craft rules so head here 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.080
 from half ingot from industrial craft 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.180
 experimental throws when he immediately 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.799
 does the block exactly royal krakow 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.819
 let's take so 8 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:09.720
 look half ingot kraft edge so 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.310
 Further we Hollow chest, he 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.170
 destroys all the things that are in it 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.700
 fall into 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.190
 and he destroys them from playing them 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.539
 return can no longer be and never 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.300
 in order to color it is necessary 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:27.760
 obsidian and ender pearls 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.030
 Krav pretty simple and use 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.190
 just huge, the simplest is 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.930
 trashcan 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.979
 well then we have a smoke generator 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.930
 this is a decorative block 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.470
 no other function than this 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.970
 here's a visual smoke he no longer has 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.150
 so in order for you to craft you 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.850
 Hellstone pot is needed 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.940
 red dust and this house is it 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.900
 rises to a height of 30 blocks and than he 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.130
 higher we see it becomes less 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.680
 here at the maximum height of it 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.080
 practically not visible in general can 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.080
 do whom are such cool rooms with 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.690
 this smoke 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.000
 Well, I think on this all put huskies 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.270
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.270
 meeting
