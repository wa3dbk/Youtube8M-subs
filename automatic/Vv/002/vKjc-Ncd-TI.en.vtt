00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 very good to all welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.610
 of animals today we are going to travel millions 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.469
 of years ago with the dinosaurs 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 concretely to the Jurassic period for 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.289
 see what dinosaurs were more 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.029
 intelligent things that were at that time 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 5 species of dinosaurs I'm going to name 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.340
 5 species that were the most 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.189
 smart of his time is to say that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.980
 with the passage of evolution then all 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.410
 this intelligence that they had is very 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 inferior to the one that now some 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.239
 simple organisms have for example 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 the mice nonetheless at that time 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 they were considered the smartest 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.290
 let's start with the list that is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.020
 quite curious and has dinosaurs that 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.539
 you will know we have for example the obi 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 raptor the obi raptor was one of the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.730
 dinosaurs smarter than any 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.219
 once there was definitely not one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.199
 of the most impressive dinosaurs and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.219
 however it takes place in this view 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.140
 this species of average theropod only 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.090
 two meters long and barely 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.759
 it reached the shoulders of a human 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.799
 gave me the intelligence of the raptor lobby 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.020
 is estimated thanks to the relationship 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.260
 between the size of your skull and the rest 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.360
 of his body that was pretty 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.460
 then we also have the tyrannosaur 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.409
 rex 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.119
 the truth is that many will surprise you 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.670
 to find it in the list of the most 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.290
 smart but it was the most 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.840
 Famous and ferocious dinosaurs 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.909
 carnivores that also turned out to be one 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.790
 of the five smartest the t-rex 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.610
 he lived in the Upper Cretaceous period and 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.010
 physically and intellectually dominated the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.990
 other creatures of your species 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.120
 we have the third with the soft 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.950
 This is undoubtedly one of the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.980
 smaller dinosaurs and 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.900
 insignificant that there was however 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.210
 deserves a place in this list thanks to 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.630
 his high intelligence in relation to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.759
 his contemporaries the conson nature 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.009
 forgive me if I say it wrong the truth is that 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.920
 the name is quite weird was a 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.759
 small theropod that lived during the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 Upper Jurassic period 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.590
 and then we have in second place to that of 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.750
 no niches the ignore and txus also 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.640
 it was a small theropod characterized 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.290
 for his outstanding intelligence 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.659
 with respect to other species of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.329
 dinosaurs besides having a brain 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.790
 bigger scientists have 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.970
 evidence to ensure that the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.099
 deinonico hunted larger prey and 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.470
 strong that the same which 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.709
 necessarily implied an intellect 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.650
 something superior and first of all we have 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.310
 Don ORT have reached the end of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.620
 list 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.650
 this is the smartest dinosaur 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 according to experts a dinosaur 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.150
 omnivore the size of a human that 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.579
 he lived in the Upper Cretaceous period 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.129
 the trotter had great qualities for 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.109
 hunt and elude larger predators 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.720
 and that's why scientists believe that 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.450
 reached the highest level of intelligence 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.030
 of all the species of the group of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.519
 I often think of dinosaurs 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.280
 what would have happened if the dinosaurs did not 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.139
 would have been extinguished surely 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.970
 forms of intelligence would have gone 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.700
 directed to reptiles 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.550
 the reptiles would have developed to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.610
 some sizes and an intelligence very 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.830
 higher than we have right now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.170
 let's not forget that the human being is very 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.590
 little time evolving if the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.020
 not extinct dinosaur would not 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.210
 would have gone back surely 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.250
 now we would be in astonishment not 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.140
 we would be but there would be a society of 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.140
 intelligent dinosaurs
