00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.400
 the eagerly awaited samsung 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.109
 galaxy s 6 is in our editorial 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.929
 We fell and we pack the good piece 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.230
 Now look at them together 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 packing from samsung galaxy s 6 out of 32 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.090
 gb the thing is a bit out of this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.740
 plastic that is no longer this wood 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.320
 Fire can be on the left side 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.820
 nothing still the exact devices 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.800
 designation smg 209 120 f and a 1 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 next to it on the back we have the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 most relevant information about the device 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 but we will in the video of course 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.630
 again listen to you and here 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 on the side black sea ​​fire or black 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.399
 Sapphire or whatever you do that 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.320
 We pronounce black sapphire 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 here in this version and I pack that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 Just get together with you 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 this is the box we are traveling now 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:01:01.170
 Let 's go and make the samsung 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.059
 galaxy s 6's colleagues down in the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.070
 editorial I'm looking forward to it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.299
 let's finally unpack the thing 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.409
 I'm with you now too 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.990
 a lot of time 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.909
 Here you can easily get the thing out 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 so still very very easy to get 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.310
 for that there is so much in here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.860
 we still have the normal 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.479
 packing a brief instruction 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 a quick start guide a regional 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.530
 loctite an important note for 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.270
 Internet usage very very important and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.250
 you should all be vertical 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.560
 keep it with the thing if something 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.049
 everything should be nice in here 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 packaged this thing that you can safely 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.290
 Actually doing something like that but still us 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.320
 the headphones are the new ones 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 I will test in any case 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.680
 they look in quotation marks 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.470
 Looks like apple have the people yes 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 already rushed from the beginning 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.020
 I think how should one headphones 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.679
 otherwise different women 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.520
 sometimes that's what it is 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.039
 most important here 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.789
 They should be really good in the ear 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.740
 lie 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.789
 I'm curious to have the apple 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.860
 somehow always very good 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.899
 By the way, one likes to listen to music 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.849
 for really good music enjoyment must 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.410
 of course, neat head recover that 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.390
 but only on the edge 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.700
 then we have the tool with it 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.840
 you get one of these quasi one bay 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.180
 side out and can the sim card 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.790
 insert 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.260
 because only the usb cable the usb cable and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.360
 Here the charger lived almost charge 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.650
 indirectly from the outset a human 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.709
 a quick charger with it 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.970
 with an output of 2 amps 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.970
 that's the way it has to be 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.060
 that was pretty chic right now 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:53.269
 Almost always together almost 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:56.660
 Charging cables are a tool here 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.400
 zeug to read zeug to the eu 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.700
 Plug 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 that's the samsung galaxy s 6 then 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:12.680
 Let's get rid of that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:15.079
 his like here so well ok I pull 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.920
 just from the top so the piece 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.889
 plastic is because also the thing sees 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 cool 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:29.989
 This blue will be much darker than me in 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.530
 remember and that he did that 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.530
 we also leave 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.750
 now you are free as a free 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.830
 birds down here we have the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.730
 unfortunately usb connector not usb 3.1 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.050
 that's just three only 2.0 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.910
 I would have expected something more 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.420
 but maybe that will come with one 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.590
 new variant of an upgrade or so 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 3.5 millimeter jack connection on the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.459
 bottom here we have the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.190
 speakers that down here this 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.010
 both strips are connector in 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.350
 quotation marks for the antenna from 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.940
 so that the net is here at an alu frame 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.100
 also behave both neatly ahead 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.170
 Come on the right side if you like that 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.239
 think we have here once the appropriate 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.790
 then bay the power button on one 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.400
 very good altitude located up here 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.640
 again the two antennae shafts say 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.220
 I now here the microphone for 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.540
 noise and here the airport so 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.440
 You can also use the s6 again as 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.350
 use remote control 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.300
 loud and quiet on the left side as 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.700
 single buttons on the back of the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:40.180
 camera and here we have the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:42.850
 Pulse sensor and the word of lightning 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.990
 but no tutorial flash or that is 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.540
 a normal simple joke 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.430
 also the camera and that looks too 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.090
 a bit out , you have to 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.880
 still say 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.590
 this is when the thing is on the ground 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.460
 but you can still do that completely 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.750
 normal use except in the upper area 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.580
 there you can hook a bit down 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.290
 quite normal tap down here but the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.060
 power button is now running with one 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.770
 fingerprint sensor only through 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.060
 you need to rest 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.710
 hang up the finger and it will be 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.110
 thing counted we still have a touch 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.880
 Res 7 Touch Resistive Both A Touch 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.250
 bathe here new touch button here the 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.249
 front camera and that is the samsung 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.479
 galaxy s 6 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.859

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.099
 times in the hand had the samsung galaxy 

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:25.659
 s 6 is really amazing 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.519
 at least at first sight 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.919

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:31.449
