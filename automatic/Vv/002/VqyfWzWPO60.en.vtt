00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990 

I<00:00:04.009> think<00:00:05.009> it's<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.339> first<00:00:05.549> time<00:00:05.700> we've<00:00:05.759> eaten

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
I think it's the first time we've eaten

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.620 
I think it's the first time we've eaten
central<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.569> home<00:00:06.750> since<00:00:07.250> 1996<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.540> been

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
central at home since 1996 so it's been

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.620 
central at home since 1996 so it's been
a<00:00:09.660> while<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.940> you<00:00:11.940> know<00:00:12.030> for<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.179> most<00:00:12.240> part<00:00:12.480> I

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
a while and you know for the most part I

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.970 
a while and you know for the most part I
think<00:00:12.660> they<00:00:12.900> were<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.170> second<00:00:13.650> best<00:00:13.769> team<00:00:13.860> in

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
think they were the second best team in

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350 
think they were the second best team in
the<00:00:14.070> conference<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.700> have<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.030> move<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
the conference now we have to move to

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.019 
the conference now we have to move to
more<00:00:15.480> matches<00:00:15.809> left<00:00:16.400> beaten<00:00:17.400> Buffalo<00:00:17.730> already

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
more matches left beaten Buffalo already

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.279 
more matches left beaten Buffalo already
at<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.240> Virginia<00:00:18.630> Doyle's<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.869> think<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.140> can

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
at the Virginia Doyle's I think we can

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.170 
at the Virginia Doyle's I think we can
come<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:20.430> well<00:00:20.580> against<00:00:20.820> them<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
come back and do well against them and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.210 
come back and do well against them and
and<00:00:21.410> focus<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.500> Easter<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> much<00:00:23.070> improved

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
and focus on Easter is a much improved

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.490 
and focus on Easter is a much improved
team<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.880> gave<00:00:23.910> central<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.900> battle<00:00:25.320> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
team they gave central a battle so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
team they gave central a battle so
they're<00:00:26.220> gonna<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.430> good<00:00:26.580> night<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.029> well

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
they're gonna be good night I think well

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.210 
they're gonna be good night I think well
we<00:00:28.080> match<00:00:28.230> up<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> got<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> make

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
we match up with them so we got to make

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
we match up with them so we got to make
sure<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.429> ready<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.090> after

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
sure we ready for that and then after

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.730 
sure we ready for that and then after
that<00:00:31.050> we'll<00:00:31.170> start<00:00:31.349> worried<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
that we'll start worried about the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.700 
that we'll start worried about the
national<00:00:32.250> duals<00:00:33.079> essential<00:00:34.079> they<00:00:34.350> knew

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
national duals essential they knew

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
national duals essential they knew
exactly<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.219> they're<00:00:35.340> trying<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> slow<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
exactly what they're trying to slow to

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.479 
exactly what they're trying to slow to
our<00:00:36.540> guys<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.260> thought<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.100> were<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.219> more

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
our guys down I thought we were the more

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
our guys down I thought we were the more
aggressive<00:00:38.670> team<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> way<00:00:40.079> throughout

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
aggressive team all the way throughout

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.080 
aggressive team all the way throughout
there's<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> weight<00:00:40.980> class<00:00:41.100> where<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.640> weren't

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
there's a weight class where we weren't

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.660 
there's a weight class where we weren't
more<00:00:42.239> aggressive<00:00:42.860> that's<00:00:43.860> how<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.010> wrestle<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
more aggressive that's how we wrestle I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
more aggressive that's how we wrestle I
think<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.780> hard<00:00:46.020> when<00:00:46.230> teams<00:00:46.440> tried<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> go

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
think it's hard when teams tried to go

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
think it's hard when teams tried to go
there<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.100> try<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> slow<00:00:47.520> things<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
there and try to slow things down and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
there and try to slow things down and
that's<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.829> central<00:00:50.039> does<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.250> great

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that's what I think central does a great

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.529 
that's what I think central does a great
job<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> very

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
job up they go on they have a very

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
job up they go on they have a very
simple<00:00:52.379> style<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.890> wrestling<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.399> it's

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
simple style of wrestling but it's

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
simple style of wrestling but it's
really<00:00:53.699> really<00:00:53.820> hard<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> beat<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:55.140> take

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
really really hard to beat they take

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.340 
really really hard to beat they take
down<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> match<00:00:55.920> um<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.760> never<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> want

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
down a match um it's never what I want

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.229 
down a match um it's never what I want
to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.530> going<00:00:58.739> into<00:00:58.920> match<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.670> take<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to do going into match you know take it

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.670 
to do going into match you know take it
down<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> last<00:01:00.600> second<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.230> that's<00:01:01.469> been

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
down to the last second but that's been

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.820 
down to the last second but that's been
uh<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.579> saw<00:01:03.300> wrestling<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.989> 97<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.710> year

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
uh I saw wrestling at 97 this year

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.550 
uh I saw wrestling at 97 this year
bumping<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> few<00:01:05.610> weights<00:01:05.850> um<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.110> I'm

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
bumping up a few weights um so I'm

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
bumping up a few weights um so I'm
pretty<00:01:07.830> confident<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:09.570> say

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
pretty confident that's when I would say

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.850 
pretty confident that's when I would say
that's<00:01:09.869> my<00:01:09.960> best<00:01:10.140> shot<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.710> pretty

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's my best shot so I was pretty

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
that's my best shot so I was pretty
confident<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.430> shot<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.450> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
confident in my shot you know it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.670 
confident in my shot you know it's
pretty<00:01:12.720> confident<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> he<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.439> gonna<00:01:13.500> take

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
pretty confident that he was gonna take

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.219 
pretty confident that he was gonna take
me<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.850> confident<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.509> wrestled<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> kid

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
me down I was confident I wrestled a kid

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
me down I was confident I wrestled a kid
earlier<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.740> season<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:18.180> was<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> closer

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
earlier this season it was a closer

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.190 
earlier this season it was a closer
match<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.710> knew<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.729> knew<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.600> he<00:01:21.810> had<00:01:21.869> he

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
match but I knew I knew what he had he

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
match but I knew I knew what he had he
he<00:01:22.500> probably<00:01:22.680> knew<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.250> um<00:01:24.020> like<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.110> said

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
he probably knew I had um like I said

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
he probably knew I had um like I said
I'm<00:01:25.439> lost<00:01:25.650> confident<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.520> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'm lost confident that he was going to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
I'm lost confident that he was going to
school<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> me<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.170> had<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
school on me it was just like I had to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
school on me it was just like I had to
go<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.680> there<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> takedown<00:01:30.360> working

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
go out there and get my takedown working

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.880 
go out there and get my takedown working
and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.229> did<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> end<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.630> worked<00:01:33.630> out
