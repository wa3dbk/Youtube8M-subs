mind is that the microphone has a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.280 
mind is that the microphone has a
certain<00:00:58.769> amount<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.250> space<00:00:59.790> around<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.960> where

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
certain amount of space around it where

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.350 
the fullest sound so you want to make
sure<00:02:04.620> that<00:02:04.830> your<00:02:04.980> finger<00:02:05.400> your<00:02:05.790> top<00:02:05.970> finger<00:02:06.120> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
sure that your finger your top finger is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.119 
sure that your finger your top finger is
away<00:02:06.780> from<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> mesh<00:02:09.259> let's<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.009> next

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
away from the mesh let's see the next

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770 
away from the mesh let's see the next
thing<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.519> think<00:02:11.550> about<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.060> angle<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.659> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
thing to think about is the angle of the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.259 
thing to think about is the angle of the
microphone<00:02:13.230> if<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.280> stand<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
microphone if I stand on this to the

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.089 
microphone if I stand on this to the
side<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.709> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> hold

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
side like this you don't want to hold

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.890 
side like this you don't want to hold
the<00:02:17.220> microphone<00:02:17.400> straight<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.390> down<00:02:18.450> like

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the microphone straight up and down like

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.979 
the microphone straight up and down like
so<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.159> to<00:02:20.220> angle<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.550> slightly<00:02:20.909> away<00:02:21.239> at

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
so you want to angle it slightly away at

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.679 
so you want to angle it slightly away at
about<00:02:22.050> 45<00:02:22.860> degrees<00:02:23.280> or<00:02:23.459> so<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.450> going

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
about 45 degrees or so and that's going

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.110 
about 45 degrees or so and that's going
to<00:02:24.780> give<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.609> you're<00:02:26.609> going<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:26.849> able<00:02:26.939> to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
to give you you're going to be able to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.569 
to give you you're going to be able to
talk<00:02:27.629> or<00:02:27.900> sing<00:02:28.139> right<00:02:28.379> into<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.799> sweet<00:02:29.189> spot

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
talk or sing right into the sweet spot

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.020 
talk or sing right into the sweet spot
of<00:02:29.760> them

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
of them

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
of them
your<00:02:30.180> phone<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.810> gonna<00:02:30.930> look<00:02:31.230> a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
your phone and it's just gonna look a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.530 
your phone and it's just gonna look a
little<00:02:31.530> bit<00:02:31.770> better<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:33.270> hold<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
little bit better as well if I hold the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.600 
little bit better as well if I hold the
microphone<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.410> doesn't<00:02:34.680> doesn't

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
microphone like this it doesn't doesn't

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.850 
microphone like this it doesn't doesn't
quite<00:02:35.850> look<00:02:36.030> as<00:02:36.209> good<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.440> little<00:02:37.650> it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
quite look as good and it's a little it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.680 
quite look as good and it's a little it
feels<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> little<00:02:38.130> awkward<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.580> my<00:02:38.700> hand<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.600> if

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
feels a little awkward on my hand but if

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.860 
feels a little awkward on my hand but if
I<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:40.050> angle<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> microphone<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.750> then<00:02:42.750> it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
I can angle the microphone out then it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
I can angle the microphone out then it
works<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.140> little<00:02:43.260> bit<00:02:43.440> better<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.790> want

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
works a little bit better and you want

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.910 
works a little bit better and you want
to<00:02:45.120> keep<00:02:45.240> your<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.750> arm<00:02:46.050> relaxed<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.800> your

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
elbow a little bit of natural space

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.380 
elbow a little bit of natural space
between<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.650> elbow<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.100> your<00:02:50.220> body<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.150> take

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
a look at the difference between me

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.120 
a look at the difference between me
holding<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.130> microphone<00:02:53.280> like<00:02:53.640> this<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
holding the microphone like this and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.870 
holding the microphone like this and
like<00:02:56.130> this<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:59.550> looks<00:02:59.700> kind

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
like this and like that that looks kind

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.400 
like this and like that that looks kind
of<00:02:59.910> weird<00:03:00.060> huh<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.870> don't<00:03:00.930> want<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> do<00:03:01.260> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
of weird huh you don't want to do that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.860 
of weird huh you don't want to do that
take<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.519> arm<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.660> want<00:03:03.840> to

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
take that arm down but you do want to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.860 
take that arm down but you do want to
have<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> little<00:03:04.350> bit<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.560> natural<00:03:04.860> air<00:03:05.430> space

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
have a little bit of natural air space

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.720 
have a little bit of natural air space
probably<00:03:06.870> that'll<00:03:07.170> allow<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.769> yourself<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
probably that'll allow your yourself to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.759 
probably that'll allow your yourself to
breathe<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.110> looks<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.500> more

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
breathe and it just looks a little more

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.680 
breathe and it just looks a little more
