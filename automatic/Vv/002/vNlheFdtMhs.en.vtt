horses<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:50.750> different<00:01:51.050> courses<00:01:51.320> or<00:01:51.560> is

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
horses for different courses or is

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.219 
horses for different courses or is
actually<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.550> lot<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.820> overlap<00:01:53.150> about<00:01:53.960> what

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
actually a lot of overlap about what

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.380 
actually a lot of overlap about what
when<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.860> get<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.220> next<00:01:55.370> generation<00:01:56.060> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
when you get to the next generation you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.000 
when you get to the next generation you
know<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.630> fundamental<00:01:57.229> platforms<00:01:57.830> that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
know the fundamental platforms that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.000 
know the fundamental platforms that
power<00:01:58.970> both<00:01:59.360> wimax<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.200> what's<00:02:00.680> being<00:02:00.799> called

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
power both wimax and what's being called

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.340 
power both wimax and what's being called
4G<00:02:01.520> or<00:02:01.549> next<00:02:01.940> gen<00:02:02.090> wireless<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:02.690> something

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
4G or next gen wireless is something

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.399 
4G or next gen wireless is something
called<00:02:03.470> OFDM<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.360> fundamental<00:02:05.510> platforms

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
called OFDM so the fundamental platforms

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.660 
called OFDM so the fundamental platforms
in<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.560> end<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:07.250> know<00:02:07.280> there<00:02:07.520> would<00:02:07.610> be

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
in the end you know there would be

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.729 
in the end you know there would be
convergence<00:02:08.299> it'll<00:02:08.599> be<00:02:08.690> based<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.049> OFDM

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
convergence it'll be based on OFDM

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.010 
convergence it'll be based on OFDM
different<00:02:10.729> antenna<00:02:11.090> techniques<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.840> offer

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
different antenna techniques to offer

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.750 
different antenna techniques to offer
you<00:02:12.800> know<00:02:12.890> even<00:02:13.040> faster<00:02:13.550> speeds<00:02:13.910> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you know even faster speeds to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.839 
you know even faster speeds to
to<00:02:14.879> enable<00:02:15.299> even<00:02:15.720> even<00:02:16.290> wider<00:02:17.220> array<00:02:17.670> of

to enable even even wider array of
applications<00:02:18.090> okay<00:02:19.079> I<00:02:19.110> gotta<00:02:19.290> ask<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.560> we've

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
1 x which is actually better at that

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.050 
1 x which is actually better at that
which<00:02:35.970> is<00:02:36.150> safer<00:02:36.420> which<00:02:37.260> which<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> cheaper

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
which is safer which which is cheaper

well uh you know it depends on you know

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.619 
well uh you know it depends on you know
where<00:02:41.549> you're<00:02:41.670> coming<00:02:41.700> from<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.359> if<00:02:42.450> you're<00:02:42.599> an

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
where you're coming from so if you're an

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.280 
where you're coming from so if you're an
operator<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.590> 3g<00:02:44.430> license<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.299> mobile

network mobile 2g network 3g is and he's
easier<00:02:50.519> migration<00:02:51.060> okay<00:02:51.269> right<00:02:51.569> if<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.260> are

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
easier migration okay right if you are

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.349 
easier migration okay right if you are
an<00:02:52.560> operator<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.190> doesn't<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.329> know

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
an operator that doesn't have you know

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.050 
an operator that doesn't have you know
3g<00:02:54.780> spectrum<00:02:54.989> or<00:02:55.379> 3g<00:02:55.709> license<00:02:56.159> but<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.849> have<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
3g spectrum or 3g license but you have a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.720 
3g spectrum or 3g license but you have a
wireline<00:02:57.599> line<00:02:57.959> spectrum<00:02:58.560> or<00:02:58.709> you're<00:02:59.129> an<00:02:59.250> ISP

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
wireline line spectrum or you're an ISP

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.879 
wireline line spectrum or you're an ISP
you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.299> why<00:03:00.450> max<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.900> an<00:03:01.019> easier<00:03:01.290> migration

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
you know why max is an easier migration

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.309 
you know why max is an easier migration
easier<00:03:02.280> easier<00:03:02.760> technology<00:03:03.569> to<00:03:03.720> embrace<00:03:04.049> so

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
easier easier technology to embrace so

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.599 
easier easier technology to embrace so
it<00:03:04.440> depends<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.829> where<00:03:04.980> people<00:03:05.280> come<00:03:05.430> from

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
it depends on where people come from

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.910 
it depends on where people come from
from<00:03:06.269> an<00:03:06.389> end-user<00:03:06.599> perspective<00:03:07.019> there's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
from an end-user perspective there's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.699 
from an end-user perspective there's
really<00:03:08.040> no<00:03:08.280> difference<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.500> are
