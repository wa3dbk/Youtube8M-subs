lens<00:00:27.250> descriptions<00:00:29.190> what<00:00:30.190> I<00:00:30.220> just<00:00:30.460> showed<00:00:30.580> you

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
lens descriptions what I just showed you

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.690 
lens descriptions what I just showed you
was<00:00:31.330> a<00:00:31.360> photograph<00:00:31.660> taken<00:00:32.200> with<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:33.489> land

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
was a photograph taken with the land

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.970 
was a photograph taken with the land
lens<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.329> i<00:00:34.420> keep<00:00:34.629> on<00:00:34.780> my<00:00:34.960> camera<00:00:35.350> most<00:00:35.800> of

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
lens that i keep on my camera most of

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.340 
lens that i keep on my camera most of
the<00:00:36.100> time<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.570> first<00:00:37.839> of<00:00:37.960> all<00:00:38.079> let's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the time but first of all let's

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.860 
the time but first of all let's
understand<00:00:38.949> what<00:00:39.519> lenses<00:00:39.940> are<00:00:40.089> all<00:00:40.239> about<00:00:40.539> and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
understand what lenses are all about and

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.599 
understand what lenses are all about and
then<00:00:41.050> you'll<00:00:41.230> understand<00:00:41.800> why<00:00:42.039> I<00:00:42.069> use<00:00:42.429> this

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
then you'll understand why I use this

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.579 
then you'll understand why I use this
one<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.059> why<00:00:43.539> i<00:00:43.569> might<00:00:43.929> change<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.469> use

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
one and why i might change and use

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.259 
one and why i might change and use
others<00:00:45.010> for<00:00:45.429> different<00:00:45.730> purposes<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:49.149> are

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
others for different purposes there are

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.819 
others for different purposes there are
two<00:00:49.390> numbers<00:00:49.749> that<00:00:49.899> are<00:00:49.989> mostly<00:00:50.229> important

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
two numbers that are mostly important

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.790 
two numbers that are mostly important
when<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:51.159> buy<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.850> lens<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:53.019> first<00:00:53.229> number<00:00:53.440> is

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
when you buy a lens the first number is

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.849 
when you buy a lens the first number is
the<00:00:53.859> number<00:00:54.639> of<00:00:55.149> millimeters<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.559> this<00:00:56.710> is

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
the number of millimeters and this is

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.430 
the number of millimeters and this is
described<00:00:57.370> as<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.699> focal<00:00:58.089> length<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:59.019> focal

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
described as the focal length the focal

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.729 
described as the focal length the focal
length<00:00:59.679> of<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.010> lens<00:01:00.659> talks<00:01:01.659> about<00:01:01.989> how<00:01:02.409> long

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
length of the lens talks about how long

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.070 
length of the lens talks about how long
the<00:01:02.920> lens<00:01:03.159> is<00:01:03.429> and<00:01:03.819> how<00:01:04.059> close<00:01:04.299> is<00:01:04.659> going<00:01:04.930> to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
the lens is and how close is going to

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.670 
the lens is and how close is going to
get<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.770> your<00:01:06.159> subject<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:08.110> we<00:01:08.290> really<00:01:08.650> mean

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
get to your subject what we really mean

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.460 
get to your subject what we really mean
by<00:01:08.860> this<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.460> if<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:10.060> imagine<00:01:10.330> just<00:01:10.930> looking

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
by this is if you imagine just looking

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.000 
by this is if you imagine just looking
around<00:01:11.620> at<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.730> scene<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:14.200> your<00:01:14.380> eyes<00:01:14.410> are

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
around at a scene what your eyes are

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.500 
around at a scene what your eyes are
seeing<00:01:15.280> is<00:01:16.440> approximately<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.590> same<00:01:17.830> as<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.510> 50

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
seeing is approximately the same as a 50

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.020 
seeing is approximately the same as a 50
millimeter<00:01:19.720> lens<00:01:20.650> on<00:01:21.010> a<00:01:21.070> 50<00:01:21.820> on<00:01:22.000> a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
millimeter lens on a 50 on a

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.700 
millimeter lens on a 50 on a
35-millimeter<00:01:22.720> camera<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:25.000> we<00:01:25.300> go<00:01:25.510> down<00:01:25.750> from

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
35-millimeter camera if we go down from

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.870 
35-millimeter camera if we go down from
50<00:01:27.190> millimeters<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.990> get<00:01:29.230> a<00:01:29.410> wider<00:01:30.280> field<00:01:30.730> of

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
50 millimeters we get a wider field of

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.260 
50 millimeters we get a wider field of
view<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.410> so<00:01:32.410> we<00:01:32.620> refer<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.100> those<00:01:33.220> as<00:01:33.280> a<00:01:33.640> wide

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
view and so we refer to those as a wide

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.980 
view and so we refer to those as a wide
angle<00:01:34.480> lens<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.950> we<00:01:36.370> go<00:01:36.580> above<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.660> 50

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
angle lens if we go above the 50

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.790 
angle lens if we go above the 50
millimeters<00:01:38.620> then<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:39.370> angle<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.210> view<00:01:40.420> is

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
millimeters then the angle of view is

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.490 
millimeters then the angle of view is
narrower<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.070> narrower<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:43.990> those<00:01:44.260> are

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
narrower and narrower and so those are

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.080 
narrower and narrower and so those are
referred<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:45.390> telephoto<00:01:46.440> lenses<00:01:48.090> putting

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
referred to as telephoto lenses putting

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.380 
referred to as telephoto lenses putting
it<00:01:49.210> another<00:01:49.330> way<00:01:49.660> because<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.980> wide<00:01:51.310> angle<00:01:51.580> gets

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
it another way because a wide angle gets

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.220 
it another way because a wide angle gets
a<00:01:52.540> lot<00:01:52.750> more<00:01:52.810> information<00:01:53.710> into<00:01:54.490> the<00:01:54.640> picture

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
a lot more information into the picture

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.190 
a lot more information into the picture
it<00:01:56.230> will<00:01:56.590> look<00:01:56.830> like<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.700> Egypt<00:01:58.300> subject<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.140> a

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
it will look like the Egypt subject is a

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.370 
it will look like the Egypt subject is a
little<00:01:59.710> bit<00:01:59.860> further<00:02:00.190> away<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.350> a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
little bit further away but because a

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.270 
little bit further away but because a
telephoto<00:02:03.130> lens<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:03.870> zooming<00:02:04.870> in<00:02:05.020> close<00:02:05.590> to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
telephoto lens is zooming in close to

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.950 
telephoto lens is zooming in close to
the<00:02:06.430> image<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.970> you<00:02:07.060> haven't<00:02:07.510> got<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.690> lot<00:02:07.900> of

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the image and you haven't got a lot of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.609 
the image and you haven't got a lot of
things<00:02:08.200> over

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
things over

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.009 
things over
and<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.159> image<00:02:09.789> will<00:02:09.970> seem<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.420> be<00:02:10.569> much

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
and if that image will seem to be much

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.490 
and if that image will seem to be much
closer<00:02:11.819> if<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:13.030> wanted<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.510> take<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> big<00:02:14.140> wide

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
closer if you wanted to take a big wide

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.130 
closer if you wanted to take a big wide
landscape<00:02:14.980> scene<00:02:15.730> with<00:02:16.209> lots<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.629> rolling

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
landscape scene with lots of rolling

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.949

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
aperture ok so the lowest number lets

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.249 
aperture ok so the lowest number lets
the<00:04:26.259> most<00:04:26.440> likely<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.490> f<00:04:27.699> 1.8<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.660> very<00:04:29.050> very

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
the most likely so f 1.8 is very very

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
can be useful for a low light lens it

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.499 
can be useful for a low light lens it

and in there which takes out any shaking
so<00:06:23.979> if<00:06:24.069> my<00:06:24.400> hands<00:06:24.669> are<00:06:24.849> not<00:06:25.029> very<00:06:25.210> steady<00:06:25.569> and

when you're using telephoto it's very

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.430 
when you're using telephoto it's very
difficult<00:06:28.389> to<00:06:28.659> not<00:06:28.899> shake<00:06:29.139> it

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
difficult to not shake it

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.610 
difficult to not shake it
it<00:06:29.650> the<00:06:30.490> camera<00:06:30.970> will<00:06:31.360> take<00:06:31.900> out<00:06:32.080> those<00:06:32.320> shakes

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
it the camera will take out those shakes

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.620 
it the camera will take out those shakes
completely<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.670> give<00:06:33.940> you<00:06:34.030> a<00:06:34.060> much<00:06:34.270> steadier

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630
