00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.119
 obviously I won't show you either 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.760
 the one that contains neither the sides why 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.760
 they are all the same so they don't change 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:38.989
 Maximum power makes him the slip 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.430
 behind that is always the same then 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:52.879
 easy only the part in mind so many of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.879

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.009
 plastic that I don't like at all 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.009

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.630

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.780

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.649
 as packages and also between who or is not 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.439
 bad 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.420
 let's say that this is one of the artwork 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.399
 which I consider less fortunate then 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.670
 let's try to find something 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.209

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.069
 previous with ajax 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.069
 I always start from the 7th oldest 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
 code 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:09.330

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:14.920

 rare zoroark we pass dragon lineage 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.700

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:32.819
 the economy in tea compared to those in 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.819

 I don't really think about the chaos that rai 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.310
 find something 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.739
 look at the opening of this package 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.739
 super perfect 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:33.819
 that's if there are the cards maybe it would be 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:36.099
 also the ideal code even before 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.680
 raped with glaciers but they don't think here 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:43.019
 it does not seem to me from the same luck 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:48.810

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:53.440
