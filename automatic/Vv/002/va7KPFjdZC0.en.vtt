00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.360 

the<00:00:47.050> best<00:00:47.260> thing<00:00:47.440> about<00:00:47.500> is<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:47.829> Tai<00:00:48.130> Chi

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
the best thing about is that Tai Chi

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.119 
the best thing about is that Tai Chi
like<00:00:48.550> many<00:00:48.850> other<00:00:49.059> techniques<00:00:49.480> azure<00:00:50.170> ways<00:00:50.770> is

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
like many other techniques azure ways is

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.569 
like many other techniques azure ways is
a<00:00:51.370> platform<00:00:51.940> for<00:00:52.620> self<00:00:53.620> exploration<00:00:53.890> and

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
a platform for self exploration and

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.930 
a platform for self exploration and
learning<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:56.800> we're<00:00:57.250> about<00:00:57.460> well<00:00:57.760> knifes

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
learning what we're about well knifes

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.860 
learning what we're about well knifes
about<00:00:58.270> how<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.230> do<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.530> little<00:00:59.620> better<00:00:59.800> maybe

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.970 

well<00:01:04.470> Taichi<00:01:05.010> certainly<00:01:05.460> designed<00:01:06.920> more<00:01:07.920> than

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980 
well Taichi certainly designed more than

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.390 
well Taichi certainly designed more than
certain<00:01:08.460> techniques<00:01:08.940> for<00:01:10.100> looking<00:01:11.100> inward

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
certain techniques for looking inward

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.110 
certain techniques for looking inward
and<00:01:12.500> if<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.740> look<00:01:13.890> outward<00:01:14.280> you're<00:01:14.970> only

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
and if you look outward you're only

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.430 
and if you look outward you're only
going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:16.520> often<00:01:17.520> act<00:01:17.790> act<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.870> from<00:01:19.200> some

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
going to often act act out from some

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.060 
going to often act act out from some
habits<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.070> maybe<00:01:20.310> realize<00:01:20.790> what's<00:01:22.070> what

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
habits and not maybe realize what's what

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.580 
habits and not maybe realize what's what
the<00:01:23.190> journey<00:01:23.430> inside

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
the journey inside

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.219 
the journey inside
everyone<00:01:25.590> has<00:01:25.860> their<00:01:26.570> starting<00:01:27.570> tendency<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
everyone has their starting tendency in

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.440 
everyone has their starting tendency in
the<00:01:28.320> idea<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.860> find<00:01:29.190> your<00:01:29.460> Center<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.270> really

quite<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.250> deep<00:01:32.250> process<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.119> someone<00:01:34.080> who

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
quite a deep process if you someone who

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
quite a deep process if you someone who
tends<00:01:34.410> to<00:01:34.650> move<00:01:34.800> out<00:01:34.950> quickly<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> engage

tends to move out quickly and and engage
in<00:01:36.690> things<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.640> perhaps<00:01:38.640> go<00:01:38.820> too<00:01:38.880> fast<00:01:39.270> or

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
in things and and perhaps go too fast or

in things and and perhaps go too fast or
someone<00:01:39.960> who<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> simple<00:01:41.700> explanation

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
someone who the simple explanation

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.850 
someone who the simple explanation
you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.810> tends<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.200> hold<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.590> too

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
