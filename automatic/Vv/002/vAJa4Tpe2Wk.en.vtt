if you watch my videos you know that I
replaced<00:00:06.049> this<00:00:07.049> case<00:00:07.880> with<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.059> gigabyte

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
replaced this case with the gigabyte

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.359 
replaced this case with the gigabyte
free<00:00:10.139> demos<00:00:11.480> anyway<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> tip<00:00:16.220> if<00:00:17.220> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
what air that is okay sir

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.710 
what air that is okay sir
it's<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:05.000> air<00:01:06.000> tunnel<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.350> fresh<00:01:08.450> cool<00:01:09.450> air

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it's a air tunnel to get fresh cool air

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.420 
it's a air tunnel to get fresh cool air
from<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> outside<00:01:11.659> directly<00:01:13.280> to<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
from from the outside directly to the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.620 
from from the outside directly to the
CPU<00:01:14.670> cooler<00:01:16.400> see<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> CPU<00:01:17.909> cooler<00:01:18.210> will<00:01:18.450> be

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
CPU cooler see the CPU cooler will be

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.460 
CPU cooler see the CPU cooler will be
here<00:01:20.930> behind<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.439> panel<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> air<00:01:25.229> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
here behind that panel and the air that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.370 
here behind that panel and the air that
will<00:01:25.770> give<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:27.650> fresh<00:01:28.650> air<00:01:29.720> directly<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
will give it fresh air directly to the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.330 
will give it fresh air directly to the
fan<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.880> helps<00:01:33.329> cooling<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
fan this helps cooling so if you have a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.780 
fan this helps cooling so if you have a
very<00:01:35.700> small<00:01:36.420> fan<00:01:36.810> at<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> stock<00:01:37.500> cooler<00:01:37.790> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
very small fan at the stock cooler you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.420 
very small fan at the stock cooler you
can<00:01:39.110> maybe<00:01:40.189> retract<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.369> all<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:43.430> get

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
can maybe retract it all the way to get

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
can maybe retract it all the way to get
better<00:01:44.670> performance<00:01:45.409> better<00:01:46.409> cooling<00:01:48.439> hope

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
better performance better cooling hope

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
better performance better cooling hope
it<00:01:49.619> helpful<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.549> people<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.180> didn't<00:01:51.540> know

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it helpful to people that didn't know

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.520 
it helpful to people that didn't know
that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.470 

these<00:02:00.530> cases<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:01.160> are<00:02:01.460> actually<00:02:01.880> quite<00:02:02.210> good

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
these cases that are actually quite good

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.340 
these cases that are actually quite good
with<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.020> air-duct<00:02:03.440> gives<00:02:04.750> nice<00:02:05.750> cooling

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
with the air-duct gives nice cooling

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.980 
with the air-duct gives nice cooling

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
performance for cheap money Intel

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.380 
performance for cheap money Intel
actually<00:02:12.170> used<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:13.010> recommend<00:02:13.340> these<00:02:13.790> cases

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
actually used to recommend these cases

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.100 
actually used to recommend these cases
in<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.590> family<00:02:16.280> advantage<00:02:17.470> chassis<00:02:18.470> list<00:02:20.110> in

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
in the family advantage chassis list in

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.630 
in the family advantage chassis list in
this<00:02:21.350> case<00:02:21.560> wasn't<00:02:21.830> too<00:02:22.190> bad<00:02:22.870> it's<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.020> heck<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.709> 6

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
this case wasn't too bad it's a heck a 6

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.199 
this case wasn't too bad it's a heck a 6
I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.340> joy<00:02:28.850> I<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:31.970> another

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
I think and joy I have here another

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.350 
I think and joy I have here another
example<00:02:33.790> for<00:02:34.790> an<00:02:34.910> air<00:02:35.090> duct<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.910> one<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.330> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
example for an air duct this one is a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.190 
example for an air duct this one is a
bit<00:02:38.570> border<00:02:39.140> design<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:41.020> actually<00:02:42.020> have<00:02:42.170> a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
bit border design and actually have a

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.510 
bit border design and actually have a
system<00:02:42.560> installed<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.760> as<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.050> see<00:02:45.520> you

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
system installed so as you can see you

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.740 
system installed so as you can see you
can<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.300> fan<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:48.020> the<00:02:48.580> CPU<00:02:50.680> through<00:02:51.680> this

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
can see the fan of the CPU through this

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.820 
can see the fan of the CPU through this
and<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.840> will<00:02:53.989> show<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:55.600> how<00:02:56.600> how<00:02:57.200> different<00:02:57.680> it

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and I will show you how how different it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:10.930 
and I will show you how how different it
is<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> change<00:02:58.580> its<00:02:59.000> size<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:10.459> one<00:03:10.700> actually

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
is to change its size this one actually

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:20.680 
is to change its size this one actually
has<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:16.010> have<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.400> screw<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:19.299> get<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.450> size

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
has you have to screw to get the size

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.350 
has you have to screw to get the size
