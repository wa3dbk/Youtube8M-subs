00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
of the movie i'm guessing and then

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.460

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.510 
else on earth that can try to take me on
it's<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.470> what<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.770> Z<00:02:21.920> Warriors<00:02:22.280> are<00:02:22.400> going

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
it's like what the Z Warriors are going

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's like what the Z Warriors are going
to<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.450> basically<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.870> little

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
to do and that's basically the little

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
to do and that's basically the little
synopsis<00:02:24.470> kind<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.220> sound<00:02:25.400> spoilers<00:02:25.849> but<00:02:26.030> i'm

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
synopsis kind of sound spoilers but i'm

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.490 
synopsis kind of sound spoilers but i'm
pretty<00:02:26.300> sure<00:02:26.420> again<00:02:26.720> that's<00:02:26.870> like<00:02:26.989> maybe<00:02:27.380> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
pretty sure again that's like maybe the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.780 
pretty sure again that's like maybe the
first<00:02:27.650> five<00:02:27.920> or<00:02:28.099> ten<00:02:28.250> minutes<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.670> movie

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
first five or ten minutes of the movie

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.420 
first five or ten minutes of the movie
at<00:02:29.030> most<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.020> set<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.319> up<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.650> while<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
at most just to set it up and while that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.550 
at most just to set it up and while that
sounds<00:02:31.730> pretty<00:02:32.000> epic<00:02:32.239> like<00:02:32.540> holy<00:02:32.900> Goku

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
sounds pretty epic like holy Goku

sounds pretty epic like holy Goku
losses<00:02:34.130> at<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.730> same<00:02:34.970> time<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.300> kind<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
losses at the same time it kind of

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.330 
losses at the same time it kind of
sounds<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.720> a<00:02:35.810> setup<00:02:36.050> like<00:02:36.170> holy<00:02:36.980> if

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
sounds like a setup like holy if

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340 
sounds like a setup like holy if

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
little bit different than just Goku

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.420

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
soundtrack from dragon ball z so you

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.270 
soundtrack from dragon ball z so you
know<00:04:42.020> in<00:04:42.170> that<00:04:42.290> aspect<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.830> kind<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.040> cool

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
know in that aspect it's kind of cool

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.970 
know in that aspect it's kind of cool
but<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.660> story<00:04:44.960> just<00:04:45.080> seems<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:45.650> little<00:04:45.770> bit

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
but the story just seems a little bit

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.970 
but the story just seems a little bit
too<00:04:46.160> weird<00:04:46.490> like<00:04:46.760> first<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.480> all<00:04:47.680> this<00:04:48.680> takes

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
too weird like first of all this takes

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.520 
too weird like first of all this takes
place<00:04:49.100> years<00:04:49.880> after<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.420> end<00:04:50.450> of<00:04:50.780> GT<00:04:51.230> and

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
place years after the end of GT and

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.090 
place years after the end of GT and
apparently<00:04:52.190> pan<00:04:52.790> ends<00:04:53.270> up<00:04:53.420> with<00:04:53.630> boob<00:04:53.930> I'm<00:04:54.680> a

apparently pan ends up with boob I'm a

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.630 
apparently pan ends up with boob I'm a
pen<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.490> if<00:04:56.480> any<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:57.020> see<00:04:57.260> GT<00:04:57.890> pen<00:04:58.250> and

pen and if any of you see GT pen and

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.500 
pen and if any of you see GT pen and
boom<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.620> don't<00:05:00.620> know<00:05:00.770> like<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:01.700> story<00:05:02.000> wasn't

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
boom I don't know like the story wasn't

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.970 
boom I don't know like the story wasn't
really<00:05:02.810> all<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.410> be<00:05:03.500> honest<00:05:03.770> with<00:05:03.860> you

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
really all that to be honest with you

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.490 
really all that to be honest with you
I've<00:05:04.430> wasn't<00:05:04.880> really<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.210> oh<00:05:05.420> my<00:05:05.990> goodness

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
I've wasn't really like oh my goodness

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.040 
I've wasn't really like oh my goodness
it<00:05:06.800> just<00:05:07.010> seemed<00:05:07.220> like<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.850> fan<00:05:08.480> attempt<00:05:08.960> at

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
it just seemed like a fan attempt at

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.780 
it just seemed like a fan attempt at
trying<00:05:09.290> to<00:05:09.440> make<00:05:09.590> something<00:05:09.830> so<00:05:10.160> I<00:05:10.340> pulled

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
trying to make something so I pulled

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.340 
trying to make something so I pulled
them<00:05:10.970> for<00:05:11.240> how<00:05:11.510> far<00:05:11.810> they<00:05:11.960> got<00:05:12.080> with<00:05:12.230> the

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
them for how far they got with the

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.630 
them for how far they got with the
animation<00:05:12.800> looks<00:05:12.950> really<00:05:13.250> cool<00:05:13.490> and

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
animation looks really cool and

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.550 
animation looks really cool and
everything<00:05:13.820> but<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.780> story<00:05:15.050> probably<00:05:15.320> could

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
everything but the story probably could

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.110 
everything but the story probably could
have<00:05:15.590> been<00:05:15.800> a<00:05:15.980> lot<00:05:16.250> better<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.910> they<00:05:16.970> could

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
have been a lot better and they could

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.280 
have been a lot better and they could
have<00:05:17.210> done<00:05:17.240> something<00:05:17.540> may<00:05:17.780> be<00:05:17.840> different<00:05:18.230> I

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
have done something may be different I

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.810 
have done something may be different I
would<00:05:18.380> have<00:05:18.500> preferred<00:05:18.590> if<00:05:19.010> they<00:05:19.550> would<00:05:19.790> have

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
would have preferred if they would have

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.030 
would have preferred if they would have
even<00:05:20.000> done<00:05:20.240> something<00:05:20.690> taking<00:05:20.990> place<00:05:21.200> after<00:05:21.440> Z

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
even done something taking place after Z

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.070 
even done something taking place after Z
maybe<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.700> just<00:05:23.120> make<00:05:23.270> it<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.450> little<00:05:23.600> bit<00:05:23.780> make

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
maybe and just make it a little bit make

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.680 
maybe and just make it a little bit make
more<00:05:24.350> sense<00:05:24.650> because<00:05:25.000> it<00:05:26.000> just<00:05:26.150> kind<00:05:26.420> of<00:05:26.480> felt

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
more sense because it just kind of felt

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.330 
more sense because it just kind of felt
a<00:05:26.780> little<00:05:26.900> all<00:05:27.080> over<00:05:27.200> the<00:05:27.350> place<00:05:27.410> again<00:05:27.860> not

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
a little all over the place again not

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.860 
a little all over the place again not
taking<00:05:28.700> away<00:05:28.790> because<00:05:29.030> it<00:05:29.360> seems<00:05:29.540> like<00:05:29.600> they

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
taking away because it seems like they

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.260 
taking away because it seems like they
worked<00:05:30.140> hard<00:05:30.380> on<00:05:30.530> this<00:05:30.740> but<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.640> just<00:05:32.090> think<00:05:32.210> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
worked hard on this but I just think the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.490 
worked hard on this but I just think the
story<00:05:32.480> could<00:05:32.660> have<00:05:32.780> been<00:05:32.870> much<00:05:33.050> much<00:05:33.290> better

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
story could have been much much better

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.200 
story could have been much much better
and<00:05:33.800> yeah<00:05:34.400> that's<00:05:34.550> all<00:05:34.700> in<00:05:34.850> that<00:05:34.970> shell

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
and yeah that's all in that shell

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.160 
and yeah that's all in that shell
because<00:05:35.390> people<00:05:35.630> been<00:05:35.750> asking<00:05:35.870> me<00:05:36.080> the

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
because people been asking me the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.870 
because people been asking me the
winning<00:05:36.440> my<00:05:36.500> thoughts<00:05:36.710> on<00:05:36.830> epsilon<00:05:37.220> there<00:05:37.730> you

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
winning my thoughts on epsilon there you

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.270 
winning my thoughts on epsilon there you
go<00:05:38.120> it<00:05:38.720> looks<00:05:38.930> cool<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.350> I<00:05:39.470> applaud<00:05:39.710> them<00:05:40.010> but

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
go it looks cool and I applaud them but

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.740 
go it looks cool and I applaud them but
definitely<00:05:40.820> the<00:05:40.910> story<00:05:41.180> could<00:05:41.330> have<00:05:41.390> been<00:05:41.540> way

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
definitely the story could have been way

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.480 
definitely the story could have been way
better<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.200> hopefully<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.860> know<00:05:43.040> if<00:05:43.310> they<00:05:43.400> go

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
better and hopefully you know if they go

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.250 
better and hopefully you know if they go
to<00:05:43.520> continue<00:05:44.000> maybe<00:05:44.150> episode<00:05:44.570> 2<00:05:44.780> and<00:05:44.960> onward

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
to continue maybe episode 2 and onward
