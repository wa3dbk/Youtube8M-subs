00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.380
 for the tenth episode of take the best 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.650
 we still have a right defender 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.299
 bronze has changed it's a b and the jpy the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 last episode so that is maybe 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.630
 the one that will replace bravo in my 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 team we will not wait too much we will 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.279
 start the first match of this episode 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.769
 number 10 and we will fall against a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.289
 babe who is rather pretty with duke at 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.119
 stage Thursday maria robin van persie a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 player and a form in midfield 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 it's one yamaha in version a form of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.200
 show the joe walcott so a quick 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 on the sides a pretty good team 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.460
 at all and it will start directly 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.050
 with robin van persie in the 2nd minute 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 he's just provoked a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.500
 penalty I was a little disgusted 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.910
 because this is the match that comes from 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.739
 start I take a cardboard I get 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 take a penalty it's a little bit 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 hot but I tell myself that here I am not 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.120
 being dry can stop it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.340
 I have a one in three chance of stopping 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.789
 and unfortunately for me he marks 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.129
 so this penalty 12th minute 1-0 for him 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.049
 it starts rather badly this game but I 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.970
 get hold of me a little bit with lacazette 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.860
 we will see except physical side between 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.170
 quotes the big drop and y pat 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 unfortunately the post a little bit 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 disgusted but there is coutinho this team 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 lacazette who recovers the ball at the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.509
 offside limit he stomped 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.549
 left 1 1 I can pick up the score 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 with a nice shot anyway 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.680
 Lacazette in the 40th minute 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.299
 1 it's not over coutinho it's ultra 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 boiling in this match he makes a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.979
 goes for neymar neymar the little 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.820
 ronaldo shop in front of the caretaker a small 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.290
 end of the game hits 1 for me at the 43rd 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.299
 minute just before half time it was 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 just perfect 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.869
 but it was necessary that wanyama 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.430
 wakes up in this match he gets to do 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's my defense making a pass for 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.280
 robin van persie 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.579
 he hits his left foot and he scores 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.049
 so the 2-2 in the 45th minute 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.700
 a little bit disgusted because it's 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.079
 just before halftime in nine years the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.329
 left foot of robin van persie at the same 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.070
 time it's just perfect at the 55th 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.890
 minute bah he's taking the ball 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450
 precisely with robin van persie 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.180
 walcott in turn pass my happiness 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.460
 for di maria tivat 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.410
 the goal I did not understand this recipe 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.940
 who is completely beaten di maria who 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.870
 two centimeters from the cages and he 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.460
 still manages to hit the post 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.850
 frankly it's great 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.920
 what 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.690
 all the better for me at the same time 76th 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.130
 minute it's now my turn to 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.770
 score third goal 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.070
 the 25 meter robben's free kick and 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.800
 I told them and I do not know what he has 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.300
 does robben but hey it's like that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.400
 82nd minute lacazette who recovers the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.660
 ball goes deep to pamper 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.170
 stingers kept parked in front of a 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.330
 defender 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.810
 the tool offers big foot strike 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.330
 left full skylight and so the 3 2 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.700
 just before the end of the match really 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.470
 super happy because already left foot 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.200
 you would be tieger it's not necessarily 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.880
 easy to score a goal like this and in 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 more it's just before the time of the mac 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.300
 so just perfect you'll have it so 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.700
 understood the guys I won the first 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.980
 match of this episode number 10 3 2 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.180
 really happy to be 7 ch for 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.070
 his first match that was not 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.110
 necessarily disgusting but frankly 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.510
 a very good lacazette is a very good 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.350
 coutinho at the level of his team 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.090
 robin van persie 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.950
 the man of the match but you know the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.530
 do not scratch scorer we will take the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.350
 second try wanyama with a note of 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.000
 7.6 who is so in my team 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.739
 welcome all anyway and so I 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.019
 just bought wanyama version 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.850
 inform that I put directly next to 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.070
 choice stinger and on two of coutinho 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.560
 for the small collective it will always be 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.769
 pleasure a very nice team but good 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.650
 always this little fell to turn second 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.050
 second team match and 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.540
 and this is very very heavy this team 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.190
 with crespo the Argentinian but that I 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.770
 overkilled you have veti you vidal of tevez 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.830
 on otamendi cluny steiner finally brief 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.990
 a team of madmen furious but it me 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.640
 do not scare lacazette in the 6th minute 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.990
 the big hit that just passes 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.700
 above the bar a little bit 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.100
 disgusted but you will see that this 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.020
 it will match practically it this 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.830
 will be a really very tight match 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.360
 coutinho I'm going to do some 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.580
 accelerations with him during the match 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.870
 but again it will be 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.030
 strikes that will pass right next 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.190
 like this one frankly I was 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.500
 really disgusted because I deserved 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.480
 a little bit of at least to mark a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.950
 goal concretely there again 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.810
 Lacazette in front of the goalkeeper 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.790
 who is above the game I did not understand 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.800
 not foolish was really very very 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.450

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.090
 finishing level team it was 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.220
 completely disgusting but that's it 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.170
 I'm still trying to do things to 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.150

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.550

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.410

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.419

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.640
 hazard I knit a little bit with him 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.710
 I hit with the left foot the keeper who 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.320
 is completely beaten but it goes to 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.080
 short side big game really 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.820

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.360
