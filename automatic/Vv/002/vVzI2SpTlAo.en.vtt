00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.480
 well here I'll leave a video of 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.130
 how to eliminate the gel effect 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:15.310
 completely has not yet served after 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.310
 to do many tests with different 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.590
 and looking with different internet 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.840
 systems to remove the gel effect then 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.090
 I decided before buying any of 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.880
 they 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.980
 perform a hole itself and the truth is 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.190
 that has gone very well even flying 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:44.620
 strong winds vibrations the truth is 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.790
 that 000 good effects we started 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 but first thing here you see 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.320
 this is a piece of neoprene that is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 a 50-millimeter wetsuit 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.780
 half a centimeter of spearfishing that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.840
 the also they sold in stores 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.690
 radio control that can be pasted that are 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.860
 like this one that takes a part and sticks 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.450
 and one that is not worth then we 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.760
 would serve two of these with two of these 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.220
 then this one is already mounted here there is one 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.820
 mounted 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.010
 that looks how it has already been very fine 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.920
 and the other is here or here in 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.590
 reality takes two pieces like this 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.200
 one has been left of the pressure here because 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.260
 I already have it assembled and another has been 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.620
 the pressure here like this 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.020
 and what you have to do is very easy 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.500
 is to look for longer screws 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.980
 put two pieces of neoprene between the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.220
 two screws like this fat 50 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.220
 millimeters 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.960
 you will put the screws here 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.220
 we will add some fixed screws 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.220
 in each screw 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.220
 I wear it tight 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.790
 one 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.530
 Y 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.400
 we will tighten the other one now I do not get 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.400
 the k screws so you can see why 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 disassembled so you can see it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.530
 but you have to put fixed screws for 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.270
 that the screws are not squeezed in 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.170
 flight 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.620
 OK 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.400
 more or less 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.909
 the coils is at the same distance and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.909
 you will see 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.780
 as it has a law of a must movement 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.240
 but it is not necessary to 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.120
 do gel effect you have to agree 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.360
 always tighten the nut correctly 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.960
 to the extent that you want it because it is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 very important that it is not loose 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.530
 important is also to balance the 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.150
 parties here I have balanced 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.110
 with insulating tape 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.180
 but you're here 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.180
 already balanced 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.609
 with sandpaper and it looks much better 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.030
 balanced if you do not have to carry the 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:27.750
 Insulating tape when finished is 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.969
 because the screw here always makes a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.810
 vibration because as you see it does not take 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:36.799
 no soleta or any catch or anything 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.799
 then here 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.790
 with a gun 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.560
 of liquid glue is to put a point 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.660
 which then is very easy to remove 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.660
 and another point on the other side 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.990
 OK 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.920
 with this 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.320
 I have managed to make videos with more than 30 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.100
 kilometers of wind speed and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:14.690
 no type of gel effect 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.820
 I recommend it is easy cheap and not 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.250
 you need no software whatsoever 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.760
 these weird ones that sell online that 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.690
 There are several types because it is 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.680
 you perfectly see the movement nothing of 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.070
 effects 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.300
 Well, I hope nothing you liked and 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.479
 I was going 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.479
 for your de jay faltÃ³n thanks
