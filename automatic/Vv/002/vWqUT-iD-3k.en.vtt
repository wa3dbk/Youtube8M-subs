00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.410
 galaxy s3 the new product 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.810
 representative of the smartphone range of 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.870
 samsung 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.510
 here we can see the first look at 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.380
 two color options that will come out at 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.480
 market both blue and white 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.640
 galaxies e3 aims to be inspired by the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.640
 nature so that if we see the 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.009
 design is a very organic fate that 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.220
 simulates mineral elements such as 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.370
 lapis lazuli or the marble from there with the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.230
 two variants at first glance we see a 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.290
 big screen with the screen is super 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.680
 amoled hd 4.8 inches but what 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.420
 really interesting is that we get 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 that despite this increase in the screen 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 Regarding the previous Samsung Galaxy S2 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.100
 the size does not grow too much and keep 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.140
 a very interesting weight is greatly reduced 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.880
 the frame so that although the screen 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
 the product's feeling is bigger 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.230
 is that it is of a size very similar to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.420
 the previous ones 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.519
 as we see here they are also incorporated 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 elements that make us more intuitive and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.700
 smoother all transitions by 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.250
 example the unlocking will simulate me 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.289
 new stone that falls into the water this is 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.700
 our touchwiz interface returns to 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.250
 principle has not commented but another 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.380
 of the news that I will be able to define 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.670
 four and four applications which I 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 want to be able 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.429
 to activate without unlocking the 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.429
 screen 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.509
 that we pretend with the ace that piece with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.549
 thanks to three to make the smartphone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.369
 more intuitive with a series of services 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 with a series of advantages and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.929
 characteristics that we understand that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.290
 recognize us make us easier 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.040
 use of experience 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.600
 apart from what we see externally 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.900
 this would be the back as you see lines 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.180
 curves there is no straight line let's go 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 to see the guts or we will include the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.120
 guts that have the galaxy s3 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.330
 It incorporates a four processor 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.010
 samsung cores that apart from making me 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.050
 the transitions and the launch open 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.090
 to do is much faster it's going to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.490
 allow to define new services that 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.170
 see that they improve this performance 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.630
 example by a feature that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.060
 we call pop-up play which is the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.959
 real multitasking once I'm me 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.959
 playing a video 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 I can see it in the screen format 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:37.430
 complete the resolution is 1280 x 720 of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.430
 the screen we will be able to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.390
 can I use any other application to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.920
 the time you are playing the video 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.490
 so that I can handle my smartphone 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.890
 we have with actions on the internet and I'm going to 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.569
 can place the video in the part of 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.400
 the screen that you want me to allow 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.040
 keep doing something else this is a 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.840
 sample of the actual multitasking that I can 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.160
 do with galaxy s3 and because of 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.160
 quad-core processor 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.720
 Another focus of the product is the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.730
 communication and sharing content is 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.769
 Besides all the possibilities 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.909
 allows me android 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.980
 ice cream 24.0 I will be able to share 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.220
 any content with my friends from 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.320
 be faster thanks to nfc 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.750
 already light and direct combining the two 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.250
 technologies we will be able to share 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.930
 any content quickly 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.680
 this way I for example be 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.680
 picking up a video 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.480
 my friend is what it is 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.480
 yours 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.880
 it gives to invite to share 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.170
 our has done through nfc and 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.170
 now I will not be able to separate them 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.420
 and as we see 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.770
 apart from that I can continue using my 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.170
 smartphone is usually being 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.870
 sharing the video in this case a 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.240
 video that just takes a few 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.569
 seconds you are thanks to an application 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.150
 called schwindt 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.189
 there is a lot more news 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.570
 recognizes for example in the position of 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.829
 our eyes when I'm looking at the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.829
 screen of the machine turn off 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.050
 possibility to share with a series 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.940
 all-share functionality with other 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.650
 products like televisions and tablets 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.550
 as I could do in the past and 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.060
 good the idea is the smartphone best in 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.400
 class the best smartphone in the range 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.140
 samsung and with this we want to make apart 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.420
 of a tremendously powerful hardware 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.650
 with a series of services and 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.009
 functionalities I expected much more 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.979
 intuitive and much more 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:55.710
 easy and simple for use by part 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.710
 from the users very well thank you very much
