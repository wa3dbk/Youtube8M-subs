00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 it has a million possibilities and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.070
 passed some examples but these are 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.590
 possibilities for it to be tested by 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 do you think comes from research but that the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.219
 people are sure if it works I was there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.570
 up commenting on these parts 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.579
 possibility for example exist 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
 surveys that show that while 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.460
 associated is the teaching of mathematics 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.940
 known to the music in such a way that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.250
 today's music is the same aura of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 an instrument that precedes the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.840
 mathematics 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 the child who has this sequence a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.000
 musical instrument after math 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.270
 performs better in math than 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.880
 child going straight to math 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.430
 This has a scientific explanation. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 What is it called to the city ​​to overflow the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.350
 What is the fact that you are the child? 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.220
 learns to focus attention using the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 music that caused him enormous interest 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 children's fascination when she or he 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.820
 go to math she transfers that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.290
 focus on tension for something that does not 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 cause the same interest 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 but your income is higher 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.720
 wanting to stay focused on him he learned the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.119
 with his brain he learned to focus 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.759
 attention using the music and apply 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.470
 then this attention in math if it is 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.200
 otherwise it does not work 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:57.479
 hence the difficulty because the mathematics of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:00.630
 abstract reason this is the time in 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.439
 abstract is you have no motivation 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.290
 focus attention and listen and learn 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.970
 good now and you could say yes to 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.280
 perfect there the solution notes all 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 brazil schools with mute grade 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.620
 curricular and music boot 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.410
 mathematics do not know if it will work here 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.170
 I another is another apartment and the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.260
 managers of teachers will 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 have to equate this difficulty with 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.459
 We give people a suggestion based on the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.360
 neuroscience and educators will 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.910
 in fact check if this works right 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.680
 I mean, it has to start because 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.349
 is that the schools all have 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.200
 instruments that teaches music before 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.019
 things like that, super practices, but he 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.140
 can even be a bathroom can be a 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.319
 harmonica does not have to be anything urine 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.700
 sophisticated but it is a 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.390
 suggestion of management where 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.379
 practice that comes from one of a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.379
 research in neurosciences
