show<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.759> how<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.600> change<00:00:08.269> the<00:00:09.269> mouse<00:00:09.870> speed

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
show you how to change the mouse speed

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.620 
show you how to change the mouse speed
in<00:00:12.150> Windows<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.590> common<00:00:14.009> problems<00:00:14.960> of

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
in Windows one of the common problems of

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.439 
in Windows one of the common problems of
when<00:00:18.630> those<00:00:18.810> users<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.680> fact<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.449> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
when those users is the fact that the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
when those users is the fact that the
mouse<00:00:21.750> pointer<00:00:21.779> might<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.500> too<00:00:22.680> slow<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.189> too

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
mouse pointer might be too slow or too

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.609 
mouse pointer might be too slow or too
fast<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:25.460> people<00:00:26.460> tend<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.560> not<00:00:28.560> really

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
fast and people tend to not really

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
fast and people tend to not really
understand<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.390> know<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
understand they think it's you know the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.270 
understand they think it's you know the
mouse<00:00:32.059> different<00:00:33.059> Mouse<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.559> course<00:00:34.890> do

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
mouse different Mouse will of course do

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.450 
mouse different Mouse will of course do
different<00:00:36.260> have<00:00:37.260> different<00:00:37.500> reactions<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
different have different reactions and

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.840 
different have different reactions and
windows<00:00:38.820> work<00:00:39.270> differently<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:41.340> totally

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
windows work differently it's totally

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.639 
windows work differently it's totally
normal<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> hardware<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> different

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
normal because the hardware is different

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.119 
normal because the hardware is different
so<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.250> might<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:45.120> count<00:00:45.960> steps<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so it might not actually count steps the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
so it might not actually count steps the
same<00:00:47.370> way<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> biggest<00:00:48.930> problems

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
same way so one of the biggest problems

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
same way so one of the biggest problems
that<00:00:49.559> people<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> fact<00:00:50.879> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that people have is the fact that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
that people have is the fact that
they'll<00:00:51.809> find<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> their<00:00:52.469> mouse<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> slow<00:00:53.250> or

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
they'll find that their mouse is slow or

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.479 
they'll find that their mouse is slow or
fast<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.739> device<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.370> they

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
fast they think it's the device so they

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.729 
fast they think it's the device so they
just<00:00:56.699> don't<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.000> nothing<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.899> all

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
just don't do nothing about it and all

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
just don't do nothing about it and all
the<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.010> along<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.730> don't<00:00:59.910> know<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the way along what they don't know is

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.560 
the way along what they don't know is
that<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> mouse<00:01:02.280> speed<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.879> controlled

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
that well the mouse speed is controlled

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260 
that well the mouse speed is controlled
by<00:01:03.629> Windows<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.400> change<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
by Windows so you can change that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
by Windows so you can change that
information<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:09.290> simply

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
information so how do you do that simply

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.780 
information so how do you do that simply
go<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.950> Start<00:01:11.220> menu<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> bottom

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
go into your Start menu at the bottom

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.570 
go into your Start menu at the bottom
left<00:01:12.680> go<00:01:13.680> into<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> control<00:01:14.520> panel<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> best

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
left go into the control panel the best

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
left go into the control panel the best
way<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.689> onto<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> upper<00:01:19.710> right<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
way is go onto the upper right if you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.660 
way is go onto the upper right if you
have<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> categories<00:01:21.360> here<00:01:21.950> go<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> upper

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
have the categories here go to the upper

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
have the categories here go to the upper
right<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.240> instead<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.900> category<00:01:25.470> click

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
right and instead of category click

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.810 
right and instead of category click
large<00:01:26.729> icons<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.509> small<00:01:27.780> icons<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
large icons or small icons and there you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.920 
large icons or small icons and there you
will<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.770> mouse<00:01:31.770> which<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:33.000> already<00:01:33.810> be

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
will have mouse which will already be

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.280 
will have mouse which will already be
there<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.369> click<00:01:35.610> Mouse<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.360> you'll

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
there you can click Mouse and you'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.390 
there you can click Mouse and you'll
have<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.689> mouse<00:01:39.689> properties<00:01:40.229> window<00:01:40.470> show

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
have that mouse properties window show

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.219 
have that mouse properties window show
up<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.350> here<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.610> culprit<00:01:45.479> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
up and here is that little culprit that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.580 
up and here is that little culprit that
little<00:01:46.710> slider<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> middle<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.970> says

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
little slider in the middle that says

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.950 
little slider in the middle that says
double<00:01:49.590> click<00:01:49.860> speed<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> them<00:01:51.420> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
double click speed that's one of them so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
double click speed that's one of them so
if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.259> think<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> speed<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> clock

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
if you think the speed of the clock

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
if you think the speed of the clock
the<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.079> clicking<00:01:55.470> speed<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.860> too<00:01:56.369> slow<00:01:56.670> too

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the the clicking speed is too slow too

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.490 
the the clicking speed is too slow too
fast<00:01:57.290> that's<00:01:58.290> one<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.490> features<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fast that's one of the features and the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.010 
fast that's one of the features and the
other<00:02:01.770> feature<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.210> go<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> top

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
other feature is if you go on the top

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.710 
other feature is if you go on the top
and<00:02:04.670> click<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.320> pointers

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and click the pointers

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.910 
and click the pointers
there<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:10.369> can<00:02:10.399> see<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:12.080> different<00:02:12.470> pointers

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
there you can see the different pointers

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.660 
there you can see the different pointers
of<00:02:13.550> your<00:02:13.790> computer<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:15.230> course<00:02:15.670> pointer

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of your computer and of course pointer

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.790 
of your computer and of course pointer
option<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.420> where<00:02:17.720> you'll<00:02:17.930> see<00:02:18.640> pointer<00:02:19.640> speed

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
option is where you'll see pointer speed

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.830 
option is where you'll see pointer speed
so<00:02:21.800> if<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.280> put<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:23.060> fast<00:02:23.540> for

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
so if you put it you know fast for

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.650 
so if you put it you know fast for
example<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.320> put<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.830> leave<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:25.940> you'll

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
example I put it here leave it go you'll

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.400 
example I put it here leave it go you'll
see<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.440> is<00:02:27.830> extremely<00:02:28.490> fast<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
see that this is extremely fast and of

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.220 
see that this is extremely fast and of
course<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:30.980> go<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.430> slow<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:31.790> down<00:02:32.230> you

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
course you can go and slow it down you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.440 
course you can go and slow it down you
can<00:02:33.290> put<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.680> really<00:02:33.950> slow<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.640> person<00:02:35.240> has

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
can put it really slow if the person has

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.800 
can put it really slow if the person has
difficulty<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:39.880> I'll<00:02:40.880> put<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.240> back<00:02:41.420> about

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
difficulty and I'll put it back about

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.830 
difficulty and I'll put it back about
here<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.830> what<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:44.000> speed<00:02:44.330> so

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
here this is what I like in speed so

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.260 
here this is what I like in speed so
that's<00:02:45.500> where<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.920> speed<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.880> pointer

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
that's where the speed of the pointer

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.680 
that's where the speed of the pointer
itself<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:48.440> located<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.150> pointer<00:02:50.510> options

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
itself is located in the pointer options

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.650 
itself is located in the pointer options
so<00:02:51.410> two<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.160> those<00:02:52.310> speed<00:02:52.850> settings<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.540> you

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
so two of those speed settings that you

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.910 
so two of those speed settings that you
can<00:02:53.810> check<00:02:54.050> here<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:56.150> pointer<00:02:56.930> options<00:02:57.140> which

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
can check here the pointer options which

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.130 
can check here the pointer options which
is<00:02:58.250> select<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.760> pointer<00:02:59.060> speed<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.900> course

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
is select a pointer speed and of course

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.490 
is select a pointer speed and of course
in<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.680> buttons<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:02.150> buttons<00:03:02.300> section<00:03:02.930> where

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
in the buttons the buttons section where

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.730 
in the buttons the buttons section where
you<00:03:03.620> can<00:03:03.890> click<00:03:04.300> actually<00:03:05.300> see<00:03:05.780> how<00:03:05.990> fast<00:03:06.500> you

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
you can click actually see how fast you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.370 
you can click actually see how fast you
need<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:08.060> double<00:03:08.420> click<00:03:09.730> by<00:03:11.260> changing<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
need to double click by changing the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.420 
need to double click by changing the
double-click<00:03:12.920> speed<00:03:13.430> you'll<00:03:14.360> help<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:15.530> lot<00:03:16.310> of

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
double-click speed you'll help a lot of

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.750 
double-click speed you'll help a lot of
people<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:17.300> example<00:03:17.530> elderly<00:03:18.530> people<00:03:18.890> often

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
people for example elderly people often

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840 
people for example elderly people often
have<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:21.110> know<00:03:21.230> slower<00:03:21.800> fingers<00:03:22.489> when<00:03:22.730> you

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
have you know slower fingers when you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.699 
have you know slower fingers when you
double<00:03:23.269> click<00:03:23.300> do<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.840> have<00:03:24.080> difficulty

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
double click do you have difficulty

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.900 
double click do you have difficulty
doing<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.580> fast<00:03:26.300> enough<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.320> by<00:03:27.670> putting<00:03:28.670> it

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
doing it fast enough so by putting it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.740 
doing it fast enough so by putting it
slower

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
slower

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.259 
slower
well<00:03:30.650> it'll<00:03:30.980> be<00:03:31.130> it's<00:03:31.550> gonna<00:03:31.670> be<00:03:31.760> easier<00:03:32.209> for

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
well it'll be it's gonna be easier for

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.560 
well it'll be it's gonna be easier for
them<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:33.220> double<00:03:34.220> click<00:03:34.670> if<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.209> need<00:03:35.390> to

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
them to double click if you need to

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:45.180 
them to double click if you need to
double<00:03:35.720> click<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.230> an<00:03:36.350> item<00:03:37.660> and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.330 

don't<00:03:45.790> forget<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.710> pointer<00:03:47.710> options<00:03:47.890> is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
don't forget that pointer options is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.000 
don't forget that pointer options is
where<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.330> select<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.930> pointer<00:03:50.260> speed<00:03:50.440> so<00:03:50.890> it's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
where you select a pointer speed so it's

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.060 
where you select a pointer speed so it's
as<00:03:51.160> easy<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:51.610> once<00:03:52.450> you've<00:03:52.630> selected

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
as easy as that once you've selected

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.590 
as easy as that once you've selected
proper<00:03:54.070> speed<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.850> just<00:03:54.880> click<00:03:55.210> apply<00:03:55.600> ok<00:03:55.960> and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
proper speed you just click apply ok and

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.970 
proper speed you just click apply ok and
your<00:03:58.600> pointer<00:03:59.230> will<00:03:59.530> be<00:04:01.050> set<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:02.500> proper

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
your pointer will be set to the proper

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.330 
your pointer will be set to the proper
speed<00:04:03.600> once<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.840> for<00:04:05.080> all<00:04:05.110> so<00:04:05.530> if<00:04:05.770> you<00:04:05.920> changed

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
speed once and for all so if you changed

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.560 
speed once and for all so if you changed
mouse<00:04:06.990> by<00:04:07.990> new<00:04:08.260> mouse<00:04:08.520> if<00:04:09.520> you<00:04:09.700> bought<00:04:10.330> a<00:04:10.360> new

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
mouse by new mouse if you bought a new

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.920 
mouse by new mouse if you bought a new
computer<00:04:10.720> maybe<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:12.520> new<00:04:13.030> laptop<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:13.780> here

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
computer maybe like a new laptop in here

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.470 
computer maybe like a new laptop in here
little<00:04:14.200> touchpad<00:04:15.160> there<00:04:15.460> is<00:04:15.640> too<00:04:15.970> quick<00:04:16.450> for

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
little touchpad there is too quick for

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.140 
little touchpad there is too quick for
you<00:04:16.840> well<00:04:17.650> that's<00:04:17.980> where<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.580> go<00:04:18.820> and

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you well that's where you can go and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.670 
you well that's where you can go and
adjust<00:04:19.330> these<00:04:19.989> settings

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
adjust these settings

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.730 
adjust these settings
so<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.220> they<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.700> the<00:04:21.880> proper<00:04:21.910> speed<00:04:22.740> for

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
so that they get the proper speed for

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.410 
so that they get the proper speed for
your<00:04:24.310> usage

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
your usage

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.540 
your usage
everybody<00:04:26.230> likes<00:04:26.470> a<00:04:26.590> different<00:04:26.920> speed<00:04:27.280> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
everybody likes a different speed and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.100 
everybody likes a different speed and
it's<00:04:27.700> really<00:04:27.970> personal<00:04:28.450> sometimes<00:04:28.660> it's<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
it's really personal sometimes it's a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.690 
it's really personal sometimes it's a
computer<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.560> can<00:04:29.710> that's<00:04:30.310> somebody<00:04:30.610> you

know gave you or maybe you bought it

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.500 
know gave you or maybe you bought it
secondhand<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:35.790> you<00:04:36.790> know<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.060> speed<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.420> the

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
secondhand and you know the speed of the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.930 
secondhand and you know the speed of the
pointer<00:04:37.840> is<00:04:37.930> not<00:04:38.110> good<00:04:38.590> for<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.100> then<00:04:39.460> you

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
pointer is not good for you then you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
know where to go to change it so don't

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.110 
know where to go to change it so don't
