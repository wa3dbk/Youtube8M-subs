okay<00:00:00.840> we<00:00:01.020> finished<00:00:01.380> hypochromic<00:00:01.890> microcytic

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
okay we finished hypochromic microcytic

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.579 
okay we finished hypochromic microcytic
anyway<00:00:02.939> we<00:00:03.060> talked<00:00:03.300> about<00:00:03.449> iron<00:00:04.049> deficiency

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
anyway we talked about iron deficiency

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.860 
anyway we talked about iron deficiency
anemia<00:00:05.040> thalassemia<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.240> enough<00:00:06.480> chronic

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870

plastic and you know we talked about

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.700 
plastic and you know we talked about
vitamin<00:00:12.509> b12<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:12.990> she's<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.410> folate

deficiency<00:00:14.000> now<00:00:15.000> today<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.599> will<00:00:15.630> talk<00:00:15.900> about

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
deficiency now today we will talk about

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080 
deficiency now today we will talk about
normal<00:00:16.410> citic<00:00:16.890> anymore<00:00:17.400> which<00:00:17.550> which<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
normal citic anymore which which is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939 
normal citic anymore which which is
which<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.660> much<00:00:18.960> easier<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.830> is

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
which is much easier because it is

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.810 
which is much easier because it is
Muslim<00:00:20.369> much<00:00:20.820> simpler<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.609> just
