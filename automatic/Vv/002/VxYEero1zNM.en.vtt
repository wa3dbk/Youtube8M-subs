00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.260
 how are you I hope very well the day of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.820
 today we are going to talk about a trend that 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.020
 I love the fringes 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.880
 we will also be able to use them 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.130
 perfectly in autumn-winter we 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.170
 let's have fun with dresses with blouses 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.619
 and even with accessories, come with me to see 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.619
 these looks 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.809
 we started with the fringes is a 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.610
 very fun trend we can use 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.090
 at night as for example in this look 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.040
 I bring the fringed skirt is imitation 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.870
 maybe they will also find it on 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.300
 normal skin what they like and in the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.430
 color you like reaches the waist 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.229
 so I put on a room for a 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.850
 of those visits that are short but not 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.159
 I see nothing because laffage 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.600
 completely the stripes is a trend 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.550
 that never goes out of style and also 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.989
 verticals make us see much more 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.059
 thin then I love I bring a 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.460
 necklace as accessory this necklace 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.170
 it also has brightness is discreet but 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.619
 I find it ideal to use during 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.840
 night the shoes full of freshness and 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.630
 the flavor have estoperoles have 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.390
 shines a little bit of everything to encourage this 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.579
 night look and finally a clutch 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 this one that also has a very design 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.420
 funny 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.930
 and if you do not like clothes with 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.820
 fringes it does not matter you can use it on 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
 accessories like for example these 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.860
 booties had charms because they are tall 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.310
 they are fun we can use them from 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.930
 with jeans with a skirt with leggings or 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.180

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.280
 black or white and a layer like 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.690
 accessories I bring a belt the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.460
 belt goes well with the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.980
 layer colors also makes a 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.470
 nice contrast and I bring a necklace very 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.480
 tiny little discreet necklaces these 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.580

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.070
 match using many or only 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.710
 I also bring rings to the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.360
 knuckles that look amazing make 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.880

 in this black klotz ideal to use 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.990

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.590
 and now they are going to see a lot of fringes in 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.330
 This dress has straight cut that will 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.190
 favors all types of body but to me 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.530
 I like acintur arme a little more 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.370
 then I put a belt on this 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.800
 height to give it an extra touch I'm 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.390
 wearing very rough shoes the 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.820
 dress is already very weak and then 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.010
 choosing shoes that were much more 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.640
 attractive and much more intense are very 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.470
 tall 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.410
 I find this look ideal for using 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.600
 also during the night this bag that 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.550
 come here have 'animal print' to me 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.140
 love black with animal print 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.270
 always combine this because you see 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.310
 Incredible, it's also a vintage bag 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.400
 this is from my grandmother but you 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.950
 you could find some I do not know a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.480
 antique market some I do not know to 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.370
 some place where they sell antiques 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.709
 there are many places the truth is something of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.790
 look up I'm using only one 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.790
 bracelet as a final touch 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.540
 This is probably the most casual look 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.260
 I'm all wearing a jacket of 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.849
 skin 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.400
 we will also enjoy them a lot in 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.439
 autumn has fringes what makes her a lot 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.689
 more fun and also that we have it 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:30.140

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.340
 jeans those that are in court had pros and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.049
 you feel that your legs are not what 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.959
 sufficiently thin you can use the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.510
 Cut boot or straight cut boots 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.450
 they are tall high high booties have 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.400
 but also create another 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.549
 diversity to this look give you more 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.180
 emotion and I'm finally using a 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.159
 bag a tiny bag is medium yo 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.230

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.720
 they can also use it during the night 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.819

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.829

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.450
 I love chains and this long 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.180
 makes the trunk look much more 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.950
 long then opt for long necklaces 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.950
 when they have the short trunk 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.690
