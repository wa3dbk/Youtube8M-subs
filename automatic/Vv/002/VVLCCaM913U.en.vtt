00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 brother 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 no human being 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.260
 health is a right and it is a right 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.060
 that is not susceptible to consideration 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.100
 differential depending on whether there 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.400
 bonanza or recession the argument 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.500
 economic is a fallacy a lie the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.330
 government has not been able to differentiate 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.100
 health tourism of attention to 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.570
 undocumented immigrants still in 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.730
 times of crisis and human rights 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 are still valid I think that interest that 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.960
 intended economic interest ever 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.480
 could be at the same level as the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.110
 right to healthcare no 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.270
 reaching a patient is a threat 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.240
 for all contacts in the population 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.229
 that this patient can have the most 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.840
 likely is that the court 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.950
 constitutional declares unconstitutional 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 this measure but in my life 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.180
 some right I have and at least I have 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.840
 straight 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.870
 to know that I have a doctor instead me 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.520
 I think there is a substrate a sector of the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.400
 population something that is below 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.450
 our skin in a lot of Spaniards that 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.550
 has to do directly with the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.220
 xenophobia with racism evidently 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.090
 if we exclude 100,000 for 500,000 us 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.400
 they want and we send them out or in addition 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.800
 some of us killed them obviously 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.470
 that the budget line will fall 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.660
 I believe that the government has opted for 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.490
 another health model not for a model 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.340
 sanitary universal but for a model 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.890
 for sure if the economic crisis 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.840
 deepens or stays in time 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.490
 what will be the next collective that 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.440
 our government is going to raise its 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.940
 exclusion a letter that is being a 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.280
 substitute for the health card what 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.470
 only that for three months in a2 there is now 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.660
 wait for the letter to expire and hopefully 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.910
 I do not have to go to the doctor here, I do not 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.090
 I know what's going to happen to gluten and I do not 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.310
 allows more 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.310
 feel guilty for being sick 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.120
 point that are direct taxes 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.739
 indirect and we are paying the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.349
 100% of all indirect taxes 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.430
 that we did travel and we are not 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.430
 doing harm 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.440
 we came back 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.010
 and we keep working we continue 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.010
 working 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:56.040
 and a person who is human is capable 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.040
 to take a measure of non-school
