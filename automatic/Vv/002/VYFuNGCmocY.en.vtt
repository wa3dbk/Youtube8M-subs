00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we're gonna talk about that in this

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.630 
we're gonna talk about that in this
review<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> coverage<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.750> definitely<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
review the coverage is definitely as it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.310 
review the coverage is definitely as it
does<00:01:53.820> say<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> back<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.659> medium<00:01:55.079> coverage

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
does say in the back a medium coverage

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.990 
does say in the back a medium coverage
maybe<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.159> bit<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> medium<00:01:56.790> full

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
maybe a little bit on the medium full

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.190 
maybe a little bit on the medium full
coverage<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.540> definitely<00:01:57.719> medium

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
coverage but it's definitely medium

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.359 
coverage but it's definitely medium
coverage<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.100> cover

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
coverage so it's gonna cover

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.789 
coverage so it's gonna cover
imperfections<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.899> finish<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
imperfections the finish on this is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.730 
imperfections the finish on this is
gorge<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> satin<00:02:03.689> finish<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.259> then

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
gorge it is a satin finish and then

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
gorge it is a satin finish and then
later<00:02:05.070> on<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.850> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.299> radiant<00:02:06.750> in

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
later on it's a little bit radiant in

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.230 
later on it's a little bit radiant in
the<00:02:06.899> beginning

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the beginning

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.559 
the beginning
and<00:02:07.390> then<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.689> really<00:02:08.259> turns<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.610> little

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
and then it really turns it up a little

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.809 
and then it really turns it up a little
bit<00:02:10.810> later<00:02:11.020> on<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.830> longer<00:02:12.130> you<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.489> it<00:02:12.640> on

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
bit later on the longer you have it on

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.979 
bit later on the longer you have it on
but<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:14.260> entails<00:02:14.980> oils<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.180> all<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.840> good

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
but that entails oils and all that good

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:17.280 
but that entails oils and all that good

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.600 
this I do have a foundation on this
isn't<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> best<00:02:35.410> application<00:02:36.130> because<00:02:36.489> I'm

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
isn't the best application because I'm

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.750 
isn't the best application because I'm
using<00:02:36.819> different<00:02:37.060> brushes<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:39.310> see

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
let's see about 4 to 5 hours so I really

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.009 
let's see about 4 to 5 hours so I really
mattified<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.220> my<00:02:51.340> t-zone<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:52.180> crazy<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.750> used

mattified in my t-zone like crazy I used
milk<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.319> magnesia

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
milk of magnesia

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.270 
milk of magnesia
I<00:02:54.069> used<00:02:54.610> Estee<00:02:55.060> Lauder<00:02:55.299> mattifying<00:02:56.019> primer<00:02:56.950> in

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
I used Estee Lauder mattifying primer in

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.240 
I used Estee Lauder mattifying primer in
the<00:02:57.430> center<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.150> this<00:02:59.019> actually<00:02:59.769> came<00:03:00.040> out

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the center and this actually came out

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.289 
the center and this actually came out
pretty<00:03:00.810> decent<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:02.799> however<00:03:03.280> in<00:03:03.700> photos<00:03:04.060> I

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
pretty decent but however in photos I

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.479 
pretty decent but however in photos I
can<00:03:04.450> definitely<00:03:04.720> see<00:03:05.200> it<00:03:05.230> more<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
can definitely see it more and if you

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.240 
can definitely see it more and if you
don't<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.540> are<00:03:07.720> team<00:03:07.989> oily<00:03:08.380> or<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:09.130> are

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
don't if you are team oily or you are

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.970 
don't if you are team oily or you are
combo<00:03:09.760> you're<00:03:10.120> going<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:11.049> to<00:03:11.260> manaphy

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
combo you're going to have to manaphy

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.420 
combo you're going to have to manaphy
and<00:03:12.370> put<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.299> mattifying<00:03:13.709> powder<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.980> top<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and put a mattifying powder on top of it

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.069 
and put a mattifying powder on top of it
and<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.579> think<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.420> has<00:03:16.600> helped<00:03:16.900> too<00:03:17.049> I

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
and I think that that has helped too I

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.349 
and I think that that has helped too I
put<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.470> NARS<00:03:19.140> light<00:03:20.140> reflecting<00:03:21.030> powder<00:03:22.030> and

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
put the NARS light reflecting powder and

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.520 
put the NARS light reflecting powder and
the<00:03:22.420> center<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> t-zone<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the center in the t-zone and that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.259 
the center in the t-zone and that
magnifies<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.190> nobody's<00:03:24.579> business<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.239> I

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
magnifies like nobody's business so I

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.360 
magnifies like nobody's business so I
had<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.750> triple<00:03:26.230> mattify<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> had<00:03:26.859> to<00:03:27.040> use<00:03:27.220> the

you're gonna need it you're going to

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.009 
you're gonna need it you're going to
have<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.310> need<00:03:42.459> that<00:03:42.640> for<00:03:42.700> this<00:03:43.269> foundation

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
have to need that for this foundation

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.470 
have to need that for this foundation
and<00:03:44.290> if<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.310> don't<00:03:45.549> do<00:03:45.760> all<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.150> you

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.000 
and if you don't do all that you
probably<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.170> need<00:03:47.319> some<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:47.890> of

control to help with the oil because
you're<00:03:54.790> going<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.359> get<00:03:56.350> oil<00:03:56.680> coming<00:03:57.160> through

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
you're going to get oil coming through

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.979 
you're going to get oil coming through
and<00:03:57.579> it's<00:03:57.700> going<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.970> make<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.209> look<00:03:58.389> even<00:03:58.569> more

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
and it's going to make it look even more

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.780

eventually<00:04:01.209> you're<00:04:01.450> gonna<00:04:01.540> look<00:04:01.720> like<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.900> oil

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
eventually you're gonna look like a oil
