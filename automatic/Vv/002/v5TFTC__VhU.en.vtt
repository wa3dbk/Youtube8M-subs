probably<00:00:07.020> harder<00:00:07.470> waiting<00:00:07.890> after<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
probably harder waiting after the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.830 
probably harder waiting after the
competition<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.120> have<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> watch<00:00:09.570> your

competition and sit there for hours

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.370 
competition and sit there for hours
that's<00:00:12.059> probably<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> harder<00:00:12.780> part<00:00:13.049> actually

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
that's probably the harder part actually

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.500 
that's probably the harder part actually
then<00:00:13.530> actually<00:00:13.889> playing

a<00:00:57.120> new<00:00:57.239> back<00:00:57.449> action<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.290> didn't<00:00:58.470> have<00:00:58.559> to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
a new back action we didn't have to

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.549 
a new back action we didn't have to
replace<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> we<00:01:00.089> can<00:01:00.269> have<00:01:00.390> between<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
replace it we can have between two and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.090 
replace it we can have between two and
four<00:01:01.739> hundred<00:01:01.980> labor<00:01:02.519> hours<00:01:02.910> into<00:01:03.540> one

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
four hundred labor hours into one

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.620 
four hundred labor hours into one
restoration<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.760> fact<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> that's<00:01:06.300> more

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
restoration the fact is that's more

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.360 
restoration the fact is that's more
hours<00:01:06.990> than<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> manufacturers<00:01:08.100> spent

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
hours than the manufacturers spent

hours than the manufacturers spent
actually<00:01:08.610> building<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.480> piano<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.930> first

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
actually building the piano in the first

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.899 
actually building the piano in the first
place<00:01:11.030> slowly<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:13.680> instrument<00:01:14.130> emerges<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
place slowly the instrument emerges and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
place slowly the instrument emerges and
at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> end<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.550> something

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
at the end you really can have something

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.440 
at the end you really can have something
very<00:01:18.480> very<00:01:18.630> special<00:01:25.730> but<00:01:26.730> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> originally

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
very very special but in the originally

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.030 
very very special but in the originally
trained<00:01:27.690> as<00:01:27.720> an<00:01:27.960> x-ray<00:01:28.170> tech<00:01:28.470> actually<00:01:28.830> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
trained as an x-ray tech actually I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.080 
trained as an x-ray tech actually I
spent<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.310> year<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> College<00:01:30.000> of

piano<00:01:35.310> around<00:01:35.850> eight<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.390> gigs<00:01:36.690> these<00:01:37.020> people

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
piano around eight two gigs these people

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.690 
piano around eight two gigs these people
are<00:01:37.410> creative<00:01:37.920> people<00:01:37.950> they<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.460> have

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
are creative people they all have

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760 
are creative people they all have
something<00:01:39.660> that<00:01:40.170> they're<00:01:40.320> passionate<00:01:40.500> about

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
something that they're passionate about

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.150 
something that they're passionate about
is<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.730> necessarily<00:01:42.120> piano<00:01:42.510> work<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
is not necessarily piano work and it

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.970 
is not necessarily piano work and it
seems<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.820> we<00:01:44.850> give<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.420> freedom<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
seems if we give them the freedom to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.010 
seems if we give them the freedom to
follow<00:01:46.980> their<00:01:47.250> passion<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.020> they're

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
follow their passion and they're

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:58.580 
follow their passion and they're
passionate<00:01:49.230> when<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.770> come<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.190> work

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 

so<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.340> had<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> competition<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so we had a competition and it was a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:10.490 
so we had a competition and it was a
very<00:02:01.259> very<00:02:01.590> nice<00:02:01.829> event<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:09.140> really<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.289> feel

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
very very nice event I really do feel

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800 
very very nice event I really do feel
like<00:02:10.560> every<00:02:11.099> piano<00:02:11.430> has<00:02:11.760> its<00:02:12.000> own<00:02:12.209> individual

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
like every piano has its own individual

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.830 
like every piano has its own individual
personality<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.770> soul<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.660> sometimes<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
personality and soul and sometimes that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.280 
personality and soul and sometimes that
soul<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.349> very<00:02:16.620> well<00:02:16.860> hidden<00:02:17.989> by<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> lot<00:02:19.260> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
soul is very well hidden by a lot of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.199 
soul is very well hidden by a lot of
problems<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> piano<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.849> what<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.150> do

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
problems in the piano and what they do

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.790 
problems in the piano and what they do
is<00:02:21.420> they<00:02:21.569> get<00:02:21.690> rid<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> all<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.200> those<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.769> that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
is they get rid of all of those so that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:51.270 
is they get rid of all of those so that
the<00:02:23.069> piano<00:02:24.030> lives<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.540> reads<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280
