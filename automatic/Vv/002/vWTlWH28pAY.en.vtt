00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.040
 ask dear 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 I want to tell you today about fishing 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.839
 foam here this place was my favorite 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.310
 where I often fish here 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.939
 flyers worth rod on the floor and fishing line 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.390
 such a stick is hung here 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.160
 here is the whole prepares casting second bait 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 you were thus not involved 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.270
 two fishing rods 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.149
 this spinning rod usual now 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 you when physics moment bite 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.010
 first bite this year means I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.379
 specifically came now on the leaves though 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 I must say to the advantage of this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.620
 tackle on the foam in principle can not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.480
 hook he sits there almost here 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.050
 is being drawn in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 to show you were visually 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.660
 undercutting spills 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.710
 easy means and 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.760
 thing a gram on 500 probably a bream so 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.290
 let's say apparently this stand came 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.370
 literally a few minutes you 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.460
 see gifts trough still porridge as was 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.960
 remained virtually untouched 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.270
 but the fish will see white balls out of america 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.290
 this foam is hooked 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.060
 Something as he dressed, too, can be see details and 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.110
 he will tell everything later in 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.850
 following in the next reports there as 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.670
 it's all to do I have to say that I do a lot 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:48.149
 years doing only this kind of fishing 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:52.000
 foam and bream and crucian carp is 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.009
 mean on carp we have about the same 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.490
 small nuances which she then 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.479
 all make their reports tell here 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:06.399
 was that it, too, as you can see 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:10.030
 the feeder is still absolutely that simple 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.910
 there was a demonstrative lesson 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.510
 for so for those who don't believe in this 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.330
 tackle 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.780
 please see subscribe to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.170
 the channel and all the details will be in 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.260
 I tell you further I welcome 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.470
 dear fishermen today I want you 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:34.200
 tell about the magic wand 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.790
 which I consider together with nost 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.720
 as if in one piece 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.959
 but let's compare it with the clock that was 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.830
 a nasty ca n't hang down minute 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:52.120
 hand and watch tackle this is watch 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.950
 arrow here is this wand minute hand 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.760
 which allows 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:04.800
 more accurately and clearly determine the bite 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.520
 and the cutting accuracy means options in 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.160
 bites may be slightly but 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.480
 different from being considered the first option 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.580
 bite on this stick 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.090
 so here we see a stretch goes mean 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.620
 fish pulls it already captured this our 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.290
 foam ball and here at the moment 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.380
 maximum stretch when deviation 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.500
 maximum occurs then sweeps 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.160
 and at the time of weakening 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.050
 that's when the wand starts to sink into 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.230
 This time it is undesirable because 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.120
 that how would the fish most likely move in 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:51.440
 tackle direction 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 so you can pull out 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.310
 out of her mouth because see 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.650
 what size fish again if she 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.200
 large then it turns out that you can 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.820
 snatch her card and so quite often 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.430
 going on even a lip there tear off here in 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.840
 principle the essence comes down to the moment 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.169
 stretch should be sprinkled 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.780
 maximum and when it took place and blah 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.140
 long enough standing relaxed 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.640
 able then, too, can podsekat 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.669
 or when you see it already 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.010
 occurs repeatedly that is stretch 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:39.150
 because glorification stretch weakening then 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.640
 there he is there like to sit everywhere 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.470
 child that fish is different in size 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.340
 small fish like this one 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.990
 option means 4 I would generally leak 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.169
 did not become because this gnome 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.230
 some trifle hammering and here you are only 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:01.320
 in vain will and tug and 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:04.150
 food as if you were wasting 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.040
 would most likely be an empty pigtail or 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.390
 maybe some will not get me just 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.570
 r which is worthy of our attention but here 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.920
 This option means bite here on my 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.660
 look here in this form most so 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.410
 let's say it looks like stew 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.160
 big fish because slower 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.090
 lift 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:35.250
 more so powerfully well small fish so 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:39.360
 how such smooth suspenders do not 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:43.060
 more often than smaller fish that speech 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.670
 bite now I want to show how 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.990
 going on means detaching the wand 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:53.320
 automatically from the main line 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:59.470
 there is now she stretches and breaks down 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:02.140
 This is an option but real and which is already 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.970
 I used to see that I managed 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.450
 to shoot 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:10.900
 so big fish sat in principle I 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.620
 I saw that she pecked well, I just filmed 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.120
 for 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:20.260
 as if to show in 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.210
 reality here's a time meter like this 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.840
 happens but I just know that there is a fish 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.500
 already sitting therefore I kind of do 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.800
 interval 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:34.720
 not in a hurry with cutting and just like 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.820
 demonstrates and bite here but if 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.240
 would this be a tesla bite 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.840
 first time no matter what they are fish there 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:47.820
 sits when most likely it would be necessary 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:52.020
 cut a bit earlier but over there sits 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.020
 Sign up so 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.950
 Well, in general, that's all good luck
