00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
exciting part about it is that there is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
exciting part about it is that there is
always<00:01:08.430> another<00:01:09.330> level<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
always another level to go to when you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.300 
always another level to go to when you
create<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> were<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.479> creator<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
create and you were the creator there is

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.179 
create and you were the creator there is
no<00:01:14.490> boundary<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.549> future<00:01:18.030> holds<00:01:18.540> no

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
no boundary right so the future holds no

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
no boundary right so the future holds no
obstacles<00:01:20.869> that's<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.110> future<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.040> that's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
obstacles that's the future so that's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
obstacles that's the future so that's
what<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.240> forward<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
what we have to look forward to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.010 
what we have to look forward to
I<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.500> produce<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.330> system<00:01:27.330> where<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.869> is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
I will produce a system where there is

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
I will produce a system where there is
no<00:01:28.259> negative<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.189> hinder<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.380> what<00:01:31.380> has

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
happened now we don't have too much time

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.670 
happened now we don't have too much time
what<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.250> happening<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.180> negative<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:37.350> allow

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
what is happening the negative we allow

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.139 
what is happening the negative we allow
to<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:39.950> thought<00:01:41.299> we<00:01:42.299> allowed<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:43.100> a

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
to have thought we allowed it have a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.990 
to have thought we allowed it have a
power<00:01:45.149> right<00:01:45.979> I'm<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.250> put<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
power right I'm gonna put it into that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
power right I'm gonna put it into that
not<00:01:48.630> into<00:01:49.110> negative<00:01:49.649> where<00:01:50.070> negative<00:01:50.670> don't

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.859 
threatening right it's a negative that's
gonna<00:01:56.009> work<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.430> us<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> negative

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
gonna work for us right not a negative

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
gonna work for us right not a negative
that<00:01:58.140> has<00:01:58.350> power<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.119> come<00:02:00.299> against
