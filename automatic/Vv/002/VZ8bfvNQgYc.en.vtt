in the front and it's just so happy that
seam

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
seam

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.140 
seam
so<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:25.940> nicely<00:01:27.310> onto<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.430> rod<00:01:28.610> without<00:01:29.030> me

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
so that nicely onto the rod without me

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.789 
so that nicely onto the rod without me
having<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.479> sew<00:01:29.690> anything<00:01:29.960> all<00:01:30.260> I<00:01:30.320> did<00:01:30.530> was<00:01:30.650> put

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
having to sew anything all I did was put

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.620 
having to sew anything all I did was put
a<00:01:30.830> little<00:01:31.040> East<00:01:31.220> 6000<00:01:31.790> glue<00:01:31.909> on<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> end<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
a little East 6000 glue on the end and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.990 
a little East 6000 glue on the end and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
work real good in order to blow in the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.800 
work real good in order to blow in the
wind<00:01:37.070> just<00:01:37.490> fine<00:01:37.670> our<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.060> be<00:01:38.180> very<00:01:38.390> visible

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
wind just fine our to be very visible

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.020 
wind just fine our to be very visible
and<00:01:38.990> this<00:01:39.590> one<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.190> other<00:01:40.310> one<00:01:40.490> was<00:01:40.640> wouldn't

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
and this one the other one was wouldn't

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.880 
and this one the other one was wouldn't
this<00:01:41.360> one<00:01:41.509> will<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:41.899> lot<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:42.140> flex<00:01:42.649> and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
this one will have a lot more flex and

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.980 
this one will have a lot more flex and
should<00:01:43.040> last<00:01:43.190> me<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.430> lot<00:01:43.580> longer<00:01:43.759> Plus<00:01:44.240> that

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
should last me a lot longer Plus that

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.499

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
it's a two-piece Pole so I can separate

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.330 
it's a two-piece Pole so I can separate
it<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.830> store<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:48.979> one<00:01:49.100> of<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.220> rod

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
