00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.630 
Eddie with dairying and seven years ago
we<00:00:29.760> started<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.560> processing<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
we started with the first processing and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.680 
we started with the first processing and
a<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:33.380> stranded<00:00:34.760> processing<00:00:35.760> plant<00:00:36.000> about

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
a little stranded processing plant about

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.430 
a little stranded processing plant about
four<00:00:36.989> miles<00:00:37.230> away<00:00:37.440> from<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:38.160> own<00:00:38.489> place<00:00:38.730> here

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
four miles away from our own place here

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.030 
four miles away from our own place here
and<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.649> has<00:00:41.239> evolved<00:00:42.239> since<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:44.010> started

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and it has evolved since then we started

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.229 
and it has evolved since then we started
to<00:00:44.399> throw<00:00:44.610> bit<00:00:44.989> 1015<00:00:45.989> dairy<00:00:46.350> cows<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.239> right

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to throw bit 1015 dairy cows and right

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.920 
to throw bit 1015 dairy cows and right
now<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.450> mill<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> from<00:00:49.410> 40<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> 50<00:00:50.489> cows<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
now we mill it from 40 to 50 cows and we

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
now we mill it from 40 to 50 cows and we
have<00:00:52.020> an<00:00:52.170> on-site<00:00:52.640> processing<00:00:53.640> plant<00:00:53.879> where

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
have an on-site processing plant where

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.779 
have an on-site processing plant where
we<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> processing<00:00:55.460> where<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.610> make

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
we do all the processing where we make

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.840 
we do all the processing where we make
all<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> products<00:00:57.559> we<00:00:58.559> started<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.309> whole

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
all the products we started with whole

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
milk yogurt plain vanilla and that's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
milk yogurt plain vanilla and that's
what<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.830> thought<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.339> would<00:01:05.369> stay<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
what we thought we would stay with but

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
what we thought we would stay with but
then<00:01:06.900> people<00:01:07.170> started<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> ask<00:01:07.860> about<00:01:08.189> 2%<00:01:08.610> 1%

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
then people started to ask about 2% 1%

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.050 
then people started to ask about 2% 1%
and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.710> start<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> scheme<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.729> had

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and then we start the scheme so you had

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.890 
and then we start the scheme so you had
the<00:01:12.510> cream<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:13.320> went<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> 52<00:01:14.580> percent

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
the cream we went to 52 percent

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.490

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
due to the health from people I think is

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.660 
due to the health from people I think is
we<00:02:15.440> stay<00:02:15.650> away<00:02:15.740> from<00:02:15.830> that<00:02:16.360> right<00:02:17.360> now<00:02:17.600> we<00:02:17.660> are

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
we stay away from that right now we are

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.570 
we stay away from that right now we are
all<00:02:19.670> self-sufficient<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:20.780> our<00:02:20.900> feed<00:02:21.580> except

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
all self-sufficient with our feed except

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.240 
all self-sufficient with our feed except
feed<00:02:23.480> ingredients<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.320> we<00:02:24.530> don't<00:02:24.830> grow<00:02:25.010> at

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
feed ingredients that we don't grow at

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.449 
feed ingredients that we don't grow at
all<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.670> area<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.240> molasses<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.020> buy<00:02:27.200> in

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
all in this area like molasses we buy in

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.250 
all in this area like molasses we buy in
minerals<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.860> buy<00:02:31.130> some<00:02:31.820> flax<00:02:32.209> meal<00:02:32.510> from

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
minerals and we buy some flax meal from

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.339 
minerals and we buy some flax meal from
Iowa<00:02:33.830> crossing<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:34.970> all<00:02:35.150> has<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.600> be

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
Iowa crossing and that all has to be

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.690 
Iowa crossing and that all has to be
certified<00:02:37.159> organic<00:02:37.430> or<00:02:38.030> certified<00:02:38.900> duped<00:02:39.700> or

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
certified organic or certified duped or

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.190 
certified organic or certified duped or
we<00:02:40.969> don't<00:02:41.090> use<00:02:41.329> any<00:02:42.310> artificial<00:02:43.310> inputs<00:02:44.200> so

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
we don't use any artificial inputs so

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.649 
we don't use any artificial inputs so
it's<00:02:45.349> better<00:02:45.560> for<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.859> land<00:02:46.120> but<00:02:47.120> I<00:02:47.180> think

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
it's better for the land but I think

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.599 
it's better for the land but I think

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
starts with the soil you feed the soil

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.970 
starts with the soil you feed the soil
the<00:02:52.609> solid<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.689> get<00:02:53.810> over<00:02:53.989> your<00:02:54.109> feet<00:02:54.439> for<00:02:54.890> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
cows if that's balanced on the dishes
