looking at our now sandblasted abutment

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
looking at our now sandblasted abutment
I<00:00:13.920> want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> show<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.670> there's<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> big

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
difference you know when you have a an

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.550 
difference you know when you have a an
abutment<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.420> has<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> matte<00:00:18.930> finish<00:00:18.960> now

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
abutment that has a matte finish now

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.439 
abutment that has a matte finish now
when<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> cement<00:00:20.310> attaches<00:00:20.880> now<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
when the cement attaches now to that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.759 
when the cement attaches now to that
you'll<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.900> little<00:00:22.109> better<00:00:22.199> bite<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.710> little

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you'll get a little better bite a little

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.759 
you'll get a little better bite a little
better<00:00:23.100> bonding<00:00:24.109> and<00:00:25.109> then<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.439> highly

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
better bonding and then the highly

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
better bonding and then the highly
polished<00:00:26.039> area<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> go<00:00:27.359> toward

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
polished area that's going to go toward

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.900 
polished area that's going to go toward
the<00:00:27.750> soft<00:00:28.050> tissue<00:00:28.609> all<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:31.219> with<00:00:32.219> that

let's just see now it's better cut at

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.270 
let's just see now it's better cut at
least<00:01:23.899> a<00:01:24.020> couple<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.409> weeks<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.950> we're<00:01:25.159> going

to take first-hand look at what that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.200 
to take first-hand look at what that
tissue<00:01:27.979> looks<00:01:28.369> like<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:30.800> right<00:01:31.009> let's<00:01:32.000> see

the<00:02:28.280> implant<00:02:29.500> we're<00:02:30.500> worried<00:02:30.860> about<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
the implant we're worried about the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.259 
the implant we're worried about the
threads<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.760> want<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:31.940> make<00:02:32.030> sure<00:02:32.060> the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
first make sure we got a good seat and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.990 
first make sure we got a good seat and
then<00:03:24.470> our<00:03:24.650> crown<00:03:26.920> I'm<00:03:27.920> going<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.280> back<00:03:28.520> up<00:03:28.820> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
then our crown I'm going to back up the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.670 
then our crown I'm going to back up the
magnification<00:03:29.810> so<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:30.050> can<00:03:30.200> see<00:03:30.350> how<00:03:30.500> this

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
magnification so you can see how this

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.420 
magnification so you can see how this
all<00:03:30.860> goes<00:03:31.100> into<00:03:31.370> place<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.860> haven't<00:03:33.860> tried

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
all goes into place so I haven't tried

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.370 
all goes into place so I haven't tried
this<00:03:34.700> in<00:03:34.940> yet<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.840> first<00:03:36.110> try<00:03:36.440> and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
this in yet so this is the first try and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.790 
this in yet so this is the first try and
it<00:03:39.380> goes<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.890> like<00:03:40.070> so<00:03:40.720> now<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.780> my<00:03:42.290> hand<00:03:42.620> it

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
it goes in like so now to my hand it

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.920 
it goes in like so now to my hand it
seems<00:03:43.100> like<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.640> little<00:03:43.880> tight<00:03:44.150> right<00:03:44.450> now

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
seems like it's a little tight right now

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.510 
seems like it's a little tight right now
we<00:03:45.110> went<00:03:45.500> with<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> little<00:03:45.980> lighter<00:03:46.160> color

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
we went with a little lighter color

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.400 
we went with a little lighter color
because<00:03:46.850> luigi<00:03:47.330> wants<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.750> bleach<00:03:47.960> his<00:03:48.140> front

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
because luigi wants to bleach his front

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.060 
because luigi wants to bleach his front
teeth<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.960> but<00:03:50.960> it<00:03:51.080> feels<00:03:51.320> tight<00:03:51.710> so<00:03:51.950> I'm

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
teeth and but it feels tight so I'm

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.680 
teeth and but it feels tight so I'm
going<00:03:52.220> to<00:03:52.250> spend<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.730> next<00:03:52.880> few<00:03:53.150> minutes<00:03:53.390> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
going to spend the next few minutes to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.040 
going to spend the next few minutes to
adjust<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.110> contacts<00:03:55.060> I'll<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.480> simply<00:03:56.870> use

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
adjust the contacts I'll just simply use

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.310 
adjust the contacts I'll just simply use
a<00:03:57.080> pencil<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:58.010> one<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.510> make<00:03:59.510> a<00:03:59.540> mark<00:03:59.900> adjust

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
a pencil and one to make a mark adjust

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.080 
a pencil and one to make a mark adjust
adjust<00:04:00.530> adjust<00:04:00.890> until<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:01.580> down<00:04:01.760> all<00:04:02.000> the

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
adjust adjust until it's down all the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.240 
adjust adjust until it's down all the
way<00:04:02.240> but<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:02.990> far<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:03.350> what<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.740> see<00:04:03.830> it's

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
way but so far I like what I see it's

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.110 
way but so far I like what I see it's
got<00:04:04.400> some<00:04:04.610> nice<00:04:04.790> contours<00:04:07.030> especially<00:04:08.030> around

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
got some nice contours especially around

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.540 
got some nice contours especially around
the<00:04:08.300> gingival<00:04:08.780> area<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.950> certainly<00:04:10.340> it's

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
the gingival area and certainly it's

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.220 
the gingival area and certainly it's
going<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.730> get<00:04:10.850> healthier<00:04:11.300> as<00:04:11.480> time<00:04:11.750> goes<00:04:11.990> on

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
going to get healthier as time goes on

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.420 
going to get healthier as time goes on
with<00:04:12.770> that<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:14.440> other<00:04:15.440> than<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:15.680> Luigi<00:04:16.400> I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
with that so other than that Luigi I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.070 
with that so other than that Luigi I
