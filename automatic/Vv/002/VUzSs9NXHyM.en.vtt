00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.020
 live a big flat screen TV 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.880
 Bought 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.990
 the package of big winners are the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.550
 The coach sure will not save today 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.880
 really such a chance gets 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 not care eventually reached a 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.859
 little bit of big ones 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 flat screen TV 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 that's not so much what that is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.739
 I ordered something like that , I have to type 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 from the usa have led the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.590
 actually at amazon one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 ordered flat screen TV and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.730
 instead the Swiss assault rifle 6 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.250
 716 has been delivered really now 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.329
 swiss assault rifle 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 after the man has opened the parcel 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.329
 immediately alerted the police 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 Of course, this also came immediately 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.329
 probably put a complete one 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 house makes donate first and not 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.149
 first a wife his whole family 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.379
 and maybe even bet his omi too 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.020
 al qaida could belong newer 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.100
 probably for hours 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.300
 Waterboardings wanted the movie on the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 List of national enemies set 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 maybe they were nice too 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.339
 but hey i mean my america so 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 let's just say that it was like me 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.220
 said the police then auf 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.510
 each case the wrong first 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.040
 delivered weapons confiscated 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 Above all, it also determines how it does 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 that could ever happen to that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.390
 amazone have weapons supplied the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.070
 you receive the wrong package 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.720
 not only did not take a TV 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.979
 and animal stress with the boeing yes now 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.600
 where the whimsy is confiscated can 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.939
 do not even send it back and sit up 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.110
 the costs are super small 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810
 This article will accompany you for me 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.659
 story always in the video description 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 next topic zombie surprise 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.619
 ended up really counting 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.119
 interesting social science 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.500
 project deals with it like ours 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.790
 World could look like if zombies are not 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
 try our go someday 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.119
 snacking on summer simply live among us 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 and part of our society are here 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.740
 a short excerpt with different 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740
 reactions 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.550
 now I personally believe that the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.210
 world is not quite ready for it 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.920
 I want to participate 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 probably over a zombie yet 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 be less pleased than about the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.200
 normal gez light salmon the otherwise so 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.550
 In front of the door I stand my zombie what 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.020
 you mean how could such a world 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800
 look and above all what would be 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.650
 Good jobs for zombies cashier ice cream 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.850
 Vendor on every crash test dummies 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.780
 and on which side of the society 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.610
 who actually celebrities here or to the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.200
 zombie really fierce 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 socially critical topic youth so 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.570
 In any case, let us do that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.700
 hold against gomez be little 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.780
 discuss and try your opinion so 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.490
 good as it is to substantiate I am 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.890
 pretty tense and so far with tap 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.820
 next topic is in the master of mother 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.740
 fucking transfer would be yes in nrw is 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.020
 has now misunderstood to be yes 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.460
 the name of a new game console 2013 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.080
 the basic framework is to appear 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.700
 a totally murderously designed 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.230
 Game console since the android based 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.730
 works with a quad core 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.739
 processor, however, enough power 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.970
 for high end graphics and nexgen players 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.650
 should have and all now 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.020
 actually due to the android thoughts 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.090
 is it an open source system ergo the 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.709
 fact that everyone will develop games for it 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.420
 and could bring to market the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.130
 giant giants sony microsoft and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.600
 nintendo from her monopoly throne 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.310
 that in turn could be displaced 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.930
 extreme price changes on the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 Video game market lead to my console 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.709
 in itself and should cost $ 99 and 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.250
 i mean haye it was a game that 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.989
 not 60 or 70 days costs is cool 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.420
 Apart from that, I think that 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.920
 I do not really 99 euros before 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.630
 Hide other consoles must be mobile 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250
 gaming looks pretty cool today 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.900
 from the whole with more power and 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.200
 better graphics chips on the tv 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.180
 could be pretty wet if that the 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800
 That or Dorian right next year 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.120
 if i participate for my part and 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.380
 I think that in any case 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 pretty curious what happened there 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.569
 open source is extremely cool the thought 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.950
 that 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.359
 problem with it is however mine 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.499
 opinion interested in me because 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.180
 your opinion is not the danger 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.530
 that's pretty high because of that 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.120
 Each one determines his own prices 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.859
 can launch his own games on the market 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.049
 it can take too much to throw 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.870
 just have to play up shit 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.250
 whatever the android market 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.930
 you want to call it later then come 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.599
 so what do you think is extremely horny 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.659
 number or to purify yours 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.880
 Write opinion in the comments to 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:22.620

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.699

 know from this weird world of 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.820
 they should also be concerned 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.699
