Belgium and that's all i can say i was a
little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.450> gutted<00:02:00.600> about<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.259> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
little bit gutted about that but you

instruction because we don't really need

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.819

that<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.799> do<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.180> with<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:28.049> our

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
that we have to do that with with our

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.979 
that we have to do that with with our
players<00:02:28.349> before<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.709> game<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> i<00:02:30.030> think<00:02:30.870> it's

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
players before the game and i think it's

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.240 
players before the game and i think it's
better<00:02:31.139> you<00:02:31.409> know<00:02:31.469> they<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.010> arena

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
better you know they just have the arena

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.179 
better you know they just have the arena

but i prefer this however we got off to

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.890 
but i prefer this however we got off to
the<00:02:35.219> worst<00:02:35.310> start<00:02:35.760> possible<00:02:36.000> steffon

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900

anyway<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.439> note<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.709> manchester<00:03:02.519> city<00:03:02.700> was

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
anyway one note in manchester city was

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.890 
anyway one note in manchester city was
probably<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.239> worst<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.599> we<00:03:03.689> could<00:03:03.810> have

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
probably the worst that we could have

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.709 
probably the worst that we could have
had<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.859> way<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.700> them<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.150> then<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.329> really<00:03:06.510> good

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
had a way to them and then a really good

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.940 
had a way to them and then a really good
say<00:03:06.840> by<00:03:06.959> ten<00:03:07.139> quarters<00:03:07.379> neither<00:03:07.650> striker

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
say by ten quarters neither striker

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.440 
say by ten quarters neither striker
there<00:03:08.159> but<00:03:08.669> luckily<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:08.939> was<00:03:09.030> offside<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.389> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
there but luckily it was offside so it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.970 
there but luckily it was offside so it
doesn't<00:03:09.719> count<00:03:09.840> anyway<00:03:10.169> clichy<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.739> coming
