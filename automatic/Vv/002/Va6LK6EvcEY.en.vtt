00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
everything but it seems as if it's not

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
everything but it seems as if it's not
lagging<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.989> supposed<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> be

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lagging because it is not supposed to be

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
lagging because it is not supposed to be
