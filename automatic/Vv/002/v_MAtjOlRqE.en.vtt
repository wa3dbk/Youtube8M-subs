what I want to show you now is is a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.160 
what I want to show you now is is a
completely<00:00:06.299> new<00:00:06.420> technology<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.930> we've

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
completely new technology that we've

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.390 
completely new technology that we've
been<00:00:07.319> developing<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:07.740> at<00:00:08.189> Microsoft

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
been developing here at Microsoft

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.330 
been developing here at Microsoft
Research<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:09.120> Cambridge<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:11.160> what<00:00:11.250> I'm

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
Research in Cambridge and so what I'm

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
Research in Cambridge and so what I'm
going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.670> take<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
going to do is take this this is a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.879 
going to do is take this this is a
regular<00:00:12.690> laptop<00:00:13.349> computer<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.799> we've

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
regular laptop computer that we've

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.730 
regular laptop computer that we've
modified<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:15.120> I've<00:00:15.240> been<00:00:15.420> showing<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.750> it's

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
modified and I've been showing you it's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.560 
modified and I've been showing you it's
running<00:00:16.980> Vista<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.850> traditional<00:00:18.390> mode

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
running Vista in the traditional mode

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.790 
running Vista in the traditional mode
but<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.840> want<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.529> switch

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
but what I want to do now is to switch

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.040 
but what I want to do now is to switch
the<00:00:20.070> mode<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> operation<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.600> computer

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the mode of operation of this computer

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.710 
the mode of operation of this computer
to<00:00:22.560> show<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.800> our<00:00:23.039> new<00:00:23.340> our<00:00:24.060> new<00:00:24.510> user

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to show you our new our new user

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.700 
to show you our new our new user
interface<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.330> we've<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
interface so what we've got here on the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
interface so what we've got here on the
screen<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.519> carousel<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
screen is actually a little carousel of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.359 
screen is actually a little carousel of
pieces<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> media<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> couple<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pieces of media there's a couple of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
pieces of media there's a couple of
pieces<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.669> movie<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.930> couple<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
pieces of movie and there's a couple of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
pieces of movie and there's a couple of
just<00:00:34.980> images<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.899> we've<00:00:37.050> done<00:00:37.200> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
just images and and what we've done is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
just images and and what we've done is
we've<00:00:37.530> taken<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> traditional<00:00:38.550> touchscreen

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
we've taken the traditional touchscreen

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
we've taken the traditional touchscreen
but<00:00:39.629> rather<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:39.960> putting<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.700> traditional

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but rather than putting a traditional

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
but rather than putting a traditional
overlay<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.239> front<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.690> screen<00:00:42.870> we've

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
overlay in front of the screen we've

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.200 
overlay in front of the screen we've
actually<00:00:43.800> added<00:00:44.190> some<00:00:44.460> electronics<00:00:44.940> behind

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
actually added some electronics behind

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.160 
actually added some electronics behind
the<00:00:45.270> display<00:00:45.450> which<00:00:45.719> gives<00:00:45.750> us<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the display which gives us the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.110 
the display which gives us the
capability<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.829> doing<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:47.969> more

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
capability of doing much more

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.779 
capability of doing much more
sophisticated<00:00:48.950> interactions<00:00:49.950> directly<00:00:50.610> with

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sophisticated interactions directly with

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.360 
sophisticated interactions directly with
the<00:00:50.940> display<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.140> example<00:00:52.530> if<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.129> want<00:00:53.309> to

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the display so for example if I want to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.689 
the display so for example if I want to
move<00:00:54.050> this<00:00:55.050> carousel<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.710> media<00:00:56.070> around<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.520> can

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
move this carousel of media around I can

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.099 
move this carousel of media around I can
just<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.090> finger<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> display<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
just put my finger on the display and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.610 
just put my finger on the display and
and<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.070> gently<00:00:59.430> slide<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.120> across<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:01.410> order

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and and gently slide it across in order

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
and and gently slide it across in order
to<00:01:01.739> change<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.850> I'm<00:01:02.940> looking<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.600> can

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
to change and what I'm looking at I can

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.390 
to change and what I'm looking at I can
spin<00:01:04.320> things<00:01:04.589> around<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.010> example<00:01:05.100> with

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
spin things around for example with

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.719 
spin things around for example with
these<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.729> simple<00:01:05.909> gestures<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.729> for

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
these very simple gestures so if I for

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
these very simple gestures so if I for
example<00:01:11.869> move<00:01:12.869> around<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.560> here

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
example move around to this one here

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
example move around to this one here
another<00:01:14.580> form<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> interaction<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.659> support

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
another form of interaction we support

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600 
another form of interaction we support
is<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.259> notion<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.979> zooming<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> right

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
is the notion of just zooming it right

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.770 
is the notion of just zooming it right
so<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.939> can't<00:01:18.150> quite<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.509> no<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so if I can't quite see it no one to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
so if I can't quite see it no one to
make<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> bigger<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.369> two

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
make it bigger I can just use two

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
make it bigger I can just use two
fingers<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> stretch<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> reduce<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.619> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
fingers to stretch it or to reduce it in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
fingers to stretch it or to reduce it in
size<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.820> spin<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> around<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.720> well

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
size and I can spin it around as well

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
size and I can spin it around as well
for<00:01:25.020> example<00:01:25.110> by<00:01:25.470> using<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.159> using<00:01:26.460> two

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
for example by using again by using two

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.569 
for example by using again by using two
fingers<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> conventional

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
fingers so with a conventional

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
fingers so with a conventional
touchscreen<00:01:30.240> people<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.049> come<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
touchscreen people have come at the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.890 
touchscreen people have come at the
problem<00:01:32.060> from<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> direction<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> thinking

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
problem from the direction of thinking

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
problem from the direction of thinking
well<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.829> replace<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.549> mouse<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
well how do we replace the mouse you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
well how do we replace the mouse you
know<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> mouse<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.259> single<00:01:37.650> pointer<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
know the mouse is a single pointer and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
know the mouse is a single pointer and
and<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.030> want<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> interact<00:01:39.900> directly<00:01:40.110> with

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and if we want to interact directly with

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
and if we want to interact directly with
the<00:01:40.350> screen<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.890> need<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> technology

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the screen all we need is a technology

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
the screen all we need is a technology
which<00:01:42.380> essentially<00:01:43.380> replicates<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.009> single

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
which essentially replicates that single

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
which essentially replicates that single
pointer<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.229> my<00:01:46.380> finger<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pointer so I can use my finger as that

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.950 
pointer so I can use my finger as that
one<00:01:47.369> pointer<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:47.909> we're<00:01:48.060> doing<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.630> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
one pointer what we're doing here is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
one pointer what we're doing here is
actually<00:01:49.409> instrumenting<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> whole<00:01:50.460> screen

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
actually instrumenting the whole screen

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.600 
actually instrumenting the whole screen
so<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:51.930> image<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.409> exactly<00:01:52.890> what's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
so we can get an image of exactly what's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.940 
so we can get an image of exactly what's
up<00:01:54.119> against<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.689> front<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> screen<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
up against the front of the screen so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.020 
up against the front of the screen so
there<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.340> no<00:01:56.490> rules<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> know

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there really are no rules you know

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
there really are no rules you know
whatever<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> put<00:01:57.689> ten<00:01:57.930> fingers<00:01:58.259> on

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
whatever I want to put ten fingers on

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
whatever I want to put ten fingers on
the<00:01:58.469> screen<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:59.159> interact<00:01:59.549> with<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.509> what

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the screen to interact with it so what

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
the screen to interact with it so what
we've<00:02:00.869> done<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> rather<00:02:01.979> than<00:02:02.100> putting<00:02:02.219> an

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we've done is rather than putting an

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.679 
we've done is rather than putting an
overlay<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.820> front<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> screen<00:02:03.329> which<00:02:03.570> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
overlay in front of the screen which is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.080 
overlay in front of the screen which is
which<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.200> common<00:02:04.439> way<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.710> doing<00:02:05.090> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
which is one common way of doing of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.940 
which is one common way of doing of
implementing<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> touchscreen<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> where

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
implementing a touchscreen and where

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
implementing a touchscreen and where
that<00:02:08.039> where<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.310> overlay<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.849> only<00:02:09.090> sense

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that where that overlay can only sense

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.470 
that where that overlay can only sense
one<00:02:10.080> point<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> contact<00:02:11.030> we've<00:02:12.030> actually<00:02:12.209> put

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
one point of contact we've actually put

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.460 
one point of contact we've actually put
some<00:02:12.629> electronics<00:02:13.140> in

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
some electronics in

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010 
some electronics in
behind<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.040> display<00:02:14.690> which<00:02:15.690> lets<00:02:15.900> us

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
behind the display which lets us

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.360 
behind the display which lets us
essentially<00:02:16.500> image<00:02:16.830> through<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.130> display

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
essentially image through the display

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.880 
essentially image through the display
and<00:02:17.580> see<00:02:17.730> anything<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:19.170> gets<00:02:19.260> too<00:02:19.380> close<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and see anything that gets too close to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.500 
and see anything that gets too close to
the<00:02:20.010> front<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.340> display<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.300> if<00:02:21.420> for

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the front of the display so if for

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.850 
the front of the display so if for
example<00:02:21.570> if<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.930> look<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.170> up<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> top<00:02:22.740> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
example if you look up up in the top of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.340 
example if you look up up in the top of
the<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> display<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:24.540> as<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.960> put

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the of the of the display here as I put

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.890 
the of the of the display here as I put
my<00:02:25.560> fingers<00:02:26.010> down<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.970> see<00:02:27.180> multiple

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
my fingers down you can see multiple

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
my fingers down you can see multiple
contact<00:02:28.380> points<00:02:28.440> being<00:02:29.160> generated<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.850> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
contact points being generated and I

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.550 
contact points being generated and I
mean<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.990> many<00:02:31.200> different

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
mean I can do that for as many different

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.640 
mean I can do that for as many different
fingers<00:02:31.860> as<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.070> want<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:33.390> example<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.230> so

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
fingers as I want for example and so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.530 
fingers as I want for example and so
that<00:02:34.890> lets<00:02:35.130> us<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.850> raw<00:02:36.090> data<00:02:36.330> is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
that lets us get the the raw data is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.270 
that lets us get the the raw data is
where<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> information<00:02:37.050> about<00:02:37.560> exactly<00:02:37.920> what

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
where the information about exactly what

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.430 
where the information about exactly what
the<00:02:38.340> users<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:39.360> when<00:02:39.870> they<00:02:39.990> interact

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the users doing and when they interact

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
the users doing and when they interact
with<00:02:40.650> the<00:02:40.950> screen<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.490> then<00:02:41.940> really<00:02:42.270> we're

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
with the screen and then really we're

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
with the screen and then really we're
just<00:02:42.630> beginning<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.140> explore<00:02:43.890> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
just beginning to explore the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.730 
just beginning to explore the
interaction<00:02:45.270> metaphors<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.840> follow<00:02:46.170> you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
interaction metaphors that follow you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.020 
interaction metaphors that follow you
know<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:46.980> well<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.220> is<00:02:47.370> an<00:02:47.459> obvious<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:47.880> you

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
know so well this is an obvious one you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.220 
know so well this is an obvious one you
can<00:02:48.180> kind<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.420> make<00:02:48.570> things<00:02:48.750> bigger<00:02:49.080> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
can kind of make things bigger and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.020 
can kind of make things bigger and
smaller<00:02:49.680> just<00:02:50.070> by<00:02:50.220> pinching<00:02:50.520> them<00:02:50.850> and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
smaller just by pinching them and

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.060 
smaller just by pinching them and
stretching<00:02:51.660> them<00:02:51.750> again<00:02:51.990> or<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.500> can<00:02:52.680> spin

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
stretching them again or you can spin

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.610 
stretching them again or you can spin
them<00:02:53.220> around<00:02:53.490> by<00:02:54.270> rote<00:02:54.840> sort<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.140> rotating

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
them around by rote sort of rotating

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.770 
them around by rote sort of rotating
with<00:02:55.770> your<00:02:55.890> fingers<00:02:56.250> like<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.660> but<00:02:57.660> we

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
with your fingers like that but we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.680 
with your fingers like that but we
believe<00:02:58.020> there<00:02:58.140> will<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.470> number<00:02:58.830> more

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
believe there will be a number more

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.390 
believe there will be a number more
really<00:03:00.690> intuitive<00:03:01.170> gestures<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.190> can

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really intuitive gestures that you can

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.160 
really intuitive gestures that you can
use<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.760> actually<00:03:03.270> directly<00:03:03.750> interact<00:03:04.050> with

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
use to actually directly interact with

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.600 
use to actually directly interact with
with<00:03:04.500> things<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.920> screen<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.340> there's

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
with things on the screen so there's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.860 
with things on the screen so there's
something<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.940> only<00:03:06.060> one<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.570> screen<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
something the only one on the screen and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.090 
something the only one on the screen and
you<00:03:06.930> want<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.140> move<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.440> where<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.650> grab

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
you want to move it where you just grab

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100 
you want to move it where you just grab
it<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:08.400> your<00:03:08.430> hand<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.060> slide<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.660> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
it with your hand and and slide it the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.660 
it with your hand and and slide it the
way<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.410> works<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.800> as<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.220> explained<00:03:11.490> we've

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
way this works is as I explained we've

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.150 
way this works is as I explained we've
we've<00:03:12.240> added<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.440> load<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:13.980> extra

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
we've added a and a load of extra

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.770 
we've added a and a load of extra
sensors<00:03:14.640> behind<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> display<00:03:15.330> so<00:03:15.510> at<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
sensors behind the display so at the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.240 
sensors behind the display so at the
moment<00:03:16.140> we<00:03:16.200> don't<00:03:16.320> cover<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.800> whole<00:03:16.980> display

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
moment we don't cover the whole display

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.940 
moment we don't cover the whole display
it's<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.180> area<00:03:18.630> here<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.380> active

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
it's just this area here which is active

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.710 
it's just this area here which is active
and<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:20.700> really<00:03:20.910> just<00:03:21.120> because<00:03:21.390> this<00:03:21.570> is

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
and that's really just because this is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.030 
and that's really just because this is
the<00:03:21.810> first<00:03:21.989> prototype<00:03:22.200> we've<00:03:22.560> built<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the first prototype we've built and the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.490 
the first prototype we've built and the
next<00:03:23.310> stage<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> be<00:03:24.450> covering<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
next stage is going to be covering the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.780 
next stage is going to be covering the
whole<00:03:25.620> display<00:03:25.860> making<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> whole<00:03:26.580> display

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
whole display making the whole display

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.699 
whole display making the whole display
touch<00:03:27.120> sensitive<00:03:27.660> but<00:03:28.200> essentially<00:03:28.590> what

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
touch sensitive but essentially what

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.830 
touch sensitive but essentially what
we've<00:03:28.830> done<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.130> taken<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.489> was<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.840> standard

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
we've done is taken this was a standard

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.620 
we've done is taken this was a standard
off-the-shelf<00:03:31.019> laptop<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.130> we've<00:03:33.060> taken<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
off-the-shelf laptop and we've taken the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.090 
off-the-shelf laptop and we've taken the
screen<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.110> we've<00:03:34.200> just<00:03:34.380> cut<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> hole<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
screen and we've just cut a hole in the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.190 
screen and we've just cut a hole in the
metal<00:03:35.370> working<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.060> back<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.630> then

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
metal working in the back here and then

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.130 
metal working in the back here and then
we've<00:03:38.269> we've<00:03:39.269> made<00:03:39.420> some<00:03:39.600> circuit<00:03:39.959> boards

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
we've we've made some circuit boards

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.630 
we've we've made some circuit boards
with<00:03:40.260> our<00:03:40.350> sensors<00:03:40.800> on<00:03:40.920> them<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:41.190> we<00:03:41.370> push

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
with our sensors on them which we push

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.080 
with our sensors on them which we push
up<00:03:41.850> against<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.750> back<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.560> LCD<00:03:43.940> but<00:03:44.940> it's

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
up against the back of the LCD but it's

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.580 
up against the back of the LCD but it's
just<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.390> essentially<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.200> regular

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
just that essentially just a regular

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.070 
just that essentially just a regular
liquid<00:03:47.549> crystal<00:03:47.820> display<00:03:48.120> panel<00:03:48.660> inside

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
liquid crystal display panel inside

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.970 
liquid crystal display panel inside
there<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.890> what<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:50.190> devices<00:03:50.340> do<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.120> they

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
there and what these devices do is they

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.780 
there and what these devices do is they
as<00:03:52.980> they<00:03:53.220> shine<00:03:54.410> infrared<00:03:55.410> light<00:03:55.980> out<00:03:56.280> through

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
as they shine infrared light out through

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.699 
as they shine infrared light out through
the<00:03:56.940> display<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.230> when<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.410> put<00:03:58.680> my

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
the display and then when I put my

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.770 
the display and then when I put my
finger<00:03:58.890> tips<00:03:59.670> or<00:03:59.820> any<00:03:59.940> kind<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.239> object<00:04:00.540> close

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
finger tips or any kind of object close

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.630 
finger tips or any kind of object close
to<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.080> front<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.410> display<00:04:01.530> some<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.519> that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
to the front of the display some of that

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.550 
to the front of the display some of that
infrared<00:04:02.880> light<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.269> reflected<00:04:03.840> back<00:04:03.989> in<00:04:04.230> it's

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
infrared light is reflected back in it's

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.440 
infrared light is reflected back in it's
reflected<00:04:04.980> from<00:04:05.100> my<00:04:05.280> fingertips<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.940> those

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
reflected from my fingertips and those

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.660 
reflected from my fingertips and those
devices<00:04:06.660> behind<00:04:07.560> also<00:04:07.920> detect<00:04:08.459> what's

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
devices behind also detect what's

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.100 
devices behind also detect what's
reflected<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.330> that's<00:04:09.450> how<00:04:09.630> we<00:04:09.690> generate

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
reflected and that's how we generate

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.500 
reflected and that's how we generate
those<00:04:10.739> images<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.390> the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
those images and because of the

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.449 
those images and because of the
technology<00:04:12.630> we're<00:04:13.049> using<00:04:13.320> which<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.470> infrared

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
technology we're using which is infrared

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.820 
technology we're using which is infrared
based<00:04:14.820> we<00:04:15.150> can<00:04:15.299> actually<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:15.780> another<00:04:16.620> thing

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
based we can actually do another thing

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.110 
based we can actually do another thing
with<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.040> display<00:04:17.220> which<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.549> communicate

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
with this display which is communicate

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.320 
with this display which is communicate
with<00:04:18.269> electronic<00:04:18.750> devices<00:04:18.950> so<00:04:19.950> one<00:04:20.459> form<00:04:20.970> one

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
with electronic devices so one form one

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.480 
with electronic devices so one form one
way<00:04:21.479> that<00:04:22.229> existing<00:04:22.919> electronic<00:04:23.280> devices

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
way that existing electronic devices

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.890 
way that existing electronic devices
communicate<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:24.150> each<00:04:24.240> other<00:04:24.360> wirelessly

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
communicate with each other wirelessly

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.960 
communicate with each other wirelessly
is<00:04:25.169> through<00:04:25.680> infrared<00:04:26.070> communicate

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
is through infrared communicate

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.730 
is through infrared communicate
and<00:04:27.450> we<00:04:27.930> can<00:04:28.110> do<00:04:28.260> exactly<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> same

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
and we can do exactly the same

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.320 
and we can do exactly the same
intrinsically<00:04:29.460> because<00:04:29.640> we've<00:04:29.970> added<00:04:30.150> this

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
intrinsically because we've added this

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.420 
intrinsically because we've added this
infrared<00:04:30.840> capability<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.740> our<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:32.400> our

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
infrared capability to our to our

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.050 
infrared capability to our to our
display<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.110> actually<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.500> standard

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
display so this is actually a standard

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.730 
display so this is actually a standard
television<00:04:36.060> remote<00:04:36.180> control<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.870> which<00:04:37.440> uses

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
television remote control and which uses

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.830 
television remote control and which uses
infrared<00:04:37.980> to<00:04:38.820> norwegia<00:04:39.300> signal<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
infrared to norwegia signal to the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.700 
infrared to norwegia signal to the
television<00:04:40.200> you<00:04:40.230> want<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.470> change<00:04:40.650> the

television you want to change the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.710 
television you want to change the
channel<00:04:40.890> but<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.670> demonstrate<00:04:41.880> what<00:04:42.690> we

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
channel but just to demonstrate what we

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.860 
channel but just to demonstrate what we
can<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.110> with<00:04:43.260> this<00:04:43.380> if<00:04:43.590> I<00:04:43.920> fire<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.870> towards

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
can do with this if I fire this towards

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.830 
can do with this if I fire this towards
our<00:04:47.000> our<00:04:48.000> despair<00:04:48.420> you'll<00:04:48.570> see<00:04:48.750> the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
our our despair you'll see the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.210 
our our despair you'll see the
information<00:04:48.960> at<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.770> top<00:04:49.950> that<00:04:50.100> we're

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
information at the top that we're

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.650 
information at the top that we're
picking<00:04:50.460> up<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.760> information<00:04:51.210> that's<00:04:51.570> being

picking up the information that's being

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.910 
picking up the information that's being
transmitted<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.230> we<00:04:52.380> can<00:04:52.500> actually<00:04:52.620> control

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
transmitted and we can actually control

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.120 
our display using this device so another
example<00:04:57.020> application<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:58.950> for

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
example application it this is just for

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.430 
example application it this is just for
manipulating<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.210> photograph<00:05:01.020> so<00:05:01.050> we've<00:05:01.320> got

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
manipulating a photograph so we've got

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.230 
manipulating a photograph so we've got
an<00:05:01.560> image<00:05:01.650> here<00:05:01.980> now<00:05:02.370> traditionally<00:05:02.880> you

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
an image here now traditionally you

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.180 
an image here now traditionally you
would<00:05:03.270> have<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.560> mouse<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.590> pointing<00:05:05.040> device

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
would have a mouse a pointing device

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.290 
would have a mouse a pointing device
like<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.370> mouse<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.820> could<00:05:05.970> use<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.210> to

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
like a mouse and you could use that to

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.610 
like a mouse and you could use that to
move<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.510> photo<00:05:06.780> around<00:05:07.170> but<00:05:07.290> if<00:05:07.350> you<00:05:07.410> want<00:05:07.560> to

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
move the photo around but if you want to

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.720 
move the photo around but if you want to
do<00:05:07.680> anything<00:05:07.860> more<00:05:08.040> sophisticated<00:05:08.520> you

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
do anything more sophisticated you

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.100 
do anything more sophisticated you
probably<00:05:08.940> have<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.120> go<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.420> menu<00:05:09.630> item<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
probably have to go to a menu item and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.960 
probably have to go to a menu item and
say<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.260> want<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.530> put<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.740> in<00:05:10.800> rotate<00:05:11.160> mode<00:05:11.370> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
say I want to put it in rotate mode and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.250 
say I want to put it in rotate mode and
then<00:05:12.090> use<00:05:12.270> the<00:05:12.420> mouse<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.630> rotate<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.230> image

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
then use the mouse to rotate the image

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.640 
then use the mouse to rotate the image
for<00:05:13.560> example<00:05:13.610> now<00:05:14.610> whereas<00:05:15.090> with<00:05:15.210> our

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
for example now whereas with our

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.560 
for example now whereas with our
multi-touch<00:05:16.650> interaction<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.430> not<00:05:18.180> only<00:05:18.360> can

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
multi-touch interaction and not only can

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.590 
multi-touch interaction and not only can
I<00:05:18.660> move<00:05:18.870> this<00:05:19.290> around<00:05:19.470> just<00:05:19.950> by<00:05:20.070> by<00:05:20.940> by

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
I move this around just by by by

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.940 
I move this around just by by by
touching<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:21.990> with<00:05:22.110> my<00:05:22.200> finger<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.800> course

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
touching it with my finger but of course

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.980 
touching it with my finger but of course
I<00:05:23.040> can<00:05:23.190> make<00:05:23.310> it<00:05:23.460> bigger<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.330> smaller<00:05:24.660> and

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
I can make it bigger and smaller and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.460 
I can make it bigger and smaller and
spin<00:05:25.260> it<00:05:25.350> around<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.460> same<00:05:26.640> way<00:05:27.320> so<00:05:28.320> it's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
spin it around in the same way so it's

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.100 
spin it around in the same way so it's
just<00:05:28.560> really<00:05:28.770> another<00:05:29.250> example<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.870> sort

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
just really another example of the sort

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.510 
just really another example of the sort
of<00:05:31.169> interaction<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.680> we<00:05:31.830> support<00:05:32.160> it's<00:05:32.340> very

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
of interaction that we support it's very

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.390 
of interaction that we support it's very
intuitive<00:05:33.440> with<00:05:34.440> this<00:05:34.650> multi-touch

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
intuitive with this multi-touch

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.610 
intuitive with this multi-touch
technology
