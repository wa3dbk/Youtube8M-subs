hi<00:00:17.400> Fiona

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.600 

we've<00:00:33.030> already<00:00:33.300> built<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.020> much<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.770> can't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
we've already built this much I can't

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130 
we've already built this much I can't
believe<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> city's<00:00:36.360> come<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.840> far<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
believe the city's come this far so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
believe the city's come this far so
quickly<00:00:37.760> and<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> doesn't<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.510> they

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
quickly and it doesn't look like they

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.319 
quickly and it doesn't look like they
used<00:00:39.840> magic<00:00:40.320> look

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
used magic look

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.880 
used magic look
looks<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.629> burned<00:00:42.870> themselves<00:00:43.079> out

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
looks like they burned themselves out

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.459 
looks like they burned themselves out
looks<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:44.790> the<00:00:44.910> Knights<00:00:45.120> put<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> 5-2<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
looks like the Knights put up a 5-2 I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619 
looks like the Knights put up a 5-2 I

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
guess this is what people do when they

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.069 
guess this is what people do when they
work<00:00:48.809> together

story I know it's hard to believe but

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.139 
story I know it's hard to believe but
that's<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.710> reality<00:01:56.979> we're<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.490> against

no more blastia no more barriers there
would<00:02:01.090> be<00:02:01.119> so<00:02:01.479> much<00:02:01.659> chaos<00:02:01.959> if<00:02:02.470> we<00:02:03.280> don't<00:02:03.549> do<00:02:03.729> it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
would be so much chaos if we don't do it

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.120 
would be so much chaos if we don't do it
