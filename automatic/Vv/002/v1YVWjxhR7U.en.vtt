nature<00:00:28.949> breaks<00:00:29.250> problem<00:00:30.150> being<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.660> they

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
nature breaks problem being is they

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.020 
nature breaks problem being is they
don't<00:00:31.470> tend<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> keep<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> chamois<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.790> place

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
don't tend to keep the chamois in place

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.000 
don't tend to keep the chamois in place
so<00:00:33.270> once<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.559> point<00:00:34.829> where

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
so once you get to the point where

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.470 
so once you get to the point where
you're<00:00:35.130> logging<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.790> more<00:00:36.000> miles<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.360> lot

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you're logging a lot more miles a lot

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.580 
you're logging a lot more miles a lot
more<00:00:36.660> hours<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> saddle

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
more hours in the saddle

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.200 
more hours in the saddle
keeping<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.100> chamois<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.550> place<00:00:38.730> becomes<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
keeping that chamois in place becomes a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.819 
keeping that chamois in place becomes a
lot<00:00:39.450> more<00:00:39.899> critical<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.500> we're<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> look

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
lot more critical so we're going to look

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
lot more critical so we're going to look
at<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> anatomy<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:42.030> basic<00:00:42.480> cycling

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
at the anatomy of your basic cycling

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.690 
at the anatomy of your basic cycling
short<00:00:43.440> first<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.950> let's<00:00:44.370> look<00:00:44.430> at<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
short first of all let's look at the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.979 
short first of all let's look at the
chamois<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> pad<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:45.780> what's

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
chamois or the pad that's what's

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
chamois or the pad that's what's
responsible<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.160> comfort<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
responsible for the comfort in the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
responsible for the comfort in the
cycling<00:00:48.600> short<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.289> lower<00:00:49.469> end<00:00:49.649> models

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
cycling short on the lower end models

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
cycling short on the lower end models
it's<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.910> single<00:00:51.660> density<00:00:51.870> foam

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's going to be a single density foam

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's going to be a single density foam
so<00:00:52.590> they're<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> foam<00:00:53.520> of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so they're just going to use a foam of

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.100 
so they're just going to use a foam of
one<00:00:54.000> thickness<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.840> into<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
one thickness as we get into the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
one thickness as we get into the
higher-end<00:00:55.559> models<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
higher-end models not only is the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.790 
higher-end models not only is the
chamois<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.420> contoured<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.440> better

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
chamois going to be contoured to better

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
chamois going to be contoured to better
match<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.100> contours<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.760> your<00:00:59.820> body<00:00:59.969> but

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
match the contours of your body but

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.700 
match the contours of your body but
they're<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> utilize<00:01:01.079> foams<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
they're going to utilize foams of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
they're going to utilize foams of
different<00:01:02.010> thicknesses<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.609> densities<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
different thicknesses or densities in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759 
different thicknesses or densities in
different<00:01:03.390> areas<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.350> support

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
different areas so you get good support

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.440 
different areas so you get good support
on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.189> sit<00:01:05.369> bones<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.939> not<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.240> of
