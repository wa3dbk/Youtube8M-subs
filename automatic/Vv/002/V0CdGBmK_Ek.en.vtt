00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
transport box in the wintertime the idea

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.660 
transport box in the wintertime the idea
is<00:02:04.000> that<00:02:04.030> it'll<00:02:04.420> tip<00:02:05.110> fairly<00:02:05.530> easily<00:02:05.680> I'm

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
is that it'll tip fairly easily I'm

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.440 
is that it'll tip fairly easily I'm
gonna<00:02:06.820> pull<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.180> handle<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.709> handle

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gonna pull that handle see that handle

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.170 
gonna pull that handle see that handle
it<00:02:10.450> should<00:02:10.690> tip<00:02:10.929> although<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:12.550> tractor<00:02:13.000> is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it should tip although the tractor is

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.949 
it should tip although the tractor is
sort<00:02:13.570> of<00:02:13.860> pointed<00:02:14.860> downwards<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.750> was

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
sort of pointed downwards it was

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.740 
sort of pointed downwards it was
designed<00:02:17.350> to<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.920> fairly<00:02:18.670> neutral<00:02:19.090> balance

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
designed to be fairly neutral balance

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.229 
designed to be fairly neutral balance
when<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.380> horizontal<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.880> this<00:02:22.000> might

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
when it's horizontal so this might

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.250 
when it's horizontal so this might
require<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.630> little<00:02:22.780> bit<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.140> encouragement

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.380 

I'll<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.409> pick<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:31.379> tip<00:02:31.680> set<00:02:32.010> thing

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
I'll just pick that up the tip set thing

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.800 
I'll just pick that up the tip set thing
that'll<00:02:33.390> unlatch<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.879> I<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.659> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that'll unlatch it and I see that it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.309 
that'll unlatch it and I see that it's
not<00:02:36.900> automatically<00:02:37.470> done<00:02:37.709> pink<00:02:38.659> so<00:02:39.659> let<00:02:40.200> me

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
not automatically done pink so let me

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.679 
not automatically done pink so let me
get<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> started<00:02:41.640> it's<00:02:42.269> gonna<00:02:42.390> need<00:02:42.540> some<00:02:43.040> help

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
get it started it's gonna need some help

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.530 
get it started it's gonna need some help
there<00:02:45.689> it<00:02:45.810> goes<00:02:46.349> well<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.519> horizontal<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
there it goes well that's horizontal and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.339 
there it goes well that's horizontal and
it's<00:02:48.810> fairly<00:02:48.989> neutral<00:02:49.260> balance<00:02:51.349> although

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
it's fairly neutral balance although

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.270 
it's fairly neutral balance although
it's<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.530> heavy<00:02:52.680> load<00:02:56.269> there<00:02:58.099> there's<00:02:59.099> my

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's a heavy load there there's my

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's a heavy load there there's my
firewood<00:02:59.720> my<00:03:01.700> firewood<00:03:02.700> shed<00:03:03.980> okay<00:03:05.659> so<00:03:06.659> my

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
firewood my firewood shed okay so my

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.069 
firewood my firewood shed okay so my
tractor<00:03:08.040> has<00:03:08.159> the<00:03:08.280> same<00:03:08.489> attachment<00:03:08.900> point<00:03:09.900> to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
tractor has the same attachment point to

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.270 
tractor has the same attachment point to
the<00:03:10.230> front-end<00:03:10.650> loader<00:03:10.859> and<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.459> Bobcat<00:03:12.120> does

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the front-end loader and the Bobcat does

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.870 
the front-end loader and the Bobcat does
and<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.270> think<00:03:14.770> access

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
and so I think access

all of them the Rhodes reason why I'm
using<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.409> drag<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:18.949> that<00:05:19.689> when<00:05:20.689> you<00:05:20.780> back

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
using the drag is that when you back

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.879 
using the drag is that when you back
drag<00:05:21.470> your<00:05:21.710> gravel<00:05:22.629> it<00:05:23.629> makes<00:05:23.960> it<00:05:24.110> fairly<00:05:24.620> soft

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
drag your gravel it makes it fairly soft

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.379 
drag your gravel it makes it fairly soft
and<00:05:25.250> you<00:05:25.340> drive<00:05:25.550> your<00:05:25.669> truck<00:05:25.819> aren't<00:05:26.210> make

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
and you drive your truck aren't make

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.050 
and you drive your truck aren't make
sort<00:05:26.810> of<00:05:26.870> tire<00:05:27.199> tracks<00:05:27.560> which<00:05:28.460> are<00:05:28.580> hard<00:05:28.849> and

sort of tire tracks which are hard and
compacted<00:05:29.629> and<00:05:29.810> then<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.710> center<00:05:31.039> is<00:05:31.099> all

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
compacted and then the center is all

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.179 
compacted and then the center is all
soft<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.819> a<00:05:31.909> little<00:05:32.120> bit<00:05:32.210> higher<00:05:32.419> so<00:05:33.189> I'm

hoping that this roller is gonna pack
down<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.370> center

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.739 

and<00:05:49.840> I<00:05:50.169> use<00:05:50.319> it<00:05:50.469> for<00:05:50.680> picking<00:05:51.280> on<00:05:51.550> rocks<00:05:52.270> at

00:05:52.739 --> 00:05:52.749 
and I use it for picking on rocks at

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.060 
and I use it for picking on rocks at
first-rate<00:05:53.349> driveway

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070

good
that<00:07:08.970> top<00:07:10.400> link<00:07:11.400> thing<00:07:11.700> is<00:07:11.850> designed<00:07:12.030> so<00:07:12.540> that

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
that top link thing is designed so that

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.770 
that top link thing is designed so that
it<00:07:12.720> will<00:07:13.590> allow<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:13.860> tip<00:07:14.220> up<00:07:14.430> if<00:07:14.820> your<00:07:15.510> rear

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
it will allow to tip up if your rear

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.210 
it will allow to tip up if your rear
wheels<00:07:16.020> go<00:07:16.200> into<00:07:16.380> a<00:07:16.410> hole<00:07:16.620> or<00:07:16.860> something<00:07:17.130> like

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
wheels go into a hole or something like

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.190 
wheels go into a hole or something like
that<00:07:17.280> and<00:07:17.910> the<00:07:18.000> backend<00:07:18.240> of<00:07:18.570> the<00:07:18.690> thing<00:07:18.900> has<00:07:19.050> to

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.200 
that and the backend of the thing has to

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.610 
that and the backend of the thing has to
tip<00:07:19.380> up<00:07:19.560> this<00:07:20.340> thing<00:07:20.520> flexes<00:07:24.410> good<00:07:25.410> heavy

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
tip up this thing flexes good heavy

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.050 
tip up this thing flexes good heavy
skids<00:07:26.040> on<00:07:26.250> the<00:07:26.400> sides<00:07:27.000> and<00:07:29.060> quarter-inch

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
skids on the sides and quarter-inch

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.440 
skids on the sides and quarter-inch
sidewall<00:07:33.590> yeah<00:07:34.590> I<00:07:34.919> built<00:07:35.669> it<00:07:35.790> extra<00:07:36.120> heavy<00:07:36.300> it

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:36.450 
sidewall yeah I built it extra heavy it

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.879 
sidewall yeah I built it extra heavy it
works<00:07:36.660> really<00:07:36.900> really<00:07:37.290> good<00:07:37.500> ok<00:07:38.030> I<00:07:39.770> guess<00:07:40.770> I

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:40.889 
works really really good ok I guess I

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:43.130 
works really really good ok I guess I
didn't<00:07:41.130> mention<00:07:41.310> what<00:07:41.580> I<00:07:41.610> was<00:07:41.760> doing
