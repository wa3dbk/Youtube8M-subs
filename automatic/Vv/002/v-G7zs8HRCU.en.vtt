piece of paper back to the book so it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.650 
piece of paper back to the book so it
comes<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.070> little<00:00:32.369> sheet<00:00:32.640> inside<00:00:33.059> which

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600 
comes with a little sheet inside which
looks<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.440> telling<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> all

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610

looks a bit like that telling you all
about<00:00:35.760> what's<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.809> therefore<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.530> does<00:00:37.980> say

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
about what's that therefore it does say

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
about what's that therefore it does say
that<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:38.820> good<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.270> both<00:00:39.540> new<00:00:39.809> and
