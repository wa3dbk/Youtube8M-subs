they<00:00:56.000> won't<00:00:56.330> stop<00:00:56.720> they'll<00:00:56.990> go<00:00:57.170> right<00:00:57.320> on

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
they won't stop they'll go right on

because<00:00:59.450> they're<00:00:59.660> faster<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.530> we're

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
because they're faster and we're

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.310

operating<00:01:01.640> them<00:01:01.940> without<00:01:02.240> magnets<00:01:02.930> so<00:01:03.140> they

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
operating them without magnets so they

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.280

this layout figure 6b just below it is

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.759 
this layout figure 6b just below it is
basically<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.090> same<00:03:48.120> track<00:03:49.079> plan<00:03:49.439> but<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
basically the same track plan but the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.069 
basically the same track plan but the
switches<00:03:50.189> are<00:03:50.310> rearranged<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.480> instead

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
switches are rearranged so that instead

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.649 
switches are rearranged so that instead
of<00:03:52.260> one<00:03:52.620> long<00:03:52.980> route<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.760> divided<00:03:54.419> up<00:03:54.540> into

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
of one long route it's divided up into

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.439 
of one long route it's divided up into
two<00:03:55.519> separate<00:03:56.519> routes<00:03:56.760> basically<00:03:57.359> an

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
two separate routes basically an

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.520 
two separate routes basically an

this<00:04:42.659> is<00:04:42.810> very<00:04:43.050> similar<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.650> track<00:04:44.009> plan

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
this is very similar to track plan

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.159 
this is very similar to track plan
number<00:04:44.520> six<00:04:45.000> which<00:04:45.270> just<00:04:45.419> rearranged<00:04:46.050> a

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
number six which just rearranged a

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.560 
number six which just rearranged a
little<00:04:46.409> bit<00:04:46.729> so<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:47.880> goes<00:04:48.060> straight<00:04:48.449> across

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
little bit so it goes straight across

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.719 
little bit so it goes straight across
the<00:04:49.080> middle<00:04:49.470> if<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.590> compare<00:04:50.009> the<00:04:50.190> two<00:04:50.340> plans

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
the middle if you compare the two plans

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.370 
the middle if you compare the two plans
they're<00:04:51.030> very<00:04:51.240> similar<00:04:51.630> and<00:04:51.900> again<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.259> can

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
they're very similar and again you can

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.589 
they're very similar and again you can
see<00:04:52.409> this<00:04:52.740> one<00:04:52.949> shows<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.280> via<00:04:54.030> these<00:04:54.240> dotted

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
see this one shows a via these dotted

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.790 
see this one shows a via these dotted
lines<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.380> over<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.120> location<00:04:57.120> for<00:04:57.360> the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
diverting switch which is over here and

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.350

we<00:05:03.270> relocated<00:05:04.229> back<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.650> here<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:06.150> take

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
we relocated back to here and you take

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.110 
we relocated back to here and you take
the<00:05:07.070> converting<00:05:08.070> switch<00:05:08.460> well<00:05:08.699> I<00:05:08.729> think<00:05:08.880> that

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
the converting switch well I think that

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.450 
the converting switch well I think that
stays<00:05:09.449> here<00:05:09.840> yet<00:05:10.139> converting<00:05:10.860> switch<00:05:11.159> stays

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
stays here yet converting switch stays

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.120 
stays here yet converting switch stays
the<00:05:11.669> same<00:05:11.880> place<00:05:12.210> but<00:05:12.240> that<00:05:12.599> gives<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:13.130> again

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
the same place but that gives you again

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.980 
the same place but that gives you again

little<00:05:24.669> more<00:05:24.909> we<00:05:25.090> see<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.270> screen<00:05:25.720> capture<00:05:26.050> from

little more we see a screen capture from

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.159 
video 632 that shows the layout
configured<00:05:30.370> for<00:05:30.550> two<00:05:30.729> alternating<00:05:31.180> routes

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
configured for two alternating routes

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.499 
configured for two alternating routes
you<00:05:32.349> can<00:05:32.409> see<00:05:32.710> here<00:05:32.889> at<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:33.129> diverging<00:05:34.060> switch

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
you can see here at the diverging switch

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.959 
you can see here at the diverging switch
and<00:05:34.780> this<00:05:35.379> train<00:05:35.680> is<00:05:35.860> going<00:05:35.889> the<00:05:36.340> flat<00:05:36.639> route

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
and this train is going the flat route

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:39.089 
and this train is going the flat route
the<00:05:37.599> next<00:05:37.870> train<00:05:38.080> that<00:05:38.289> comes<00:05:38.439> out<00:05:38.740> of<00:05:38.770> here

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
the next train that comes out of here

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:41.879 
the next train that comes out of here
will<00:05:39.310> go<00:05:39.490> straight<00:05:40.270> and<00:05:40.599> go<00:05:40.810> up<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.020> incline

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
will go straight and go up the incline

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.339 
will go straight and go up the incline
so<00:05:42.310> it's<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.729> two<00:05:43.449> different<00:05:43.659> routes<00:05:44.050> and

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
so it's to two different routes and

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.770 
so it's to two different routes and
again<00:05:44.770> there's<00:05:44.979> a<00:05:45.039> link<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.639> video<00:05:46.479> to

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
again there's a link to the video to

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.020 
again there's a link to the video to
look<00:05:46.930> at<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.259> look<00:05:48.129> at<00:05:48.280> that<00:05:48.340> layout<00:05:48.699> in

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
look at that look at that layout in

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.750
