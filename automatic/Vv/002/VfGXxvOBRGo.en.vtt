 The influence wants to introduce how to fold Tokyo Tower 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:17.530
 Recently I introduced some of the things that are quite difficult to be with you here 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.120
 I will introduce a little 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.630
 3 red hairs 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.630
 Ask them three sheets I'd say even folded it said bone 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 Fold into triangles 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.270
 I fall into 3 pieces at a time 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.670
 Yes 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.579
 30,000 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.400
 1 piece each 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.490
 With 2 sheets 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.490
 Chaimashou broke Well then from where the third most difficult 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.790
 First, in line with this line of sight 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.820
 in this way 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.239
 You will Otsu 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.239
 Yes the other side is also the same 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.870
 Yes turn the back 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:09.790
 If you do so yeah this 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.770
 Get down on the promotion that connects this card with this corner 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.700
 Yes 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700
 It looks like this 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.620
 I 'll put it back once and it's right now 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.720
 To the middle of a thousand 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.680
 Available to you in this way 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.400
 Once more to involve and come in 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.400
 Turn over 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.030
 I am thinner 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.570
 Yes 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 The other side is equally thin 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.590
 I am 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.810
 Yes 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.350
 It becomes this 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.970
 If you do 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.970
 The out finger U 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.420
 Strictly speaking, I am here 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.080
 this 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:07.260
 In accordance with this corner that has become a little bit 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.290
 In this way Well even if this area is somewhat deviated 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.950
 I think there is no problem at all 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.830
 The indication here is such a feeling 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.000
 I am 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:24.450
 If you do so, your head will be completed 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.200
 Beg repeated this two fell after earlier together 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 Folded in the middle 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.490
 Scissor 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.490
 so 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.650
 in this way 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.140
 I will match 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.530
 If you do 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.530
 Plug this into this challenge 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.220
 Tokyo Tower 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.340
 It will be completed 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.780
 Yes it's back like this 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.880
 This is the correct answer 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.850
 High powers 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.970
 I wonder if the good is better here 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.180
 Huh-it's a strict cat 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.220
 Another person 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.650
 At all even ended up Kokoko 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.740
 that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.450
 There is no real harm 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.180
 Sumus 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.120
 You should look after thinking 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 It is together 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.890
