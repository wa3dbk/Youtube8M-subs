00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.250 
felt really smart when I was reading the
book<00:04:23.820> because<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.360> knew<00:04:24.539> ahead<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.870> time

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
book because I knew ahead of time

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.310 
book because I knew ahead of time
I'm<00:04:25.320> who<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.040> culprit<00:04:26.550> would<00:04:26.760> be<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:28.110> just

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
I'm who the culprit would be so I just

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.200 
I'm who the culprit would be so I just
felt<00:04:28.530> like<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.680> genius<00:04:29.280> when<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.490> was<00:04:29.700> reading<00:04:29.940> it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
felt like a genius when I was reading it

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.810 
felt like a genius when I was reading it
it<00:04:31.080> was<00:04:31.500> kind<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.740> fun<00:04:31.980> reading<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.640> book

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
it was kind of fun reading the book

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.240 
it was kind of fun reading the book
seeing<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.780> things<00:04:34.020> which<00:04:34.440> were<00:04:34.620> in<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.070> game

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
seeing the things which were in the game

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.100 
seeing the things which were in the game
and<00:04:35.670> some<00:04:36.000> things<00:04:36.210> weren't<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.690> game<00:04:36.870> like

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
and some things weren't in the game like

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.470 
and some things weren't in the game like
I<00:04:37.410> think<00:04:38.250> Bess<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.490> George<00:04:38.670> were<00:04:39.030> there<00:04:39.240> with

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
I think Bess and George were there with

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.350 
I think Bess and George were there with
Nancy<00:04:39.960> when<00:04:40.170> she<00:04:40.290> was<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.530> San<00:04:40.710> Francisco<00:04:40.920> and

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
Nancy when she was in San Francisco and

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.850 
Nancy when she was in San Francisco and
she<00:04:42.360> almost<00:04:42.510> fell<00:04:42.780> off<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.140> roof<00:04:43.380> or

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
she almost fell off the roof or

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.680 
she almost fell off the roof or
something<00:04:43.920> like<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:44.730> was<00:04:45.150> an<00:04:45.330> exciting

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
something like that that was an exciting

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.490 
something like that that was an exciting
episode<00:04:46.760> um<00:04:47.930> there's<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:49.020> little<00:04:49.230> bit<00:04:49.440> of

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
episode um there's a little bit of

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.240 
episode um there's a little bit of
romance<00:04:50.070> between<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:51.090> rose<00:04:51.690> and<00:04:52.260> Luis<00:04:52.650> actually

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
romance between a rose and Luis actually

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.180 
romance between a rose and Luis actually
I<00:04:53.310> think<00:04:53.370> he<00:04:53.790> actually<00:04:54.090> kisses<00:04:54.870> her<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.290> the

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
I think he actually kisses her in the

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.340 
I think he actually kisses her in the
book<00:04:56.670> he<00:04:57.450> doesn't<00:04:57.720> do<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.930> in<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.170> game

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
book he doesn't do that in the game

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.440 
book he doesn't do that in the game
there's<00:04:58.620> sort<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.400> reference<00:04:59.700> to<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.240> in

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
there's sort of a reference to that in

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.970 
there's sort of a reference to that in
the<00:05:00.630> game<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.080> they<00:05:01.200> don't<00:05:01.350> really<00:05:01.500> play<00:05:01.860> it

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
the game but they don't really play it

up<00:05:02.100> as<00:05:02.280> much<00:05:02.580> which<00:05:02.940> makes<00:05:03.390> sense<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.900> guess<00:05:03.930> I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
up as much which makes sense I guess I

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.920 
up as much which makes sense I guess I
mean<00:05:05.820> it's<00:05:05.940> a<00:05:06.030> mystery<00:05:06.360> serious<00:05:06.750> not<00:05:06.900> a
