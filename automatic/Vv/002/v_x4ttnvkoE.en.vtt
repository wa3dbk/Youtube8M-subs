00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the awm and our 700 now that 59 damage

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.139 
the awm and our 700 now that 59 damage
does<00:01:26.840> still<00:01:27.170> mean<00:01:27.439> it's<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.950> one-hit<00:01:28.579> kill<00:01:28.880> to

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
does still mean it's a one-hit kill to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.879 
does still mean it's a one-hit kill to
the<00:01:29.179> head<00:01:29.479> with<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.259> headshot<00:01:30.709> multiplier

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889 
the head with the headshot multiplier

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.699 
the head with the headshot multiplier
and<00:01:31.579> that's<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.450> same<00:01:32.689> for<00:01:32.869> every<00:01:33.139> sniper

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:33.709 
and that's the same for every sniper

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.160 
and that's the same for every sniper
rifle<00:01:34.159> for<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.459> record<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:35.299> scout<00:01:35.630> elite<00:01:35.810> has

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
rifle for the record the scout elite has

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.139 
rifle for the record the scout elite has
a<00:01:36.200> slightly<00:01:36.590> different<00:01:36.770> damage<00:01:37.609> model<00:01:37.969> to

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
a slightly different damage model to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.410 
a slightly different damage model to
those<00:01:38.359> two<00:01:38.779> so<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.529> Scout<00:01:39.799> elite<00:01:40.009> only<00:01:40.819> does<00:01:41.179> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
those two so the Scout elite only does a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.769 
those two so the Scout elite only does a
maximum<00:01:41.959> of<00:01:42.079> 75<00:01:42.679> damage<00:01:43.459> but<00:01:44.240> what<00:01:44.389> that<00:01:44.569> does

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779 
maximum of 75 damage but what that does

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:47.109 
maximum of 75 damage but what that does
mean<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.319> it<00:01:45.770> won't<00:01:46.009> always<00:01:46.219> kill<00:01:46.700> with<00:01:46.909> one

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
mean is it won't always kill with one

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.719 
mean is it won't always kill with one
shot<00:01:47.389> to<00:01:47.569> the<00:01:47.659> body<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:48.200> an<00:01:48.590> enemy<00:01:48.950> if<00:01:49.100> they're

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
shot to the body of an enemy if they're

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.099 
shot to the body of an enemy if they're
running<00:01:49.999> around<00:01:50.119> on<00:01:50.420> full<00:01:50.689> health

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
running around on full health

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.769 
running around on full health
you<00:01:51.259> will<00:01:51.409> only<00:01:51.499> take<00:01:51.859> them<00:01:52.100> down<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.939> 25%

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
you will only take them down to 25%

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:56.620 
you will only take them down to 25%
health<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.279> minimum<00:01:55.700> damage<00:01:55.939> of<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.420> weapon

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
health the minimum damage of this weapon

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.949 
health the minimum damage of this weapon
is<00:01:57.049> 51<00:01:57.920> now<00:01:58.549> as<00:01:58.999> I<00:01:59.179> said<00:01:59.240> earlier<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.719> means

00:01:59.949 --> 00:01:59.959 
is 51 now as I said earlier that means

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.289 
is 51 now as I said earlier that means
that<00:02:00.349> at<00:02:00.560> any<00:02:00.770> range<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.429> will<00:02:01.549> always<00:02:01.789> kill

with one shot to the head with this

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.830 
with one shot to the head with this
weapon<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:05.299> does<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.779> 75<00:02:06.590> damage<00:02:07.159> up<00:02:07.459> to<00:02:07.939> 45

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
good close quarters sniper rifle because

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.980 
good close quarters sniper rifle because
it<00:03:01.070> doesn't<00:03:01.460> require<00:03:01.610> you<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.510> headshot

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
it doesn't require you to get headshot

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.890 
it doesn't require you to get headshot
but<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:03.710> as<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.160> start<00:03:04.580> getting<00:03:04.910> beyond<00:03:05.450> 50

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
but then as you start getting beyond 50

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.200 
but then as you start getting beyond 50
meters<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.800> tails<00:03:07.220> off<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.060> an

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
meters it tails off in it's an

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.740 
meters it tails off in it's an
effectiveness<00:03:08.990> quite<00:03:09.770> significantly<00:03:10.750> so

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
effectiveness quite significantly so

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.900 
effectiveness quite significantly so
what<00:03:11.900> I'd<00:03:12.080> like<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.500> talk<00:03:12.650> about<00:03:12.860> now<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.490> what

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
what I'd like to talk about now is what

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.720 
what I'd like to talk about now is what
I<00:03:13.970> think<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.810> best<00:03:15.110> or<00:03:15.740> most<00:03:16.010> effective

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
I think is the best or most effective

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.110 
I think is the best or most effective
all-round<00:03:17.390> sniper<00:03:17.780> rifle<00:03:18.460> available<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
all-round sniper rifle available to the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.850 
all-round sniper rifle available to the
professional<00:03:20.810> class<00:03:21.020> in<00:03:21.320> battlefield

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
professional class in battlefield

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.130 
professional class in battlefield
hardline<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.300> think<00:03:23.540> that's<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.870> Scout

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
hardline and I think that's the Scout

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.800 
hardline and I think that's the Scout
elite<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.680> I'll<00:03:24.830> go<00:03:24.980> for<00:03:25.190> my<00:03:25.310> reasons<00:03:25.730> why<00:03:25.970> so

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
elite and I'll go for my reasons why so

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.650 
elite and I'll go for my reasons why so
the<00:03:26.900> Scout<00:03:27.200> elite<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:28.130> viable<00:03:28.820> in<00:03:29.090> close<00:03:29.330> range

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
the Scout elite is viable in close range

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.540 
the Scout elite is viable in close range
because<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.170> has<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> really<00:03:30.890> good<00:03:31.250> rate<00:03:31.520> of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
because it has a really good rate of

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.740 
because it has a really good rate of
fire<00:03:31.820> of<00:03:32.560> 85<00:03:33.560> RPM<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.820> also<00:03:35.030> has<00:03:35.450> an

fire of 85 RPM it also has an

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.810 
fire of 85 RPM it also has an
exceptionally<00:03:36.500> good<00:03:36.530> quick<00:03:37.070> reload<00:03:37.520> are

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
exceptionally good quick reload are

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.580 
exceptionally good quick reload are
under<00:03:38.180> three<00:03:38.390> seconds<00:03:38.900> which<00:03:39.410> are<00:03:39.560> a

under three seconds which are a
bolt-action<00:03:39.950> is<00:03:40.400> very<00:03:40.730> good<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.239> it<00:03:42.050> has<00:03:42.290> a

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
bolt-action is very good and it has a

bolt-action is very good and it has a

drop the bullets don't drop as much so
maybe<00:04:28.070> if<00:04:28.280> you're<00:04:28.370> targeting<00:04:28.730> someone<00:04:29.360> that's

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
maybe if you're targeting someone that's

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.840 
maybe if you're targeting someone that's
completely<00:04:30.140> stationary<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.220> you're<00:04:31.640> lining

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
completely stationary and you're lining

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.200 
completely stationary and you're lining
up<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.240> headshot<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.870> awm<00:04:33.650> or<00:04:33.890> the<00:04:34.310> r700<00:04:34.850> it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
up that headshot the awm or the r700 it

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.530 
up that headshot the awm or the r700 it
might<00:04:35.419> be<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.660> bit<00:04:35.870> easier

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
might be a bit easier

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.800 
might be a bit easier
but<00:04:37.230> we've<00:04:37.920> a<00:04:37.950> moving<00:04:38.520> target<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:39.120> distance<00:04:39.630> it

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
but we've a moving target a distance it

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.390 
but we've a moving target a distance it
will<00:04:39.930> always<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.230> easier<00:04:40.830> with<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.100> Scout

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
will always be easier with the Scout

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.670 
will always be easier with the Scout
elite<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:42.570> because<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.080> bullet<00:04:43.410> speed

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
elite just because of the bullet speed

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.460 
elite just because of the bullet speed
being<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.370> much<00:04:44.550> faster<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.720> think<00:04:46.050> if<00:04:46.230> you

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
being so much faster and I think if you

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.560 
being so much faster and I think if you
look<00:04:46.740> at<00:04:46.830> those<00:04:46.980> two<00:04:47.040> situations<00:04:47.550> if<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.390> look

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
look at those two situations if you look

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.810 
look at those two situations if you look
at<00:04:48.720> an<00:04:48.840> enemy<00:04:49.260> that's<00:04:49.470> stationary<00:04:50.160> would<00:04:50.700> you

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
at an enemy that's stationary would you

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.300 
at an enemy that's stationary would you
want<00:04:50.970> it<00:04:51.030> to<00:04:51.120> be<00:04:51.210> easier<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.810> hit<00:04:51.960> him<00:04:52.230> on<00:04:52.380> the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
want it to be easier to hit him on the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.130 
want it to be easier to hit him on the
head<00:04:53.490> or<00:04:53.700> would<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.030> want<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.270> easier<00:04:54.930> to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
head or would you want it to easier to

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.620 
head or would you want it to easier to
hit<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.500> moving<00:04:56.040> target<00:04:56.510> personally<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.540> think

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
hit a moving target personally I think

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.410 
hit a moving target personally I think
stationary<00:04:58.350> targets<00:04:58.950> with<00:04:59.340> practice<00:04:59.910> are

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
stationary targets with practice are

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.450 
stationary targets with practice are
quite<00:05:00.810> easy<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.230> hit<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.740> head<00:05:01.920> anyway

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
quite easy to hit in the head anyway

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.580 
quite easy to hit in the head anyway
it's<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.120> moving<00:05:03.360> targets<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.440> are

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
it's the moving targets that are

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.500 
it's the moving targets that are
trickier<00:05:05.010> now<00:05:05.280> such<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:05.970> something<00:05:06.360> that

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
trickier now such is something that

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.810 
trickier now such is something that
Scout<00:05:06.750> elite<00:05:07.020> will<00:05:07.500> assist<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:08.430> with<00:05:08.550> by

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
Scout elite will assist you with by

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.960 
Scout elite will assist you with by
having<00:05:09.210> such<00:05:09.600> high<00:05:10.290> muzzle<00:05:10.740> velocity<00:05:11.520> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
having such high muzzle velocity and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.510 
having such high muzzle velocity and
it's<00:05:12.570> not<00:05:12.780> only<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.620> going<00:05:13.890> back<00:05:14.130> to

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
it's not only that just going back to

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.390 
it's not only that just going back to
the<00:05:14.910> rate<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.450> fire<00:05:15.770> even<00:05:16.770> if<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.980> are<00:05:17.160> missing

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
the rate of fire even if you are missing

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.550 
the rate of fire even if you are missing
shots<00:05:17.790> because<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.540> are<00:05:18.750> calculating<00:05:19.080> the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
shots because you are calculating the

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.170 
shots because you are calculating the
bullet<00:05:19.830> drop<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.040> finding<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.700> bit<00:05:20.880> tricky

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
bullet drop and finding it a bit tricky

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.290 
bullet drop and finding it a bit tricky
you<00:05:21.510> have<00:05:22.320> numerous<00:05:22.980> opportunities<00:05:23.300> because

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
you have numerous opportunities because

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.750 
you have numerous opportunities because
the<00:05:24.420> rates<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.780> fire<00:05:25.020> is<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.590> high<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:26.580> can

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
the rates of fire is so high you can

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.360 
the rates of fire is so high you can
spam<00:05:27.390> out<00:05:27.600> shots<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.170> sniper<00:05:28.560> rifle<00:05:28.800> so

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
spam out shots with a sniper rifle so

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.150 
spam out shots with a sniper rifle so
quickly<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.630> even<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:31.530> does<00:05:31.680> take<00:05:31.890> one

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
quickly that even if it does take one

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.550 
quickly that even if it does take one
two<00:05:32.490> or<00:05:32.700> three<00:05:33.000> shots<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.780> get<00:05:34.020> that<00:05:34.200> choice

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
two or three shots you get that choice

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.680 
two or three shots you get that choice
because<00:05:35.010> of<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.550> rate<00:05:35.760> of<00:05:36.030> fire<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.300> this

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
because of the rate of fire of this

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.410 
because of the rate of fire of this
weapon<00:05:37.170> now<00:05:37.440> as<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.490> said<00:05:38.790> earlier<00:05:39.240> the

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
weapon now as I said earlier the

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.410 
weapon now as I said earlier the
knockout<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.110> some<00:05:40.890> extent<00:05:41.250> I<00:05:41.400> guess<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.790> awm

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
knockout and some extent I guess the awm

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.900 
knockout and some extent I guess the awm
and<00:05:42.570> r700<00:05:43.050> could<00:05:43.950> be<00:05:44.100> considered<00:05:44.640> more

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
and r700 could be considered more

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.090 
and r700 could be considered more
damaging<00:05:45.540> in<00:05:45.660> close<00:05:45.900> quarters<00:05:46.440> although<00:05:47.070> I

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
damaging in close quarters although I

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.880 
damaging in close quarters although I
would<00:05:47.430> argue<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.960> rate<00:05:49.170> of<00:05:49.380> fire<00:05:49.620> makes

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
would argue that the rate of fire makes

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.920 
would argue that the rate of fire makes
the<00:05:50.070> scout<00:05:50.340> elite<00:05:50.580> extremely<00:05:51.330> damaging<00:05:51.750> but

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
the scout elite extremely damaging but

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.720 
the scout elite extremely damaging but
the<00:05:52.050> one-shot<00:05:52.530> potential<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.250> those<00:05:53.400> other

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
the one-shot potential of those other

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.390 
the one-shot potential of those other
weapons<00:05:54.150> well<00:05:54.810> I'd<00:05:54.930> say<00:05:55.260> the<00:05:55.440> way<00:05:55.650> that<00:05:56.310> the

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
weapons well I'd say the way that the

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.460 
weapons well I'd say the way that the
professional<00:05:57.000> class<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.420> just<00:05:57.630> balanced<00:05:58.290> in

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
professional class is just balanced in

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.760 
professional class is just balanced in
battlefield<00:05:58.980> hardline<00:05:59.030> you<00:06:00.030> actually<00:06:00.390> have

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
battlefield hardline you actually have
