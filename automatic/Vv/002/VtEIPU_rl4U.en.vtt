00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 so six guys again I'm here and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 is that the information around xbox 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.040
 720 or xbox durango does not stop ringing 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.800
 Now what has been said is that good 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.170
 to be let's say very linked to the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.630
 digital television platforms but 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.330
 eye because it offers something new something that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 it even includes kinect because it includes 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.630
 that I found very curious one 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.430
 of the details I'm just going to tell you one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.650
 before watching the video 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.910
 a detail in which it is said that if 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 For example, we are watching a movie 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.250
 and we leave the room kinect detects 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.650
 that we're gone and the movie gets 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 in pause but hey all this comes with 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.150
 many more things have been given more data 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 more information about that new xbox 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.430
 720 of which we want to know so much 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.290
 tomorrow it seems very strong and is that they continue 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.410
 appearing more data on that new 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.210
 xbox 720 this time it says that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 Would work with different suppliers 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 cable television at least so 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.530
 has ensured of multiple sources 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.289
 close to microsoft have revealed that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.310
 the new xbox will have the possibility of 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.799
 connect 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.409
 portable television providers 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.490
 that we would have to use 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.470
 decoders of the different 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.479
 companies to integrate them into 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.789
 consoles it's a service that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.100
 it would work by connecting the decoder 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.320
 to the new xbox what will allow us 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.659
 use the interface of the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.000
 machine add even functions 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 additional as reported by this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 medium will be one of the key pieces of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.789
 the microsoft proposal is something that goes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.009
 to be available from the same 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.409
 launch of the console but then 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.810
 later it will be expanding in addition this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 system would offer exclusive elements already 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 that Microsoft would have agreements with the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.659
 Cable TV providers and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.420
 even the integration with kinect 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.280
 would allow for example pause what 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.229
 we are seeing if we abandon the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.240
 room is to say we are seeing one 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.979
 movie we go to the bathroom kinect us 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.959
 it detects that we are leaving and the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.000
 movie is paused alone has also been 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.220
 said that microsoft would prepare its own 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 low cost xbox designed to offer 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.380
 these services something that many are already 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.269
