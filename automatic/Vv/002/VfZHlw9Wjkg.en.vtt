actually<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.660> think<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.139> chia<00:00:13.710> we

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
actually when we think of chia we

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.609 
actually when we think of chia we
usually<00:00:14.309> think<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.969> chia<00:00:15.330> pet<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
usually think of the chia pet of the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.890 
usually think of the chia pet of the
late-night<00:00:17.160> infomercial<00:00:17.970> right<00:00:18.180> it's<00:00:18.690> bad

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
late-night infomercial right it's bad

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.599 
late-night infomercial right it's bad
weather<00:00:19.140> though<00:00:19.500> you're<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.890> 22<00:00:20.070> g<00:00:20.400> yeah

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
weather though you're what 22 g yeah

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.820 
weather though you're what 22 g yeah
yeah<00:00:21.330> absolutely<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.109> actually<00:00:22.590> from<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
yeah absolutely it's actually from a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.730 
yeah absolutely it's actually from a
plant<00:00:23.100> called<00:00:23.189> salvia<00:00:23.789> hispanica<00:00:24.439> we<00:00:25.439> think

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
plant called salvia hispanica we think

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.679 
plant called salvia hispanica we think
like<00:00:25.920> way<00:00:26.220> back<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> chia<00:00:27.090> pet<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.539> it's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
like way back with the chia pet but it's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.080 
like way back with the chia pet but it's
at<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.990> plant<00:00:28.380> has<00:00:28.590> existed<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.099> hundreds

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
at this plant has existed for hundreds

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.730 
at this plant has existed for hundreds
of<00:00:30.210> years<00:00:30.420> back<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.109> been<00:00:31.230> part<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
of years back and it's been part of the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.600 
of years back and it's been part of the
diet<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.960> seed<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.370> has

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
diet and the the seed is actually has

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.819 
diet and the the seed is actually has
tremendous<00:00:36.180> nutritional<00:00:36.780> value<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.559> plant

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
tremendous nutritional value the plant

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
tremendous nutritional value the plant
itself<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.670> bit<00:00:38.760> bitter<00:00:39.030> right<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
itself is a little bit bitter right it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.940 
itself is a little bit bitter right it
doesn't<00:00:39.870> reach<00:00:40.110> them<00:00:40.290> really<00:00:40.530> something<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
doesn't reach them really something that

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
doesn't reach them really something that
we<00:00:41.070> would<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.250> consuming<00:00:41.820> but<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> seed<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
we would be consuming but the seed is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.920 
we would be consuming but the seed is
rich<00:00:43.350> in<00:00:43.559> fiber<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.760> soluble<00:00:45.030> fiber<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.899> well

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
rich in fiber in a soluble fiber as well

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
rich in fiber in a soluble fiber as well

as in omega fatty acid tapping and you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.819 
as in omega fatty acid tapping and you
recently<00:00:48.390> took<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.899> trip<00:00:48.930> went<00:00:49.469> straight<00:00:49.710> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
recently took a trip went straight to

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
the source to find out more about this
scene<00:00:52.140> isn't<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.469> ask<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.070> chia

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
scene isn't really ask there are chia

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.970 
scene isn't really ask there are chia
seeds<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.510> world<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.410> particular

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
seeds around the world this particular

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.709 
seeds around the world this particular
area<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> went<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> northwest

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
area where I went was to the northwest

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
area where I went was to the northwest
the<00:00:58.320> con<00:00:58.530> Inara<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.190> Australia<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> I

the con Inara in Australia and I

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.910 
the con Inara in Australia and I
actually<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.079> had<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> lot<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> questions<00:01:01.859> about

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
actually I had a lot of questions about

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
actually I had a lot of questions about
how<00:01:02.219> chia<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.579> farm<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.270> got<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.539> sit<00:01:03.690> down

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
how chia is farm so I got to sit down

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.539 
how chia is farm so I got to sit down
with<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.170> farmer<00:01:04.680> who<00:01:05.189> started<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.760> there

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.010 

so<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> making<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> Kimberley

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so here in the making of the Kimberley

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.570 
so here in the making of the Kimberley
region<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.439> Western<00:01:13.740> Australia<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.490> at

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
region of Western Australia which is at

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
region of Western Australia which is at
the<00:01:14.640> top<00:01:14.820> part<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.210> Australia<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the top part of Australia and this is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.469 
the top part of Australia and this is
proven<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> world's<00:01:17.790> best<00:01:17.909> place<00:01:18.270> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
right and make it 3 ratio in the oil

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.899 
right and make it 3 ratio in the oil
remember<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.229> magnificent<00:01:25.799> dry<00:01:26.070> warm

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
remember it's magnificent dry warm

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
remember it's magnificent dry warm
weather<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.540> critical<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.530> with

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
weather which is critical as we go with

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
weather which is critical as we go with
the<00:01:29.220> crop<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.549> despairing<00:01:30.119> phase<00:01:30.360> need<00:01:30.689> grain

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the crop in despairing phase need grain

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
the crop in despairing phase need grain
ripening<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.159> we've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.549> fantastic

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
ripening so we've got this fantastic

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.480
