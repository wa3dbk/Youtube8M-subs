00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.680
 do not 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:24.400
 I came here when I was 19 and not 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.250
 I have known another institution that is and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.869
 has been the one that has given me to form 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.230
 my students 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.890
 I have lived fully the whole life of the 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.899
 orchestra because 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.129
 I pain that is all I have 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.059
 I could make my life look I lived in 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.570
 Europe 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.490
 spent until two years ago I came back from 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.530
 Europe 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.820
 and sing again with one of the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.790
 orchestras that practically saw me born 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.640
 as for artistically as to 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.840
 Professional is the biggest thing that I 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.130
 I have at this moment is one of the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.560
 gloves inside the gifts more 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.370
 big ticket is worth a lot and I had 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.260
 the enormous fortune of being last year 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.360
 doing the eighth symphony of mahler's 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.930
 gustav mahler participate in that 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 wonderful event and I have a memory 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.080
 absolutely unforgettable fantastic of 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 that experience 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 the party is wonderful is a level 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160
 soaring 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.270
 or 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.770
 and power of the new symphony is that its 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.610
 music for me is the ninth symphony is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.149
 like music is beyond 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.759
 simply notes is something that elevates the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.440
 something spiritual spirit something that goes more 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.130
 beyond what our ears are 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.130
 able to capture 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.320
 because it is the work of a great genius who 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.390
 He knew how to express the feeling of 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.390
 humanity in this symphony 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.920
 talks about friendship love 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.270
 fraternity 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.060
 I believe that the society in which 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.099
 we live needs a lot of that and my 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.770
 personal story as it turns out that 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.970
 It also suits me because I do not 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.280
 I knew and I was very encouraged by the first 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.260
 rehearsal where he filled me with joy 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 listen to her - you're not in the room 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.670
 movement specifically what was it 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.980
 that we rehearsed less and I'm very very 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.940
 satisfied to be able to sing the novena 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.630
 action and more with the philharmonic orchestra 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.630
 from Bogota 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 sound like a million
