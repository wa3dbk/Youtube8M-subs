connected so you're teaching that if

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.020 
connected so you're teaching that if
this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.689> doe<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> Ray<00:01:26.280> you've<00:01:26.850> already

them now here's the visual

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.380 
them now here's the visual
representation<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.920> if<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.369> doe<00:01:32.850> this

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
representation of it if this is doe this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.669 
representation of it if this is doe this
is<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:33.840> um<00:01:34.670> same<00:01:35.670> thing<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.499> although

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
is right um same thing on here although

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.080 
is right um same thing on here although
I<00:01:37.799> didn't<00:01:38.039> draw<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.219> notes<00:01:38.429> we<00:01:38.579> were<00:01:38.670> looking

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I didn't draw the notes we were looking

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.899 
I didn't draw the notes we were looking
with<00:01:39.210> earlier<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> G<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.859> doe<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.429> the<00:01:41.729> G

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909

with earlier if the G is doe and the G
is<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.359> G<00:01:42.600> line<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.619> G<00:01:43.950> clef

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is on the G line because the G clef

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.080 
is on the G line because the G clef
loves<00:01:44.789> G<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.479> makes<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.960> hug<00:01:46.289> around<00:01:46.590> G<00:01:47.280> line<00:01:47.789> to
