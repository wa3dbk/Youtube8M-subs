the<00:05:47.000> moon<00:05:47.180> is<00:05:47.300> Veda<00:05:47.539> of<00:05:47.750> gravel<00:05:48.199> but<00:05:48.349> you<00:05:48.529> will

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
the moon is Veda of gravel but you will

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.969 
the moon is Veda of gravel but you will
not<00:05:49.099> fall<00:05:49.969> like<00:05:50.779> the<00:05:50.930> gravel<00:05:51.289> does<00:05:51.440> not<00:05:51.650> fall

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
not fall like the gravel does not fall

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.059 
not fall like the gravel does not fall
like<00:05:52.279> it<00:05:52.460> normally<00:05:52.610> would<00:05:53.060> on<00:05:53.919> planet<00:05:54.919> which

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
like it normally would on planet which

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:01.540 
like it normally would on planet which
is<00:05:55.250> right<00:05:55.460> there<00:05:59.409> so<00:06:00.409> I<00:06:00.440> guess<00:06:00.800> that's<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.490> for

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
is right there so I guess that's it for

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.189 
is right there so I guess that's it for
the<00:06:01.879> moon<00:06:02.120> mod<00:06:02.419> I<00:06:04.270> will<00:06:05.270> have<00:06:05.419> the<00:06:05.569> link<00:06:05.750> for
