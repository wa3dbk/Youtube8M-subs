track<00:05:08.450> so<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.560> when<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.860> do<00:05:10.010> time<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:11.479> arm

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
track so that when you do time the arm

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.620 
track so that when you do time the arm
is<00:05:11.870> ground<00:05:12.169> the<00:05:12.979> energy<00:05:13.460> will<00:05:14.030> be<00:05:14.180> lining<00:05:14.419> out

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
is ground the energy will be lining out

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.600 
is ground the energy will be lining out
a<00:05:14.660> little<00:05:14.900> bit<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.290> corner<00:05:15.650> so<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.340> power

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
a little bit to the corner so the power

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.310 
a little bit to the corner so the power
