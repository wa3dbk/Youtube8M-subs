00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.450 

as<00:05:46.370> long<00:05:46.580> as<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.700> do<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.940> quickly<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:48.460> don't

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
as long as you do it quickly you don't

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.310 
as long as you do it quickly you don't
do<00:05:49.610> it<00:05:49.760> by<00:05:49.940> the<00:05:50.000> 42nd<00:05:50.780> block<00:05:50.900> you're<00:05:51.050> gonna<00:05:51.170> be

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
do it by the 42nd block you're gonna be

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.300 
do it by the 42nd block you're gonna be
a<00:05:51.350> little<00:05:51.440> bit<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.770> trouble<00:05:51.980> so<00:05:52.760> yeah<00:05:54.310> but

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
a little bit of trouble so yeah but

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.059 
a little bit of trouble so yeah but
starts<00:05:55.640> to<00:05:55.730> move<00:05:55.850> faster

00:05:59.059 --> 00:05:59.069 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:01.529 

the<00:06:00.069> purpose<00:06:00.340> of<00:06:00.460> employee<00:06:00.759> bug<00:06:01.000> is<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.300> slow

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
the purpose of employee bug is to slow

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.559 
the purpose of employee bug is to slow
it<00:06:01.689> down<00:06:01.719> but<00:06:02.110> it<00:06:02.169> will<00:06:02.259> move<00:06:02.469> fast<00:06:02.770> eventually

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:24.300 

so<00:06:07.569> be<00:06:07.719> careful<00:06:08.050> with<00:06:08.139> that<00:06:23.069> that's<00:06:24.069> probably

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
so be careful with that that's probably

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.999 
so be careful with that that's probably
easiest<00:06:24.729> of<00:06:24.939> the<00:06:25.030> bends<00:06:25.389> just<00:06:26.319> watch<00:06:26.620> it's<00:06:26.830> not

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
easiest of the bends just watch it's not

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:28.010 
easiest of the bends just watch it's not
easy

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
easy

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.029 
easy
crap

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:46.800 

go<00:06:33.039> for<00:06:33.310> it<00:06:33.340> to<00:06:33.879> taste<00:06:45.300> it<00:06:46.300> took<00:06:46.509> me<00:06:46.629> a<00:06:46.689> while
