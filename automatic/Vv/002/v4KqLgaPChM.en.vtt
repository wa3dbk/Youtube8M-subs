00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
applied to the back of the planks before

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.250 
applied to the back of the planks before
we<00:00:37.920> put<00:00:38.489> them<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.059> framing<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.750> then

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
we put them on to the framing and then

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
we put them on to the framing and then
since<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.769> time<00:00:41.070> we've<00:00:41.309> applied<00:00:41.640> one<00:00:42.059> more

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
since that time we've applied one more

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.229 
since that time we've applied one more
coat<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.900> 1026<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> interior<00:00:44.699> of<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.030> boat

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
coat of 1026 to the interior of the boat

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
coat of 1026 to the interior of the boat
as<00:00:45.449> well<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.110> gunnels<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.250> knees<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
as well as the gunnels and the knees and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.259 
as well as the gunnels and the knees and
the<00:00:48.150> inside<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.659> transom<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.909> we<00:00:50.909> had<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
the inside of the transom so we had to

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.270 
the inside of the transom so we had to
prep<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> up<00:00:51.870> from<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.649> varnish<00:00:53.040> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
prep it up from there for varnish and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
prep it up from there for varnish and
what<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.550> did<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.790> most<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.479> the<00:00:54.600> interior<00:00:55.170> was

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
what we did on most of the interior was

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
what we did on most of the interior was
just<00:00:55.559> simply<00:00:55.920> rub<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.449> little

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
just simply rub it down with a little

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.250 
just simply rub it down with a little
brown<00:00:58.460> scotch<00:00:59.460> brite<00:00:59.789> pad<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
brown scotch brite pad because the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
brown scotch brite pad because the
original<00:01:01.559> sealer<00:01:02.100> has<00:01:02.370> raised<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.329> grain<00:01:03.660> in

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
original sealer has raised the grain in

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.290 
original sealer has raised the grain in
between<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> frames<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.460> raised<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.030> grain

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
between the frames and raised the grain

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.600 
between the frames and raised the grain
on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.690> frames<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.229> little<00:01:07.259> bit<00:01:07.679> and<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.399> didn't

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
on the frames a little bit and we didn't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.790 
on the frames a little bit and we didn't
want<00:01:08.789> to<00:01:08.850> use<00:01:08.910> any<00:01:09.240> sandpaper<00:01:10.050> or<00:01:10.320> anything<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
want to use any sandpaper or anything to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.260 
want to use any sandpaper or anything to
get<00:01:10.979> rid<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.160> that<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> knew<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.149> would

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
get rid of that because we knew we would

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270 
get rid of that because we knew we would
scratch<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.110> surface<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.710> didn't<00:01:13.920> want<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> do

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
scratch the surface we didn't want to do

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.999 
scratch the surface we didn't want to do
that<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> little<00:01:16.440> dinghy<00:01:16.710> that's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that and this is a little dinghy that's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.740 
that and this is a little dinghy that's
being<00:01:17.190> used<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.030> time<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.570> still

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
being used all the time but we still

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600 
being used all the time but we still
trying<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> make<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.890> nice<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:20.429> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
trying to make it look as nice as we can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.810 
trying to make it look as nice as we can
make<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.909> look<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.740> we<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:22.950> prepped<00:01:23.580> up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
make it look and we actually prepped up

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.029 
make it look and we actually prepped up
in<00:01:24.030> between<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> frames<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:25.320> vertically

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
in between the frames going vertically

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.520 
in between the frames going vertically
against<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> grain<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.509> cedar<00:01:27.899> planking

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
against the grain of that cedar planking

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.710 
against the grain of that cedar planking
and<00:01:28.679> of<00:01:29.220> course<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.539> done

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and of course all of it was done

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.479 
and of course all of it was done
vertically<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.470> between<00:01:31.800> and<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.399> of

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:32.489 
vertically in between and that kind of

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.300 
vertically in between and that kind of
scrubbed<00:01:32.880> off<00:01:33.149> all<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.780> fuzz<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.709> some

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
scrubbed off all of that fuzz and some

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
scrubbed off all of that fuzz and some
of<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.520> little<00:01:35.729> brush<00:01:36.030> hairs<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.720> different

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
of the little brush hairs and different

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the little brush hairs and different
things<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.410> were<00:01:37.530> left<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.160> on<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.580> of

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
things that were left on it on some of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.449 
things that were left on it on some of
the<00:01:38.759> flat<00:01:39.000> surfaces<00:01:39.660> we<00:01:39.840> also<00:01:40.050> use<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:41.130> just

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
the flat surfaces we also use like just

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.199 
the flat surfaces we also use like just
220<00:01:42.090> paper<00:01:42.989> because<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.160> actually<00:01:44.550> makes<00:01:44.819> it's

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
220 paper because it actually makes it's

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.469 
220 paper because it actually makes it's
much<00:01:45.479> smoother<00:01:46.349> then<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.700> does<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.239> kind

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
much smoother then this does this kind

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
much smoother then this does this kind
of<00:01:48.569> roughs<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> surface<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.739> allows<00:01:49.830> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of roughs the surface and allows the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.639 
of roughs the surface and allows the
varnish<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.819> stick<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> seal<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> coat<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
varnish to stick to the seal of coat but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.290 
varnish to stick to the seal of coat but
if<00:01:52.739> you<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.069> that<00:01:53.250> surface<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.819> be<00:01:53.970> flat

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
if you want that surface to be flat

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.460 
if you want that surface to be flat
you're<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.929> sand<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.349> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you're going to have to sand it this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.680 
you're going to have to sand it this
doesn't<00:01:55.709> really<00:01:56.220> flatten<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.819> surface<00:01:57.000> it

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
doesn't really flatten the surface it

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.630 
doesn't really flatten the surface it
really<00:01:57.959> just<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.440> preps<00:01:58.800> it<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.129> to<00:01:59.310> grip

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
really just kind of preps it up to grip

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
really just kind of preps it up to grip
the<00:01:59.819> varnish<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.929> those<00:02:01.229> are<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.679> things

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the varnish so those are the two things

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.559 
the varnish so those are the two things
that<00:02:02.069> we<00:02:02.280> used<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.879> after<00:02:03.209> that<00:02:03.390> was

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
that we used and then after that was

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.260 
that we used and then after that was
done<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.140> took<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.920> brush<00:02:05.129> and<00:02:05.429> we<00:02:05.610> brushed<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
done we took a brush and we brushed the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.330 
done we took a brush and we brushed the
inside<00:02:06.690> of<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.229> vacuumed<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
inside of it and we vacuumed it and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.190 
inside of it and we vacuumed it and
cleaned<00:02:08.940> out<00:02:09.119> everything<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.050> get

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
cleaned out everything that we could get

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
cleaned out everything that we could get
cleaned<00:02:10.470> out<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.190> wipe<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.030> down<00:02:12.239> with

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
cleaned out by then wipe it down with

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.630 
cleaned out by then wipe it down with
alcohol<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.530> rag<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.220> picked<00:02:14.489> up

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
alcohol and a rag and that picked up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.040 
alcohol and a rag and that picked up
quite<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.910> bit<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.270> after<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.660> was<00:02:15.840> done<00:02:15.870> we

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
quite a bit and after that was done we

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.110 
quite a bit and after that was done we
pick<00:02:16.319> up<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.560> tack<00:02:16.830> cloth<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.580> tacked<00:02:17.879> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
pick up a tack cloth and we tacked the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.479 
pick up a tack cloth and we tacked the
whole<00:02:18.300> inside<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.019> boat<00:02:19.310> vertically<00:02:20.310> and

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
whole inside of the boat vertically and

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.610 
whole inside of the boat vertically and
in<00:02:20.610> between<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.090> frames<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.720> every<00:02:22.110> surface

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
in between the frames and every surface

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.710 
in between the frames and every surface
so<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.950> we'd<00:02:23.069> get<00:02:23.250> every<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:24.269> last<00:02:24.450> bit

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so that we'd get every little last bit

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.990 
so that we'd get every little last bit
of<00:02:25.019> dust<00:02:25.260> off<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.550> I've<00:02:26.730> got<00:02:26.760> an

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
of dust off of it all right I've got an

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.920 
of dust off of it all right I've got an
old<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.599> honest<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.379> I've

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
old can of honest here and I've

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.809 
old can of honest here and I've
move<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.319> top<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.859> actually<00:02:30.219> poke<00:02:30.519> some

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
move the top and actually poke some

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.009 
move the top and actually poke some
holes<00:02:30.849> in<00:02:32.489> receiver<00:02:33.489> for<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.000> top<00:02:34.239> around<00:02:34.719> so

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
holes in receiver for the top around so

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.410 
holes in receiver for the top around so
that<00:02:35.049> when<00:02:35.319> they<00:02:35.439> pour<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.819> varnish<00:02:37.239> will

that when they pour it the varnish will

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.420 
that when they pour it the varnish will
run<00:02:37.629> back<00:02:37.870> down<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.439> holes<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.069> purpose

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
run back down the holes that's a purpose

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.920 
run back down the holes that's a purpose
for<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.030> actually<00:02:40.480> what<00:02:40.629> I'm<00:02:40.719> going<00:02:40.870> to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
for that and actually what I'm going to

for that and actually what I'm going to
do<00:02:41.049> now<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.439> just<00:02:41.680> strain<00:02:42.129> it<00:02:42.340> through<00:02:42.370> this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
do now is just strain it through this

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.819 
do now is just strain it through this
little<00:02:42.939> strainer<00:02:43.450> into<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.439> quart

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
little strainer into this quart

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.230 
little strainer into this quart
container

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.840 

strain<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.050> whole<00:02:49.260> thing<00:02:49.710> right<00:02:50.520> through

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
strain the whole thing right through

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.840 
strain the whole thing right through
there<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.870> once<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.670> fill

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
there all at once I don't want to fill

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.580 
there all at once I don't want to fill

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the strainer all the way up to the top

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.740 
the strainer all the way up to the top
because<00:02:55.860> then<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.490> handle<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.240> strain<00:02:57.540> or

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
because then when I handle the strain or

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.300 
because then when I handle the strain or
would<00:02:57.870> get<00:02:58.080> all<00:02:58.230> over<00:02:58.260> me<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.890> I'm<00:02:59.010> trying<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
would get all over me and I'm trying to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.200 
would get all over me and I'm trying to
avoid<00:02:59.640> that

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
avoid that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.090 
avoid that
well<00:03:00.690> there's<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.050> drains<00:03:01.440> down<00:03:01.770> I'll<00:03:02.070> just

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
well there's that drains down I'll just

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.190 
well there's that drains down I'll just
keep<00:03:02.460> draining<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.720> little<00:03:04.020> bit

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
keep draining the can here a little bit

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.810 
keep draining the can here a little bit
so<00:03:04.560> now<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.040> set<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.610> down

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
so now I'm going to set the can down

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.570 
so now I'm going to set the can down
right<00:03:06.090> beside<00:03:06.510> me<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:08.070> shake<00:03:08.400> her<00:03:08.520> up

right beside me here just shake her up
here<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.450> we've<00:03:10.290> transferred<00:03:10.770> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
here a little bit we've transferred the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.340 
here a little bit we've transferred the
strainer<00:03:11.220> back<00:03:11.520> over<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> can<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.660> this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
strainer back over to the can and this

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.750 
strainer back over to the can and this
is<00:03:13.500> what<00:03:13.680> we're<00:03:13.800> going<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:13.980> use<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.430> apply<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
is what we're going to use to apply to

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.700 
is what we're going to use to apply to
the<00:03:15.030> boat<00:03:15.240> now<00:03:15.600> I'd<00:03:15.930> like<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.260> show<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
the boat now I'd like to show you the

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.500 
the boat now I'd like to show you the
brush<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.730> use<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.120> apply<00:03:18.240> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
brush that I'm going to use to apply the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.080 
brush that I'm going to use to apply the
varnish<00:03:18.870> now<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> China<00:03:20.700> bristle

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
varnish now this is a China bristle

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.300 
varnish now this is a China bristle
brush<00:03:21.600> it's<00:03:21.840> not<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.200> most<00:03:22.380> expensive<00:03:22.710> brush

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
brush it's not the most expensive brush

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.480 
brush it's not the most expensive brush
in<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.610> world<00:03:23.820> but<00:03:24.450> they<00:03:24.600> work<00:03:24.750> quite<00:03:25.080> nicely

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
in the world but they work quite nicely

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.950 
in the world but they work quite nicely
the<00:03:26.490> trouble<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:27.030> them<00:03:27.150> usually<00:03:27.630> is<00:03:27.750> is

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
the trouble with them usually is is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.230 
the trouble with them usually is is
they've<00:03:28.140> made<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.530> bristles<00:03:29.010> too<00:03:29.580> long<00:03:29.910> for

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
they've made the bristles too long for

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.420 
they've made the bristles too long for
the<00:03:30.390> stiffness<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> bristles<00:03:31.620> are<00:03:32.070> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the stiffness that the bristles are and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.000 
the stiffness that the bristles are and
you<00:03:33.210> have<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.780> little<00:03:34.170> bit<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.470> hard<00:03:34.680> time

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
you have a little bit of a hard time

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.790 
you have a little bit of a hard time
moving<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.910> varnish<00:03:36.330> with<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.870> these<00:03:36.990> so

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
moving the varnish with one of these so

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.610 
moving the varnish with one of these so
the<00:03:37.950> simple<00:03:38.370> cure<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.900> box<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the simple cure for that is the box the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.950 
the simple cure for that is the box the
bristles<00:03:41.130> up<00:03:41.370> near<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.760> heel<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.270> little<00:03:42.840> bit

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
bristles up near the heel a little bit

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.690 
bristles up near the heel a little bit
of<00:03:43.080> tape<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.650> allows<00:03:43.950> you<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.280> move<00:03:44.460> your

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
of tape and that allows you to move your

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.390 
of tape and that allows you to move your
fingers<00:03:45.120> down<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.690> hold<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.560> without<00:03:46.920> being

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
fingers down and hold it without being

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400 
fingers down and hold it without being
involved<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.300> bristles<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.870> spreading

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
involved in the bristles and spreading

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
involved in the bristles and spreading
the<00:03:49.560> bristles<00:03:49.980> when<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.250> squeeze<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.760> brush

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the bristles when you squeeze the brush

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.660 
the bristles when you squeeze the brush
the<00:03:51.780> bristles<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.380> little<00:03:52.620> bit<00:03:52.770> corralled<00:03:53.310> this

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
the bristles a little bit corralled this

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.580 
the bristles a little bit corralled this
way<00:03:53.910> becomes<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.570> little<00:03:54.690> stiffer<00:03:55.050> at<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> end

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
way becomes a little stiffer at the end

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.460 
way becomes a little stiffer at the end
allows<00:03:56.460> you<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.760> move<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.210> varnish<00:03:57.630> better<00:03:57.930> it

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
allows you to move the varnish better it

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.230 
allows you to move the varnish better it
also<00:03:58.500> makes<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.790> varnish

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
also makes it so that the varnish

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.720 
also makes it so that the varnish
doesn't<00:04:00.630> creep<00:04:01.020> up<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.380> bristles<00:04:02.190> quite<00:04:02.490> so

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
doesn't creep up the bristles quite so

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.840 
doesn't creep up the bristles quite so
fast<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:03.750> high<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.380> get<00:04:05.010> involved<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.700> the

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
fast and so high and get involved in the

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.120 
fast and so high and get involved in the
heel<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.900> when<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.140> strip<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.650> tape<00:04:07.890> off

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
heel so that when you strip the tape off

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.430 
heel so that when you strip the tape off
afterwards<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:09.240> easier<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.960> clean<00:04:10.230> the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
afterwards it's easier to clean the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.230 
afterwards it's easier to clean the
brush<00:04:10.590> out<00:04:10.890> and<00:04:11.130> mineral<00:04:11.490> spirits<00:04:11.640> and<00:04:12.060> it

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
brush out and mineral spirits and it

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.480 
brush out and mineral spirits and it
would<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:12.870> you<00:04:13.320> hadn't<00:04:13.740> boxed<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.280> like

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
would be if you hadn't boxed it like

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.220 
would be if you hadn't boxed it like
this<00:04:14.700> with<00:04:14.910> this<00:04:15.090> tape<00:04:15.390> all<00:04:15.750> right<00:04:15.900> I'm<00:04:16.020> just

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
this with this tape all right I'm just

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.620 
this with this tape all right I'm just
about<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.590> start<00:04:16.950> applying<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.609> varnish<00:04:17.790> and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
about to start applying the varnish and

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.660 
about to start applying the varnish and
I've<00:04:19.230> talked<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.680> over<00:04:20.040> quite<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.280> bit<00:04:20.520> with

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
I've talked this over quite a bit with

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.880 
I've talked this over quite a bit with
Kenneth<00:04:21.060> about<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> procedure<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.470> this

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
Kenneth about a procedure because this

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.590 
Kenneth about a procedure because this
is<00:04:23.040> quite<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> complicated<00:04:23.700> little<00:04:24.270> thing<00:04:24.480> to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
is quite a complicated little thing to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.480 
is quite a complicated little thing to
varnish<00:04:24.990> actually<00:04:25.500> here<00:04:25.680> there's<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:25.980> lot<00:04:26.310> of

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
varnish actually here there's a lot of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.490 
varnish actually here there's a lot of
surfaces<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.330> edges<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:27.960> different<00:04:28.260> things

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
surfaces and edges and different things

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.980 
surfaces and edges and different things
to<00:04:28.770> get<00:04:29.370> around<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.390> just<00:04:30.570> wouldn't<00:04:30.810> want

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
to get around and you just wouldn't want

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.230 
to get around and you just wouldn't want
to<00:04:31.050> start<00:04:31.470> off<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.040> varnish<00:04:32.490> say<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.910> gunnel

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
to start off and varnish say the gunnel

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.060 
to start off and varnish say the gunnel
first<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.780> after<00:04:34.050> lean<00:04:34.230> over<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:34.890> there<00:04:35.040> is

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
first and after lean over it so there is

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.700 
first and after lean over it so there is
a<00:04:35.190> procedure<00:04:35.760> so<00:04:36.060> Kenneth<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:36.690> now<00:04:36.900> applying

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
a procedure so Kenneth is now applying

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.370 
a procedure so Kenneth is now applying
the<00:04:38.040> varnish<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.640> he's<00:04:39.120> starting<00:04:39.630> just<00:04:39.900> under

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the varnish and he's starting just under

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.340 
the varnish and he's starting just under
the<00:04:40.500> gunnel<00:04:40.920> not<00:04:41.460> where<00:04:42.270> he'd<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:42.690> involved

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the gunnel not where he'd get involved

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.840 
the gunnel not where he'd get involved
in<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.620> with<00:04:43.770> his<00:04:43.920> shirt<00:04:44.190> or<00:04:44.370> anything<00:04:44.460> like

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
in it with his shirt or anything like

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.420 
in it with his shirt or anything like
that<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.270> he's<00:04:45.360> doing<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:46.320> bay<00:04:46.650> between<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
that and he's doing one bay between the

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.690 
that and he's doing one bay between the
frames<00:04:47.730> and<00:04:48.240> then<00:04:48.780> one<00:04:49.170> frame

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
frames and then one frame

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.450 
frames and then one frame
and<00:04:50.850> making<00:04:51.690> sure<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:52.110> we<00:04:52.260> don't<00:04:52.530> have<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:53.010> lot

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
and making sure that we don't have a lot

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.000 
and making sure that we don't have a lot
of<00:04:53.760> extra<00:04:54.300> varnish<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.930> run<00:04:55.260> out<00:04:55.470> under<00:04:55.890> the

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
of extra varnish to run out under the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.770 
of extra varnish to run out under the
seat<00:04:56.220> riser<00:04:56.490> then<00:04:56.790> he'll<00:04:56.970> pick<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.240> on<00:04:57.600> it

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
seat riser then he'll pick up on it

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.680 
seat riser then he'll pick up on it
under<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.560> seat<00:04:58.830> riser<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.460> continue<00:05:00.420> down

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
under the seat riser and continue down

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.290 
under the seat riser and continue down
to<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.530> keel<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.980> we're<00:05:02.130> going<00:05:02.760> to<00:05:02.880> do<00:05:03.060> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
to the keel and we're going to do the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.500 
to the keel and we're going to do the
entire<00:05:03.780> side<00:05:04.410> first<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.370> then<00:05:05.460> switch<00:05:06.360> over

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
entire side first and then switch over

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.450 
entire side first and then switch over
to<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.900> other<00:05:07.020> side<00:05:07.320> we've<00:05:07.620> decided<00:05:08.040> that<00:05:08.340> we

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
to the other side we've decided that we

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.790 
to the other side we've decided that we
do<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> whole<00:05:09.030> interior<00:05:09.420> of<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> boat<00:05:10.170> then

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
do the whole interior of the boat then

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.280 
do the whole interior of the boat then
come<00:05:11.100> around<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.700> work<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.600> transom<00:05:13.140> and

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
come around and work on the transom and

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.160 
come around and work on the transom and
do<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.040> gunnels<00:05:14.460> last<00:05:14.820> as<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.870> see<00:05:16.020> the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
do the gunnels last as you can see the

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.350 
do the gunnels last as you can see the
way<00:05:16.290> he's<00:05:16.440> applying<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.160> varnish<00:05:17.670> first<00:05:18.120> off

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
way he's applying this varnish first off

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.240 
way he's applying this varnish first off
he's<00:05:18.570> picking<00:05:19.020> up<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:19.200> right<00:05:19.560> amount<00:05:19.950> and<00:05:20.130> the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
he's picking up the right amount and the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.460 
he's picking up the right amount and the
anticipated<00:05:20.940> amount<00:05:21.420> each<00:05:21.660> time<00:05:21.690> on<00:05:22.350> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
anticipated amount each time on the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.800 
anticipated amount each time on the
brush<00:05:22.740> when<00:05:23.040> he<00:05:23.130> goes<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.670> pot<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.660> he's

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
brush when he goes to the pot so he's

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.930 
brush when he goes to the pot so he's
simply<00:05:25.110> dabbing<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.160> side<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.430> the<00:05:26.700> pot

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
simply dabbing it on the side of the pot

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.790 
simply dabbing it on the side of the pot
so<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.570> knocks<00:05:27.840> off<00:05:28.170> a<00:05:28.290> little<00:05:28.530> bit<00:05:28.710> of

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
so that it knocks off a little bit of

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.590 
so that it knocks off a little bit of
the<00:05:28.890> varnish<00:05:29.250> without<00:05:29.550> wiping<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.180> all<00:05:30.360> off

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
the varnish without wiping it all off

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.540 
the varnish without wiping it all off
the<00:05:30.780> brush<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.590> then<00:05:31.680> he's<00:05:31.860> dabbing<00:05:32.400> it

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
the brush and then he's dabbing it

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.490 
the brush and then he's dabbing it
around<00:05:32.880> in<00:05:33.150> different<00:05:33.540> spots<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:34.260> but<00:05:34.440> he

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
around in different spots so but he

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.280 
around in different spots so but he
doesn't<00:05:34.890> dump<00:05:35.220> all<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:36.270> varnish<00:05:36.750> off<00:05:36.990> the

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
doesn't dump all the varnish off the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.950 
doesn't dump all the varnish off the
brush<00:05:37.560> in<00:05:37.770> one<00:05:38.010> spot<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.790> then<00:05:38.850> have<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.540> move

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
brush in one spot and then have to move

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.650 
brush in one spot and then have to move
it<00:05:40.230> around<00:05:40.350> he's<00:05:41.220> actually<00:05:41.520> distributed<00:05:42.480> it<00:05:42.570> a

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
it around he's actually distributed it a

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.930 
it around he's actually distributed it a
little<00:05:42.840> bit<00:05:43.110> and<00:05:43.320> then<00:05:43.530> move<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:43.980> around<00:05:44.070> makes

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
little bit and then move it around makes

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.030 
little bit and then move it around makes
it<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.120> lot<00:05:45.270> easier<00:05:45.720> and<00:05:45.810> go<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.110> lot<00:05:46.410> faster<00:05:47.010> now

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
it a lot easier and go a lot faster now

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.760 
it a lot easier and go a lot faster now
the<00:05:47.940> varnish<00:05:48.390> is<00:05:48.540> like<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:48.960> say<00:05:49.170> it's<00:05:49.350> fairly

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770

also you know a feel for it because you

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.660 
also you know a feel for it because you
have<00:06:23.990> to<00:06:24.170> understand<00:06:24.800> how<00:06:25.040> much<00:06:25.250> varnish

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:25.670

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
much area it's going to cover so that

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.600

inboard side of the transom here and

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.469 
inboard side of the transom here and
it's<00:06:56.930> looking<00:06:57.259> fantastic<00:06:57.580> this<00:06:58.580> is<00:06:58.879> the<00:06:59.119> first

the<00:07:01.999> sealer<00:07:02.330> it's<00:07:02.899> probably<00:07:03.379> ultimately

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:03.589 
the sealer it's probably ultimately

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.159 
the sealer it's probably ultimately
going<00:07:04.219> to<00:07:04.279> get<00:07:04.430> three<00:07:04.759> more<00:07:05.029> coats<00:07:05.389> over<00:07:05.689> this
