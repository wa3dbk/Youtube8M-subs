10 thing you do that on Pocket Edition

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.510 
10 thing you do that on Pocket Edition
but<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> slightly<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:04.710> here<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.399> have

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but it's slightly from here you do have

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
but it's slightly from here you do have
more<00:02:05.850> slots<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.390> hotbar<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.229> the

cool<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.490> for<00:02:35.670> me<00:02:35.730> though<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.210> fact<00:02:36.240> that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
cool one for me though is the fact that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.360 
cool one for me though is the fact that
if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.870> already<00:02:37.080> own<00:02:37.230> minecraft<00:02:37.620> from<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> pc

if you already own minecraft from the pc

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.160 
if you already own minecraft from the pc
a<00:02:38.490> separate<00:02:39.030> game<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.360> minecraft<00:02:39.720> Windows<00:02:39.960> 10

to switch because the second screen shot

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.670 
to switch because the second screen shot
shows<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.510> exactly<00:04:51.720> how<00:04:52.380> it's<00:04:52.500> gonna<00:04:52.590> work

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
that you swap jump and stick and then

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.270 
that you swap jump and stick and then
you<00:04:54.450> can<00:04:54.840> switch<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.470> do<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.800> so<00:04:55.950> if

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
you can switch it and do that so if

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.530 
you can switch it and do that so if
you're<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> politician<00:04:56.640> player<00:04:57.030> don't<00:04:57.330> worry

you're a politician player don't worry
that's<00:04:57.780> all<00:04:58.020> gonna<00:04:58.140> be<00:04:58.320> changed<00:04:58.680> and<00:04:58.890> fixed

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
that's all gonna be changed and fixed

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.320 
that's all gonna be changed and fixed

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and stuff it's just kind of a big deal

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.630 
and stuff it's just kind of a big deal
so<00:05:00.870> yeah<00:05:01.080> there<00:05:01.290> is<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.440> we<00:05:01.800> also<00:05:02.070> have<00:05:02.460> an

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
so yeah there is that we also have an

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.250 
so yeah there is that we also have an
image<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.270> enchantment<00:05:03.780> table<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.170> he's

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
image of the enchantment table and he's

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.990 
image of the enchantment table and he's
like<00:05:04.470> accidental<00:05:05.100> glitch<00:05:05.280> oh<00:05:05.490> no<00:05:05.700> it's<00:05:05.880> a

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
like accidental glitch oh no it's a

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.550 
like accidental glitch oh no it's a
feature<00:05:06.180> now<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.750> so<00:05:07.020> what<00:05:07.170> we<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.410> now

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
feature now and that so what we have now

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.590 
feature now and that so what we have now
so<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:08.310> looks<00:05:08.550> like<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.910> Pocket<00:05:09.150> Edition<00:05:09.210> also

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
so it looks like the Pocket Edition also

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.510
