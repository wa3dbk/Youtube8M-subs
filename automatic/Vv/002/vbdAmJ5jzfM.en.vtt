I<00:00:10.969> did<00:00:11.969> do<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> video<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.690> how<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.320> install<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I did do a video on how to install it

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.000 
I did do a video on how to install it
from<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.730> bootable<00:00:14.940> USB<00:00:15.650> but<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
from a bootable USB but this is a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.510 
from a bootable USB but this is a
slightly<00:00:17.550> different<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:19.140> if<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.279> going

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
slightly different so if you are going

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.830 
slightly different so if you are going
to<00:00:20.609> install<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.180> external<00:00:21.480> hard<00:00:21.779> drive

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

to install it as an external hard drive
what<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> suggest<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:22.980> having<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.430> blank

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

partitions on as monitors on it because

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.160 
partitions on as monitors on it because
it<00:00:28.410> seems<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.800> run<00:00:28.949> into<00:00:29.779> different<00:00:30.779> issues

like I said leave it on allocators if
you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.040> make<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.489> very<00:00:41.520> easy<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
you can it can make it very easy to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.970

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.160 

might<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.290> kinda<00:01:11.280> slow<00:01:11.540> because<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.729> USB

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
might be kinda slow because of the USB

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.260 
might be kinda slow because of the USB
so<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> first<00:01:16.470> option<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> pick<00:01:17.159> your

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
so the first option is to pick your

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.649 
so the first option is to pick your
language<00:01:19.369> then<00:01:20.369> it'll<00:01:20.640> ask<00:01:20.729> if<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
language then it'll ask if you want to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.469 
language then it'll ask if you want to
make<00:01:22.530> sure<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:22.950> plugged<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.460> amount<00:01:24.330> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
make sure it's all plugged in amount of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.679 
make sure it's all plugged in amount of
space<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> need<00:01:26.210> let's<00:01:27.210> say<00:01:27.299> continue<00:01:29.689> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
space you need let's say continue this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.929 
space you need let's say continue this
is<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> important<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.369> happen

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
is the important bit here if you happen

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.710 
is the important bit here if you happen
to<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:34.820> partition<00:01:35.820> mounted<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.509> your

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
to have a partition mounted on your

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.090 
to have a partition mounted on your
stone<00:01:36.960> heart<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.799> something

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
stone heart or when you have something

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.730 
stone heart or when you have something
on<00:01:38.340> us<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.329> might<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.659> better<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:39.960> backing<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
on us you might be better off backing it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
on us you might be better off backing it
up<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:41.939> computer<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.720> somewhere<00:01:43.049> else

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
up to your computer or somewhere else

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.560 
up to your computer or somewhere else
before<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.009> start<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:46.430> if<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.790> it's

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
before you start this and if not it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
given me the option to unmount us and if

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
given me the option to unmount us and if
I<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.149> yes<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.720> conscious<00:01:52.259> delete

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I say yes it's conscious delete

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
I say yes it's conscious delete
everything<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:52.979> my<00:01:53.100> hard<00:01:53.310> drive<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:53.729> not

going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.659> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.869> say<00:01:55.049> no

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.200 

and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.430> have<00:02:03.550> these<00:02:03.700> options<00:02:03.880> to

unallocated hour drive you could if you

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.909 
unallocated hour drive you could if you

partitions as primary if you like it's

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.550 
partitions as primary if you like it's
just<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.840> you're<00:05:24.960> only<00:05:25.080> allowed<00:05:25.350> to<00:05:25.410> have

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
just that you're only allowed to have

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.249 
just that you're only allowed to have
four<00:05:26.039> primary<00:05:26.520> partitions<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.389> any<00:05:27.990> hard

four primary partitions on any hard

four primary partitions on any hard
drive<00:05:28.639> but<00:05:29.639> you<00:05:29.820> can<00:05:30.030> have<00:05:30.210> lots<00:05:30.419> of<00:05:30.539> logical

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
drive but you can have lots of logical

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.330 
drive but you can have lots of logical
partitions<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.509> so<00:05:34.050> that's<00:05:34.620> why<00:05:34.979> some<00:05:35.310> of

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
partitions on it so that's why some of

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.670 
partitions on it so that's why some of
them<00:05:35.520> are<00:05:35.610> logical<00:05:36.419> bush<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:37.260> booth<00:05:37.440> is

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
them are logical bush the booth is

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.740 
them are logical bush the booth is
probably<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.280> most<00:05:38.400> important<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.510> has

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
probably the most important that it has

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.300 
probably the most important that it has
to<00:05:39.930> be<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:41.960> primary<00:05:42.960> partition<00:05:43.590> or<00:05:43.800> one

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
to be on a primary partition or one

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.110 
to be on a primary partition or one
pools<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.669> Prayer

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
pools of Prayer

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.379

so<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.889> the<00:05:46.889> next<00:05:47.100> bit<00:05:47.250> now<00:05:47.430> this<00:05:48.000> is<00:05:48.150> another

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
so and the next bit now this is another

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.900 
so and the next bit now this is another
important<00:05:49.080> piece<00:05:49.199> as<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:50.190> can<00:05:50.430> see<00:05:50.580> this<00:05:50.760> is

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
important piece as you can see this is

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.620 
important piece as you can see this is
my<00:05:51.030> booth<00:05:51.240> s<00:05:51.660> db2<00:05:52.440> so<00:05:53.190> I<00:05:53.490> want<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:53.940> make<00:05:54.120> sure<00:05:54.330> is

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
my booth s db2 so I want to make sure is

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.540 
my booth s db2 so I want to make sure is
that<00:05:55.610> this<00:05:56.610> here<00:05:57.180> as<00:05:57.690> you<00:05:57.900> can<00:05:58.020> see<00:05:58.199> I<00:05:58.440> want<00:05:59.430> to

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
that this here as you can see I want to

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.100 
that this here as you can see I want to
make<00:05:59.639> sure<00:05:59.759> I<00:05:59.880> don't<00:06:00.000> install<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.750> anywhere

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
make sure I don't install it anywhere

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.650 
make sure I don't install it anywhere
only<00:06:01.650> on<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.070> my<00:06:02.250> booth<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:03.030> I'm<00:06:03.360> going<00:06:03.599> to

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
only on to my booth so I'm going to

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.580 
only on to my booth so I'm going to
scroll<00:06:04.259> down<00:06:04.320> here<00:06:04.560> until<00:06:05.190> I<00:06:05.310> get<00:06:05.370> my<00:06:05.639> SDP<00:06:06.240> to

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
scroll down here until I get my SDP to

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.930 
scroll down here until I get my SDP to
and<00:06:07.590> choose<00:06:07.830> that<00:06:08.099> make<00:06:08.400> sure<00:06:08.580> you<00:06:08.699> change

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
and choose that make sure you change

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.279 
and choose that make sure you change
that<00:06:10.340> and<00:06:11.419> so<00:06:12.419> it<00:06:12.479> doesn't<00:06:12.750> install<00:06:12.990> it<00:06:13.169> on

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
that and so it doesn't install it on

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.370 
that and so it doesn't install it on
your<00:06:13.470> internal<00:06:13.770> hard<00:06:14.010> drive<00:06:14.270> once

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
your internal hard drive once

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.700 
your internal hard drive once
everything's<00:06:16.380> good<00:06:17.130> to<00:06:17.220> go<00:06:17.400> and<00:06:18.470> just<00:06:19.470> click

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
everything's good to go and just click

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.960 
everything's good to go and just click
it<00:06:19.889> install<00:06:20.280> now<00:06:22.340> now<00:06:23.340> I'll<00:06:23.460> probably<00:06:23.669> get<00:06:23.909> a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
it install now now I'll probably get a

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.920 
it install now now I'll probably get a
