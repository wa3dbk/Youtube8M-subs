00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.640
[MIDI music]

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.980
[typing]

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.200
There was a short time from 2001 to 2004 or so

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080
that I didn't own a decent desktop PC.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.860
I had a piece of crap Compaq Presario 5000US

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.640
with those stupid, swappable color faceplates

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.100
that were trying to cash in on the current craze
of multicolored iMacs and cell phone faceplates.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.160
With an 8 MB TNT2 video card

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.640
and 700 MHz Duron CPU,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.480
there wasn't much gaming to be had.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.640
But still, it was a working computer

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.840
and I would rather have that than nothing.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.840
So programs like Real Arcade were awesome,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.040
simply because there were tons of new games to play

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.300
that weren't hard to run and
were only a few megabytes at most.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.620
One of those was Lawn Mower,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.440
released in 2001 by Terminal Studio.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.400
It was developed by a small
Russian team based in Moscow,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.140
with lead design by Egor Dioukarev.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.380
Now the weird thing is there are few activities

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.660
that I hate more than mowing lawns.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.080
It can be fun if it's cool out and
you have a fast riding mower,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.600
but when you have to use a push mower
during a midsummer Piedmont heat wave,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.880
there's nothing even remotely fun about it.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
But somehow, Lawn Mower
appealed to me as soon as I saw it.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.300
Maybe it was because there really aren't
too many lawn mower games, period.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
Maybe it was the game's
description from the developers,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.280
which I can't help but imagine
being read by an ex-KGB officer.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.040
They are?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.740
Well, dang! Those freakin' angry enemies
of this unusual arcade will surely be wared!

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.040
Lawn Mower is shareware

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.860
and is pretty much full-featured as-is,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.040
but if you paid something like $15,
you got access to all 50 levels

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.140
and a password feature to let
you continue where you left off.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.520
Once you start it up from the launcher window,

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.540
you're greeted with the main menu.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.800
The main menu itself is in itself a menu, mainly.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.820
And it's got some cheery music

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.440
which sets you up for the cheery and
relaxing tone of the rest of the game.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.020
The main thing you'll wanna
check here is the help screen,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.500
which provides an outline of
the bizarre pickups and enemies

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.320
that "are" stole your fuel.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.060
Start the game and the grand grass
gradation gets going immediately.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.220
The controls are about as simple as you can get.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.160
Move left, right, or forward.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.720
Your mower doesn't stop
unless it hits an obstacle head-on,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960
so pressing forward makes it go faster.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780
The goal is to mow the lawn.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.120
And... that's it!

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.540
Make sure you hit 100% and it's on to the next level.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.300
Yeah, at one point, you're told to
make sure the lawn is cut nice and neat,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.560
but it doesn't matter if it looks like
it was cut by Helen Keller on PCP,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.560
as long as you reach that percentage.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.640
Along the way, you'll come across
some truly strange enemies and pickups,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.700
and if you don't read the help screen,
you're really not able to tell what's what.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.300
I mean, why do chairs and toilets give you points,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.780
but cowboy boots take your life?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.820
Are cowboy boots a natural enemy of Russians

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.040
and toilets some kind of after-
dinner snack I'm not aware of?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.180
Yeah, lots of stuff here is really
weird when you think about it.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.740
Like, bananas... are bad

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.620
because they stop you from being able to mow,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.940
yet Coke cans are good
because they give you points.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.740
Yeah, stupid fruit!

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.880
Gimme the caustic sugar water instead.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.300
Then there's this blue pencil-looking
thing that enlarges your blades

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.840
so you can cut wider paths.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.280
Why this frick is it a blue pencil thing?

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.400
Why not, oh I don't know, a BLADE?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
And this is one of those games that really
tests my obsessive-compulsive tendencies

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.600
since you can never actually mow 100% of the grass,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.000
even though it says you do.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.920
It's more like 94, 95%

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.720
as you'll always have little patches left over.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.060
Especially annoying to me are those corners. Ugh!

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.080
You cannot physically get in there to cut them,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.820
so you end up with a yard with rounded corners.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.500
Ew, I can hear Apple's lawsuit glands salivating already.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.780
And that's really it for Lawn Mower.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.300
You either get hit by enemies that
"are stole your fuel" enough times,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.980
or run out of fuel on your own and it's game over.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.880
Enter a high score, play again.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.520
There is also a two-player mode,
but it's exactly the same as single-player,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.580
except that you're competing for
points and amount of grass mowed.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.680
Oddly, it doesn't keep track of how many
toilets and beer bottles you ingest,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.340
like any good Russian game should, if you ask me.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.860
But I can forgive such shortcomings

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.480
because Lawn Mower is relaxing as heck.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.040
You just wander around,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.740
cutting circles into the grass,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.340
avoiding the occasional
unrecognizable, twisted enemy thing.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.840
And try to ignore the OCD klaxons going off in your brain

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.440
due to all the uneven sections of grass that are left.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.960
The music is happy, the controls are easy,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.060
and the objective couldn't be simpler.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.420
Lawn Mower is one of those games

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.740
that really takes me back to a simpler time

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.220
where even if you had a piece of junk machine

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.840
and a lame 28K dial-up connection,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.880
you could still download some fun if you looked for it.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.360
Even if it "are" stole your fuel.
