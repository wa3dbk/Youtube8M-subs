00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.400
 good evening women 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.570
 German silver 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.490
 because they were 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.190
 so obviously artificial lighting 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.299
 I have just returned to my ass 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.019
 a few minutes book to do in this mine 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.019
 then that like me you read from the title 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.419
 convert from dream 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.639
 rdu purchases cetaceans plot more than anything the stroke 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.880
 then polti moment noticed that 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.499
 and many people 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.949
 they write to each other 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.839
 I don't speak for my channel but from what I have 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:31.930
 can you too 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 to another party. of death part 2 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.890
 that is, in practice many girls 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 I'm still in general 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.950
 they took this ugly 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 habit 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.510
 which I really find 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.370
 something funny 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.150
 unsubscribe and channels 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.080
 and key id letters m 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.750
 as an enclosure 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.400
 the fact of saying 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.740
 registered spare parts 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.520
 people who have not returned eccentricity then this thing me 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.610
 it's happening very often 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.539
 rn 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.420
 for those who subscribe to my local channel 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 usually when I saw mystic flautist 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 field art letters of the person in question 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.080
 it happened to me very often to receive with 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.050
 answer thanks then I saw that you are not there 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.050
 written great battle tank sign up 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.140
 I hope many of you 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.450
 or at least those who have registered have seen that there is in my channel 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.010
 explicitly written 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.210
 that anyone who will write you a lunch because we are entitled to whom I spare 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 in the fourth channel 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620
 then this is because it is for you personally 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.940
 since I signed up on youtube in general 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.870
 if I never have names I personally never write a channel 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.320
 because what a show 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 imperial I expected someone 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 the person to whom I am registered 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.480
 but I did it because 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.569
 the person 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.870
 it's perfect 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.320
 my nice 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.400
 I found his videos rambo 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.679
 &amp; original amp or 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.859
 in short, it was about things that are of interest, so I'm never allowed to 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.599
 write to a plus channel 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.209
 from the one who had a subscriber to the one who had the centomiglia 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.279
 subscribe 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:25.279
 the keygen of change because why 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.819
 for a personal matter 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.869
 the end obviously I noticed that 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 better intimate do not write me nomis 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.239
 to the channels of these on the staff of course the communication comes 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.389
 canceled then I tell him 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.199
 writing member because you want 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.650
 straight that has changed 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.870
 and therefore you are not interested in what I say of what in 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.870
 face in video cyclicality this thing irritates me somewhat 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.220
 for cake 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.019
 someone joins my channel 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.720
 I want you to write why 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.310
 wilson nice because he likes what he says nico incas what 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 I say 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.409
 I am interested in what I say cyclicality not because it expects to kill you ricambi 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.760
 this thing is helping me in an incredible way 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.169
 I'm not here to have 10 not registered to dial 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.489
 order you believe with youtube partners or search recipes to get me dpr 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 this thing really makes me 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.599
 attack noted that many people who enrolled 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:26.269
 what does it mean 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.239
 write spare parts c3 quotes 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.289
 maremmano on the canakkale 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:31.079
 they do not have 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.499
 not even a video 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:33.589
 posted 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:36.299
 or to have no favorites is enough for you 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.569
 or milvio bridge absolutely as far as I am concerned 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.569
 to which not to write mail but why not too much 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.739
 and yet I don't know in thousandths of the first discs are the type of diploma 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.330
 for some partners 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.330
 so fake green antimo made a video this thing me 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:58.659
 really on my nerves so I sincerely hope that with this video yes 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.099
 conclude this story 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.329
 to write 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.709
 webcam winners but I'm not going to change to miss 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.319
 also not actually interested in the channel 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.729
 ah so hopefully 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.339
 please ask me please 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.349
 whoever writes h my channel you have to do it 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.759
 only because the person concerned is not because it is 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.599
 repent something in return 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.570
 with this everywhere use 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.939
 once i do 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:25.909
 a video 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 silvio because it is my channel does not want to be nothing d 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.749
 i like d use he jo on annoying 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.140
 unicredit anticipates research 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.140
 but this is really becoming an issue 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.710
 in my opinion 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.029
 now in jpg 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.050
 reality tour 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.800
 anyone who writes with channels alone has coupons in exchange for registration 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.389
 register ctu moto what to you 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.500
 rather I prefer to stay with you 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.249
 written maffucci hereke 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.349
 they really appreciate what I do. on what to have in my writing 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.759
 and be a goat because in the end 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:03.880
 you're a goat 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.310
 because in the end they follow you and just a small one because you have 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.310
 a school of jenna shea of ​​people who follow you but 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.419
 so it doesn't calculate you no part only description I don't look at you 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:15.249
 now 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.249
 because nobody cares what you say 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.900
 and just enough to have 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.139
 so I conclude 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.110
 I greet you all 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.190

 binetti because some want me for all they don't really want real - 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.309

 I subscribe to the other taxtel to the others I also say to cancel my written her 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.759
