 Yohanan Diaz Neil Armstrong the first 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.040
 man in stepping on the moon the hero 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.469
 national in usa as well as his family 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.960
 they were threatened with death so that 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.120
 keep the information secret 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.090
 he had about aliens and their 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.740
 ships that I had seen on the moon a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 strong statement published in the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.180
 digital newspaper examiner dotcom days 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 after the recognized one passed away 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.760
 astronaut what was this great 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.669
 secret that during the moon landing in the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.390
 mission of apollo 11 on July 20, 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 1969 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.219
 armstrong and buzz aldrin had seen two 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 large UFOs and their crew that 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.989
 they watched from a nearby crater and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 it is even affirmed that of that event there is 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.489
 photographs that went with time 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.680
 shown of the military and that from 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.829
 then never made knowledge 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.870
 public an event that would change 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.969
 the life of amstrong so also according to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.350
 affirms his determination to the eventual 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.260
 abandonment of lunar missions 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.199
 manned and their reluctance to speak of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 your experience on the moon during this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.780
 mission there are two minutes of silence that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 according to the nasa 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.440
 the problem was overheating 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 who suffered one of the two cameras 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.090
 television which caused him to stop 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 transmit but in counterpart what 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 it really happened at that time and that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.960
 the transmission that was made was captured 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.050
 of the apollon be nasa located in houston 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 texas by radio amateurs that was that 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.030
 someone else accompanied them on their mission 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.680
 certainly the heart rate of both 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.680
 astronauts increased 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 but no more 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 that's why 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 ah 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.310
 the house is everything 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.770
 this fact would be reinforced in 1975 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.530
 when the former massa engineer in the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.830
 communication area mauris catalan 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.540
 he published his book our ancestors 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.670
 cosmic where he talks about several 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
 photographs of that incident that had 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 been published in a magazine that according to 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.180
 all this had happened before 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.060
 Armstrong will go down the stairs to put 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.920
 a foot on the moon however the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.010
 researchers of this topic refer to 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.110
 that on July 20 , 1994 at an event 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.350
 celebrated in the white house by 25 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.850
 Anniversary of the landing of Apollo 11 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.480
 while sampson contained the tears 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.430
 remembering the event along with your two 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.590
 mission partners who had layers 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.810
 protectors of the truth where 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 I would find more information 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.760
 statements made to the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.680
 America's best students up 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 where you know this was the only 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.870
 occasion when this national hero did 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.180
 reference in a very vague way to this 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.860
 business twenty years later the second 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.049
 man in stepping on the moon voice 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.920
 aldrin would confirm in an interview in 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.720
 the channel sign 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.090
 chanel that a flying object does not 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.099
 identified had followed them but that 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.650
 they had decided not to report anything 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:20.960
 fear of being ordered to abort the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.710
 ribas mission 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.710
 flora 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:47.090
 what we were the business examiner.com 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.620
 public than the original source of the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.180
 news of the death threat the 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.969
 first man to step on the moon had 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.709
 been by members of the family and 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.510
 close friends of amstrong who had 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.870
 informed the director of the disclosure 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.669
 project doctor steven griner news 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.859
 that ran like gunpowder days after 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.620
 who died on August 25 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.230
 Neil Armstrong at 82 years of age by 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.510
 heart failure what we should not 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.150
 forget are those two minutes of silence 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.820
 who make the difference between 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 truth and concealment in reality ni 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.229
 he showed it was threatened with death to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.110
 that did not say everything I knew about 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.660
 extraterrestrial what it owes us of 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:31.360
 to be very clear is that neither was he a 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.360
 patriot until the end of his days 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.760
 or not
