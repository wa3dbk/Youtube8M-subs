00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:07.779
 good afternoon we are no one expects this 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.789
 thing we are designing a circuit of the 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.809
 control to return to generate passage to 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:17.289
 step the stepper motor is an engine 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.519
 bipolar as we can see it has 44 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.519
 entries in four cables 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:53.320
 this is on the way 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.880
 Now we can see that the source is going to 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.190
 connect in a variable source of 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:02.350
 1.2 buns to the 15 votes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.350
 we put in the negative 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.660
 and device 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.710
 now we start to vary our people 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.080
 now we have four push buttons this the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.040
 first thinker will not ignore the ignition 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.740
 the motor 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.159
 as well as the pay is on the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.380
 processors the engine turn 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.390
 the last two buttons and is to increase 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 and decrease speeds 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 for this we have used a peak 18 f 45 50 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.680
 that we have used 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 always being 93 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.340
 which is an integrator that contains 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.320
 two we could use the engines 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.610
 we use half of the 20 Â° and here we 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.610
 let's just a count h 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:08.649
 the operation feels we oppress the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.990
 first push button as we can see 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:16.760
 the turning of the motor takes you to a sense 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.760
 and we reverse the motor rotation 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.609
 my duty 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.860
 we see how he took them for the other 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.860
 side as 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.200
 now we will go to increase 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.200
 at speed 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.610
 20 wind 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.610
 also as here menstruation 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.480
 we see how the LEDs indicate the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.480
 speed style
