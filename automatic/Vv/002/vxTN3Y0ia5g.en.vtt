frontside disastrous unqualified that's

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.030 
frontside disastrous unqualified that's
a<00:00:28.470> disaster<00:00:28.770> you<00:00:29.760> don't<00:00:29.790> want<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.060> ollie<00:00:31.040> down

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
a disaster you don't want to ollie down

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.690 
a disaster you don't want to ollie down
up<00:00:32.190> the<00:00:32.310> ramp

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
up the ramp

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.240 
up the ramp
all<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:34.830> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.070> bit

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
all right about here go a little bit

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.660 
all right about here go a little bit
above<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.930> snap<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> down<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.130> learn<00:00:38.460> them

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
above it snap it down you can learn them

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.810 
above it snap it down you can learn them
by<00:00:38.790> putting<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.390> wheels<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:40.700> which<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
by putting your back wheels on which I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.320 
by putting your back wheels on which I
recommend<00:00:42.290> but<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.380> can<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:44.670> that's<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
recommend but you can and that's a

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.370 
recommend but you can and that's a
little<00:00:45.510> bit<00:00:45.630> easier<00:00:45.720> to<00:00:45.930> learn<00:00:46.140> them<00:00:46.260> because

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
little bit easier to learn them because

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.200 
little bit easier to learn them because
you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> sit<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:46.980> them<00:00:47.130> for<00:00:47.190> longer<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.090> then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you can sit on them for longer and then

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.090 
you can sit on them for longer and then
get<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.630> of<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.900> more<00:00:49.650> time<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.040> come<00:00:50.220> in<00:00:50.750> so

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
get more of a more time to come in so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.650 
get more of a more time to come in so
that's<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.250> they<00:00:53.460> ride<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> out<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.120> right

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that's all they ride it out here right

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.280 
that's all they ride it out here right
there<00:00:54.870> put<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> top<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.199> you're

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
there put it out the top and then you're

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.110 
there put it out the top and then you're
going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.710> make<00:00:58.860> sure<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.370> push<00:00:59.820> down

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to want to make sure to push down

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
going to want to make sure to push down
enough<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.379> wheels<00:01:01.530> back<00:01:01.830> let's<00:01:02.309> get

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
enough see your wheels back let's get

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.490 
enough see your wheels back let's get
right<00:01:02.610> over<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> coping<00:01:06.409> that's<00:01:07.409> bad

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.249 

boom<00:01:15.729> on<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:17.030> make<00:01:17.509> sure<00:01:17.689> your<00:01:17.840> front<00:01:18.020> wheels

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
boom on it make sure your front wheels

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.580 
boom on it make sure your front wheels
go<00:01:18.680> over<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.100> top<00:01:20.049> and<00:01:21.049> that's<00:01:21.200> why<00:01:21.439> we

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
go over the top and that's why we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.820 
go over the top and that's why we
learned<00:01:21.770> switch<00:01:22.009> rocks

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:36.710 

and<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.640> why<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.970> learn<00:01:30.090> switch<00:01:30.360> rocks<00:01:35.720> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
and that's why we learn switch rocks and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
and that's why we learn switch rocks and
then<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:45.150> then<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:46.010> start<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.100> learn

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
then you and then you start to learn

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.530 
then you and then you start to learn
masters

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.250 

all<00:01:59.540> right<00:01:59.720> so<00:01:59.960> one<00:02:00.140> Keuka<00:02:00.500> stalls<00:02:00.800> down<00:02:01.070> on

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
all right so one Keuka stalls down on

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.810 
all right so one Keuka stalls down on
quarter<00:02:03.260> pipes<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.160> can<00:02:04.220> learn<00:02:04.430> how<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.580> do

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
quarter pipes you can learn how to do

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.520 
quarter pipes you can learn how to do
frontside<00:02:05.150> like<00:02:05.750> lift<00:02:05.960> slides<00:02:06.170> across<00:02:06.290> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
frontside like lift slides across the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.410 
frontside like lift slides across the
court<00:02:06.740> if<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.390> slide<00:02:08.390> them<00:02:09.490> go<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.550> revert<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.300> it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
court if I slide them go to revert do it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:21.670 
court if I slide them go to revert do it
ever<00:02:11.740> lots<00:02:12.740> of<00:02:12.920> variations

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.289 

when<00:02:22.370> you're<00:02:22.489> learning<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.849> trick<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.209> want

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
when you're learning the trick you want

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.699 
when you're learning the trick you want
to<00:02:23.420> start<00:02:23.629> small<00:02:23.870> at<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.079> frontside<00:02:24.379> Ollie's

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
to start small at the frontside Ollie's

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.309 
to start small at the frontside Ollie's
and<00:02:24.980> then<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.180> go<00:02:26.299> bigger<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.870> higher

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
and then you can go bigger like higher

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.649 
and then you can go bigger like higher
and<00:02:27.560> higher<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:28.010> then<00:02:28.519> once<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:29.209> start<00:02:29.480> all

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
and higher and then once you start all

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.539 
and higher and then once you start all
above<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.200> coping<00:02:30.439> you'll<00:02:30.769> be<00:02:30.860> able<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.069> put

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
above the coping you'll be able to put

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.270 
above the coping you'll be able to put
it<00:02:31.640> right<00:02:31.760> into<00:02:31.939> a<00:02:31.970> disaster<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:33.110> that's<00:02:33.860> how

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
it right into a disaster and that's how

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.120 
it right into a disaster and that's how
you<00:02:34.340> do<00:02:34.549> disasters
