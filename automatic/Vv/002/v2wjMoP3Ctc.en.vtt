by battlefield 4 having sold a few
million<00:00:44.800> more<00:00:45.010> copies<00:00:45.520> but<00:00:46.420> I<00:00:46.480> thought<00:00:46.750> I'd

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
million more copies but I thought I'd

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.590 
million more copies but I thought I'd
jump<00:00:47.199> back<00:00:47.379> in<00:00:47.650> and<00:00:47.830> see<00:00:48.550> what's<00:00:48.850> what<00:00:49.210> because

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
jump back in and see what's what because

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.680 
jump back in and see what's what because
this<00:00:50.380> was<00:00:50.590> the<00:00:50.710> first<00:00:50.950> game<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.220> I

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this was the first game that I

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.990 
this was the first game that I
exclusively<00:00:52.690> played<00:00:53.020> on<00:00:53.410> PC<00:00:53.980> and<00:00:54.220> I've<00:00:54.820> got

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
exclusively played on PC and I've got

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.590 
exclusively played on PC and I've got
rather<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.510> soft<00:00:55.870> spot<00:00:56.110> for<00:00:56.440> it<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:57.450> guess<00:00:58.450> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
rather a soft spot for it I guess the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.330 
rather a soft spot for it I guess the
first<00:00:58.810> thing<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.320> I<00:00:59.380> noticed<00:00:59.800> going<00:01:00.130> back

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
first thing that I noticed going back

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.450 
first thing that I noticed going back
was<00:01:00.670> well<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.840> game<00:01:02.050> is<00:01:02.320> far<00:01:02.770> less<00:01:02.980> advanced

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
was well the game is far less advanced

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.550 
was well the game is far less advanced
than<00:01:03.640> what<00:01:03.940> battlefield<00:01:04.509> 4<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.750> right<00:01:05.170> now<00:01:05.380> it

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
than what battlefield 4 is right now it

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.980 
than what battlefield 4 is right now it
does<00:01:05.740> feel<00:01:06.040> like<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.940> game<00:01:07.149> was<00:01:07.390> made<00:01:07.690> all

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
does feel like this game was made all

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.249 
does feel like this game was made all
the<00:01:08.200> way<00:01:08.229> back<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:08.770> 2010<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.580> 2011<00:01:10.479> I<00:01:10.960> mean<00:01:11.110> for

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
the way back in 2010 and 2011 I mean for

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.990 
the way back in 2010 and 2011 I mean for
example<00:01:11.290> you<00:01:11.920> know<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.520> feature<00:01:12.759> in

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
example you know that feature in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.580 
example you know that feature in
battlefield<00:01:13.450> 4<00:01:13.509> where<00:01:13.930> you're<00:01:14.320> halfway

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
battlefield 4 where you're halfway

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.410 
battlefield 4 where you're halfway
through<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:15.009> reload<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:15.700> then<00:01:16.090> you<00:01:16.180> have<00:01:16.300> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
through a reload and then you have to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.969 
through a reload and then you have to
switch<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.899> your<00:01:16.930> secondary<00:01:17.200> because<00:01:17.800> some

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
switch to your secondary because some

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.139 
switch to your secondary because some
noobs<00:01:18.220> come<00:01:18.460> around<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.729> corner<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.060> start

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
noobs come around the corner and start

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.330 
noobs come around the corner and start
spray<00:01:19.540> firing<00:01:19.960> at<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.259> yeah<00:01:20.920> that's<00:01:21.039> called

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
spray firing at you yeah that's called

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.010 
spray firing at you yeah that's called
tiered<00:01:21.759> reloading<00:01:22.420> because<00:01:22.780> if<00:01:22.899> you've

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
tiered reloading because if you've

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.139 
tiered reloading because if you've
passed<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.410> certain<00:01:23.679> point<00:01:23.800> in<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.069> reload<00:01:24.490> the

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
passed a certain point in the reload the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.270 
passed a certain point in the reload the
game<00:01:25.330> remembers<00:01:26.110> when<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.590> switch<00:01:26.890> back<00:01:27.100> to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
game remembers when you switch back to

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.219 
game remembers when you switch back to
that<00:01:27.399> primary<00:01:27.700> that<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.479> only<00:01:28.750> need<00:01:28.959> to<00:01:29.080> then

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
that primary that you only need to then

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.540 
that primary that you only need to then
go<00:01:29.380> through<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.709> remainder<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.280> the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
go through the remainder of the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.270 
go through the remainder of the
animation<00:01:31.229> battlefield<00:01:32.229> 3<00:01:32.470> doesn't<00:01:33.069> have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
animation battlefield 3 doesn't have

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.279 
animation battlefield 3 doesn't have
that<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:33.850> found<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.300> big<00:01:34.600> thing<00:01:34.959> to<00:01:35.140> be

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
that and I found it a big thing to be

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.809 
that and I found it a big thing to be
missing<00:01:35.679> even<00:01:36.009> after<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.310> first<00:01:36.429> couple<00:01:36.789> of

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
missing even after the first couple of

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.449 
missing even after the first couple of
minutes<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.420> playing<00:01:37.720> it<00:01:38.709> might<00:01:38.890> only<00:01:39.039> be<00:01:39.160> a

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
minutes of playing it might only be a

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.270 
minutes of playing it might only be a
tiny<00:01:39.910> tiny<00:01:40.390> little<00:01:40.600> feature<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.410> what<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.069> a

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.570 
battlefield 4 yeah it was a feature that
was<00:02:07.300> added<00:02:07.360> quite<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.349> lot<00:02:08.619> long<00:02:08.860> after<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.429> was

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
was added quite a lot long after it was

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730 
was added quite a lot long after it was
released<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.929> something<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.470> now

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
released but it's something that I now

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.400 
released but it's something that I now
take<00:02:11.800> for<00:02:12.310> granted<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.480> battlefield<00:02:14.110> 3

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
take for granted and in battlefield 3

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.130 
take for granted and in battlefield 3
the<00:02:14.620> mini-map<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.610> just<00:02:15.880> massively<00:02:16.510> inferior

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the mini-map is just massively inferior

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.680 
the mini-map is just massively inferior
to<00:02:17.290> Battlefield<00:02:17.770> fours<00:02:18.040> it's<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.030> small<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
to Battlefield fours it's so small and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.559 
to Battlefield fours it's so small and
tiny<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.349> then<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> enemy<00:02:21.190> arrows<00:02:21.760> are<00:02:22.060> so

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
tiny and then the enemy arrows are so

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.059 
tiny and then the enemy arrows are so
much<00:02:22.720> bigger<00:02:23.020> than<00:02:23.380> what<00:02:23.709> are<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
much bigger than what are on the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.620 
much bigger than what are on the
battlefield<00:02:24.520> once<00:02:24.670> at<00:02:24.790> least<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:25.060> scale<00:02:25.390> is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
battlefield once at least the scale is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.390 
battlefield once at least the scale is
is<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:26.170> much<00:02:26.380> different<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:26.950> it's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
is very much different and it's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.310 
is very much different and it's
basically<00:02:27.820> useless<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.720> close-quarter

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
basically useless in close-quarter

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.600 
basically useless in close-quarter
situations<00:02:29.980> because<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.340> can't

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
situations because you can't

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.850 
situations because you can't
tell<00:02:30.850> what<00:02:31.450> floor<00:02:31.750> somebody's<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.620> can't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
tell what floor somebody's on you can't

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.430 
tell what floor somebody's on you can't
tell<00:02:33.070> how<00:02:33.190> close<00:02:33.430> they<00:02:33.850> are<00:02:33.960> it's<00:02:34.960> just<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.290> bit

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
tell how close they are it's just a bit

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.720 
tell how close they are it's just a bit
of<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> nightmare<00:02:35.890> when<00:02:36.250> you're<00:02:36.370> out<00:02:36.490> in<00:02:36.610> open

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
of a nightmare when you're out in open

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.790 
of a nightmare when you're out in open
space<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.810> little<00:02:38.050> bit<00:02:38.170> different<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.650> mean

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
space it's a little bit different I mean

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.200 
space it's a little bit different I mean
because<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.130> tends<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.460> only<00:02:39.610> be<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.820> couple<00:02:40.150> of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
because it tends to only be a couple of

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.850 
because it tends to only be a couple of
things<00:02:40.330> on<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.690> minimap<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.290> so<00:02:41.740> it's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
things on the minimap then so it's

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.470 
things on the minimap then so it's
easier<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.160> tell<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.940> you're<00:02:43.060> aiming<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.420> but

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
easier to tell what you're aiming at but

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.410 
easier to tell what you're aiming at but
in<00:02:43.870> closed<00:02:44.380> course<00:02:44.680> situations<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.760> was<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.180> bit

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
in closed course situations it was a bit

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.930 
in closed course situations it was a bit
of<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.570> nightmare<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.110> use<00:02:47.640> something<00:02:48.640> good

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
of a nightmare to use something good

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.510 
of a nightmare to use something good
that<00:02:49.240> bf3<00:02:49.930> seems<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.800> over<00:02:51.040> battlefield

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
that bf3 seems to have over battlefield

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.670 
that bf3 seems to have over battlefield
4<00:02:51.700> though<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.660> apparent<00:02:52.960> hit<00:02:53.350> detection

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
4 though is the apparent hit detection

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.620 
4 though is the apparent hit detection
in<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.160> game<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:55.270> is<00:02:55.420> probably

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
in this game and this is probably

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.810 
in this game and this is probably
subjective<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.709> trust<00:02:57.250> me<00:02:57.459> there<00:02:57.640> are<00:02:57.700> gonna

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
subjective and trust me there are gonna

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150 
subjective and trust me there are gonna
be<00:02:57.910> plenty<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.630> people<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> comments<00:03:00.010> that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
be plenty of people in the comments that

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.500 
be plenty of people in the comments that
are<00:03:00.190> gonna<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.490> saying<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.850> I'm<00:03:00.970> completely

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
are gonna be saying that I'm completely

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.590 
are gonna be saying that I'm completely
wrong<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.770> for<00:03:03.370> me<00:03:03.580> beer<00:03:04.030> threes<00:03:04.420> hit

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
wrong but for me beer threes hit

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.770 
wrong but for me beer threes hit
detection<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.350> felt<00:03:05.560> right<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.850> mean<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.630> hit

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
detection just felt right I mean the hit

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.479 
detection just felt right I mean the hit
markers<00:03:08.080> appeared<00:03:08.380> when<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> expected<00:03:09.310> them<00:03:09.459> to

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
markers appeared when I expected them to

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.360 
markers appeared when I expected them to
and<00:03:09.910> people<00:03:10.570> died<00:03:10.930> when<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.410> Dan<00:03:11.709> knew<00:03:11.980> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
and people died when I Dan knew that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.130 
and people died when I Dan knew that
I've<00:03:12.520> been<00:03:12.700> hitting<00:03:13.030> them<00:03:13.209> with<00:03:13.570> my<00:03:13.780> bullets

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
I've been hitting them with my bullets

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.250 
I've been hitting them with my bullets
and<00:03:14.350> in<00:03:14.440> battlefield<00:03:14.920> 4<00:03:14.980> on<00:03:15.340> release<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
and in battlefield 4 on release that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.560 
and in battlefield 4 on release that
just<00:03:17.620> didn't<00:03:18.100> happen<00:03:18.310> whatsoever

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
just didn't happen whatsoever

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.350 
just didn't happen whatsoever
I<00:03:19.600> mean<00:03:20.110> battlefield<00:03:20.770> 4<00:03:20.950> now<00:03:21.160> yes<00:03:21.550> again<00:03:22.030> it

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
I mean battlefield 4 now yes again it

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.540 
I mean battlefield 4 now yes again it
has<00:03:22.540> great<00:03:22.870> hit<00:03:23.140> detection<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:24.190> it's<00:03:24.340> even

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
has great hit detection and it's even

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.520 
has great hit detection and it's even
better<00:03:24.790> with<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.209> new<00:03:25.450> CTE<00:03:25.870> changes<00:03:26.380> that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
better with the new CTE changes that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.320 
better with the new CTE changes that
will<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.770> coming<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.160> soon<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.209> was

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
will be coming in soon but it was

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.570 
will be coming in soon but it was
absolutely<00:03:28.560> abysmal<00:03:29.560> at<00:03:29.980> launch<00:03:30.220> there<00:03:30.489> was

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
absolutely abysmal at launch there was

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.820 
absolutely abysmal at launch there was
so<00:03:30.700> many<00:03:30.820> missing<00:03:31.209> hit<00:03:31.630> markers<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.680> would

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
so many missing hit markers that would

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.920 
so many missing hit markers that would
come<00:03:32.980> up<00:03:33.100> in<00:03:33.220> one<00:03:33.400> massive<00:03:33.670> bulk<00:03:34.120> after<00:03:34.780> I'd

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
come up in one massive bulk after I'd

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.259 
come up in one massive bulk after I'd
got<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.260> kill<00:03:35.470> notification<00:03:36.130> like<00:03:36.310> 4<00:03:36.730> seconds

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
got the kill notification like 4 seconds

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.000 
got the kill notification like 4 seconds
later<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:38.410> was<00:03:38.500> really<00:03:38.860> off-putting

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
later and it was really off-putting

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.710 
later and it was really off-putting
because<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.610> was<00:03:39.820> thinking<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.180> maybe<00:03:40.600> a

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
because I was thinking that maybe a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.930 
because I was thinking that maybe a
gadget<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.230> I<00:03:41.350> put<00:03:41.650> down<00:03:41.830> or<00:03:42.010> something<00:03:42.340> that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
gadget that I put down or something that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.640 
gadget that I put down or something that
had<00:03:43.239> gone<00:03:43.450> off<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.810> I<00:03:43.840> got<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.019> hit<00:03:44.170> marker<00:03:44.320> on

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
had gone off and I got a hit marker on

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.650 
had gone off and I got a hit marker on
my<00:03:44.739> screen<00:03:44.980> but<00:03:45.160> no<00:03:45.340> they<00:03:46.120> were<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.510> hit
