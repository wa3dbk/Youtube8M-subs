00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
could win and that's the first reason

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
could win and that's the first reason
that<00:00:39.120> bullies<00:00:39.360> are<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.629> vampires<00:00:40.200> because

that bullies are like vampires because

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.400

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the first place from a biological

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.700 
the first place from a biological
perspective<00:00:44.969> humans<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.050> animals<00:00:46.320> do

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
perspective humans like all animals do

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.080 
perspective humans like all animals do
things<00:00:46.950> because<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.460> those<00:00:47.700> actions

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
things because they think those actions

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.610 
things because they think those actions
are<00:00:48.180> gonna<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.480> them<00:00:48.629> certain<00:00:48.899> rewards<00:00:49.020> so

are gonna get them certain rewards so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.869 
are gonna get them certain rewards so
the<00:00:49.710> problem<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.129> bullies<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.610> too<00:00:50.760> many

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the problem is that bullies get too many

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
the problem is that bullies get too many
social<00:00:51.300> rewards<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.050> enough<00:00:52.320> social

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
consequences for their behavior in other

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.600 
consequences for their behavior in other
words<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.039> bullying<00:00:56.460> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
the solution and this is the second

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.670 
the solution and this is the second
