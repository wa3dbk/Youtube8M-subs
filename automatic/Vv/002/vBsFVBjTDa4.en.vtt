00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
couple of techniques of getting the tone

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
couple of techniques of getting the tone
adjusted<00:01:25.560> by<00:01:25.740> working<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> upper<00:01:26.520> bow<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that to a few other areas that seem to

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.580 
that to a few other areas that seem to
be<00:01:34.079> important<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.000> finally<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:37.320> dead

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
and I did a few other things in the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.289 
and I did a few other things in the
bridge<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.430> figured<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> years

bridge that I figured out over the years

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
bridge that I figured out over the years
so<00:01:52.049> worked<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.619> well<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:53.220> keep<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.490> mind

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520

that<00:02:06.859> you<00:02:07.859> can<00:02:08.009> hear<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> cold<00:02:08.550> case<00:02:08.789> for

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that you can hear in a cold case for

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.570 
that you can hear in a cold case for
example<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.769> background<00:02:11.190> music<00:02:11.459> it's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
example in the background music it's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:03:01.420 
example in the background music it's
rather<00:02:12.140> brooding

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.949 

nice<00:03:02.430> nice<00:03:02.730> tone<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.120> there<00:03:03.269> I<00:03:03.480> really<00:03:03.810> need<00:03:03.930> to

nice nice tone in there I really need to

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:16.470 
nice nice tone in there I really need to
be<00:03:04.079> all<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.349> our<00:03:04.470> quarter<00:03:05.159> jewel

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.399 

anyway<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.540> get<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.690> idea<00:03:17.780> I'm<00:03:18.170> going<00:03:18.319> to

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
anyway you get the idea I'm going to

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.570 
anyway you get the idea I'm going to
sell<00:03:18.560> these<00:03:18.709> at<00:03:18.890> 1425<00:03:19.900> used<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.049> sell<00:03:21.260> them<00:03:21.379> for

$2,200<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:23.360> I've<00:03:23.510> managed<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.870> I<00:03:23.989> took<00:03:24.319> away

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
$2,200 but I've managed to I took away

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.479 
$2,200 but I've managed to I took away
the<00:03:24.590> perfection<00:03:25.040> pegs

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
the perfection pegs

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.140 
the perfection pegs
I<00:03:26.019> saved<00:03:27.019> effort<00:03:27.349> in<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.500> few<00:03:27.650> other<00:03:27.769> places<00:03:28.150> and

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
I saved effort in a few other places and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.210 
I saved effort in a few other places and
I<00:03:29.900> think<00:03:30.110> I'm<00:03:30.260> getting<00:03:30.379> better<00:03:30.560> town<00:03:31.010> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
I think I'm getting better town the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.860 
I think I'm getting better town the
sounds<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.790> sounds<00:03:32.090> very<00:03:32.269> good<00:03:32.450> compared<00:03:32.810> to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
sounds that sounds very good compared to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.030 
sounds that sounds very good compared to
well<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.349> just<00:03:33.379> sounds<00:03:33.709> very<00:03:33.739> good

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.869 

there's<00:03:41.040> probably<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.400> lot<00:03:41.520> more<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.790> be

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
there's probably a lot more that can be

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.660 
there's probably a lot more that can be
done<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.660> playing<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.319> I'll<00:03:43.459> practice<00:03:44.459> or

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
done in playing and I'll practice or

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.589 
done in playing and I'll practice or
