00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
sure that it's hardened off and ready to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
sure that it's hardened off and ready to
go<00:01:09.479> otherwise<00:01:10.049> you're<00:01:10.409> gonna<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:11.010> issue

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
go otherwise you're gonna get an issue
like<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> where<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:13.020> pretty

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
like that where it's just gonna pretty

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.149 
like that where it's just gonna pretty
much<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:15.049> destroyed<00:01:16.049> by<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.830> weight<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
much get destroyed by the the weight of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
much get destroyed by the the weight of
the<00:01:17.280> Sun<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.790> guess<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> best<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> put

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the Sun I guess is the best way to put

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
the Sun I guess is the best way to put
it<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.200> been<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> couple<00:01:19.799> hot<00:01:19.920> days<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.580> even

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it it's been a couple hot days and even

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
it it's been a couple hot days and even
with<00:01:21.240> water<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> root<00:01:22.140> system

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
with water going to the root system

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.630 
with water going to the root system
being<00:01:23.280> switched<00:01:23.729> from<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.299> indoor<00:01:24.570> system<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
being switched from an indoor system to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.770 
being switched from an indoor system to
outdoors<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> middle<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> Sun<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
outdoors in the middle of the Sun and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
outdoors in the middle of the Sun and
the<00:01:27.840> wind<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.680> too<00:01:28.950> much<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.310> these

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the wind just was too much for these

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.390 
the wind just was too much for these
ones<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> handle<00:01:30.680> there's<00:01:31.680> another<00:01:31.890> example

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
ones to handle there's another example

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.780 
ones to handle there's another example
up<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:33.439> and<00:01:34.439> that's<00:01:35.130> pretty<00:01:35.340> much<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.759> for

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
up here and that's pretty much it for

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.060 
up here and that's pretty much it for
this<00:01:36.030> quick<00:01:36.329> update<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.960> didn't<00:01:37.439> actually<00:01:37.650> plan

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

this quick update I didn't actually plan
on<00:01:38.100> doing<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.060> were<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.450> kind

of interesting things to talk about
another<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:43.439> quick<00:01:43.680> thing<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.100> did

another little quick thing as I did
mention<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:44.759> last<00:01:44.909> video<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> had<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
mention in my last video that you had to

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.770 
mention in my last video that you had to
kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.670> sure<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> balance<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
kind of make sure that you balance the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.340 
kind of make sure that you balance the
system<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:49.829> show<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.280> happens

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
system and I'll show you what happens

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.690 
system and I'll show you what happens
you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.649> there's<00:01:52.829> more<00:01:53.009> water<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.579> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you can see there's more water on this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.810 
you can see there's more water on this
bottom<00:01:54.119> side<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:55.320> over<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.860> then<00:01:56.670> there

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
bottom side right over here then there

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.039 
bottom side right over here then there
is<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.570> because<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.810> haven't

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
is over here that's because I haven't

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.990 
is over here that's because I haven't
really<00:01:58.290> balanced<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> plus<00:01:59.939> side

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
really balanced it but on the plus side

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
really balanced it but on the plus side
I<00:02:00.390> haven't<00:02:00.780> noticed<00:02:01.049> too<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I haven't noticed too much of a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
I haven't noticed too much of a
consequence<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.479> as<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.780> can

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
consequence from that because as you can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.889 
consequence from that because as you can
see<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:05.219> spinach<00:02:05.610> right<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.719> touch

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
see this spinach right here if you touch

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.589 
see this spinach right here if you touch
this<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.890> starter<00:02:08.789> plug<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.149> very<00:02:09.330> very

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
this this starter plug it's very very

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.140 
this this starter plug it's very very
wet<00:02:09.869> still<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.800> water<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.430> making<00:02:11.879> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
wet still so water is actually making it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910 
wet still so water is actually making it
all<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.959> way<00:02:13.110> across

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
all the way across

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.040 
all the way across
and<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> way<00:02:14.700> down<00:02:14.730> every<00:02:15.600> part<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and all the way down every part of the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.320 
and all the way down every part of the
system<00:02:16.580> without<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.760> being<00:02:17.910> perfectly

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
system without it being perfectly

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.910 
system without it being perfectly
balanced<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.840> think<00:02:19.080> if<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.290> back<00:02:19.500> up<00:02:19.530> far

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
balanced and I think if I back up far

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.949 
balanced and I think if I back up far
enough<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.750> just

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
enough you can see that it is just

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.110 
enough you can see that it is just
slightly<00:02:22.260> tilted<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.760> something<00:02:24.030> I'm

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
slightly tilted that's something I'm

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.790 
slightly tilted that's something I'm
probably<00:02:24.209> gonna<00:02:24.450> fix<00:02:24.780> anyways<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
probably gonna fix anyways but it is

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.380 
probably gonna fix anyways but it is
relieving<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.459> know<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.000> not<00:02:27.150> actually

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
relieving to know that it's not actually

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.570 
relieving to know that it's not actually
as<00:02:27.750> big<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.930> an<00:02:28.110> issue<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.590> thought<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
as big of an issue as I thought so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.420 
as big of an issue as I thought so
that's<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:30.030> quick<00:02:30.180> update<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.690> tower<00:02:31.430> not

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's a quick update on the tower not

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.180 
that's a quick update on the tower not
too<00:02:32.670> much<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.390> report<00:02:33.750> but<00:02:34.110> all<00:02:34.560> everything

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
too much to report but all everything

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.650 
too much to report but all everything
looks<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.760> going<00:02:35.940> pretty<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.300> we've

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
looks like it's going pretty well we've

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.650 
looks like it's going pretty well we've
got<00:02:36.840> some<00:02:37.140> true<00:02:37.740> leaves<00:02:37.980> coming<00:02:38.430> out<00:02:38.550> for<00:02:38.880> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
got some true leaves coming out for the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.840 
got some true leaves coming out for the
kale<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.580> lettuce<00:02:41.880> as<00:02:42.410> well<00:02:43.410> as<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
kale and the lettuce as well as the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.660 
kale and the lettuce as well as the
spinach<00:02:45.270> over<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.770> at<00:02:47.340> pretty<00:02:47.580> much

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
spinach over here and at pretty much

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.979 
spinach over here and at pretty much
everything<00:02:47.970> else<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.239> doing<00:02:48.480> great<00:02:48.630> like

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
we've got look at this kale this kale

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.930 
we've got look at this kale this kale
has<00:02:50.910> grown<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:52.080> true<00:02:52.350> leaves<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.220> stem<00:02:53.910> is

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
has grown to true leaves and the stem is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.370 
has grown to true leaves and the stem is
really<00:02:54.330> sort<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.570> thickening<00:02:54.989> up<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
toughening up in just four or five days

toughening up in just four or five days
since<00:02:58.530> I've<00:02:58.680> put<00:02:58.830> it<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> system

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
since I've put it in the system
