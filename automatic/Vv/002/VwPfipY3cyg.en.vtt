00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.710
 a blouse or shirt and a pair of scissors 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.630
 let's start by cutting the part of 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.359
 in front of the fruit as I show 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.300
 now we open the blouse and we are going to cut 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.440
 the sides this way but get 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 up to the top 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.310
 again we cut from side to side to 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.620
 remove this lovely july straight and you 're done 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.380
 we have a product with the same style 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.180
 forged from a typical and old family 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.550
 remember that you can also do it with 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.680
 any type of blouse or family that already 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.360
 here it is not insufficient as 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.490
 previous only that it 's okay to be 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.710
 different is more than the story but 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.990
 As you can see, it's super super cute 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.910
 right now to use the tractor is super 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.250
 simple let's take the sides of 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.350
 side by side forming like an X in 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.320
 the back is not going to tie very 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.600
 well with a knot we arrange the sides 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 that is to say these folds to make it look 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.030
