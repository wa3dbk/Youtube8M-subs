00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.290 

okay<00:00:01.469> so<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.740> finished<00:00:01.829> modifying<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.909> common

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay so I finished modifying a common

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay so I finished modifying a common
circuit<00:00:03.750> here<00:00:04.100> I'm<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.190> gonna<00:00:05.400> connect<00:00:05.819> that

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
circuit here I'm just gonna connect that

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.140 
circuit here I'm just gonna connect that
come<00:00:06.359> over<00:00:06.509> waiting<00:00:07.109> I'm<00:00:07.350> sorry<00:00:07.740> VCD<00:00:08.670> yes

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.910 

stick<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> engine<00:00:12.660> module<00:00:12.860> so<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
stick to the engine module so I

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000 
stick to the engine module so I
unplugged<00:00:14.509> this<00:00:15.509> from<00:00:16.020> where<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.440> cruise

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
unplugged this from where the cruise

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.810 
unplugged this from where the cruise
control<00:00:17.130> stuff<00:00:18.650> comes<00:00:19.650> out<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.949> stock<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
control stuff comes out of the stock and

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.050 
control stuff comes out of the stock and
I've<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:22.010> wiring<00:00:23.010> that<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.279> made<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.789> some

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
I've got my wiring that I made here some

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.910 
I've got my wiring that I made here some
wearing<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.359> maid<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.840> looks<00:00:25.320> places<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
wearing a maid here looks places it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.400 
wearing a maid here looks places it
between<00:00:26.660> couple<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> ribbons<00:00:30.109> too<00:00:31.109> dark<00:00:31.349> for

its<00:00:31.619> first<00:00:31.890> master<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.480> idea<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.980> be

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
its first master and the idea is to be

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
its first master and the idea is to be
able<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> control<00:00:35.610> cruise<00:00:35.969> control<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.690> the

no no response from controller maybe I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.580 
no no response from controller maybe I
should<00:00:45.660> turn<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> car<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:48.260> using<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> thrust

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
should turn the car on using a thrust
