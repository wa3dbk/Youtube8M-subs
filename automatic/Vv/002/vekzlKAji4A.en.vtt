00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.510 
row you're doing these 3 week waves
they're<00:01:56.159> called

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
they're called

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.889 
they're called
you're<00:01:57.360> gonna<00:01:57.450> use<00:01:57.630> 50%<00:01:58.530> 55%<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.759> 60%<00:02:00.210> then

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
you're gonna use 50% 55% and 60% then

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.440 
you're gonna use 50% 55% and 60% then
you're<00:02:01.020> gonna<00:02:01.140> start<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> weave<00:02:01.710> back<00:02:02.009> over

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you're gonna start to weave back over

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920 
you're gonna start to weave back over
well<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.990> cube<00:02:04.290> method<00:02:04.740> invented<00:02:05.640> by<00:02:06.030> Mark

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
well in the cube method invented by Mark

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.550 
well in the cube method invented by Mark
Cuban<00:02:07.380> by<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> way<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:08.550> Brandon<00:02:09.060> Lilly<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
Cuban by the way not Brandon Lilly the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.910 
Cuban by the way not Brandon Lilly the
cube<00:02:10.830> method<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.349> broken

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
cube method is going to be more broken

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.320 
cube method is going to be more broken
now<00:02:14.190> you're<00:02:14.400> not<00:02:14.490> gonna<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.090> dynamic

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
now you're not gonna get to a dynamic

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.430 
now you're not gonna get to a dynamic
effort<00:02:15.990> lift<00:02:16.580> maybe<00:02:17.580> about<00:02:18.180> twice<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> month<00:02:18.990> or

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
effort lift maybe about twice a month or

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.190 
effort lift maybe about twice a month or
so<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> you're<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.510> gonna<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.080> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so so you're not gonna get to it as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440 
so so you're not gonna get to it as
frequently<00:02:22.709> but<00:02:23.340> could<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.700> wave<00:02:23.940> load<00:02:24.240> on

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
frequently but could you wave load on

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.380 
frequently but could you wave load on
that<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.170> sure<00:02:25.380> could<00:02:25.970> but<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:27.120> think

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
that you sure could but I don't think

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630 
that you sure could but I don't think
it's<00:02:27.569> it's<00:02:27.930> anything<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.380> even<00:02:28.620> even<00:02:29.400> bother

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
it's it's anything to even even bother

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.140 
it's it's anything to even even bother
with<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.240> even<00:02:30.420> worry<00:02:30.600> about<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.640> think

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
with or to even worry about I do think

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.720 
with or to even worry about I do think
that<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:34.380> would<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.890> become<00:02:35.190> faster

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that you would like to become faster

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.310 
that you would like to become faster
with<00:02:35.880> heavy<00:02:36.060> weights<00:02:36.390> over<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> period<00:02:36.990> of<00:02:37.140> time

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
with heavy weights over a period of time

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.160 
with heavy weights over a period of time
what<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> would<00:02:38.250> suggest<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.910> almost<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.540> wave

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
what I would suggest is almost like wave

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.010 
what I would suggest is almost like wave

true story anyway so I don't think it
would<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.269> worth<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.720> maybe<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.170> worthwhile

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
would be worth on maybe a worthwhile

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.830 
would be worth on maybe a worthwhile
thing<00:03:16.650> for<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:18.269> really<00:03:18.540> worry<00:03:18.750> about

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
thing for you to to really worry about

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.810 
thing for you to to really worry about
what<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.320> would<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.310> would<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:20.730> I

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
what I would do is just I would like I

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.759 
what I would do is just I would like I
said<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> kind<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.480> wave<00:03:21.660> load<00:03:21.959> within<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
said I kind of wave load within the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.229 
said I kind of wave load within the
workout<00:03:23.190> itself<00:03:23.549> there's<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.940> lot<00:03:24.120> of

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
workout itself there's a lot of

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.780 
workout itself there's a lot of
different<00:03:24.480> ways<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.810> doing<00:03:24.930> that<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:26.489> could

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
different ways of doing that you could

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.979 
different ways of doing that you could
if<00:03:27.030> you're<00:03:27.150> using<00:03:27.329> chains

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
if you're using chains

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.690 
if you're using chains
you<00:03:28.260> could<00:03:28.410> add<00:03:28.530> chains<00:03:28.920> every<00:03:29.250> other<00:03:29.340> set

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
you could add chains every other set

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.240 
you could add chains every other set
until<00:03:30.269> you're<00:03:30.450> done<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:31.530> could<00:03:31.739> add<00:03:31.920> chains

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
until you're done you could add chains

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.069 
until you're done you could add chains
every<00:03:32.579> set<00:03:32.820> until<00:03:33.150> you're<00:03:33.269> done<00:03:33.420> until<00:03:33.959> you

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
every set until you're done until you

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.699 
every set until you're done until you
pass<00:03:34.290> out<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:35.280> could<00:03:35.940> add<00:03:36.120> 20<00:03:36.570> pounds<00:03:37.110> every

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
pass out you could add 20 pounds every

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.490 
pass out you could add 20 pounds every
other<00:03:37.829> set<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.810> don't<00:03:40.110> want<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.320> add<00:03:40.470> a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
other set you just don't want to add a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.900 
other set you just don't want to add a
lot<00:03:40.769> of<00:03:40.920> weight<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.430> intent<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.820> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
lot of weight because the intent of the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.420 
lot of weight because the intent of the
day<00:03:42.120> is<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.989> fast<00:03:43.350> at<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.829> intent<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.280> day

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
you can mix it up that way as well so

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.670 
you can mix it up that way as well so
you<00:04:05.880> can<00:04:06.000> do<00:04:06.150> doubles<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:06.900> eight<00:04:07.049> sets<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.560> do

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
you can do doubles for eight sets you do

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.789 
you can do doubles for eight sets you do
eight<00:04:07.860> set<00:04:08.070> two<00:04:08.160> to<00:04:09.109> give<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.320> same<00:04:10.560> weight
