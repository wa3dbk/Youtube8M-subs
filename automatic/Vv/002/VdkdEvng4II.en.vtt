00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.370 
that was I didn't realize the whole
trauma<00:03:31.340> apart<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> thought<00:03:32.210> that<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.660> was

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
trauma apart and I thought that that was

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.430 
trauma apart and I thought that that was
how<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.620> Sun<00:03:34.040> came<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.490> be<00:03:34.720> what<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:36.020> thought

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
how the Sun came to be what I thought

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.930 
how the Sun came to be what I thought
you<00:03:36.920> know<00:03:37.010> I'm<00:03:37.070> saying<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.400> thought<00:03:37.520> there<00:03:37.820> was

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
you know I'm saying I thought there was

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.660 
you know I'm saying I thought there was
ten<00:03:38.210> Suns<00:03:38.600> originally<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:39.680> some<00:03:40.190> dude<00:03:40.460> I

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
ten Suns originally and then some dude I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.220 
ten Suns originally and then some dude I
guess<00:03:40.850> it's<00:03:41.030> how<00:03:41.180> he<00:03:41.240> shut<00:03:41.630> down<00:03:41.660> out<00:03:41.990> of<00:03:42.140> them

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
guess it's how he shut down out of them

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.870 
guess it's how he shut down out of them
and<00:03:42.410> then<00:03:42.590> we<00:03:42.710> were<00:03:42.800> left<00:03:43.010> with<00:03:43.130> one<00:03:43.310> Sun<00:03:43.520> know
