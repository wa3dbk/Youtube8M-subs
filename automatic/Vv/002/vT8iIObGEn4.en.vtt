00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
another video in the vs. series now I

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.300 
another video in the vs. series now I
haven't<00:00:03.959> done<00:00:04.049> one<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.230> these<00:00:04.410> vs.<00:00:04.859> videos<00:00:05.160> in

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
haven't done one of these vs. videos in

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.920 
haven't done one of these vs. videos in
a<00:00:05.400> long<00:00:05.640> time<00:00:05.940> it's<00:00:06.089> actually<00:00:06.210> been<00:00:06.509> about<00:00:06.629> two

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
a long time it's actually been about two

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.660 
a long time it's actually been about two
or<00:00:07.020> three<00:00:07.230> months<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.950> last<00:00:08.160> one<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.340> did<00:00:08.550> was

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
or three months the last one I did was

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.900 
or three months the last one I did was
the<00:00:08.820> AMD<00:00:09.240> Radeon<00:00:09.630> HD<00:00:09.660> 7870<00:00:10.559> versus<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.400> GTX

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the AMD Radeon HD 7870 versus the GTX

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.240 
the AMD Radeon HD 7870 versus the GTX
660<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.809> finally<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.650> getting<00:00:13.799> around<00:00:14.130> to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
660 and finally I'm getting around to

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.650 
660 and finally I'm getting around to
doing<00:00:14.429> another<00:00:14.519> one<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.969> these<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.540> going

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
doing another one of these this is going

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.650 
doing another one of these this is going
to<00:00:15.719> be<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.039> 7770<00:00:17.039> versus<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> GTX<00:00:17.850> 650<00:00:18.300> I

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
to be the 7770 versus the GTX 650 I

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.000 
to be the 7770 versus the GTX 650 I
think<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> lot<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.410> people<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.830> like

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
think a lot of people are going to like

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.470 
think a lot of people are going to like
this<00:00:20.189> since<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.789> question<00:00:21.000> all<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
this since I get this question all the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.150 
this since I get this question all the
time<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> these<00:00:22.500> graphics<00:00:22.949> card

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
time on which one of these graphics card

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460 
time on which one of these graphics card
to<00:00:23.310> get<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> more<00:00:24.930> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> budget

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to get and this is more on the budget

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
to get and this is more on the budget
side<00:00:25.680> compared<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> 7870<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> 660

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
side compared to the 7870 in the 660

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.570 
side compared to the 7870 in the 660
these<00:00:28.170> two<00:00:28.380> cards<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.740> costed<00:00:29.220> anywhere

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
these two cards that costed anywhere

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.130 
these two cards that costed anywhere
from<00:00:29.699> 80<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.060> $100

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
from 80 to $100

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.170 
from 80 to $100
so<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.160> good<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> budget

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so this is really good for the budget

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.709 
so this is really good for the budget
minded<00:00:33.390> gamer<00:00:33.840> also<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.920> 7770<00:00:35.880> does<00:00:36.120> cost<00:00:36.480> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
minded gamer also the 7770 does cost a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.869 
minded gamer also the 7770 does cost a
little<00:00:36.870> bit<00:00:37.020> more<00:00:37.200> than<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> GTX<00:00:37.920> 650<00:00:38.579> it's

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
little bit more than the GTX 650 it's

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
little bit more than the GTX 650 it's
about<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.120> $10<00:00:39.600> price<00:00:39.870> difference<00:00:40.410> originally

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
about a $10 price difference originally

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
about a $10 price difference originally
I<00:00:41.309> wanted<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.640> do<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.960> 7770<00:00:42.960> versus<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.350> 650

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I wanted to do the 7770 versus the 650

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
I wanted to do the 7770 versus the 650
TI<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.520> 650<00:00:44.940> Ti<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.660> 30<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.379> 40<00:00:46.680> dollars

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
TI but 650 Ti is like 30 to 40 dollars

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
TI but 650 Ti is like 30 to 40 dollars
more<00:00:47.190> expensive<00:00:47.219> than<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> 7770<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.350> really

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
more expensive than the 7770 so I really

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
more expensive than the 7770 so I really
couldn't<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.789> comparison<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> those

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
couldn't do a good comparison of those

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.560 
couldn't do a good comparison of those
to<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.260> 650<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> 7770<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> closest

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
to the 650 and the 7770 are the closest

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
to the 650 and the 7770 are the closest
and<00:00:54.809> are<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.110> price<00:00:55.379> comparison<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and are in price comparison so this is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
and are in price comparison so this is
the<00:00:56.370> fairest<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> do<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> video<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.899> yeah

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the fairest way to do the video so yeah

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.599 
the fairest way to do the video so yeah
with<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.680> being<00:00:58.859> said<00:00:58.949> let's<00:00:59.309> get<00:00:59.430> straight

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
with that being said let's get straight

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.510 
with that being said let's get straight
into<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.870> was<00:01:01.079> done<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.890> PC

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.010 
SSD and Asus p8z 77 just to get that out
of<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.479> right<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
of the way so let's get right into this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
of the way so let's get right into this
with<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> first<00:01:13.619> game<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
with the first game and I think this is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.700 
with the first game and I think this is
the<00:01:15.030> game<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.240> most<00:01:15.630> people<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the game that most people want me to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
the game that most people want me to
talk<00:01:16.830> about<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> that's<00:01:17.430> battlefield<00:01:18.180> 3

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
talk about and that's battlefield 3

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.660 
talk about and that's battlefield 3
definitely<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> most<00:01:19.140> fan<00:01:19.830> friendly<00:01:20.130> game

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
definitely the most fan friendly game

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
definitely the most fan friendly game
battlefield<00:01:21.360> 3<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:22.170> know<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.650> game

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
battlefield 3 you know that's a game

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
battlefield 3 you know that's a game

that typically on NVIDIA has a slight

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.899 
that typically on NVIDIA has a slight
edge<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> but<00:01:26.729> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
edge on I don't know what it is but in

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
edge on I don't know what it is but in
video<00:01:27.180> cards<00:01:27.479> typically<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> better<00:01:28.320> than<00:01:28.500> AMD

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
video cards typically do better than AMD

video cards typically do better than AMD
cards<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.180> game<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.689> definitely<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
cards this this game was definitely the

these lower end cards you probably do

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.830 
these lower end cards you probably do
want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> lower<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> resolution<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:48.570> lower

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.480 
want to lower the resolution or lower
the<00:01:48.990> settings<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.009> compare<00:01:50.340> apples

to<00:01:50.729> apples<00:01:50.820> they<00:01:51.570> could<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> 1080p

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439

to apples they could just do 1080p
everything<00:01:52.829> max<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.369> yeah<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.390> 7770<00:01:55.170> does

7770 is at that cusp of being playable
the<00:02:01.320> 650<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.890> wouldn't<00:02:02.219> say<00:02:02.369> would<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.610> playable

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
the 650 I wouldn't say would be playable

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.999 
the 650 I wouldn't say would be playable

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
recommend you lower the settings lower

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.029 
recommend you lower the settings lower
the<00:02:09.450> resolution<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.860> be<00:02:10.950> expected

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
settings maxed out in this test I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.159 
settings maxed out in this test I
actually<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.730> turn<00:03:20.940> off<00:03:21.180> anti-aliasing

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
actually have to turn off anti-aliasing

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:24.140 
actually have to turn off anti-aliasing
because<00:03:22.500> we<00:03:22.919> turn<00:03:23.129> on<00:03:23.250> anti-aliasing<00:03:23.940> these

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
because we turn on anti-aliasing these

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.430 
because we turn on anti-aliasing these
cards<00:03:24.389> are<00:03:24.480> gonna<00:03:24.569> get<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.840> 2<00:03:24.989> frames<00:03:25.260> per
