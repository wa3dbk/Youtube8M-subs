00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
used with a live pull when I have wig on

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.959 
used with a live pull when I have wig on
it<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.929> suddenly<00:00:10.410> but<00:00:10.740> steadily<00:00:11.160> drifts<00:00:11.790> down

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
it is suddenly but steadily drifts down

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.020 
it is suddenly but steadily drifts down
and<00:00:12.269> then<00:00:12.660> van<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.349> jerks<00:00:13.679> hard<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.670> set<00:00:14.910> up

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and then van it jerks hard to set up

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.050 
and then van it jerks hard to set up
where<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.299> originally<00:00:15.630> was<00:00:16.220> common<00:00:17.220> problem

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
where it originally was common problem

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.200 
where it originally was common problem
with<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> 604<00:00:19.080> 800<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.119> a

with the 604 800 for this also is a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.439 
with the 604 800 for this also is a
problem<00:00:21.539> with<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> Jubilee<00:00:22.230> -<00:00:22.500> I'm<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> 600<00:00:24.210> for

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
problem with the Jubilee - I'm a 600 for

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.779 
problem with the Jubilee - I'm a 600 for
the<00:00:25.260> pump<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> remember<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> side

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the pump if you remember is on the side

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.429 
the pump if you remember is on the side
of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> engine<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> live<00:00:27.869> hydraulic

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
of the engine so it's a live hydraulic

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
of the engine so it's a live hydraulic
tractor<00:00:28.859> where<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> pump<00:00:29.310> runs<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> time

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
tractor where the pump runs all the time

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.010 
tractor where the pump runs all the time
off<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.369> camshaft<00:00:32.480> there's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.630> leak

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
off the camshaft there's a leak

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.990 
off the camshaft there's a leak
somewhere<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.399> do<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> try

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
somewhere so what we have to do is try

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.119 
somewhere so what we have to do is try
to<00:00:36.030> troubleshoot<00:00:36.630> where<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.710> leak<00:00:37.890> where

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
to troubleshoot where is the leak where

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.709 
to troubleshoot where is the leak where
is<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.430> oil<00:00:38.610> leak<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.059> Downey<00:00:39.270> says<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
is the oil leak and Downey says it

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
is the oil leak and Downey says it
slowly<00:00:40.050> drifts<00:00:40.410> down<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.950> weight<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
slowly drifts down with weight on it and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.010 
slowly drifts down with weight on it and
bam<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.090> jerks<00:00:42.300> back<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.750> trying<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
bam it jerks back I was trying to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
bam it jerks back I was trying to
correct<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.460> what's<00:00:44.700> happening<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
correct it so so what's happening is the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
correct it so so what's happening is the
oil<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> leaking<00:00:46.309> if<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.670> trying<00:00:47.910> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
oil is leaking if I was trying to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
oil is leaking if I was trying to
troubleshoot<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.840> him<00:00:49.070> again<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.160> don't

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
troubleshoot this for him again I don't

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
troubleshoot this for him again I don't
have<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.430> tractor<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.120> I'm<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.270> shooting

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
have a tractor here so I'm just shooting

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350 
have a tractor here so I'm just shooting
from<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> hip<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.890> would<00:00:53.550> take<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> site

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
from the hip here I would take the site

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.069 
from the hip here I would take the site
door<00:00:54.719> off<00:00:54.989> where<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> PTO<00:00:56.250> lever<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> get

door off where the PTO lever is and get
a<00:00:58.109> flashlight<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.609> shining

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
a flashlight it would be shining

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
a flashlight it would be shining
straight<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> track<00:01:01.710> her<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.039> with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
straight in start to track her up with

straight in start to track her up with
weight<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
weight on it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
weight on it
let<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> tractor<00:01:04.350> drift<00:01:04.680> down<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.339> inside

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
let the tractor drift down look inside

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.850 
let the tractor drift down look inside
where<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> barrel<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> under<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> seat<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
where the barrel is under the seat and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
where the barrel is under the seat and
see<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.400> oils<00:01:08.820> coming<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
see if oils coming out of there then I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660 
see if oils coming out of there then I
know<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> Rings<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.590> bad<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
know that the Rings are bad on the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
know that the Rings are bad on the
piston<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.600> other<00:01:12.720> place<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> could<00:01:13.530> be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
piston the other place that it could be

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
piston the other place that it could be
bad<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> runs<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> tube<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> side<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
bad is it runs in a tube up the side of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
bad is it runs in a tube up the side of
the<00:01:16.350> transmission<00:01:16.850> that<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.299> o-ring<00:01:18.479> at

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the transmission that has an o-ring at

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
the transmission that has an o-ring at
the<00:01:18.930> top<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> lid<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.189> the

transmission meet there's over there

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
transmission meet there's over there
could<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.590> leaking<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.430> will<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
could be leaking there you will see that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.820 
could be leaking there you will see that
inside<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> transmission<00:01:25.080> leaking<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:25.740> of

inside the transmission leaking out of
there<00:01:26.180> possibly<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.450> leaking<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there possibly could be leaking on the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
there possibly could be leaking on the
outside<00:01:28.320> most<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> time<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:28.979> leak<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
outside most of time they leak on the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.710 
outside most of time they leak on the
inside<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> transmission<00:01:30.360> where<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> can't

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
inside of transmission where you can't

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.510 
inside of transmission where you can't
see<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.680> other<00:01:31.829> thing<00:01:31.979> I'd<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.130> looking

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
see them the other thing I'd be looking

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
see them the other thing I'd be looking
for<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> tube<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.259> oil<00:01:34.470> travels<00:01:34.979> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
for is the tube that the oil travels it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.330 
for is the tube that the oil travels it
could<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.960> moisture<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:38.280> it
