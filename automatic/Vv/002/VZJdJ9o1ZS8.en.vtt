00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
mission with a slightly higher infamous

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.980 
mission with a slightly higher infamous
chance<00:02:19.230> let's<00:02:20.230> juice

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.800 

OIC<00:02:27.990> ok<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.860> places<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.730> card<00:02:30.210> is<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
OIC ok so it places the card is one of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.570 
OIC ok so it places the card is one of
the<00:02:30.900> three<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.530> still<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.070> choice<00:02:32.340> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the three so you still have a choice of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.000 
the three so you still have a choice of
three<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:33.270> up<00:02:33.870> tape<00:02:34.110> monkey<00:02:34.470> business<00:02:34.800> there

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
three I up tape monkey business there

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.590 
three I up tape monkey business there
which<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.220> pretty<00:02:35.550> pathetic<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.420> I'm<00:02:36.480> going

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
which is pretty pathetic but I'm going

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.890 
which is pretty pathetic but I'm going
to<00:02:36.660> do<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.990> more<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.700> hopefully<00:02:38.910> I'll<00:02:39.660> get

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to do one more and hopefully I'll get

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.230 
to do one more and hopefully I'll get
lucky

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.150 

always<00:02:44.930> go<00:02:45.080> made

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
always go made

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.820 
always go made
so<00:02:47.700> i<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.970> i've<00:02:48.300> got<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.050> wanted<00:02:49.530> I've

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830

so i have i've got the one I wanted I've
at<00:02:50.010> least<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.430> pattern<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> I'll

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
at least got the pattern so I'll

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
at least got the pattern so I'll
specifically<00:02:53.130> get<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> pattern<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.760> there<00:02:54.000> we

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
specifically get a pattern and there we

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.520 
specifically get a pattern and there we
going<00:02:54.360> at<00:02:54.480> dragons<00:02:54.870> play<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.260> not<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
going at dragons play it's not the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.020 
going at dragons play it's not the
infamous<00:02:55.890> item<00:02:56.160> hours<00:02:56.430> after<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.850> that's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
infamous item hours after that that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.990 
infamous item hours after that that's
all<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.570> these<00:02:57.960> spent<00:02:58.260> very<00:02:58.950> quickly<00:02:59.370> on<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
all of these spent very quickly on to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.020 
all of these spent very quickly on to
pretty<00:03:00.840> simple<00:03:01.200> items<00:03:01.550> slightly<00:03:02.550> regret<00:03:02.880> that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
pretty simple items slightly regret that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.550 
pretty simple items slightly regret that
but<00:03:03.240> I<00:03:03.300> am<00:03:03.420> showing<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.990> guys<00:03:04.110> anyway

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
but I am showing it to you guys anyway

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.990 
but I am showing it to you guys anyway
and<00:03:04.770> obviously<00:03:05.160> with<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.460> long<00:03:05.640> stream

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and obviously with the long stream

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.800 
and obviously with the long stream
tomorrow<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.660> making<00:03:06.990> all<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.440> money<00:03:07.500> up

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
tomorrow we making all that money up
