00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.299
 welcome to coaching a tool 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.210
 very powerful to achieve objectives of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.010
 all kinds that are now within your reach 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.370
 you want to know more because I keep seeing 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.770
 this video 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:25.969
 this 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:25.969
 [Music] 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 there are many definitions of coaching 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.620
 as many as almost as authors have 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.079
 written about it but to summarize 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 we will say that it is a tool for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 facilitate the resolution of dilemmas and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.720
 conflicts consisting of a process 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 conversational between two people to 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.839
 from which the subject of coaching 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 that is also called client or coach and 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.519
 discover for yourself new 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.059
 new possibilities new approaches 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.000
 solutions and new alternative paths 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:08.820
 within himself from the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.090
 which can put actions in motion and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.700
 specify them in concrete plans and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.009
 defined so that to solve 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.409
 problems or achieve goals and achievements 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.470
 which until now was not reached or 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.840
 I found a solution 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.450
 there precisely is evidenced the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.610
 great power of coaching versus other 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.190
 type of tools the solutions 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.450
 they come from the person and not 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.670
 from others from their own reality 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.880
 configured by what they believe their values 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.370
 by his skills his weak points and 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.440
 the influence of their environment so 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.680
 In short, the degree of reliability 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.680
 to achieve the objectives is going to be 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 maximum 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.440
 most important benefit that the 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.100
 coaching is the increase in the level of 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.470
 consciousness not of conscience but of 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 consciousness with going between the in and the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.320
 EEC 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.539
 what this means is to do so much 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.390
 we as our environment is not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.819
 visible is to say that throughout the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.349
 life we acquire beliefs that we integrate 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.230
 inside of us as something 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.720
 consubstantial and reached the moment we 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.060
 it is impossible to distinguish when they are 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.790
 beliefs and when ways to act or 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.819
 of thinking logical given the integrated that 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.370
 are in our personality is that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.160
 what we do to act without thinking before a 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.110
 stimulus a response that for another 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.810
 part we will always consider 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.299
 which is the logic obviously the coaching 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.810
 reveals that which is us 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.120
 invisible to give us opportunity to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.790
 we check it and if it does not favor us or we 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.940
 limit what we eliminate and that is the great 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.120
 value of coaching for example that of itself 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.130
 if this is not good for me 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.590
 It is not good that's contrary to the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.890
 good ways and so on in that sense 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.630
 extremely liberating stress since 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.480
 we discover why many things 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.940
 what we do without thinking and especially 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.060
 many barriers that limit us and not 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.590
 We know why and it also increases the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.590
 level of environmental awareness 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.010
 coaching is by definition change 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.530
 change and action is ideal for when 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.900
 someone wants to change things and not only 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.660
 wants to change them if he wants to 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.120
 get moving to do it 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.340
 How does coaching help in this? 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.770
 helps find the most important thing 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.530
 key to start doing more 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.410
 easy the search for ways to 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.410
 make it easier to break the barriers 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.420
 sometimes of laziness and sometimes of fear of 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.250
 the unknown that blocks us 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.340
 in that change 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.950
 and then do something very important plans 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.580
 concrete to get to consolidate that 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.040
 change to really produce 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.230
 and in all this way the person never 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.060
 he feels alone since there is his 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.350
 shell beside following the process and 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.350
 accompanying that transformation 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.250
 in that way of change it serves 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.180
 in parallel for something very interesting 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.949
 which is generically unclogging 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.510
 unclog those relationships 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.260
 sorry those decisions that we have not 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.510
 taken those locked relationships those 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.970
 crossroads where everything seems so 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.490
 embroiled that we did not find the exit 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.440
 and outside of this has applications the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.570
 processes that we call training 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.370
 that is, preparation for interviews 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.270
 work or negotiation processes with 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.039
 clients entrepreneurship processes in 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.139
 summary coaching is more than 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.460
 interesting to drive in the 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.460
 work and in life 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.250
 Coaching is a tool that 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.360
 accurate as effective for any 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.090
 circumstance in which we are 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.260
 blocked and we do not advance that the 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.050
 question is simple 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.780
 It serves for anyone who needs it 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.360
 and it's so effective precisely because 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.360
 the solutions are found by the own 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.729
 person with the help of the coach no one 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.379
 He tells anyone what to do 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.840
 I can have a lot of experience on such 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.610
 or what thing but my reality understood 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.909
 as myself within my 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.030
 circumstances of the environment that surrounds me 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:34.639
 of my abilities and my limitations 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.860
 it's so different from yours than what I 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.050
 I tell you, I repeat, even if I am an expert 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.009
 Well, maybe it does not work for you 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.229
 for nothing so the answers to the 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.120
 questions you will find yourself 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.449
 what makes it a process 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.639
 tremendously liberating for another part 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.430
 and also your commitment to carry out 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.490
 the solutions is more is maximum because 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.849
 part of you and not of anyone that you 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.210
 demand you find the solutions you 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.190
 you draw the plans and you carry them out 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.710
 but as I said before and that's the 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.380
 you are never different in this process 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.600
 just alone 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.750
 it's like having a guide a 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.850
 facilitator a brush cutter that 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.520
 allows you to move forward without the branches 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.170
 impede seeing what's ahead 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.710
 someone who in sum makes you homework more 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.960
 more bearable for easier and less arid 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.060
 that's for anyone who wants to do 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.060
 easier to travel in life 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.170
