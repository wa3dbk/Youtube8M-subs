00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.650
 In this video, I will show you the Giatec SurfTM instrument. 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.920
 Method for measuring the surface resistance of concrete 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.180
 SurfTM has two parts: the test device and the measuring device 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.359
 SurfTM can be used for standard testing as specified by ASTM and AASHTO 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.279
 Can also be used to customize four-point resistance measurement 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.900
 First of all, please make sure the line connection is correct. 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.189
 Now press and hold the Power button to turn on the instrument. 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.620
 The sample size is a cylinder with a diameter of 100mm or 4in 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.700
 Height is 200mm or 8in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 The sample can be cast concrete or drilled concrete core 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.150
 When preparing the measurement, take the sample out of the curing container 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.100
 Remove surface moisture and keep the saturated surface dry 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 Place the sample in the test device like this 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.350
 No need to squeeze the sample hard, then close the lid 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.600
 In the main menu, you can choose different measurement methods 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.680
 If you need to customize the measurement, you can choose Custom Mode in the main menu. 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.360
 Now, the measurement can begin. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.990
 Simply press the "Start" button to test 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.670
 The measuring device will collect two sets of data from four sets of electrodes 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.450
 A total of eight groups of average resistivity will be displayed on the LCD screen 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.370
 Please see the SurfTM User Manual for details. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 It is worth mentioning that the data is available USB interface 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.140
 Import Giatec SurfTM CNC PC software 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.790
 Software provides full control of the measuring device 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.390
 Software can also generate reports that conform to ASTM and AASHTO standards. 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.979
 Thank you for watching
