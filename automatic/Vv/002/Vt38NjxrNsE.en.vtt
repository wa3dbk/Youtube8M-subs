00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.849
 Let's get the protein sentence firmly 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:14.360
 It has a view me to say we can look protein King 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.099
 To study at the molecular level with the people who have the idea Tteyuu Let's trimmed it 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.789
 I am here but here 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.580
 Glucose as a representative in I carbohydrate is dextrose sugar with glucose I was like 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 Up low 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.680
 Rutteyuu rack's entered a lot to cheese butter 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 1 I'm say Cousin from that of you You're butyl's say Rua jealousy 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:42.870
 It is an amino acid that has been cut into small pieces of protein, but as a representative for knitting it 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.570
 The most important amino acid is this methionine 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.840
 is not it 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:56.020
 So this gene is the starting amino acid for replication of the offspring of the gene, this is methionine 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:01:02.260
 I think it is the most important amino acid if it can not be replicated without 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.010
 Yes I 'm translated I 'm not sorry I see this as you see it I see the color 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.130
 I want it 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.400
 Each carbon is black hydrogen white 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.270
 Oxygen is red and nitrogen is blue 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.210
 I say yellow 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.840
 There is such a model which is divided into leaf, but this carbohydrate lipid is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.840
 It is made of carbon hydrogen oxygen 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:31.260
 What's in this protein methionine is nitrogen and so on 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:38.010
 Because it is the person at the molecular level in the body 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:44.760
 The idea is that if you look at it you can not maintain it unless you take in nitrogen and the ocean 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:50.280
 Because we are there, we will strongly say that we will take protein well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.280
 Nante There are not that there is a distance Do not like Sugiga take of rice fields and go to talk Takehito 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:59.799
 It is me 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:05.590
 This is government statistics called field of national health nutrition investigation and national nutrition from there 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:09.750
 If you make a compound graph of protein intake 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:17.670
 The present of this is a form like this 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:24.720
 It Tteyuu'll not wearing day only at the same level as the 5 level 1950 Henan 1950 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 If I'm sorry I'm sorry I've been on the right side of the griff on the bottom of the graph below 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.740
 It is a graph that the left and right are low and the middle is high 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.090
 What is above is this 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.190
 Think that the period is short 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.060
 Oh I see eh door graph above I'm sorry the line of looks the two is this is gonna be men and women 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.180
 I wonder 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.760
 It is energy that the mouth is good 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.569
 Tea the amount of energy Energy from you the fact that I calories loose said protein 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.080
 More blue at saws It is intake of protein 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.660
 That Watanabe 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:03:01.140
 In the middle of not eating food because it is a Japanese that we say that that yellow book of the teacher 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:07.470
 Also I almost I'd come out this story 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:12.069
 Calories I'm Ingested Now my teacher talked about protein but protein 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:18.249
 Not only that, but also the average calorie intake 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:22.239
 Speaking of that almost postwar level or slightly lower than postwar level 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:28.140
 It is the whole image of the Japanese that only eats 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:33.660
 After all that without apparently also by all generations Tteyuu's right 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.660
 It's not like 40's 50's 30's 40's 50's or something like that. 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:44.640
 But in the end , women in their 20s and 30s 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:48.160
 I haven't eaten it, I'm looking at the average weight of women 20 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.330
 Weight increased by 30 years so much 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.650
 There is no slight increase, and the number of men is increasing. 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:01.240
 I'm obese more and more Women are almost flat plus alpha 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:05.860
 If you look at generationally , you will say that in the 40's and 50's, even women are fat . 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.150
 The fact that it is flat on average means that you are not eating at 20's and 33's 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.590
 So everyone got skinny Well 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.710
 Some people are fat, but when you try something on the train they're still going in their twenties 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.080
 Woman 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.340
 I don't see it, I guess it's still so then what happens if there's nutrition 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.940
 If you just get in trouble 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.080
 Kas panda Umashi just eat the company of people of out'll have that 'net carbohydrates and Ma oil 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.400
 Because it becomes 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:39.460
 We'll be talking Tteyuu will, but I will be out of not enough at all to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.330
 Wonderful nitrogen and ion remembering is so common you ask for hythiol c 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.879
 People who are listening to turn 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:50.719
 I is strange to say, is not it either Haichioru c after all that hate 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:54.080
 If you look at corn Cebu it will be cysteine 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:05:01.350
 I changed the methionine a little 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:08.190
 Because the person of stay is a component of childbirth, the person who is not enough for the dignity after all is 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:09.090
 Also wrote me God because it is lack of I will be genuine in everyday meal of Tteyuu hear drank it 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.960
 At the same time 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:20.070
 It may be said that I believe that vitamin c is working 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.340
 Vitamin c Also, because it can be made from glucose, it is made only with carbon hydrogen oxygen 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.490
 Because I have 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:30.550
 Since vitamin c it is in the human body in the human body make but does not 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:35.380
 It I will day to be that anymore To 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.710
 But Torre might piggy to be I think is that it is Yoga large upper called the Which selfish 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.710
 Right
