00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 and since I promised I got out on the street with 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.750
 by helicopter it led us that is you 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.350
 maiden 12 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 let's run see how it flies 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 how do we turn the helicopter on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:36.270
 equipment have contact on trust us 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.510
 there is there so we put a helicopter I hope 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:46.370
 we did not fail 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.370
 so well from here he will fly well drove 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:25.310
 the wind blows away very blows away so 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:28.860
 all falling I'll go get it falls 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:34.979
 to a large run constantly lake or 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:40.700
 on the river the temperature does not really allow 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 pass so be careful here 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:53.509
 walk so you need to calibrate because 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.509
 you somehow introduces 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 helicopter lips let's see what he 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:22.340
 I hurt myself on a helicopter in the snow 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 Damage see them not on try 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.599
 to treat 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:48.209
 sort of work one more attempt you something 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.290
 somehow all the way you lead to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.290
 I can understand what 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 so that he is not disturbed by the world something he is not 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.200
 can take off what is wrong here 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:59.550
 the wolf again saw a lot of snow there 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:04:01.810
 cracked up so the snow shook up 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.880
 let's just try something in 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.630
 I can not get something will lead in all 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.530
 sides of it 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.530
 calibrate 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:50.420
 that that twist something apparently with a screw 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.420
 try to return back 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:08.519

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:12.849
