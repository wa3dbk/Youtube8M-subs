the aircraft again pray tell is my new
aircraft<00:00:59.370> lots<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.940> loves<00:01:00.449> major<00:01:00.780> service<00:01:01.320> and

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
aircraft lots of loves major service and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.000 
aircraft lots of loves major service and
the<00:01:02.399> aircraft<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:03.059> put<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.650> engine

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the aircraft has put this is an engine

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.550 
the aircraft has put this is an engine
issue<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.659> related<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
issue and so this is not related to the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
issue and so this is not related to the
aircraft<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.189> looks<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> said

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
an uncontained and failure of the engine

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
an uncontained and failure of the engine
so<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.110> not<00:01:13.229> related<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.740> any<00:01:13.770> maintenance
