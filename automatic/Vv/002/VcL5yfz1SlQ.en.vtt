is<00:01:04.320> actually<00:01:04.589> different<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.040> them<00:01:05.250> when<00:01:06.210> i

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
is actually different on them when i

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
is actually different on them when i
started<00:01:06.570> using<00:01:06.750> maguire<00:01:07.290> ones<00:01:07.530> i<00:01:07.830> notice<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
started using maguire ones i notice that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000 
started using maguire ones i notice that
the<00:01:08.700> pads<00:01:08.940> come<00:01:09.180> off<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.570> easier<00:01:10.010> which

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the pads come off a lot easier which

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.770 
the pads come off a lot easier which
should<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.790> lengthen<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> life<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.660> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
should you know lengthen the life of the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540 
should you know lengthen the life of the
pads<00:01:13.050> himself<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.130> they're<00:01:14.370> real

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
pads himself because if they're real

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.710 
pads himself because if they're real
hard<00:01:14.730> to<00:01:14.820> pull<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.330> could<00:01:15.510> potentially

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
hard to pull off you could potentially

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.770 
hard to pull off you could potentially
separate<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.980> backing<00:01:17.370> from<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> phone<00:01:17.880> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
separate the backing from the phone so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
separate the backing from the phone so
that's<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.770> aspect<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.370> then<00:01:20.550> if<00:01:21.150> they're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that's one aspect and then if they're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.790 
that's one aspect and then if they're
supposed<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.690> let<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> pads<00:01:22.410> run<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> little

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
supposed to let the pads run a little

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.710 
supposed to let the pads run a little
bit<00:01:22.950> cooler<00:01:23.220> too<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.730> if<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> get

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bit cooler too so if you're going to get

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.660 
bit cooler too so if you're going to get
the<00:01:24.810> system<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.800> backing<00:01:26.130> plates<00:01:26.370> are

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the system the backing plates are

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.240 
the system the backing plates are
strongly<00:01:27.150> recommended<00:01:27.950> alright<00:01:28.950> let's<00:01:29.100> check

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
strongly recommended alright let's check

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.350

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
when I was first giving the system they

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.600 
when I was first giving the system they
didn't<00:05:00.810> really<00:05:00.960> give<00:05:01.110> us<00:05:01.259> any<00:05:01.440> kind<00:05:02.430> of<00:05:02.490> like

didn't really give us any kind of like
okay<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.330> gonna<00:05:03.479> use<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:03.870> way<00:05:04.050> this

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
okay you gonna use of this way this

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.029 
okay you gonna use of this way this
basic<00:05:04.710> set<00:05:04.889> here's<00:05:05.129> a<00:05:05.190> system<00:05:05.610> go<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.449> use<00:05:06.599> it

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
basic set here's a system go and use it

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.890 
basic set here's a system go and use it
any<00:05:08.039> feedback<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.669> have<00:05:08.699> went<00:05:09.389> sent<00:05:09.629> to<00:05:09.779> us

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
any feedback you have went sent to us

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.769 
any feedback you have went sent to us
and<00:05:10.340> so<00:05:11.340> basically<00:05:11.789> I<00:05:11.819> started<00:05:12.270> out<00:05:12.330> using<00:05:12.509> it

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
and so basically I started out using it

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.019 
and so basically I started out using it
like<00:05:12.870> normally<00:05:13.259> would<00:05:13.610> typically<00:05:14.610> i<00:05:14.729> want<00:05:14.940> to

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.029 
like normally would typically i want to

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:16.929 
like normally would typically i want to
speak<00:05:15.210> five<00:05:15.449> or<00:05:15.629> six<00:05:15.810> with<00:05:15.990> my<00:05:16.139> former<00:05:16.469> cable

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:16.939 
speak five or six with my former cable

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.929 
speak five or six with my former cable
polisher<00:05:18.919> after<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:20.009> think<00:05:20.279> probably<00:05:20.550> three

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
polisher after I think probably three

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.360 
polisher after I think probably three
cars<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.509> had<00:05:22.110> one<00:05:22.409> failing<00:05:22.740> around<00:05:23.069> a<00:05:23.159> five

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
cars I had one failing around a five

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.969 
cars I had one failing around a five
inch<00:05:23.580> cutting<00:05:23.819> pad<00:05:24.229> they<00:05:25.229> do<00:05:25.349> generate<00:05:25.740> quite

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
inch cutting pad they do generate quite

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.129 
inch cutting pad they do generate quite
a<00:05:26.039> bit<00:05:26.190> heat<00:05:26.370> with<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:27.360> high<00:05:27.539> speed<00:05:27.900> and

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
a bit heat with the high speed and

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.159 
a bit heat with the high speed and
pressure<00:05:28.909> the<00:05:29.909> wires<00:05:30.120> actually<00:05:30.599> recommends

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
pressure the wires actually recommends

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.670

you<00:05:41.190> can<00:05:41.339> definitely<00:05:41.520> do<00:05:41.819> it<00:05:41.849> but<00:05:42.360> after

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:43.279 
you can definitely do it but after

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.320 
you can definitely do it but after
