00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
don't I don't know where you've been
living<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:37.079> posited<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.770> only<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.160> life

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
living but I posited with only one life

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.040 
living but I posited with only one life
left<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.820> wasn't<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.239> very<00:00:39.360> good<00:00:39.480> demo<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
left so that wasn't a very good demo I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
left so that wasn't a very good demo I
guess<00:00:40.530> I'll<00:00:40.680> hit<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.829> retry<00:00:41.309> button<00:00:41.520> but

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
guess I'll hit that retry button but

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.670 
guess I'll hit that retry button but
basically<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.600> application<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.530> do

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
basically in this application all you do

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
basically in this application all you do
is<00:00:43.980> slice<00:00:44.879> fruit<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> little<00:00:45.690> more

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
is slice fruit it's a little more

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.420 
is slice fruit it's a little more
addicting<00:00:46.200> than<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> might<00:00:46.890> think

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
addicting than you might think

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.770 
addicting than you might think
and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:47.820> eventually<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.270> gets<00:00:48.420> harder<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
and then eventually it gets harder and

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
and then eventually it gets harder and
harder<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.260> there's<00:00:49.829> bombs<00:00:50.129> they<00:00:50.940> get<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
harder and there's bombs they get in the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
harder and there's bombs they get in the
way<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.750> miss<00:00:51.930> fruit<00:00:52.170> or<00:00:52.320> hit<00:00:52.469> bombs

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
way and if you miss fruit or hit bombs

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.930 
way and if you miss fruit or hit bombs
