my<00:00:48.850> best<00:00:49.179> friend<00:00:49.269> since<00:00:49.749> I<00:00:49.960> was<00:00:50.109> so<00:00:50.260> bummed<00:00:50.469> to

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
my best friend since I was so bummed to

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.520 
my best friend since I was so bummed to
see<00:00:50.710> her<00:00:50.920> go<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:52.839> was<00:00:52.989> like<00:00:53.109> okay<00:00:53.229> well

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
see her go but and I was like okay well

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.229 
see her go but and I was like okay well
I<00:00:53.559> guess<00:00:53.679> in<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.039> no<00:00:54.309> more<00:00:54.489> Caroline<00:00:54.909> being<00:00:55.210> a

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
I guess in that no more Caroline being a

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.149 
I guess in that no more Caroline being a
vampire<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.170> after<00:00:56.499> watching<00:00:56.679> that<00:00:56.859> was<00:00:57.069> like

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
vampire and after watching that was like

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.110 
vampire and after watching that was like
maybe<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.429> don't<00:00:57.550> want<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:57.879> be<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:57.999> vampire

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
maybe I don't want to be a vampire

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.639 
maybe I don't want to be a vampire
because<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.870> differently<00:00:59.589> they<00:00:59.649> die<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:01.649> so

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
because it differently they die and so

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.469 
because it differently they die and so
but<00:01:02.859> then<00:01:03.010> when<00:01:03.309> season<00:01:03.670> two<00:01:03.789> happened<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.390> was

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
they I think I don't know where the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.950 
they I think I don't know where the
writers<00:01:28.700> want<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.120> take<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.270> i<00:01:29.420> hope<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.840> they

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
writers want to take it i hope that they

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.930 
writers want to take it i hope that they
do<00:01:30.020> keep<00:01:30.590> amends<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.310> i<00:01:31.370> hope<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.580> they<00:01:31.880> do

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940
