 Because it is the time when it sees with the smartphone It is a little big when it is pc, but it is a smartphone 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:13.080
 So I will be a little small little 

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:19.210
 It is a size that fits 300 times 250 perfectly. 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.410
 For example, this is the thing above and there is a blog title and an advertisement comes in at the moment of opening 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.310
 I 'm going to 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:29.320
 That's 300 and 250 quite visually that Dawn and advertising enter 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.990
 If it 's a bit strange, it 's okay if you're an obscene guy like 320 times 50 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:39.700
 I don't do that for 3,500,320 times 50 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:43.599
 There is ok here it is 300 degrees 250300 250 even put it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.130
