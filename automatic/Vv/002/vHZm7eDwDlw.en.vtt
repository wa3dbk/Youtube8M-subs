00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this one isn't that's some nice speedy

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.490 
this one isn't that's some nice speedy
stickering<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:35.960> on<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.229> bottom

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
stickering going on there on the bottom

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.399

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
have these small cannons kind of hard to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
have these small cannons kind of hard to
see<00:01:50.610> these<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.509> they<00:01:51.840> don't<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.380> look

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
see these because they don't really look

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
see these because they don't really look
like<00:01:52.680> cannons<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.729> my<00:01:53.850> opinion<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.810> they<00:01:54.990> are

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
like cannons in my opinion but they are

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920
