00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.530
 one of the obligatory 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.379
 Motorboat equipment is running lights 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.809
 we decided to install these 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:54.110
 metal enough reliable well and in 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.710
 Basically quite beautiful 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.280
 convenient thing to power some 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.680
 modern new gadgets this 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.119
 car cigarette lighter 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.649
 we placed it here it is visible here 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:12.409
 through the glass in front at the same time 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.229
 I installed such a tee to 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.580
 all devices had exits from this 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.300
 the cigarette lighter is feeding on me now 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 echo sounder also charging for phones and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.299
 similar devices if noticed 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.350
 then the glass on this boat is a frontal 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 old enough 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.220
 we have not yet decided to change it already 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.159
 dimmed somewhere went scratches but the file 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.560
 but its main function is it 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:47.750
 the function is to protect 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.299
 from the wind at certain speeds 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.969
 motor resonance and glass 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.399
 we rattled him pretty hard 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:02:00.259
 decided to strengthen a little bit 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.979
 placed on the sides like this 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:07.009
 Stainless steel plank 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.890
 secured it a little bit further from the edge in 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:14.750
 the center was placed here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.630
 aluminum casing tightened five bolts 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.720
 m6 in general, the design has become much 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.230
 no more rattling on any 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.660
 revs 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.170
 now there is no convenient thing 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 diverting water pump we have it 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.490
 electric not automatic 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.250
 advised us to set the automatic 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.730
 pump means automatic when 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.850
 it turns on when water 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.190
 reaches a certain level inside 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.680
 boats these sensors say 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.830
 quickly fails and in fact 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.519
 pump stops functioning we 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.480
 put 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:59.959
 usual with the inclusion on through the instrument 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.330
 panel and here they placed it here 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.280
 detachable neck of this pump honestly 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.320
 saying baby have to use 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 Well, did not fall yet in heavy rain and 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.790
 the wave did not overwhelm the boat for fastening 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.220
 echo sounder sensor was quite complex 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.709
 the task was long thought to put it 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.500
 stationary or to have the opportunity 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.790
 changes in the depth of immersion in the end 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.070
 decided to make the most of course 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:34.610
 universal and placed sensor 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.090
 echo sounder on such a homemade some 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.640
 such a clamp with the possibility 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.489
 telescopic length change on 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.100
 end mounted sensor 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.450
 the clamp itself besides 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.079
 internal screws are screwed 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.840
 from the inside 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:57.470
 fixed to the bottom 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.410
 special casing on the sheep of such 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.030
 from metal all stainless 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.030
 so it is clear that there is no corrosion 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.739
 you have the ability to change the depth 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.550
 immersion in order to perfect 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.400
 adjusted and on gliding was 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.600
 opportunity 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.750
 also watch sonar readings ie 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.160
 bottom depth any less serious 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.520
 boats need a dashboard in my 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.150
 the boat she of course also has one 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:39.440
 the sides we placed the switches 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.740
 internal devices such as the pump in 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.919
 beak fuel level sensor switch 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:51.710
 the sensor itself is located on the other side and 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:53.090
 also signal from the opposite side 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.210
 we placed 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.820
 a thermometer that reports temperature 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.540
 environmental tachometer with meter 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.690
 motochas 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.460
 and the fuel level sensor itself is standard 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.729
 the transom in our boat seemed to us 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.910
 insufficiently powerful and reliable, we decided 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:14.510
 he was strengthened as follows 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.080
 one way from the outside 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.680
 the sides placed three plates 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.330
 5 millimeters thick aluminum 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.870
 inside two plates 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.479
 exactly the same 5 millimeters on top 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.020
 on a trance placed here such 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:37.480
 aluminum beam this was made for 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:41.230
 In order to raise a little motor 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.860
 to the required level this level 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.080
 considered ideal then when 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.150
 antigravity plate at the motor 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.300
 is a little lower than the bottom . 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.730
 bottom of the boat in this case 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.490
 the contact patch of the boat is readable to others 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:06:00.990
 less correspondingly less 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.990
 water resistance and faster speed 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.440
 This is probably the main changes that 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.740
 we put our boat 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.380
 there were of course others but less significant 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.930
 eventually use the boat was 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.060
 much more convenient now that little 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.250
 distracts from the fishing process 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.860
 but as they say there is no limit 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.100
 perfection and in the future maybe we still 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.780
 let's improve something and 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.850
 upgrade if you liked the video 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.640
 don't forget to put your thumbs up 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.170
 this is the best way to say thanks 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.580
 if you have something to tell on this 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.070
 topic to share experiences 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.290
 leave comments and of course 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.810
 subscribe to the channel if it is still 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.080
 did not thank you all and to new 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.080
 meeting 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:27.410
 Muse did not come call somewhere long before 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:35.360
 60 horsepower install two whirlwinds 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:37.600
 30 no why why look though of course if 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:46.490
 you sweep closer to him will be more convenient 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:49.630
 his best and you subscribed to the channel no 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.630
 well, what's the deal
