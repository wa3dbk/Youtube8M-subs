00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.030

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.570
 the post comes - the oil inside the post until 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.799
 It's more practical for us to work but this 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.600
 we will now see in practice here 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.259
 for you difference 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.119
 as you can see the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.590
 difficulty who do not have easy habit 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.110
 that really the cans then we have 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.509
 to have the danger is cutting the can the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.020
 Excuse me, a lot of pizza's coming. 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.110
 act pizza and uses mackerel but this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 It's not all this, it 's a bug. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.579
 fish that there was there popular turkey 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.740
 where staff picks up a lot 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.369
 sardine is that it does not smell here anymore 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.200
 you see 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.590
 it's all mixed up, it 's bone well 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.820
 O spine of fish comes viscera coming back 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.799
 ahead of the 1st sun 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.380
 come all side they take everything and dies 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.600
 all together 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 The smell is not good, it reminds me a lot of sardines. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 the strong smell 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.290
 the pizza is dark is everything the same 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.600
 it's a fish they take everything just had 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.440
 the head and the tail 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.090
 I gave it all and then sent it to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.580
 people people who came on the floor of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:22.370
 tuna talks to shishin and says that the class 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.030
 this is mine is the famous chai personal 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.880
 it's not a very fish it's totally 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.280
 there is nothing toll on fish and 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 ash plate was just shaken after you 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.560
 you see that the weeping ingredient does not speak 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.570
 that bound then is a kind of bug will 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.370
 to get you now the silent act to 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.200
 we're taking a look which is already 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.400
 totally different from ours and tea 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.970
 you will first realize that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.890
 here by the fact that 20 100 grams of oil 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.970
 Can not wait too long so can not 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970
 use a pizza directly 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.870
 Look how much oil it comes here. 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.940
 where I'll hold a little oil to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.200
 right to run down the hall to people 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.150
 will use and have that amount of oil 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.470
 when the use nothing has much look the people 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.100
 leaves a little running in a 10 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.420
 minutes in the drainer each one here as 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.640
 that the test but notice the color and 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.080
 if we are using is the atom of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.080
 grated seaside 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:33.020
 The thing is well the difference in the two 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.070
 drivers and take a look 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.990
 already different thing is act a cover of 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.820
 we do not find you thorn 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.480
 do not see a darker thing that should 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.290
 drag 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.060
 this is the sea ​​border another mark that 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.830
 I also like the grated tuna 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.620
 twist you see the difference that exists 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.990
 difference in grated tuna from 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.660
 brand as there are of any kind of 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.190
 merchandise are now go growers here 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.660
 to see that there is a difference between 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.460
 the side itself 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.980
 I particularly like the tor 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:10.210
 you will understand why the side now 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.210
 also the amount of oil that comes 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.030
 but I know a little bit just for us in a 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.250
 Look, look at the color of the tuna. 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:25.470
 the difference of the athlete side to other 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:28.380
 so there is difference and you see 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:32.850
 pieces and support can not 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:36.150
 find atom still whole yet 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.050
 so it 's kind of the difference that piece 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.810
 it's all 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.300
 look at the difference that here here 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:46.410
 Brazil from here to tea all crushed 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.210
 so that's what this is the kind of support 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.760
 I like a lot that is WTorre 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.180
 even being wrong with the pizza stays 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.530
 cool're here this amount does not 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.000
 to make a whole pizza here in 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.860
 São Paulo 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.389
 the staff have one act not all the pizza 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.930
 going to be she also said she 's just going to 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.280
 all 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.440
 this amount is that you can not do 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.300
 a whole pizza only actor but 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.270
 It was not for you, you can see what the 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.070
 pieces of tuna is an agreement to 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.289
 difference is better that we get the 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.250
 two sides what I'm going to leave here 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.300
 this is what we have the border and 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.310
 here we have another brand that 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.850
 authorize the very large difference is 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.800
 now I'll get it for you 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.810
 bosh that I am currently 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.169
 Personal packaging Flame stick is a 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.360
 English is the point to separate the 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.610
 next it comes only 15 grams of oil 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.130
 so it's practically the amount you can 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.930
 if you make 75 grams it is an amount to 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.260
 who are paulo we use about 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.260
 whole pizza opel pontiac 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.169
 So we open the time to make the 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.860
 pizza that is more practical april here 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.580
 the right thing was to play over the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.229
 Pizza 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.629
 I'll put it here for you, do not look at it. 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.889
 which does not have as much oil such packaging 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:06.409
 after 1 to 1 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:10.099
 now the difference between it and the 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.840
 the sea the stage the pieces in the 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.810
 big pieces too 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:20.009
 this was quite a big arm 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.009
 It passes in the head of the voter. 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:27.490
 So here we have the difference in 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.530
 two cans and oil oil 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.849
 I give everything here is how to choose the right 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.409
 but all here of oil then can not 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.229
 there's pizza here that ends my 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:38.800
 Your pizza is going well here. 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:43.569
 people have to play a broader role. 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.969
 who goes by the dust pulled dark my horror 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.229
 pain is not cool china is nice 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:49.930
 here I have a type of grated tuna 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.819
 you can see that there are two is to approve it 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.550
 also so then but only two have 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:57.789
 differences until kids sherry color is very 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.740
 more appetizing vine okay so I have 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:03.219
 here on the chip and last of all opash 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:07.060
 look at the product color difference 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:08.590
 so here we have there is education 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.979
 track of act that we asked for 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.979

 A hug to macau
