00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
or you can see the 3d mode which most

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.760 
or you can see the 3d mode which most
people<00:04:18.859> actually<00:04:19.310> prefer<00:04:19.810> or<00:04:20.810> it'll<00:04:21.320> give<00:04:21.500> you

people actually prefer or it'll give you

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.120 
people actually prefer or it'll give you
a<00:04:22.750> bird's-eye<00:04:23.750> of<00:04:24.110> where<00:04:24.560> you're<00:04:24.800> driving

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
a bird's-eye of where you're driving

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.850 
a bird's-eye of where you're driving
what<00:04:25.730> roads<00:04:25.940> are<00:04:26.150> local<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:26.870> everything<00:04:27.710> else

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
what roads are local and everything else

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.400 
what roads are local and everything else
and<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.070> can<00:04:28.250> zoom<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.820> zoom<00:04:28.850> out<00:04:29.300> from<00:04:29.690> this

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
and you can zoom in zoom out from this

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.190 
and you can zoom in zoom out from this
point<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.550> we<00:04:31.700> can<00:04:31.910> see<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.450> if<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:32.690> go<00:04:32.960> all

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
point so we can see that if we go all

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.420 
point so we can see that if we go all
the<00:04:33.290> way<00:04:33.320> down<00:04:33.530> this<00:04:33.740> road<00:04:34.040> we're<00:04:34.250> going<00:04:34.370> to

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
the way down this road we're going to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.860 
the way down this road we're going to
have<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.729> make<00:04:34.880> a<00:04:34.910> right-hand<00:04:35.450> turn<00:04:35.630> now

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
have to make a right-hand turn now

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.450 
have to make a right-hand turn now
that's<00:04:36.020> going<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.229> be<00:04:36.410> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
that's going to be the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.180 
that's going to be the
the<00:04:37.699> easiest<00:04:38.569> and<00:04:38.870> most<00:04:38.900> enjoyable<00:04:39.350> setting

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
the easiest and most enjoyable setting

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.540
