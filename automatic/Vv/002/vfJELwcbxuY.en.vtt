00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.180
 very good to all guys and girls and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome back to leo addicts show 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.889
 as you see today is going to be a double a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 lego boxing mini figurines of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.250
 series 12 the lego movie we already did 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 a boxing of this series last week 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.800
 I think it was and touched Lincoln talk like that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.869
 let's see which one has played today 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.660
 in case it comes out repeated already you know 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.210
 that on twitter we can make changes if 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.430
 you have repeated because you say it in 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.430
 lego twitter addicts show 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.770
 let's first take out the brochure that you 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.340
 I taught it from last week 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.010
 and see what figurine is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.640
 and in effect it 's the good police and the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.320
 bad police that is has double-sided 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 first we will mount the legs and the 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.620
 torso and let's see the details that 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.699
 bring as you see is a police torso 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.620
 with the plate the walkie talkie and for 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.590
 behind is totally black the uniform 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.590
 of police now we put the head 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.900
 that as you are going to see is double-sided is 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.540
 say is ahead from behind here 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.620
 we see the bad cop's face 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 as you see with the glasses and the facet of 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.270
 angry and from behind the good cop does not 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.650
 I explain why it is so drawn 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.740
 because it's a detail of the movie and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.620
 then you will see why 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.260
 that is because it is not a normal painting of 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.150
 face and the helmet that is one of the cases 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.390
 coolest I've seen lately and 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.650
 that I remember and the truth that he liked a lot 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.010
 Now that brings accessories 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.690
 figurine first we see the mobile phone 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.220
 I would block it is placed in the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.380
 right hand 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.030
 and that I put it like that so you can see it 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 better but you know what is it you can 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.500
 put in another way and finally the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.080
 good cop wives the wives of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.650
 typical of the ego do not have any 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 novelty 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:08.070
 now let's do a 360 view 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 degrees for you to see in detail 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.950
 the figurine here you see from behind 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.390
 and the double face to remember 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.940
 and ahead, well, let's go for the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 second a boxing of a moment I already have 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.040
 two figurines of this abraham series 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.560
 lincoln and this you have seen the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.500
 good and bad police and to see what has 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.670
 touched I repeat that if I get one that already 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.599
 I have the change 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 and well, he has not played repeatedly and he 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.439
 if not mistaken about me 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.720
 willy rifle bots yes yes yes this is the 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:50.690
 torso and legs 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 here you see now better it is a 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.140
 good time you see the face that is a robot 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.260
 of the wild west we put this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.030
 accessory and the face that is is a detail 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.330
 very cool face that is this color 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.970
 silvery like in the movie 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.710
 and it looks great doing the role of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.450
 robot from behind does not have double face in 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.700
 this case 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.910
 and now we put the hat that is 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.819
 of a rubber cap is not a hard piece 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.840
 of plastic 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.719
 now and the gÃ¼ero is also super cool 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.159
 the truth is that this little figure is left 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.230
 worth it because it is a hat that does not 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.670
 I remember seeing never in leo if 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.950
 someone has seen that I mentioned it but 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.049
 I do not remember ever seeing him and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.530
 now we put the accessories that in 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.480
 this case is the right hand gun 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.989
 and in the other hand we will place the set 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.989
 of dynamite the typical set of dynamite 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.380
 that bring for example the sets of the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.720
 rangers 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.020
 and now let's also do a vision 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.730
 of 360 degrees so you see the suit by 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.880
 front and back has details by 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.210
 behind also very cool by the way 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.280
 and now finally ahead and up 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.380
