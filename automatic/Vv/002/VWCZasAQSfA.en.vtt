00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all spatogames users I am 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.710
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 video dedicated to educated free results 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 team review of a player of 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 team decided mas consisting of that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.870
 quite old because now it is in circulation 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 darwin of sneakers that last year 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.140
 we had the premier and before that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.510
 we had that of the obesity team a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.689
 mouse consists we saw martinez 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.170
 Now let's go back to Italy with the player 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.900
 as alessio cerci del torino we note 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 immediately that has been moved to records 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 respect position from base card 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.469
 which was an interesting statistics 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.000
 let's see how it behaves in the game 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.390
 starting as always the speed 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 speed that definitely has me 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.550
 satisfied would also be too much for a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 trequartista because it is more anyway 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.270
 important dribbling passes the shot 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 for a player to play three points 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 however it never hurts to have more than 85 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.300
 speed in this case will 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.609
 even deploy it as a tip maybe 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.170
 together another to make the one two in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.150
 depth as you look for it to be 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.590
 good speed is good 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.210
 acceleration 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 what leaves a little perplexed what it is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 it is the physical strength that is definitely not 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.729
 at the top then move it enough 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 easily 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.290
 as for shooting here too 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 promoted but with reservations because why 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.820
 surely 4 st de ski four stables 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.020
 weak foot and is definitely a net 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.939
 improvement over the version 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.140
 also based on the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 finalization that I have deployed 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.700
 as an attacking midfielder and excellent I hope the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.299
 average of the various marin and armani et cetera 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.119
 etc 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.270
 but I was slightly disappointed by the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.520
 shooting power and long shot is who I am 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 quite difficult to score then 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.159
 it is not very easy to be a very great gentleman 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.720
 distance 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.880
 I must say, however, that I get close with the shots 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.740
 so we know how to do it anyway 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 rather than try pulling power 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 even the precision tea that is not 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.719
 not bad at all 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.960
 as for dribbling 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.610
 dribbling is great because a 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.350
 absurd ball control one 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.430
 very good agility and four stars 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.700
 sky so you can quiet 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.770
 almost all opponents skip though 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.390
 you are good at dribbling is one of the 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.340
 better if not the best standard a 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.810
 I have tried this year's quality 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.580
 curious to try his Christmas 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.340
 version informs that it could be 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.020
 dinner him but this is already looking for is 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 definitely a great player for 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.880
 regarding the dripping the passage 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.980
 I thought I could use a little something better 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.530
 both as a passer and one who goes to 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.750
 finalize the action so it's a little bit 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.180
 doubt whether to deploy him as a trequartista 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 but then we will see how to adapt it in that 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.170
 position the header disappointed me 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.850
 because it is not in degree signals though 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.110
 however it is not very high and alone 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.170
 meter and eighty then you could understand 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.950
 that he had been dedaj in this case 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.660
 put the shot and the pass or 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.100
 finisher in this case the shot or purpose 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.630
 head the favorite shot increase it 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.180
 why because there from some point in 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.610
 more in the action movie in protection 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.250
 shooting and shooting from distance where 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.290
 use cerci we were saying that 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.370
 playmaker is good but some 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.560
 problemino then medium-low of world 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.590
 therefore false attacker in this case 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.450
 if you put it with balotelli and ibarbo 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.970
 often you look for will go further to get 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.340
 so the ball will be almost like one 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.930
 additional tip sometimes even yes 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.790
 will go to exchange thoughts or with 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.580
 candreva with el shaarawy and trust me 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.320
 on the outside it can be devastating 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.670
 because because it can re-enter and pull with 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.430
 precision shot that really does not 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.430
 bad if you love this case then 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.739
 re-enter and then go to the throw 4 2 3 1 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.290
 with giovinco and cerci sud est also are 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.959
 very very fast and let's talk about hernanes 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.549
 that maybe the defenders will be attracting the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.920
 of the two external leave free to 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.600
 pull and armani there is a great shot 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.480
 with five stars pd weak then 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.180
 pull both right and left 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.560
 if you want to deploy it tip please 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.600
 pair them with another one 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.829
 player then a tip of cerci o 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.470
 however look for gomez 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.120
 surely he can't do the single tip 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.590
 because not enough physical and anyway 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.440
 I didn't like it when used 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.680
 also as 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.450
 9 in conclusion it has excellent speed is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.160
 a good figure finalizer who 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.980
 exceeds the average of the other midfielders 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.830
 and in good control the ball is 4-star 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.709
 skill and 4 stars weaker meeting than 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.950
 it's physical strength is really not bass 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.420
 suitable as single add and launch e 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.030
 they can do more the cost either 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.870
 silver in the 120 150 thousand credits a little 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.520
 variable but be careful if it comes out in the team 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.230
 has seen as standard to how I believe that 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.180
 will come out the price could fall 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.830
 fearfully so I recommend you 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.290
 wait a few more days for 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.060
 buy it then with today not concluded 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.250
 if video there is no comment e 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.280
 write the channel we will see you soon 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.960
 probably with the review of by 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.530
 Christmas in shape so we'll see each other 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.550
 soon 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.550
 Hi everyone
