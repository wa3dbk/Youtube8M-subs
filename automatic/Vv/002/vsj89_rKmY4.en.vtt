00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.420
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.629
 indisposed and we are in a new 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:12.690
 news I will be clear sincere honest 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:14.830
 and concise in the information this afternoon 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.630
 a new information has come out of 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.130
 assassin's creed juniti to me has 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.449
 caught in the gym that has only 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.900
 could give but well we are here to 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.999
 comment it and well it has been known to 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.079
 rather confirmed resolution 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.409
 Game official 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:32.380
 both in xbox one and in playstation 4 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.360
 and attention because there is outrage in the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 playstation 4 users on the networks 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.490
 socially injured has created a hashtag 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.020
 They are outraged because in both 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:46.230
 consoles will have the same resolution 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.230
 and it's 900 p and 30 fps 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.760
 of frames per second not 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.640
 the truth is that all right up there 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.050
 until vicens by vial producers 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.840
 of the game has made some 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.660
 statements in the videogamer portal and 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.580
 has said that the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.880
 resolutions in both consultations and the 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.820
 refresh rate on the two consoles 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.670
 because then well, although better said in 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.160
 one of the consoles you already know in 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 playstation 4 this feature could 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.660
 be better than in the other 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.360
 in conclusion that ubisoft has chosen 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.000
 maintain the same resolution and rate 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 of fresh and the refresh rate in both 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 consoles to avoid arguments between 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.020
 the players and what they have achieved is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.050
 that the players of 13 are 4 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 indignen with ubisoft telling them but of 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.900
 what the hell are you going if my console can 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.930
 more can reach the 1080 and the 60 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.680
 fps is you have recognized it and it is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.750
 saying you remind me of the game 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 for xbox because xbox can not reach is 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 something really illogical very logical 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.550
 and really people are angry and with 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.520
 what's going to happen then what do I think 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.039
 what is the playstation 4 users do not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 should buy at 6 kim hyun and you and 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.620
 ubisoft 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.940
 the resolution will go up and logically I 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.710
 I think this is going to happen that in the end 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.330
 six ago that juniti after what 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.430
 is happening that is very strong in 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.740
 social networks has created a hashtag in 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 the forums are trilling 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.130
 ubisoft install with the balls of 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.430
 tie because they are not doing the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:36.410
 things really well especially and the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.050
 true then well this will bring tail 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.970
 is going to have enough tail they have 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.070
 excused in that for good the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.610
 artificial intelligence in xbox all 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.350
 this causes it to be limited to 30 fps but 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.180
 but they have recognized that in playstation 4 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.680
 it can be better that he is cox and that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.930
 they have equaled it to avoid 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.840
 discussions of the gate resolution already 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.120
 you know what resolution you want since 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 the xbox games do not reach 1080 or in 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.770
 the vast majority of them do not reach 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.800
 2,086 said the 4 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.590
 the subject is very strong the subject will give 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.050
 to talk and we'll see how the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.030
 Of course, I as a user 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.480
 of playstation 4 that is the console that 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.150
 I have therefore personally and sincerely 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.360
 I do not like at all that in a game 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.500
 reach more height simply because 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.490
 the competition can not reach me it seems 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.850
 totally 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.650
 and logical if the girl can arrive because 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.620
 is not going to arrive or is it because I do not 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.850
 optimizes the game with the potential and 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.760
 has the console 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.240
 that's what we play for everyone, I started and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.130
 is 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.840
 so that's what there is I want to know 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.960
 your opinion on the subject is 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.530
 hot and strong and thanks for being 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.530
 there, chao
