00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
so my dog gets aggressive / territorial

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.690 
so my dog gets aggressive / territorial
with<00:00:09.420> other<00:00:09.600> dogs<00:00:09.870> when<00:00:10.230> we're<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.470> walks<00:00:10.800> but

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
with other dogs when we're on walks but

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.180 
with other dogs when we're on walks but
it<00:00:11.790> doesn't<00:00:12.090> happen<00:00:12.270> with<00:00:12.570> every<00:00:13.020> dog<00:00:13.230> what

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
it doesn't happen with every dog what

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.860 
it doesn't happen with every dog what
can<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.490> about<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.270> second<00:00:15.690> part

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
can I do about that and the second part

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.420 
can I do about that and the second part
of<00:00:15.930> that<00:00:15.990> question<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.160> tell<00:00:17.370> if

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
of that question is how can I tell if

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.470 
of that question is how can I tell if
it's<00:00:17.760> aggressive<00:00:18.480> or<00:00:18.900> territorial<00:00:19.590> behavior

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
it's aggressive or territorial behavior

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.600 
it's aggressive or territorial behavior
well<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.780> mean<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> second<00:00:22.590> part<00:00:22.860> first<00:00:23.190> it

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
well I mean the second part first it

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.640 
well I mean the second part first it
really<00:00:23.910> doesn't<00:00:24.360> matter<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.840> mean<00:00:25.110> like<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.500> say

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
really doesn't matter I mean like we say

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.370 
really doesn't matter I mean like we say
its<00:00:26.040> aggressive<00:00:26.430> its<00:00:26.790> territorial<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
its aggressive its territorial so I

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.440 
its aggressive its territorial so I
could<00:00:29.160> say<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> dog<00:00:30.210> doesn't

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
could say it's because the dog doesn't

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.780 
could say it's because the dog doesn't
like<00:00:30.600> the<00:00:31.260> clothes<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:31.650> wearing<00:00:31.790> it's

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
like the clothes you're wearing it's

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
like the clothes you're wearing it's
neither<00:00:32.969> here<00:00:33.300> nor<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.930> point<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> what

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
neither here nor there the point is what

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.860 
neither here nor there the point is what
is<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> dog<00:00:34.980> doing<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.239> questions<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
is the dog doing and the questions I

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
is the dog doing and the questions I
would<00:00:36.929> ask<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.190> dangerous<00:00:38.670> yes<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.300> no

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
would ask is is this dangerous yes or no

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.009 
would ask is is this dangerous yes or no
and<00:00:40.260> presumably<00:00:40.829> not<00:00:41.219> he's<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.699> going<00:00:42.120> at

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
and presumably not he's just going at

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.139 
and presumably not he's just going at
the<00:00:43.109> end<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.409> the<00:00:43.469> leash<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.949> I<00:00:44.609> would<00:00:44.879> train

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the end of the leash so I would train

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.599 
the end of the leash so I would train
him<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.659> to<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.589> I<00:00:47.039> would<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.370> two

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
him not to do that and I would do two

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.599 
him not to do that and I would do two
things<00:00:47.820> basic<00:00:48.780> classical<00:00:49.289> conditioning<00:00:49.609> so

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
things basic classical conditioning so

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.209 
things basic classical conditioning so
we<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:52.079> make<00:00:52.379> him<00:00:52.559> feel<00:00:52.829> better

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
we want to like make him feel better

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.700 
we want to like make him feel better
about<00:00:53.609> seeing<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.420> dogs<00:00:54.659> because<00:00:55.499> at<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
about seeing out the dogs because at the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.649 
about seeing out the dogs because at the
moment<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:56.249> he<00:00:56.370> sees<00:00:56.609> other<00:00:56.789> dogs<00:00:57.120> he<00:00:57.300> knows

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
moment when he sees other dogs he knows

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.959 
moment when he sees other dogs he knows
you're<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.559> upset<00:00:58.979> you're<00:00:59.819> gonna

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
you're gonna get upset you're gonna

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
you're gonna get upset you're gonna
tense<00:01:00.269> up<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.229> can<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.559> mad<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.979> him

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tense up and you can get mad with him

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
tense up and you can get mad with him
and<00:01:02.339> that's<00:01:02.699> part<00:01:02.999> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> reason<00:01:03.479> probably

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and that's part of the reason probably

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.500 
and that's part of the reason probably
why<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.190> being<00:01:05.880> unleashed

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
why you know he is being unleashed

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.050 
why you know he is being unleashed
reactive<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.830> instead<00:01:08.250> every<00:01:08.549> time<00:01:08.759> you<00:01:08.909> see

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
reactive so instead every time you see

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.639 
reactive so instead every time you see
another<00:01:09.299> dog<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.960> saying<00:01:10.110> look<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.500> not
