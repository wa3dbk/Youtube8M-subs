00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
me up I don't you I like this one a lot

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.640 
me up I don't you I like this one a lot
it's<00:02:21.540> very<00:02:21.780> random<00:02:23.269> it's<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.409> it's<00:02:25.439> got

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
it's very random it's you know it's got

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.940 
it's very random it's you know it's got
the<00:02:25.769> same<00:02:25.920> feel<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.310> this<00:02:26.670> tree<00:02:26.909> I<00:02:26.939> think<00:02:27.950> but

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the same feel as this tree I think but

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.710 
the same feel as this tree I think but
it's<00:02:29.069> using<00:02:29.459> almost<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.000> those<00:02:30.090> notches<00:02:30.329> I

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
it's using almost all of those notches I

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.000 
it's using almost all of those notches I
went<00:02:31.200> over<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.470> checked<00:02:31.500> out<00:02:31.680> some<00:02:31.829> of<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
went over and checked out some of the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.690 
went over and checked out some of the
trees<00:02:32.220> by<00:02:32.430> bdubs<00:02:32.790> village<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.459> it's<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.670> know

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
trees by bdubs village and it's you know

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.210 
trees by bdubs village and it's you know
it's<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.299> general<00:02:36.750> idea<00:02:37.500> where<00:02:37.799> you<00:02:37.890> just

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
it's this general idea where you just

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
it's this general idea where you just
use<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.670> notches<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:39.060> create<00:02:39.389> the<00:02:39.480> entire

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
use the notches to create the entire

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.869 
use the notches to create the entire
tree<00:02:40.109> makes<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.829> really<00:02:41.069> cool<00:02:41.280> design<00:02:41.310> which<00:02:41.760> I

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
tree makes a really cool design which I

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.170 
tree makes a really cool design which I
love<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.609> what<00:02:44.609> we're<00:02:44.730> going<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.909> be<00:02:45.030> doing
