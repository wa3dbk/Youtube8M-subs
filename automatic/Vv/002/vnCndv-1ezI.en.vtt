well<00:02:04.500> let's<00:02:04.770> take<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> look<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.250> what<00:02:05.310> happens

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
well let's take a look at what happens

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
well let's take a look at what happens
in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.850> last<00:02:05.909> 30<00:02:06.299> seconds<00:02:06.750> he's<00:02:06.899> got<00:02:07.049> four

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
in the last 30 seconds he's got four

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
in the last 30 seconds he's got four
archers<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> pretty<00:02:08.340> big<00:02:08.489> decision<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
archers it's a pretty big decision I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
archers it's a pretty big decision I
kind<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.360> thought<00:02:09.509> he<00:02:09.660> should<00:02:09.780> have<00:02:09.840> deployed

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
kind of thought he should have deployed

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.740 
kind of thought he should have deployed
him<00:02:10.229> up<00:02:10.349> there<00:02:10.830> by<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.360> barracks<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.660> he

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
him up there by the barracks I think he

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.430 
him up there by the barracks I think he
could<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.020> grabbed

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
could have grabbed

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.890 
could have grabbed
um<00:02:14.160> well<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:14.970> he<00:02:15.120> deployed<00:02:15.390> enough<00:02:15.630> to

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
um well as you see he deployed enough to

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.240 
um well as you see he deployed enough to
few<00:02:16.170> archers<00:02:16.440> right<00:02:16.620> there<00:02:16.830> take<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
few archers right there take out the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.590 
few archers right there take out the
laboratory<00:02:17.640> he<00:02:17.760> should<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.030> dropped<00:02:18.270> one

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
laboratory he should have dropped one

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.840 
laboratory he should have dropped one
more<00:02:18.810> Archer<00:02:19.140> at<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.350> top<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.640> think

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
more Archer at the top because I think

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.980 
more Archer at the top because I think
it<00:02:20.910> would<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.090> been<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.240> out<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.720> range<00:02:21.840> of

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
it would have been just out of range of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.570 
it would have been just out of range of
that<00:02:22.110> mortar<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.710> he<00:02:22.800> could<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.190> grasped

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that mortar and he could have grasped

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.640 
that mortar and he could have grasped
fifty<00:02:23.850> percent<00:02:24.180> but<00:02:24.480> hey<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.870> guess<00:02:25.140> he<00:02:25.380> was<00:02:25.500> too

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
fifty percent but hey I guess he was too

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
fifty percent but hey I guess he was too
stressed<00:02:25.920> out<00:02:26.160> or<00:02:26.340> something<00:02:26.700> thank<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> for

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.050 
role because the way this base is
designed<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.130> did<00:03:05.310> switch<00:03:05.520> back<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.790> it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
designed and I did switch back to it

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.880 
designed and I did switch back to it
because<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:06.870> just<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.230> good<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.740> my

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
because it's just that good in my

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.310 
because it's just that good in my
opinion<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.880> lot<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.390> people<00:03:09.810> don't<00:03:10.170> clean

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
opinion is a lot of people don't clean

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.190 
opinion is a lot of people don't clean
up<00:03:10.440> those<00:03:10.820> side<00:03:11.820> buildings<00:03:12.240> before<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.840> in

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
up those side buildings before going in

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.020 
up those side buildings before going in
and<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.920> see<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.220> heroes<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.790> all<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and as you see the heroes and all the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.340 
and as you see the heroes and all the
troops<00:03:15.210> just<00:03:15.450> decide<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.990> around<00:03:16.230> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
troops just decide going around that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.290 
troops just decide going around that
core<00:03:16.770> and<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.400> core<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.760> probably<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> most

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
core and that core is probably the most

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.150 
core and that core is probably the most
dangerous<00:03:18.480> part<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.080> base<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.590> is<00:03:20.010> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
dangerous part of this base it is the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400 
dangerous part of this base it is the
part<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.970> able<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.570> shoot<00:03:21.600> all<00:03:21.989> around

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
part that is able to shoot all around

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.040 
part that is able to shoot all around
360<00:03:23.010> degrees<00:03:23.190> while<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.360> troops<00:03:24.570> are<00:03:24.690> walking

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
360 degrees while the troops are walking

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.470 
360 degrees while the troops are walking
around<00:03:25.170> his<00:03:25.590> king<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.950> already<00:03:26.220> down<00:03:26.480> his

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
around his king is already down his

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
around his king is already down his
queen<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.870> down<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> think<00:03:28.350> I<00:03:28.739> can't<00:03:29.100> find<00:03:29.370> her

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
of this I first thing would have thought

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.720 
of this I first thing would have thought
there<00:03:46.590> would<00:03:46.769> have<00:03:46.890> been<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.310> sure<00:03:47.550> at<00:03:47.670> least

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
there would have been for sure at least

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.600 
there would have been for sure at least
a<00:03:47.970> 50-percent<00:03:48.720> he's<00:03:48.870> got<00:03:49.019> 102<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.430> he's<00:03:50.519> gonna

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
a 50-percent he's got 102 so he's gonna

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.430 
a 50-percent he's got 102 so he's gonna
take<00:03:50.880> down<00:03:51.090> then<00:03:51.390> build<00:03:51.780> her<00:03:51.870> huts<00:03:52.110> that's
