 very good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.480
 video in the video today I bring you a mod 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.630
 for mike crapo who edit the mod 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.520
 called more bow modalities in 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 minecraft or what edition and as you see 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.850
 we have the bow that shoots arrows 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.840
 fire 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 we have the bow that pulls tnt arrows 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.110
 we have the bow that shoots double arrows 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 the arch that pulls like the herpes is worth 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.370
 are no companies tend arrow we will 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 we transported and the arch as more 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.000
 whole load to the glass and then 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.830
 we have to speak as the default 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.740
 that comes to you in minecraft because 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.980
 normal edition with no fly to 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.980
 have these arcs you will also need 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.170
 the txomin and itunes for I'll also leave 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.080
 the video for cloud you load and I'll leave the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.140
 mod and the texture of these arcs is worth 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.030
 because if the texture can not have no 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.180
 you see the arches is also worth it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.710
 I will leave in the description 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.080
 and good every bow needs 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.930
 his arrow and as you can see if we do not have his 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.360
 arrow we can not shoot then 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
 well let's see who we 're going to give 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.680
 let's take the date is the date of 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.440
 fire is not worth we are going to make a list 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.450
 ex and as you can see we are going to shoot east 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
 and how are they fire arrow if 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.430
 you shoot for example a cow is going to 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 give the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.930
 cooked meat is worth going to give you the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.840
 normal meat good let's shoot 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 arrows of has skin we will catch and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.780
 we are going to place a stacks of dates of 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.780
 to have 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.740
 and we 're going to give you we 're going to have dates and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.470
 As you can see, that's going to explode 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.240
 for it makes great reach and breaks 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.280
 enough to buy houses or what 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 you want it serves very well we are going to 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.520
 use this bow that good and we're going to 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.490
 pass because this bow pulls dates 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.039
 doubles ok it's good now let's catch 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 this arch is worth Johnson and take the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:13.620
 arrows a stacks is worth and as you see we are going 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.540
 to shoot and those who transported him 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.730
 like writing us transport of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.459
 way the day of the day 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.100
 some teleports not and so this one to 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.890
 that we are going to take are normal dates 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.980
 like the bow or normal instance and throw yourself 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.470
 the strongest arrows as you see days 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.940
 dates 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.690
 that are going farther than the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.500
 others I do not know if the furthest and they are more 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.200
 it shoots better and better than when you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.760
 you shoot someone and it does more damage worth 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.840
 Then, well, I'm going to teach you 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.800
 how to install the world and the texture is worth 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.440
