00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.830
 part of Mosul 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.379
 we'll come before we have that 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.730
 whole spit on 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.340
 stanza and chorus and so on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 played and then there is just this 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.200
 this part was then twice the f 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.200
 so this 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.800
 play twice then let's go through 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.950
 click and then comes this way 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.150
 little interviewed for it now go up 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.450
 a yes to a normal emol that we 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.410
 we fight very well in my hannover 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.970
 Just play it from the top 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.910
 to the side and I have with me now 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.860
 the accord with death how do I do 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.370
 designed me forward you can times 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.370
 look where 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.670
 as backward or forward depending comes 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.120
 on what should the amplifier 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.120
 just has 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.550
 his 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.700
 I'll stop and play 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.950
 the gdg side always empty for it 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.750
 we have to raise this here because 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.450
 we namely have a mood 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.210
 yes to a normal d-dur finger 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.710
 second bunch on the g string ring finger 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.230
 Third were hair side middle finger 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.960
 second colorful page and now it works 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.070
 so far that we now so the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.220
 Idea says we have right now 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 I always played the g string 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.590
 the hair side as well as the side 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 now for below the idea so the e 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.280
 play a game once empty one 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.960
 hemmer and with the second bunch with the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.860
 second finger so with the one with 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.290
 middle finger on the second reason like that 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:54.400
 again the hair side and the 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.400
 So once the e 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.630
 Switch to the dike now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.170
 back to g string now comes 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.170
 down the side empty 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.390
 most of them then lift everyone 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.770
 finger one tries to calm that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.730
 her fingers are here 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.210
 so now the few page 3 now you two 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.790
 on the opposite side 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.660
 and now they raised their little fingers 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.580
 the three on the side 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.340
 now there is in the original notes 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.080
 is now the g string with this yes 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.880
 You're welcome to do that like that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.470
 then here's the index finger should school of 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.750
 But I never took it away 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.950
 can also play much the same as 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.150
 I just play the three 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.150
 have to know easier 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 So 3 has the two early didi says the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.299
 hair and the gisaid I do not know 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.590
 so now we just stay on this 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.200
 Just like that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.530
 middle finger on top of the 3 on the a 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.530
 page 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.159
 the b side 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.280
 and hhg 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.319
 and now we go with the index finger 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.030
 on the 2 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.030
 on the idea side 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.280
 so now 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 30 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.230
 3 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.410
 so now comes the 2 now i take 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.240
 everything but high 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.440
 the two are playing on the b side now 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.440
 the page comes empty 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.329
 now comes the phase would now empty 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.230
 the second bunch comes on the other side 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.519
 I go with the middle finger on it 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.519
 and now comes the hazel again 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.310
 now comes zero on the a-side and 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.620
 two on the a-side quite with the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.340
 index finger 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.190
 Now the g string is coming back 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.780
 the h page page where i am with the 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.360
 index finger lies on the second composite in it 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.640
 so now I go with the index finger 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.140
 a high on the b side 2 on the b 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.420
 side where still the middle finger 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.420
 not in it and the hair side empty 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.700
 and now comes the three above 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.710
 I do that with the ring finger and 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.130
 then comes the lower side of that 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.130
 next e 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.050
 b 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.590
 So you can the part a bit different 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.830
 still play with another hand with 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.590
 another gripping motion 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:43.550
 but I would so I have it that way 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.790
 taught with the years and keeps 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:51.020
 I just stop it while 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.040
 while now the acoustic guitar 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.010
 that they are all the time now 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.630
 plays through the plays 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.920
 plays the other electric guitar 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.920
 the guitar 2 is playing 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:09.869
 actually with such a bit of effect 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.489
 but I'll just leave it 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:14.339
 You can enlighten your guitar quite well 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:18.689
 listen to it so we go to the 2 

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:19.949
 on the idea side on the four cases 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.299
 that actually one can one so one 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:29.249
 want to take pedal yes and then so 

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:37.739
 have a peace 245 and now comes 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:41.759
 the two on the opposite side 248 then 

00:06:37.739 --> 00:06:52.159
 Let's start with the ones with the double 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:58.030
 solo, this then goes on with it 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:07:00.280
 but we do that thanks 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.840
 not now we play again 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.650
 very briefly the small part yes 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.650
 ok again for you together 1234 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.170
 No
