00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.560
 Y 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.940
 a winter day dawns in the us 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.880
 an awesome cold and we come 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.790
 up vermont a little south of detroit 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.790
 where, many years ago, the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.680
 ford motor company and we are 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.920
 precisely in the henry ford museum that 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.680
 in 1929 it was created by henri himself 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.870
 ford and by thomas edison I invite you to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.250
 know a story fort because 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.350
 let's see very little in a way that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.690
 inside but the history of the invention 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.690
 and especially the history of the USA 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.050
 one of the attractions of this museum is 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.000
 this long exposure of the cars of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.579
 the most important presidents of the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.769
 us and in this case it is not a car but 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.199
 a limousine pulled by horses that 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:04.809
 used teddy roosevelt and that was 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.809
 used between 1902 and 1928 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 but 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.570
 for 50 years lincoln manufactured 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
 vehicles or limousines for 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.340
 president of the us and this was the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.990
 first he started using franklin 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.480
 roosevelt and also used the game 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.670
 truman one of the curiosities we see 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.530
 is that at first I did not have 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.740
 practically protection are you a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.750
 soft top convertible which is 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.300
 they added more protections from 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 of 1942 when the bombing occurs 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.310
 Pearl Harbor was about to explode 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 world war for the us and 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.410
 obviously the president needed 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.410
 much more protection 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.600
 this is the link with the bubble roof 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.380
 that was used between 1950 and 1967 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.210
 mainly by the president 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.500
 eisenhower the main feature 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.750
 is this transparent roof that is not to 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.970
 bulletproof test but it allowed him to 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.549
 people can see the president yet 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 when it rained because you could close the 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.899
 roof obviously all these cars 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.569
 they still lacked one more protection 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.670
 important because the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.870
 facts that we're going to see that happened 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.870
 the president of the us 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.870
 one of the most valuable pieces in this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.630
 museum is this link with the built in 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.940
 1961 and is the original vehicle is not 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.120
 it's about a replica in which on 22 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.920
 November 1963 was killed john 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.280
 fitzgerald Kennedy but this vehicle 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.300
 It was redesigned and written several times 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.860
 and was in service until 1977 as a 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.020
 Although it was the author who died 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.780
 Kennedy is a museum piece like what 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.390
 we see now it was so difficult to adapt and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.560
 so expensive to all the technology that is 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.750
 put in a vehicle of these for 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.720
 protect a president who could not 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.080
 build a car until 1977 as they 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.080
 counted 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.540
 there is the energy section of the museum 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.549
 henry Ford and let's see that the cars 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.200
 electric hybrid cars all this 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.260
 technology that we are knowing now 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.569
 it's actually almost 100 years old and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.209
 They had been studying her for a long time 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.920
 for example almost a century ago the cars 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.530
 Electric were very popular among the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.629
 women in fact women in reform 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.629
 I was driving away an electric car because this 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.849
 allowed man to have it controlled and 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.620
 that the range that a car could travel 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.780
 electric was little then the woman was going 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.400
 alone to do the shopping and return the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.940
 true that example a divine with his 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:52.819
 woman in 1896 this tricycle was created 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.280
 electric created specifically by 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.400
 Andrew Rico with which he came up 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.349
 win a competition after which 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.530
 He also started working on engines 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.639
 gasoline but electric motors 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.700
 practically started before 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.829
 gasoline engines from 1920 when 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.170
 the gasoline cars began to 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.800
 become more popular the government started 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.840
 to regulate what was 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.170
 to naphtha delivery the naphtha office 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.260
 to consumers and it was in 1940 when 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.850
 these first jets appeared 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.920
 automatic that they could say at the same 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.690
 how many liters were we loading 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.690
 and how much you had to pay for that 

00:04:31.769 --> 00:04:36.669
 this is the corner of security in 

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:39.249
 this museum because in the 50's 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.739
 more than 35 thousand people began to die 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.059
 per year the traffic accident 

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:45.129
 then the automotive industry already 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:47.739
 he started working in security this 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.689
 of 1957 is the first prototype that 

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:51.819
 used to do crash tests 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.489
 but they were not done with davis or with 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.619
 dolls as we see now but the 

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:58.299
 Real people that really believe me 

00:04:56.619 --> 00:05:00.689
 that after the accident it ended very 

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:00.689
 machuca 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.860
 child safety also began to 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.100
 be a problem in which the industry 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.470
 it began to worry and since 1960 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.600
 began to manufacture the first 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.650
 attempts of what are today the chair of 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.650
 security for the boys
