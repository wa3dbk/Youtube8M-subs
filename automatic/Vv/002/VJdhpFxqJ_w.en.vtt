definitely a step for if we can get the
hell's<00:01:37.460> frame<00:01:37.759> rates<00:01:38.030> from<00:01:38.210> where<00:01:38.450> they<00:01:38.659> are

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
hell's frame rates from where they are

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.810 
hell's frame rates from where they are
it's<00:01:39.380> gonna<00:01:39.560> look<00:01:39.740> pretty<00:01:39.920> good<00:01:40.070> let<00:01:40.640> me<00:01:40.729> know
