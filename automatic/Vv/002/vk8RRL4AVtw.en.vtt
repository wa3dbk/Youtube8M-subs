00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.799
 In this lesson we will teach you how to delete a page 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.700
 or leave it without access. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.500
 We are in "pages" in the system. 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.733
 See: this green ball means that the page is online, 

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.033
 published on the website. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.666
 Let's say you're almost done with your site 

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.999
 and has not yet written the page "who we are" 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.266
 and want to leave it for now out of thin air. 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.266
 click this green ball at the front of the page. 

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.332
 This page visibility window appears. 

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:45.166
 Click "Unpublished. No one can see the page " 

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.566
 No one can see the page. 

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.632
 Click "Save." 

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.699
 See the ball went red. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.666
 Let's click on preview to see how it looks. 

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.666
 See: the "who we are" page is no longer on your menu. 

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.732
 Close this tab to return to the system. 

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:08.966
 The page exists inside the system, but is locked for access. 

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.399
 When you finish writing the text "who we are" 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
 just click on the red ball 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.200
 and change to "Posted". 

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.699
 If you no longer want to have the "who we are" page on your site. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.400
 Delete this page forever. 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.700
 To do this, hover the mouse over the page you want to delete. 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.166
 This line of actions will appear in red. 

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.366
 Click Delete. 

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:39.199
 It will look like a confirmation box. 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.966
 Click "Delete Page". 

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.799
 See: the page has been deleted. 

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.699
 It's all very simple.
