00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
so if I was to do a smoky eye put it out

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.439

the<00:04:34.430> brow<00:04:34.669> not<00:04:35.000> below<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.479> because<00:04:35.599> we<00:04:35.840> don't

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
the brow not below it because we don't

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.100 
the brow not below it because we don't
want<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.169> take<00:04:36.409> away<00:04:36.590> too<00:04:37.280> much<00:04:37.580> space<00:04:38.509> from

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
want to take away too much space from

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.110 
want to take away too much space from
our<00:04:39.319> eyelids<00:04:39.919> where<00:04:40.340> we<00:04:40.430> would<00:04:40.610> put<00:04:40.639> our<00:04:40.970> eye

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
our eyelids where we would put our eye

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.029 
our eyelids where we would put our eye
shadow<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.080> want<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.349> connect<00:04:42.650> these<00:04:42.770> dots

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
shadow so you want to connect these dots

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.800 
shadow so you want to connect these dots
and<00:04:43.400> don't<00:04:43.580> worry<00:04:43.789> if<00:04:43.879> it<00:04:43.970> looks<00:04:44.180> quite<00:04:44.419> strong

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
and don't worry if it looks quite strong

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.869 
and don't worry if it looks quite strong
because<00:04:45.319> it<00:04:45.590> will<00:04:45.710> fade<00:04:46.039> when<00:04:46.370> we<00:04:46.490> start<00:04:46.729> to

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
because it will fade when we start to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.999 
because it will fade when we start to
brush<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.870> I'm<00:04:48.020> using<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.470> blond<00:04:48.740> color

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
brush it and I'm using the blond color

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.640 
brush it and I'm using the blond color
which<00:04:49.250> has<00:04:49.280> an<00:04:49.699> ash<00:04:50.060> tone<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.690> it<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:51.229> it's<00:04:51.530> a

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
which has an ash tone to it so it's a

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.800 
which has an ash tone to it so it's a
more<00:04:51.860> realistic<00:04:52.190> color<00:04:52.729> so<00:04:53.419> I'm<00:04:53.539> just<00:04:53.690> going

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
more realistic color so I'm just going

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.570 
more realistic color so I'm just going
to<00:04:53.870> be<00:04:54.020> continually<00:04:54.740> grooming<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.340> brows

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
to be continually grooming the brows

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.999 
to be continually grooming the brows
with<00:04:55.849> the<00:04:55.970> brush<00:04:56.180> as<00:04:56.389> well<00:04:56.500> so<00:04:57.500> what<00:04:57.680> I<00:04:57.710> want<00:04:57.949> to

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
with the brush as well so what I want to

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.920 
with the brush as well so what I want to
do<00:04:58.159> is<00:04:58.370> make<00:04:58.819> sure<00:04:58.849> that<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.270> arch<00:04:59.509> of<00:04:59.750> the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
do is make sure that the arch of the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.080 
do is make sure that the arch of the
brow<00:05:00.199> and<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.530> tail<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.099> brow<00:05:01.310> are<00:05:01.610> the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
brow and the tail of the brow are the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.730 
brow and the tail of the brow are the
strongest<00:05:02.509> points<00:05:02.930> and<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.199> can<00:05:03.229> see<00:05:03.590> that

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
strongest points and you can see that

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.189 
strongest points and you can see that
I'm<00:05:03.860> not<00:05:03.889> overly<00:05:04.460> arching<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.659> eyebrow

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
I'm not overly arching the eyebrow

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.200 
I'm not overly arching the eyebrow
because<00:05:06.380> there<00:05:06.740> isn't<00:05:06.949> a<00:05:07.190> natural<00:05:07.580> arch<00:05:07.759> in<00:05:08.090> my

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
because there isn't a natural arch in my

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.999 
because there isn't a natural arch in my
brow<00:05:08.449> so<00:05:08.720> I<00:05:08.750> don't<00:05:09.080> think<00:05:09.409> I<00:05:09.590> should<00:05:09.770> really

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:10.960 
brow so I don't think I should really
try<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.340> put<00:05:10.580> one<00:05:10.759> in
