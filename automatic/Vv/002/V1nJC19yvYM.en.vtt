00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.599
 the Mexican rugby team 15 headed 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.660
 by rubÃ©n duque closed with a victory 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.759
 crushing 96 by 0 this end of 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.500
 week off the Turkish islands and 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.120
 caicos in a meeting held in the 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.129
 Mexico City that gave them leadership 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.040
 of the group of the North Central America 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.410
 and the Caribbean scourge of the league cup 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.910
 the international rugby board as well as the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.469
 undefeated to dispute the promotion to 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.870
 first division against bermuda in 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.719
 next August still with date and time 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.239
 to be defined with a 15 initial composite 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.770
 by many elements of great value the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.270
 Last game of the area was developed 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.100
 without complications and with an attack 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.289
 Mexican who left the bench blank 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.269
 of the Turkish and Caicos Islands with a 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.340
 top three-way scorer of three 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.229
 annotations through pascal 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.580
 I'm not sure that the two win the most 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.619
 previous matches also including a 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.330
 third against Bermuda that was friendly 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.429
 and it made us climb many positions in 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.940
 the ranking but this match was a 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.380
 authentic challenge with him 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 what it required in terms of maturity 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.310
 because we have had many ups and downs 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.860
 we had to prove in this match 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.320
 that we are able to play that we are 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.030
 able to compete during 80 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.470
 minutes here in what determines the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.390
 triumph is the determination he has is 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.010
 attitude and everything then I feel that 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.110
 we pressed from the beginning was the attitude 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.700
 is to form down us up and 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 it's a drastic change in mentality 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.050
 of the player we have put players 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.790
 new ones have had experience and therefore not 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.460
 it was easy you do not know a big sacrifice 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.460
 and little by little you are having all
