00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
it's hard it's faster than it's furious

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:59.639 
it's hard it's faster than it's furious
and<00:05:57.550> if<00:05:57.699> you<00:05:57.909> miss<00:05:58.209> a<00:05:58.240> step<00:05:58.599> it's<00:05:58.869> it's<00:05:59.199> kind<00:05:59.499> of

00:05:59.639 --> 00:05:59.649 
and if you miss a step it's it's kind of

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:02.249 
and if you miss a step it's it's kind of
all<00:05:59.769> over<00:05:59.939> but<00:06:00.939> we<00:06:01.539> can<00:06:01.719> take<00:06:01.899> it<00:06:02.019> so<00:06:02.080> you<00:06:02.139> can

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
all over but we can take it so you can

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:03.959 
all over but we can take it so you can
do<00:06:02.319> all<00:06:02.499> these<00:06:02.709> dances<00:06:03.159> she<00:06:03.429> just<00:06:03.639> takes<00:06:03.819> them

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
do all these dances she just takes them

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.670 
do all these dances she just takes them
in<00:06:04.059> her<00:06:04.119> stride<00:06:04.419> so<00:06:04.719> surely<00:06:05.019> each<00:06:05.199> week<00:06:05.439> a

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
in her stride so surely each week a

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.920 
in her stride so surely each week a
little<00:06:06.550> bit<00:06:06.759> hard<00:06:09.089> I<00:06:10.089> don't<00:06:10.300> think<00:06:10.689> it's<00:06:10.839> a

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
little bit hard I don't think it's a

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.569 
little bit hard I don't think it's a
matter<00:06:11.110> of<00:06:11.229> making<00:06:11.439> it<00:06:11.769> harder<00:06:12.189> I<00:06:12.219> think<00:06:12.459> it's

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:12.579 
matter of making it harder I think it's

00:06:12.579 --> 00:06:14.040 
matter of making it harder I think it's
the<00:06:12.699> matter<00:06:12.879> of<00:06:12.969> like<00:06:13.329> I<00:06:13.509> mentioned<00:06:13.869> probably

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
the matter of like I mentioned probably

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.499 
the matter of like I mentioned probably
before<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.559> the<00:06:14.709> shooting<00:06:14.949> the<00:06:15.399> suit<00:06:16.209> boots

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
before is the shooting the suit boots

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.389 
before is the shooting the suit boots
suits<00:06:16.749> the<00:06:16.959> song<00:06:17.199> and<00:06:17.589> what<00:06:17.919> suits<00:06:18.189> the

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:18.399 
suits the song and what suits the

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.339 
suits the song and what suits the
character<00:06:18.610> it's<00:06:19.029> like<00:06:19.180> it's<00:06:19.779> a<00:06:19.930> big<00:06:20.079> process

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
character it's like it's a big process

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.559 
character it's like it's a big process
it's<00:06:20.800> not<00:06:21.009> just<00:06:21.279> you<00:06:21.610> go<00:06:21.789> into<00:06:22.029> the<00:06:22.119> studio<00:06:22.539> and

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569 
it's not just you go into the studio and

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.239 
it's not just you go into the studio and
say<00:06:22.809> okay<00:06:23.079> we're<00:06:23.319> gonna<00:06:23.439> try<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.740> go<00:06:24.069> from

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
say okay we're gonna try to go from

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.149 
say okay we're gonna try to go from
level<00:06:24.699> a<00:06:24.819> to<00:06:25.539> level<00:06:25.839> B<00:06:25.869> now<00:06:26.259> because<00:06:26.740> you've

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
level a to level B now because you've

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.639 
level a to level B now because you've
done<00:06:27.459> certain<00:06:27.999> weeks<00:06:28.209> of<00:06:28.419> dancing<00:06:29.349> so<00:06:29.529> hey

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:29.649 
done certain weeks of dancing so hey

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:30.809 
done certain weeks of dancing so hey
let's<00:06:29.919> go<00:06:30.069> for<00:06:30.219> the<00:06:30.279> harder<00:06:30.519> routine

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
let's go for the harder routine

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.609 
let's go for the harder routine
sometimes<00:06:31.419> harder<00:06:31.809> routine<00:06:32.110> doesn't<00:06:32.439> come

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:32.619 
sometimes harder routine doesn't come

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:35.639 
sometimes harder routine doesn't come
across<00:06:32.769> as<00:06:33.309> effective<00:06:34.179> so<00:06:34.509> you<00:06:35.079> need<00:06:35.259> to<00:06:35.379> find

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
across as effective so you need to find

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.859 
across as effective so you need to find
the<00:06:35.769> contrast<00:06:36.249> between<00:06:36.429> lights<00:06:36.999> and<00:06:37.449> having

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:37.869 
the contrast between lights and having

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:40.799 
the contrast between lights and having
shades<00:06:38.229> is<00:06:38.469> that<00:06:38.889> that<00:06:39.519> makes<00:06:39.909> it<00:06:40.119> interesting

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:40.809 
shades is that that makes it interesting

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.779 
shades is that that makes it interesting
so<00:06:41.110> it's<00:06:41.469> other<00:06:41.949> things<00:06:42.159> about<00:06:42.309> getting<00:06:42.699> it

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
so it's other things about getting it

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:44.569 
so it's other things about getting it
hard<00:06:42.999> I<00:06:43.119> think<00:06:43.179> is<00:06:43.389> about<00:06:43.599> getting<00:06:43.839> it<00:06:44.019> right

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:44.579 
hard I think is about getting it right
