00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
oxygen equipment so now we've gone

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.149 
oxygen equipment so now we've gone
through<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.230> cockpit<00:02:41.590> we<00:02:41.739> can<00:02:41.859> look<00:02:41.980> at<00:02:42.099> a

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
through the cockpit we can look at a

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.119 
through the cockpit we can look at a
startup<00:02:42.719> to<00:02:43.719> start<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.079> 109f<00:02:44.469> four<00:02:44.829> we<00:02:45.010> have

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
startup to start the 109f four we have

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.949 
startup to start the 109f four we have
our<00:02:45.250> throttle<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.760> idle<00:02:45.790> prop<00:02:46.540> pitch<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
our throttle to idle prop pitch and

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.199 
our throttle to idle prop pitch and
radiators<00:02:47.469> are<00:02:47.590> both<00:02:47.709> automatic<00:02:48.219> so<00:02:48.939> we<00:02:49.060> press

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
radiators are both automatic so we press

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:57.119 
radiators are both automatic so we press
e<00:02:49.389> to<00:02:49.450> stuff<00:02:49.719> the<00:02:49.840> engine<00:02:55.290> engine<00:02:56.290> started<00:02:56.950> and

is warm so we open the cockpit then we

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.119 
is warm so we open the cockpit then we
make<00:03:01.780> sure<00:03:01.959> our<00:03:01.989> tail<00:03:02.349> wheel<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.709> unlocked

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
make sure our tail wheel is unlocked

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.189 
make sure our tail wheel is unlocked
this<00:03:03.819> gives<00:03:04.120> us<00:03:04.239> more<00:03:04.419> directional<00:03:04.870> control

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
this gives us more directional control

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.740 
this gives us more directional control
while<00:03:05.379> taxiing<00:03:05.909> then<00:03:06.909> we<00:03:07.060> check<00:03:07.239> out<00:03:07.389> front

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
while taxiing then we check out front

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.589 
while taxiing then we check out front
make<00:03:08.139> sure<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.409> all<00:03:08.500> clear<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.419> we<00:03:10.419> give<00:03:10.569> a

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
make sure it's all clear and we give a

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.870 
make sure it's all clear and we give a
better<00:03:10.840> throttle<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.379> start<00:03:11.889> taxiing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
better throttle and start taxiing

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.130 
better throttle and start taxiing
we'll<00:03:14.880> skip<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.210> taxi<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.630> move<00:03:15.780> straight<00:03:16.020> to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
we'll skip the taxi and move straight to

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.280 
we'll skip the taxi and move straight to

okay<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.350> we're<00:03:19.770> approaching<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.190> runway<00:03:20.280> now

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
okay so we're approaching the runway now

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700 
okay so we're approaching the runway now
I<00:03:21.000> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> make<00:03:21.900> sure<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.200> since<00:03:22.440> we've<00:03:22.590> had

notches<00:03:49.980> on<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.370> wing<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:51.420> we'll<00:03:51.540> start

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
notches on the wing then we'll start

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.360 
notches on the wing then we'll start
increasing<00:03:52.230> our<00:03:52.500> throttle<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.010> we'll<00:03:53.160> rotate

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
increasing our throttle and we'll rotate

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.810 
increasing our throttle and we'll rotate
it<00:03:53.700> 180<00:03:53.850> km/h<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.430> we're<00:03:56.550> going<00:03:56.700> to<00:03:56.760> be

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
it 180 km/h so we're going to be

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.120 
it 180 km/h so we're going to be
increasing<00:03:57.150> our<00:03:57.480> throttle<00:03:57.720> towards<00:03:58.230> 2700<00:03:59.040> rpm

increasing our throttle towards 2700 rpm

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.680 
increasing our throttle towards 2700 rpm
and<00:03:59.670> 1.4<00:04:00.300> atmospheres<00:04:02.450> we'll<00:04:03.450> still<00:04:03.660> be

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
and 1.4 atmospheres we'll still be

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.320 
and 1.4 atmospheres we'll still be
experiencing<00:04:04.380> torque<00:04:04.710> on<00:04:04.890> takeoff<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:06.240> in

the<00:04:06.420> 109<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.110> pulls<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.560> left<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.250> need

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
the 109 it pulls to the left so you need

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.950 
the 109 it pulls to the left so you need
to<00:04:08.550> apply<00:04:08.760> right<00:04:09.090> rudder<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.630> keep<00:04:09.660> it

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
to apply right rudder to keep it

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.770

straight<00:04:10.550> speed<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.730> not<00:04:11.880> an<00:04:12.000> increase<00:04:12.420> we<00:04:12.630> can

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
straight speed is not an increase we can

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.789 
straight speed is not an increase we can
bring<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.110> tail<00:04:13.290> up<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.560> tiny<00:04:13.740> bit<00:04:15.530> then<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:16.680> can

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
bring the tail up a tiny bit then we can

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.260 
bring the tail up a tiny bit then we can
just<00:04:16.950> hold<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.220> attitude<00:04:17.730> and<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:17.970> will<00:04:18.060> lift

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
just hold this attitude and it will lift

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:30.159 
just hold this attitude and it will lift
off<00:04:18.420> a<00:04:18.450> 180<00:04:18.930> km/h

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.749 

okay<00:04:30.740> we'll<00:04:30.889> continue<00:04:30.979> climbing<00:04:31.430> out<00:04:31.669> on

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
okay we'll continue climbing out on

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.369 
okay we'll continue climbing out on
runway<00:04:31.939> heading<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.479> then<00:04:32.539> once<00:04:32.780> we're<00:04:32.990> near

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:33.379 
runway heading and then once we're near

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.469 
runway heading and then once we're near
about<00:04:33.590> 250<00:04:34.340> Kaiser<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:34.819> will<00:04:35.060> retract<00:04:35.330> the

flaps in gear now if you were going to

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.330 
flaps in gear now if you were going to
maintain<00:04:38.960> your<00:04:39.080> climb<00:04:39.349> up<00:04:39.529> to<00:04:39.620> takeoff<00:04:39.979> you'd

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
maintain your climb up to takeoff you'd

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.860 
maintain your climb up to takeoff you'd
want<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.610> reduce<00:04:40.849> your<00:04:40.909> throttle<00:04:41.360> to<00:04:41.479> 1.3

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
want to reduce your throttle to 1.3

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.390 
want to reduce your throttle to 1.3
atmospheres<00:04:42.469> because<00:04:42.860> you<00:04:42.979> can't<00:04:43.189> maintain

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
atmospheres because you can't maintain

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.219 
atmospheres because you can't maintain
takeoff<00:04:44.060> power<00:04:44.270> for<00:04:44.509> more<00:04:44.659> than<00:04:44.779> one<00:04:44.930> minute

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
takeoff power for more than one minute

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.379 
takeoff power for more than one minute
before<00:04:45.259> suffering<00:04:45.800> engine<00:04:46.310> damage<00:04:46.610> but<00:04:47.210> we're

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
before suffering engine damage but we're

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:48.790 
before suffering engine damage but we're
going<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.599> re-enter<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> circuit<00:04:48.439> so<00:04:48.620> we'll

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
going to re-enter the circuit so we'll

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.589 
going to re-enter the circuit so we'll
just<00:04:48.919> reduce<00:04:49.310> power<00:04:49.550> slightly<00:04:50.060> and<00:04:50.210> turn<00:04:50.389> left

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
just reduce power slightly and turn left

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.869 
just reduce power slightly and turn left
onto<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.960> downwind<00:04:51.349> and<00:04:51.979> while<00:04:52.189> in<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.520> circuit

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:52.879 
onto a downwind and while in the circuit

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.399 
onto a downwind and while in the circuit
remember<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.479> can<00:04:53.629> use<00:04:53.779> the<00:04:53.900> horizontal

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
remember that you can use the horizontal

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:55.809 
remember that you can use the horizontal
stabilizer<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:55.159> help<00:04:55.340> maintain<00:04:55.520> your

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
stabilizer to help maintain your

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.610 
stabilizer to help maintain your
attitude<00:04:56.360> because<00:04:56.659> it<00:04:56.779> functions<00:04:56.930> as<00:04:57.289> a<00:04:57.319> trim

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
attitude because it functions as a trim

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.499 
attitude because it functions as a trim
so<00:04:58.310> let's<00:04:58.430> turn<00:04:58.610> left<00:04:58.879> on<00:04:59.029> the<00:04:59.120> downwind<00:04:59.449> and

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
so let's turn left on the downwind and

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.779 
so let's turn left on the downwind and
go<00:04:59.689> over<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.930> checklist<00:05:00.460> all<00:05:01.460> right<00:05:01.639> for

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
go over the checklist all right for

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.670 
go over the checklist all right for
landing<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.150> 109<00:05:02.539> generally<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:03.349> profit

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
landing the 109 generally the profit

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.260 
landing the 109 generally the profit
sure<00:05:03.800> will<00:05:03.919> be<00:05:03.949> automatic<00:05:04.610> but<00:05:04.909> if<00:05:05.029> you're<00:05:05.180> on

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
sure will be automatic but if you're on

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.929 
sure will be automatic but if you're on
manual<00:05:05.629> then<00:05:05.750> you<00:05:05.810> should<00:05:05.990> set<00:05:06.169> it<00:05:06.199> to<00:05:06.349> 11:30

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:06.939 
manual then you should set it to 11:30

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.459 
manual then you should set it to 11:30
set<00:05:07.939> our<00:05:08.060> rpm<00:05:08.419> and<00:05:08.539> manifold<00:05:08.870> pressure<00:05:09.110> we

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
set our rpm and manifold pressure we

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.709 
set our rpm and manifold pressure we
check<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.740> Taylor's<00:05:10.219> locks<00:05:10.460> and<00:05:11.029> for<00:05:11.599> our

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
check the Taylor's locks and for our

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:13.330 
check the Taylor's locks and for our
gear<00:05:11.900> we<00:05:12.020> put<00:05:12.199> it<00:05:12.289> down<00:05:12.439> to<00:05:12.590> add<00:05:12.710> more<00:05:12.830> drag<00:05:13.129> so

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
gear we put it down to add more drag so

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.300 
gear we put it down to add more drag so
we<00:05:13.430> can<00:05:13.550> get<00:05:13.639> our<00:05:13.759> speed<00:05:13.969> below<00:05:14.210> 250<00:05:15.139> km/h<00:05:15.650> and

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
we can get our speed below 250 km/h and

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.550 
we can get our speed below 250 km/h and
we<00:05:16.490> can<00:05:16.639> drop<00:05:16.819> our<00:05:16.969> flaps<00:05:17.240> by<00:05:17.389> 20<00:05:17.659> degrees<00:05:17.990> with

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
we can drop our flaps by 20 degrees with

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.869 
we can drop our flaps by 20 degrees with
our<00:05:18.680> flaps<00:05:18.919> down<00:05:19.099> a<00:05:19.129> bit<00:05:19.370> we'll<00:05:19.520> start<00:05:19.699> losing

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
our flaps down a bit we'll start losing

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.399 
our flaps down a bit we'll start losing
more<00:05:20.150> airspeed<00:05:20.599> and<00:05:20.750> then<00:05:20.870> we'll<00:05:21.020> be<00:05:21.139> at<00:05:21.259> our

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
more airspeed and then we'll be at our

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.110 
more airspeed and then we'll be at our
approach<00:05:21.710> speed<00:05:22.039> by<00:05:22.370> the<00:05:22.400> time<00:05:22.729> we<00:05:22.849> turn<00:05:23.000> on

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
approach speed by the time we turn on

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.089 
approach speed by the time we turn on
base<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:24.050> we<00:05:24.169> turn<00:05:24.379> on<00:05:24.500> baseball<00:05:24.949> in<00:05:25.039> the

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
base and we turn on baseball in the

base and we turn on baseball in the
runway<00:05:25.460> is<00:05:25.520> 45<00:05:26.120> degrees<00:05:26.479> between<00:05:26.719> our<00:05:26.990> wing

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
runway is 45 degrees between our wing

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:27.730 
runway is 45 degrees between our wing
and<00:05:27.289> our<00:05:27.349> tail

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
and our tail

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.679 
and our tail
once<00:05:28.249> on<00:05:28.430> base<00:05:28.610> will<00:05:28.849> start<00:05:29.060> at<00:05:29.180> descent<00:05:29.569> and

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
once on base will start at descent and

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.239 
once on base will start at descent and
then<00:05:29.810> we<00:05:29.930> turn<00:05:30.110> on<00:05:30.259> final<00:05:30.589> is<00:05:30.650> required<00:05:31.039> to

then we turn on final is required to

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:32.709 
then we turn on final is required to
line<00:05:31.430> up<00:05:31.580> on<00:05:31.699> centerline<00:05:32.120> with<00:05:32.360> an<00:05:32.449> approach

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
aim to touchdown at 160 km/h all right

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.779 
aim to touchdown at 160 km/h all right
so<00:05:39.800> we've<00:05:39.889> started<00:05:40.099> loading<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.460> gear<00:05:40.639> now

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
so we've started loading the gear now

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.760 
so we've started loading the gear now
and<00:05:41.000> get<00:05:41.089> more<00:05:41.210> drag<00:05:41.569> bring<00:05:42.169> our<00:05:42.289> speed<00:05:42.529> down

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
and get more drag bring our speed down

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.079 
and get more drag bring our speed down

so should be there in a sec okay about
45<00:06:16.360> degrees<00:06:16.690> now<00:06:16.990> we<00:06:17.050> can<00:06:17.200> start<00:06:17.380> turning<00:06:17.530> onto

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
45 degrees now we can start turning onto

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.910 
45 degrees now we can start turning onto
base<00:06:18.810> right<00:06:19.810> our<00:06:19.990> boat<00:06:20.230> speed<00:06:20.560> so<00:06:20.800> we<00:06:20.890> can

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
base right our boat speed so we can

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.790 
base right our boat speed so we can
start<00:06:21.220> the<00:06:21.310> sending<00:06:21.610> slightly<00:06:22.030> now<00:06:22.470> and<00:06:23.470> you

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
start the sending slightly now and you

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.260 
start the sending slightly now and you
can<00:06:23.950> also<00:06:24.100> drop<00:06:24.400> some<00:06:24.640> more<00:06:24.760> flaps<00:06:25.030> if<00:06:25.180> you

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
can also drop some more flaps if you

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.780 
can also drop some more flaps if you
want<00:06:25.450> to<00:06:26.040> roll<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.100> wings<00:06:27.310> level<00:06:27.610> under<00:06:27.760> a

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
want to roll the wings level under a

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.680 
want to roll the wings level under a
quick<00:06:28.000> check<00:06:28.210> of<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:28.330> runway<00:06:28.630> position<00:06:30.690> and

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
quick check of the runway position and

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.870 
quick check of the runway position and
we<00:06:31.780> can<00:06:31.900> turn<00:06:32.050> it<00:06:32.200> on<00:06:32.320> to<00:06:32.440> final<00:06:32.770> as<00:06:33.580> we<00:06:33.730> come

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
we can turn it on to final as we come

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.430 
we can turn it on to final as we come
around<00:06:33.970> under<00:06:34.390> final<00:06:34.750> you<00:06:34.900> can<00:06:35.050> adjust<00:06:35.380> your

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
around under final you can adjust your

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.540 
around under final you can adjust your
flaps<00:06:35.800> to<00:06:36.040> get<00:06:36.220> your<00:06:36.400> flight<00:06:36.610> path<00:06:36.790> right<00:06:38.550> and

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
flaps to get your flight path right and

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.800 
flaps to get your flight path right and
hopefully<00:06:39.880> as<00:06:39.970> we<00:06:40.060> come<00:06:40.210> in<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.390> final<00:06:40.570> will

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
hopefully as we come in the final will

myself with the center now on final we

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.570 
myself with the center now on final we
pick<00:06:53.140> a<00:06:53.170> spot<00:06:53.470> on<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.680> runway<00:06:54.010> where<00:06:54.250> we<00:06:54.370> want

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
pick a spot on the runway where we want

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.010 
pick a spot on the runway where we want
to<00:06:54.610> land<00:06:54.850> and<00:06:55.210> we<00:06:55.300> keep<00:06:55.480> it<00:06:55.630> in<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:55.810> same

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
to our landing position now so we begin

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.120 
to our landing position now so we begin
to<00:07:05.080> flare<00:07:07.350> let<00:07:08.350> me<00:07:08.410> do<00:07:08.530> our<00:07:08.680> best<00:07:08.830> to<00:07:08.980> keep

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
to flare let me do our best to keep

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.650 
to flare let me do our best to keep
ourselves<00:07:09.340> a<00:07:09.760> foot<00:07:09.940> or<00:07:10.030> two<00:07:10.060> off<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.300> ground

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.450 
ourselves a foot or two off the ground
and<00:07:10.840> begin<00:07:11.050> applying<00:07:11.140> fallback<00:07:11.860> pressure<00:07:12.100> to

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
and begin applying fallback pressure to

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.860 
and begin applying fallback pressure to
get<00:07:12.610> ourselves<00:07:12.700> into<00:07:13.060> three<00:07:13.270> point<00:07:13.480> attitude

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
get ourselves into three point attitude

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.760 
get ourselves into three point attitude
so<00:07:14.050> we<00:07:14.140> can<00:07:14.290> touch<00:07:14.500> down<00:07:14.770> at<00:07:14.980> 160<00:07:15.490> km/h<00:07:16.710> now<00:07:17.710> we

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
so we can touch down at 160 km/h now we

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.230 
so we can touch down at 160 km/h now we
maintain<00:07:18.250> our<00:07:18.400> full<00:07:18.550> back<00:07:18.730> pressure<00:07:19.000> and

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240
