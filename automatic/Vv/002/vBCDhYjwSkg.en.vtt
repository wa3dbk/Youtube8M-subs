you'll<00:01:35.000> you'll<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:35.810> at<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.200> little

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
you'll you'll look at it a little

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.349 
you'll you'll look at it a little
differently<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:37.579> go<00:01:37.729> back<00:01:37.909> down<00:01:38.179> the

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
differently when you go back down the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.749 
differently when you go back down the
second<00:01:38.780> time<00:01:38.959> to<00:01:39.289> actually<00:01:39.409> play<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.799> game<00:01:40.159> or

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
second time to actually play the game or

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.419 
second time to actually play the game or
or<00:01:41.569> will<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:41.810> be<00:01:41.929> actually<00:01:42.530> no<00:01:42.920> business<00:01:43.280> as

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429
