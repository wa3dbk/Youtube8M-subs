00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Hi everyone new video and it's about 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.049
 a video 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 what a strange thing I am not doing the usual 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.730
 premise and childbirth let you see what 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.400
 I bought I was from max and I am 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.460
 been from sephora I went to mark 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 because I wanted to try the little things of the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 new collections really have not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.820
 found everything as it always happens then 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.189
 having no sky near card way 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.109
 to go there just when the new one 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 collection comes out, in short, are 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 managed to find different things and they are 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 happy to leave immediately to show 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.120
 the year before you see things 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 of the new collections I managed to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
 find this lipsticks know I was aiming for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.610
 from a bag and that of the line 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.530
 retro matt and is the king lansley 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.989
 red I don't think I said it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 right however this is the color 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.399
 unpronounceable but really beautiful 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.559
 which is part of the retro mats 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 so they should be the ones who 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.079
 they are even harder to spread 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.660
 on the lips but that last a lot e 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 that remain very much matteo board 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.040
 I've seen it in so many videos and I was 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.260
 in love and I managed to find him 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
 finally, however , I have this name 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.869
 still showed this beautiful 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.110
 color that is is not a red ie a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 red strawberry pink is very special 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.189
 and rejected is fired really a chante 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.340
 super beautiful color for the summer 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.450
 totally matt and that's it but that while 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.310
 the needle swatch I did almost hard to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 reject it so I'll have to use it 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.299
 definitely putting ourselves under a good one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.820
 cocoa butter but this one came out 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.399
 very very pretty collection that has the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.770
 packaging with all these droplets 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.780
 of water among other things are the relief 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.970
 so i'm just chat and own 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.399
 the deposited and beautiful water vi 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.020
 attracts time of festivol packaging though 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.450
 you also liked the products very much 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.079
 in fact the one I took is the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 broadband powder and is the refined gold is 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.110
 practically it is 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.440
 and beautiful, I repeat the packaging 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.709
 however it will do a lot of reflection anyway 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.680
 is this beautiful gorgeous browser it is 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.600
 slightly glittery but I am 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.360
 did apply in the store and I have to say 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.700
 that really alone this aspect of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.640
 healthy color is illuminating here is wrong 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.590
 well to make us contouring however just 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.959
 put in this area is almost as good as 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.250
 blush because it gives you just that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.590
 illuminating effect of bread cheeks 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.570
 once there is no use 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.420
 not even going to apply illuminating 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.640
 then later on I also have this collection 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.180
 got a little one this is called 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.060
 extra dimension fi and shadow eyeshadow e 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.709
 I took the color lore her 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.410
 I hope to pronounce them right if not 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.290
 correct me and that's pretty much it 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.230
 beautiful color suitable for a game from 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.660
 everyday packaging again 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.340
 wonderful that I really like it is 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.410
 this can be used here either 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.630
 as enlightening that just like 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.730
 fast eyeshadow everyday e 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.420
 you know that in this period the tricks 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.950
 my matte is quick but bright 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 so when i saw it i couldn't 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.180
 rom take it and then I was 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.709
 very lucky because I found the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.500
 lipsticks know that attracted me already since 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:27.750
 site is always in this collection is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.489
 this is a crime so the finish here 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.890
 one of the favorite for finisher 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.530
 regarding the max lipsticks after i 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.329
 map and we will see later if they will also chase me 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980
 found this here that i took is the 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.890
 first and I can't wait to try it 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.870
 however of this collection or creed 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.600
 this beautiful color that is called 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:52.269
 gold golden foot godet guests leave you 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.060
 the name and it is this beautiful purple that 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.329
 but in fact it is a film so it remains 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.840
 very soft on the lips and pigmented 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:03.100
 at the right point it is not so scary 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 as you see it in 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.320
 in packaging it is still a violet with a 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.290
 blue undertone that surely tends to 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.180
 make your teeth whiter and finally 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.580
 I wanted a lot and lipsticks of the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.180
 new collection the maleficent one 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.580
 mallett fitschen due to pronounce it 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.310
 however, the one dedicated to the new film 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.510
 of the disney that to this packaging 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.820
 cute with the two are two eagles 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.280
 actually these some cross me 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.560
 I thought this bat is okay to 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.690
 this cute packaging of course 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.330
 effects had sold out in a 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.910
 moment I didn't try them but I did 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.890
 consoled in quotation marks because in 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.830
 actually I wanted it I wanted this too from 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:51.940
 site does not come out and I took this here 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:55.300
 which is practically casting powder 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.420
 so it should be a land but for 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.640
 to count ying as there is only one 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.320
 color however is this color is too much 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.290
 clear for me to go and do the 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.030
 contouring but I will definitely use it 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.580
 like powder instead of mine 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.000
 mineralize on TV that is almost over 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.360
 because it has the color of my own 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.310
 embodied and very very matt to a back 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.130
 tone that I think is really good with 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.380
 any kind of complexion though 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.080
 precisely if you have a little dark 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.390
 I think it's okay to do almost da 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.520
 cinzia rather than from the ground for the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.710
 contouring because you would not see much 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.410
 this is the state with dates and dates 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:38.440
 finally found the chocolate bar 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.710
 that I think I wanted more or less from 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.510
 when it was March this palette is 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.600
 very happy I found it from writing 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.150
 inside the cranes in turin so if 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.310
 you can't find it there there were several a 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.040
 for the prices said that I don't take them 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.570
 remember this should be 44 90 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.600
 but all the rest is number 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.920
 remembered I'll leave it in the info 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.200
 box below the video 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.110
 however this is the very famous here 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.230
 chocolate palestine that by now 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.960
 you really have seen in any video 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.300
 I though I did not have and the good ones 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.660
 I could start making me miss one 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.770
 palette so fantastic you April 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.840
 practically, that is, it releases chocolate 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.750
 this stake and anyway to all these 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.000
 colors that are quite neutral and there 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.970
 however, they are also grayscale violets 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.220
 the only thing missing is a black in my opinion 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.860
 the nice thing about this palette is that there 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.220
 I am both amat and opaque then 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.050
 surely it can be exploited very well e 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.660
 it can also be an excellent stick from 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.790
 travel and finally if you come to you though 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.920
 I think this other little face to face 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.150
 which is what is called 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.340
 bonjour soleil 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:55.870
 and it is a limited edition that contains 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:58.270
 all their bronze bar more lablache more 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.840
 famous we say it is made this way 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:05.740
 I also look for a brush and here for 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.840
 example to the chocolate browser she who 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.320
 it is the very famous one 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.440
 here is the sun bagni and natural browser e 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.950
 then here I am practically enlightening 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.860
 bronze blush so you can mix them 

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:23.620
 that use them separately in my opinion 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.480
 it is a beautiful wall and this too 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.150
 Crusade dilates in fact so it is 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.830
 so convenient for travel so these 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.650
 they were all my last purchases 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.440
 period with the new collections released 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.630
 in short, for spring summer we say 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.180
 let me know if you have too 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.980
 bought something from these collections or 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.410
 however, if there are any products there 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.600
 they attract that you have already tried 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.730
 in short, as always let me know everything 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.680
 in the comments below I hope to 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.090
 having kept us company in us 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.870
 see you at the next video 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.870
 Hello
