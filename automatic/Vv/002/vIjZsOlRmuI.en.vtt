just keep on going like a normal rope
braid<00:03:24.520> so<00:03:25.330> you<00:03:25.390> twist<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:28.300> the<00:03:28.420> right<00:03:28.600> and

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
braid so you twist it to the right and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.910 
braid so you twist it to the right and
you<00:03:29.680> go<00:03:29.800> over<00:03:30.240> on<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.450> left<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:32.650> you<00:03:32.740> just

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
you go over on the left and you just

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.490 
you go over on the left and you just
keep<00:03:33.160> on<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:34.080> till<00:03:35.080> you<00:03:35.140> feel<00:03:35.320> like

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
keep on going till you feel like

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.770 
keep on going till you feel like
stopping<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.190> course<00:03:36.460> you<00:03:37.390> should<00:03:37.570> probably

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
stopping of course you should probably

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.200 
stopping of course you should probably
stop<00:03:38.320> if<00:03:38.620> your<00:03:39.250> hair<00:03:39.430> starting<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.850> come<00:03:40.030> out

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
stop if your hair starting to come out

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.030 
stop if your hair starting to come out
like<00:03:40.600> if<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.960> have<00:03:41.050> layers<00:03:41.320> that's<00:03:41.710> probably

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
like if you have layers that's probably

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.150 
like if you have layers that's probably
going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.280> happen<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:43.770> really<00:03:44.770> think<00:03:45.070> this

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
going to happen I really think this

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.000 
going to happen I really think this
braid<00:03:45.430> looks<00:03:45.640> good<00:03:45.940> when<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.210> have<00:03:46.650> they<00:03:47.650> care

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
braid looks good when you have they care

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.450 
braid looks good when you have they care
because<00:03:48.910> then<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:50.080> can<00:03:50.230> really<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.100> big

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
because then you can really have a big

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.120 
because then you can really have a big
rope<00:03:51.970> braid<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.800> also<00:03:53.800> if<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.010> have<00:03:54.100> a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
rope braid and also if you have a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.250 
rope braid and also if you have a
light-colored<00:03:54.430> hair<00:03:54.850> it's<00:03:55.450> easier<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.020> see

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
light-colored hair it's easier to see

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.520 
light-colored hair it's easier to see
the<00:03:56.310> braid<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.870> think<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:58.990> looks<00:03:59.170> nice<00:03:59.380> like

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
the braid I think it looks nice like

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.760 
the braid I think it looks nice like
that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
that

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.650 
that
you<00:04:00.520> have<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.760> make<00:04:00.940> sure<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.240> keep<00:04:01.480> on

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
you have to make sure you keep on

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.420 
you have to make sure you keep on
twisting<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.320> opposite<00:04:02.710> direction<00:04:02.860> or

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
twisting it the opposite direction or

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.120 
twisting it the opposite direction or
else<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.210> twisting<00:04:04.800> twisting<00:04:05.800> thing<00:04:06.010> is

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
else the twisting twisting thing is

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:14.810 
else the twisting twisting thing is
going<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.400> come<00:04:06.580> out<00:04:06.730> once<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.720> go<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.930> tie<00:04:08.260> it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.190 

okay<00:04:15.820> once<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.239> don't<00:04:16.420> feel<00:04:16.690> like<00:04:16.840> doing<00:04:17.080> it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
okay once you don't feel like doing it

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.340 
okay once you don't feel like doing it
anymore<00:04:17.230> when<00:04:18.220> there's<00:04:18.459> no<00:04:18.670> more<00:04:18.850> hair<00:04:19.090> left

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
anymore when there's no more hair left

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:30.850 
anymore when there's no more hair left
using<00:04:20.350> elastic

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.140 

and<00:04:31.130> just<00:04:31.610> secure<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.000> at<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.240> end<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:34.970> is

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
and just secure it at the end so this is

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.810 
and just secure it at the end so this is
how<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.330> do<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.570> rope<00:04:35.840> braid<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:37.280> French<00:04:37.610> twist

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
how you do a rope braid the French twist

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.480 
how you do a rope braid the French twist
into<00:04:38.180> rope
