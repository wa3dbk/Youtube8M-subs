00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to see how it turns out and I have three

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
something more tame their black in the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
something more tame their black in the
middle<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.009> wide<00:01:28.549> or<00:01:30.290> maybe<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
middle and wide or maybe and all of the
