 close to the villains who are in every way 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.059
 trying to ruin the life of his enemy 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.730
 masks or completely change their appearance 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 Reed Richards may not just 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 Put on a coat and hat which he 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.710
 showing all their green faces and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.210
 such cases were very much here 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.210
 I'll show you at least a couple of examples. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.770

 give him with wings up to maybe 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.190
 since flash is fast his face is not 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.110
 has time to recognize but what about those 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.580
 cases when jay started people in his arms 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.590
 or until he ran all the time 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.549
 does he run besides 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.560
