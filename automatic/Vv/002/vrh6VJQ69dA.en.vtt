this nice little tutorial on how to get
on<00:00:14.789> the<00:00:15.000> terminal<00:00:15.299> plane<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.139> modern<00:00:16.619> warfare

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
on the terminal plane and modern warfare

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.069 
on the terminal plane and modern warfare
3<00:00:16.919> this<00:00:17.310> works<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.669> model<00:00:17.880> warfare<00:00:18.119> 2<00:00:18.270> also<00:00:18.509> so

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:19.079 
3 this works a model warfare 2 also so

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.640 
3 this works a model warfare 2 also so
be<00:00:19.430> feeling<00:00:20.430> free<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.119> both<00:00:21.270> games

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
be feeling free to do it in both games

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.979 
be feeling free to do it in both games
so<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> start<00:00:23.009> off<00:00:23.239> it's<00:00:24.239> actually<00:00:24.509> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
simple i can get a first try every time

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.200 
simple i can get a first try every time
now<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.899> jump<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.469> like<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:28.739> right<00:00:29.520> about<00:00:29.730> here

rights completely then your top

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.370 
rights completely then your top
crosshair<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.060> need<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> watch<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.540> until

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
crosshair you need to watch it until

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.650 
crosshair you need to watch it until
your<00:00:46.710> top<00:00:46.920> crosshair<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.850> right<00:00:48.180> there

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
your top crosshair is about right there

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.319 
your top crosshair is about right there
below<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.350> f<00:00:49.579> possibly<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.880> further<00:00:51.090> up

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
below the f possibly a little further up

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.479 
below the f possibly a little further up
it<00:00:51.450> doesn't<00:00:51.540> really<00:00:51.780> matter<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:53.220> from

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
it doesn't really matter and now from

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.280 
it doesn't really matter and now from
here<00:00:53.520> you're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> need<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.720> press<00:00:55.110> a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
here you're going to need to press a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.370 
here you're going to need to press a
move<00:00:56.190> straight<00:00:56.579> backwards<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.630> then<00:00:58.170> move<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
move straight backwards and then move to

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.650 
move straight backwards and then move to
the<00:00:58.530> left<00:00:58.770> directly<00:00:59.399> after<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> jump

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the left directly after you jump

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290 
the left directly after you jump
straight<00:01:00.870> backwards<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:03.000> you're<00:01:03.149> up

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
straight backwards and then you're up

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
straight backwards and then you're up
like<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.100> obviously<00:01:05.100> from<00:01:05.399> here<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.939> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
like this so obviously from here I just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.260 
like this so obviously from here I just
move<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.719> back<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.219> a<00:01:08.759> sprint

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
move it back like so and then a sprint

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
move it back like so and then a sprint
forward<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.079> a<00:01:10.110> little<00:01:10.290> strafe<00:01:10.649> and<00:01:10.920> now

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
forward and do a little strafe and now

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.830 
forward and do a little strafe and now
you're<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.399> top<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.820> plane<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.630> this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you're on top of the plane now this

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.489 
you're on top of the plane now this
works<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.229> infected<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.639> today<00:01:14.969> which<00:01:15.179> is

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
works in infected as of today which is

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.080 
works in infected as of today which is
726<00:01:16.499> I<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.789> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.969> get

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
726 I don't think it's going to get

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
726 I don't think it's going to get
patched<00:01:18.329> seeing<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.810> modern<00:01:19.020> warfare<00:01:19.170> 2<00:01:19.469> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
patched seeing in modern warfare 2 it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.739 
patched seeing in modern warfare 2 it
never<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.920> patched<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.819> can<00:01:21.030> also<00:01:21.240> come<00:01:21.509> over

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
never got patched you can also come over

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.239 
never got patched you can also come over
here<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.409> obviously<00:01:22.649> isn't<00:01:23.039> really

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
here this obviously isn't really

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.410
