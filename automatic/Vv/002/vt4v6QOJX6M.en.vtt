like<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.400> call<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.670> partial<00:00:27.210> eruption

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
like what we call is partial eruption

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.410 
like what we call is partial eruption
where<00:00:28.800> half<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> tooth<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.760> showing<00:00:30.150> and

where half of the tooth is showing and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
where half of the tooth is showing and
the<00:00:30.539> other<00:00:30.720> half<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.320> still<00:00:31.590> buried<00:00:31.890> below<00:00:32.219> the

the other half is still buried below the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.330 
the other half is still buried below the
gum<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.910> gum<00:00:33.420> tissue<00:00:34.110> flap<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.829> actually

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
gum and that gum tissue flap is actually

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.110 
gum and that gum tissue flap is actually
over<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:36.300> tooth<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.980> allows<00:00:38.640> bacteria

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
over your tooth so it allows bacteria

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.569 
over your tooth so it allows bacteria
and<00:00:39.780> debris<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> seep<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.070> underneath

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
and debris to kind of seep up underneath

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.240 
and debris to kind of seep up underneath
the<00:00:41.850> tissue<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.480> also<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> causes<00:00:44.129> an

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the tissue and also start it causes an

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
the tissue and also start it causes an
infection<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.719> need<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> do
