00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 tomorrow will come in another episode 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 to be in a better position today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.639
 is busy with the bach timings 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.139
 this is a very simple little topic 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.840
 and I thought of you as one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.530
 to give a little tip 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.599
 in this regard, one must say 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.859
 that the baw timings are very very simple 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.850
 are that means I have you first the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 descriptions fact or 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 some left the most important times 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.369
 would be blue and red bulls and five 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 minutes of the urgent comes all six 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.390
 minutes in the mountain hall seven minutes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.400
 this is something simple that you can get 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.980
 quickly notice the problem is now like 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 We usually use that in the game 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 or probably has one or 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.480
 others find that it is so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.890
 we are made in the game 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 we are making the dragon and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.550
 then write in the chat times 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 when we did that or we did 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 calculate before 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.000
 when the next dragon quasi spawn that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 is the old and relaxed way and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.239
 the problem is at least with me 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.309
 I am myself at the moment that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.780
 to practice in uniform that it is me 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.949
 It would be a little bit emotional 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 if I'm the pure I'm glad 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 and forget the time to write down though 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 I do support the tied the can 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.250
 take over this task easily 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 but it also nice when the other 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.880
 make that clear or if the opponent 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
 makes the dirt because Pocher measures and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.330
 sparse and annoy me over it and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.200
 realize that I have the time again 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.939
 not noted 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 and we'll get into the game 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.229
 go in and see how to do this 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.909
 solve small problem of forgetfulness 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.890
 can and then see if we have one 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.130
 get a smooth transition with it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 of course , you go out with knowledge here 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.310
 First google us the classic one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
 look at the method that means you can 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.700
 simply problem is that chat window 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.930
 then open drake and above one time a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.579
 describe if you are this one 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 you have done that means you can quasi 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.659
 before you calculate or you the time 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 note when you destroyed those 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.990
 Of course, the whole thing goes with it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.030
 Abbreviation of the wise can dr for dragon 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.380
 Write or pa for barrel neh close 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.390
 for a ass so that no the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 useless also the bluetooth with 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.850
 There are very many 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.619
 combinations that actually play 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.090
 not big role 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.280
 how important we are the whole 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.439
 can make more pleasant and there goes 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.509
 he simply in the auction window 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.210
 then goes also expanded and then presses 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.530
 to show who exactly what time 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.600
 Looks will have found that it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.909
 was already selected for me and now 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.409
 Do you have the following option as soon as possible 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.989
 now something in the game 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.420
 then the times are left 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.380
 written down and that brings 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.790
 of course more 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.470
 advantage with that means you have to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 almost only drake write and know 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.100
 okay, when did i calculate that 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.730
 six minutes that there is absolutely no 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.680
 problem 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.750
 or you can see this one as you see here 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.370
 can simply destroy it by yourself and 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.350
 you then of course an entry 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.060
 come that you have made the dragon 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.380
 and the time left to the likewise only 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.850
 six more minutes to count 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.220
 and you know when the next one 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.170
 dragons bound this quasi one 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.730
 pleasant evasive method if you can 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.140
 forget in any form that is 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.870
 you can just scroll up in the chat 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 and look ok wall stood that is there 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.780
 the time quasi left participants and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 already you know man the next dragon 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.980
 comes funnily works exactly 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.000
 the same if the enemy is the dragon 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.040
 it is meant also makes 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.720
 indicated that he has destroyed him and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.940
 You can still be in the time in 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.980
 of all comfort note or the 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.150
 chat does this automatically 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.190
 just expect a bit 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 the big advantage of the whole story 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.180
 it's just that you're the team 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.860
 can coordinate much better 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 when you are to the dragon when this boat 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.300
 and be there in front of the enemy and so to speak 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.220
 kill them quickly 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.960
 This will not only give you more gold 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 and experience but also have the 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.470
 possibility to lean in the important top 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.790
 to coordinate any form because 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 that's always the problem or the one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.170
 crack point in a dragon because there have 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.970
 you the possibility quite simply you 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.500
 to locate teleport as well 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.240
 always and can be quite easy in itself 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.800
 the situation is less relaxed 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
 shape as you can see here 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.440
 I'm here briefly with my colleague 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.840
 we knew that this in 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.880
 a few seconds spot and then have him 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 could easily do it well would be there 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.000
 do you have to look up something krone.at 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.650
 but that should have made the already 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.580
 if you also times normal on 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.190
 would have written 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 that means we now know how to do that 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.120
 simply you can it is just one 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.380
 small change in the menu itself 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.660
 that was it now 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.790
 why do we need the whole thing for what 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.780
 we need the timings and to do that 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.630
 I definitely have a tutorial 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.709
 let follow and that of the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.630
 but countdowns will be later 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.370
 come and I hope you will at 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.630
 be patient in any case 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.630
 have fun while gambling
