00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.099
 and what's up kids like nothing in this 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.599
 I'm going to talk a bit about the video 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.759
 slope that I like that almost 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:10.230
 nobody uses it because the value of 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.150
 always those who believe themselves experts in 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 marine aquarium like to have the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.619
 aquarium absolutely no algae 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 and the unpolished crystals are all over 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 the day cleaning the but I love you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 demonstrate with this image and that this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.259
 aquarium is not yet mature in the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 sense of having the seaweed with flour 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.830
 fully extended by the crystals 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.130
 you can see that it is much more beautiful 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 aquarium so totally clean 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.340
 totally clean if you have it in a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 that is, in the center of the dining room 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's completely normal that you go to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 have it clean because you want to see it 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.130
 all sides but if you only see 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.990
 frontally this would be the best 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.990
 shed and in the video 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.510
 now signal because it is the slope 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.100
 that I like the most and for my aquarium you go to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.770
 kids I want to record is one thing that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.360
 is the behavior of the government 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.630
 Valencian that in theory 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160
 then peck the soil and filter the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.680
 sand to say it in a way looking 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.990
 of microorganisms but as you can see 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.870
 here the goby has discovered that my 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 wall that I want to be filled with 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.500
 coral algae and to say it some 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.410
 way of shit 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
 he has discovered that there is more 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.830
 microorganisms there in what would be in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 the sand why a lot of people then 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.410
 he also dies the gobies of this 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.240
 kind because they do not find enough 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.610
 as nutritional value in the substrate by 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.850
 say it somehow little worms and micro 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.830
 bacteria but fix yes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.479
 you keep the aquarium as I said 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.880
 someone from the channel that he likes much more 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.799
 an aquarium full of algae that usually 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
 be more natural because those live more 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.509
 the bugs here you can see the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.509
 behavior of the government has observed 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.670
 and it is that it is directly absorbing 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.730
 I'm going to peck what would be on the wall 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 from behind 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.870
 that as I said in many videos 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.090
 this is for tastes everyone has the 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.070
 aquarium as I want the aquarium this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.560
 I already said the back wall now 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 you can see it ugly because I still do not know 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.500
 form the rock 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.330
 some will say is not going to form rock are 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.860
 coral algae finally we know that 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 there are quite a few fickle people out there 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.360
 making the fool that for every word 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 I say the transversal but it sweats me 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.320
 quite what is the member 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.800
 manly, here you can see the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.380
 government behavior saw skip if 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.959
 is going to be quite successful because 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.760
 directly he is eating then all 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.260
 the bugs 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.959
 on the rock wall in quotes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.090
 it's going to be something with alina and 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.700
 shit, so you see, I wanted to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.260
 record this behavior because no 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.959
 I think you see it in many aquariums already 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.819
 that people are pretty fussy in 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.849
 regarding the cleaning of the aquarium and has 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.340
 that everything is perfect but it is that 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.500
 perfect does not mean that they remove 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870
 algae every day perfect would this leave 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.390
 the natural aquarium in front like sodium 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 you have to leave the aquarium completely 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.650
 clean because if you do not you will not know 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.349
 fish is to be able to enjoy 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.960
 them but fix the behavior of 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.850
 government 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.790
 and how good it is to have a wall by 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.280
 say it some natural way too 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 I even ask you for your many times I see you 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.480
 pecking from the wall good indeed 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.770
 right now he is pecking at the wall 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.560
 because because you let them grow there 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.250
 algae is good to have the back glass 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.250
 full of seaweed 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.720
 there you can see it feeds the sun or 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.300
 absolutely nothing happens because it is 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.990
 itching but clear ahead you can not 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.990
 have to be crystal 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.620
 because all this is a video that can be 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.450
 call dedication then for all those 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.390
 experts in quotes about everything from a 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.490
 forum that seems to like them 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.990
 quite the channel gets into all the 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.000
 days to comment a bit and then what 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.270
 comment in the forum saludito a todos 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.270
 those 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.190
 so nothing here you see the 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.210
 behavior something saw the duck giving a 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.210
 I saw something 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.830
 good until the parents are pecking 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.920
 because they are pecking because of what 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.480
 I say again, it's a lot coming 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.700
 to the surface where they are growing 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.310
 lot of microorganisms that serves as 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.820
 food then directly for the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.620
 the fish 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.490
 that's why it's good that you do not clean the part 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.290
 back and I tell you that some crazy that 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.880
 he thinks he is an expert he will say little thing he is 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.920
 saying not to clean the back wall 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.230
 not the back wall is not cleaned and 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.689
 point is not cleaned and the one that 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.819
 clean because the expert has little 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:40.369
 one thing that people are very anxious and 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.499
 see if the aquarium with the wall as a 

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:43.879
 little dirty and they already say there is no 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.229
 clean it not the back wall is not 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.249
 It cleans the back wall in the end will 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.259
 look like this clothes that you see ahead 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:52.989
 and there will be a perfect background there 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.849
 follow the goby eating to fix the 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:57.339
 amount of natural food that can 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.789
 eat the fish and the back wall does not 

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:02.079
 you remove the algae the front because the 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.549
 you have to remove it if you do not remove the 

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:05.439
 drowning is the aquarium but what is 

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:08.120
 the laterals as is the side of there 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:10.340
 and the back wall 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.199
 let it be left in the end then that 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.860
 that is filled with coral seaweed that is 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.070
 take that is part of what is the 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.510
 biodiversity of the marine aquarium because 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.580
 apart from having the living rock that you see 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.060
 here and what's below, you're going to have 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.130
 all this let's say I'm going to invent the 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.610
 term that maybe some dairy 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.160
 in the teeth crystal I live this side and 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.370
 the entire back wall and the entire wall 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.040
 side so clear crystal alive outside 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.160
 I do not know that clean it as there are there to 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.800
 him because you look like fish 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.020
 final because it finds it very useful 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.330
 have the crystals in quotation marks 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.060
 full of shit see the front always 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.870
 the front has to be super clean 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.449
 to be able to see what is happening 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.660
 inside so I hope you liked it 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:00.889
 the video and as you can see then the 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.430
 first government that stings the 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.020
 crystals 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.820
 and he's putting on his boots 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.790
 So nothing 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.169
 and already this afternoon I'm already I'm now 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.020
 same about to go down 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.849
 to buy everything install the psuv that 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.129
 when you see the zumba fitness and it's a 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.389
 shit like that is crap but it's that 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.819
 I said it and will say it again in the 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.340
 next video here if I can not do 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.499
 miracles I do not have space and it's just 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.599
 to place the skimmer that I have 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:31.889
 bought and to not have all this is 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.990
 shit up here 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.450
 so nothing and also well to put 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.250
 the algae shelter that obviously here 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.190
 with the status as leave a sheet by 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.500
 there alone he eats it here we have my 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.120
 guardians I love seeing him I had 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.670
 right now a clown is also pecking 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:51.330
 in the glass 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.400
 and you have them how nice 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.850
 the clowns are already pecking the glass there 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.670
 is one that is fond is to look 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:02.220
 Now we see him because of the bugs that 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.740
 Osen with the paridera be taught as 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.630
 I already have to say that it's not media art 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.790
 I honestly do not know I do not know if it's 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.220
 my art, but I can not, well 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.470
 imagine in the bugs that were born of 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.910
 here that can be bugs that 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.010
 they came with the eggs that have also 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.510
 hatched out there in the aquarium 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.850
 serving as food for the 

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:23.250
 corals and for all so now I say 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.130
 this goes by slopes I'm going to respect 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:29.060
 the slope of having the crystals 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:32.430
 dirty the sides and the back 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.140
 because I want such rocks to form 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.570
 which and some will say little when getting off to 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.560
 some rock shapes I understand myself with what 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.450
 what do I say and the one that is a little 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.070
 intelligent understands perfectly to what 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.849
 I mean with it being a rocks forms 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.879
 in the back 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:47.439
 there you all to all the fish 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:49.600
 chopping the back that is 

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:51.430
 full of microorganisms 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.530
 so nothing for all those experts
