00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.930 
buddy Benny grab was a big part of
designing<00:02:08.610> these<00:02:08.730> things<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.510> I<00:02:10.940> understand

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
designing these things and I understand

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.450 
designing these things and I understand
why<00:02:12.870> they're<00:02:13.170> needed<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:13.740> they've<00:02:14.100> been

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
why they're needed because they've been

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.360 
why they're needed because they've been
pretty<00:02:14.850> much<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.270> main<00:02:15.380> crash<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.710> whole

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
pretty much my main crash on this whole

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.270 
pretty much my main crash on this whole
record<00:02:17.580> either<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.220> the

it's<00:02:23.400> another<00:02:23.670> 18<00:02:24.120> inch<00:02:24.300> sand<00:02:24.480> crash<00:02:24.720> that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
it's another 18 inch sand crash that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.100 
it's another 18 inch sand crash that
we've<00:02:25.530> been<00:02:25.620> using<00:02:25.680> that's<00:02:26.100> just<00:02:26.400> been<00:02:27.110> the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
we've been using that's just been the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.740 
we've been using that's just been the
main<00:02:28.350> sound<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.640> our<00:02:29.880> main<00:02:30.210> crash<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.690> the

main sound for our main crash on the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.310 
main sound for our main crash on the
record<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.170> been<00:02:31.320> awesome<00:02:32.720> they<00:02:33.720> also<00:02:33.930> just

record it's been awesome they also just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.400 
record it's been awesome they also just
have<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> nice<00:02:34.770> decay<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:36.140> that<00:02:37.140> doesn't

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
have a nice decay to them that doesn't

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.190 
have a nice decay to them that doesn't
really<00:02:37.920> cut<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.600> doesn't<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.690> overpower

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
really cut it doesn't really overpower

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.470 
really cut it doesn't really overpower
the<00:02:40.470> music<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> lot<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.280> times<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:42.360> way<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the music and a lot of times the way I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.380 
the music and a lot of times the way I
hit<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.930> crash<00:02:43.580> cymbals<00:02:44.580> hit<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.820> hard

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
hit I crash cymbals hit them hard

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.570 
hit I crash cymbals hit them hard
I<00:02:45.420> need<00:02:45.960> something<00:02:46.380> that's<00:02:46.560> gonna<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:47.130> know

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
I need something that's gonna you know

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.870 
I need something that's gonna you know
have<00:02:47.820> its<00:02:48.000> own<00:02:48.210> level<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.900> decay<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:49.880> when

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
have its own level of decay because when

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.550 
have its own level of decay because when
I'm<00:02:51.000> swinging<00:02:51.240> it's<00:02:51.600> makes<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.290> lot<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.470> noise

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I'm swinging it's makes a lot of noise

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.730 
I'm swinging it's makes a lot of noise
so<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.160> nice<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.810> attack<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.470> for

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
so this is nice for the attack and for

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.730 
so this is nice for the attack and for
the<00:02:56.430> really<00:02:56.790> pretty<00:02:57.510> sound<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.320> doesn't

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
the really pretty sound that doesn't

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.040 
the really pretty sound that doesn't
overpower<00:02:59.130> everything<00:02:59.970> else<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.690> music

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
overpower everything else in the music

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.949 
overpower everything else in the music
so<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.800> cool<00:03:02.040> um<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.690> one<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> my
