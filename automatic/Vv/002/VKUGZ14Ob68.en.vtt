00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.230
 already 45 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
 commandments 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:31.420
 then that little nerve 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.420
 we always know 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.170
 understandable 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:51.589
 because I draw like that because I need this 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.989
 it's pretty slim the engine is by 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.620
 under everything is below the top 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.620
 I do not see it 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.040
 and that's why this sensitive 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.430
 this is the engine and this one is sensitive and 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.980
 this sense this 51 goes out where in 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.210
 special painting then for the indy 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.210
 hard is to think more about leaving 3 451 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:33.380
 the 5 2 where it comes out bigger round 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.380
 and the 53rd or bad day there is another 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.410
 then we have it 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.530
 in the cottage the round 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.569
 this round this is the oval 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.880
 has a relationship 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.080
 that's why you always remember that the artery 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.170
 I told myself half amen amen and amen and half 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.030
 but also because he killed me when I 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.690
 shot in the temple 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.760
 then this glass breaks and accumulates 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.380
 here the blood and the unemployment number 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.250
 Cardiac- respiratory cardiac 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:52.100
 that's why we would find this is the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.630
 petros area like that and here the hole would be 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.630
 internal auditory 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:10.599
 and we put the 7 and the 18 the 8 are two 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:15.299
 cochlear hallway copy hall 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.299
 cochlear balance hearing balance 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:22.290
 so is 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.290
 he is the only dead and 8 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.330
 and here would be the subsequent transfer 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.300
 later then this later gift 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:41.530
 It has two portions, one anterior and one 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.530
 later is after a party 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.760
 and here would be this is the hole 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.740
 occipital and ahead is a hole 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.150
 there 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:57.150
 at 12 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.300
 3 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.550
 346 5th century 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.690
 we go 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.079
 there you have the shots 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.210
 i 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:45.039
 to little 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.080
 the zygomatic support of malaria is 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.080
 here
