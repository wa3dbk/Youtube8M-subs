00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
side like so and the other side of there

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680 
side like so and the other side of there
there<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.980> if<00:00:44.579> you're<00:00:44.789> creating<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> u-shape

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
there just if you're creating a u-shape

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
there just if you're creating a u-shape
like<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.289> automatically<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.190> folding

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
like this it automatically like folding

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
like this it automatically like folding
folding<00:00:48.420> down<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:49.110> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
folding down like so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.670 
folding down like so
see<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:51.239> fold<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.379> hold<00:00:52.590> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
see so then just fold it you can hold it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.510 
see so then just fold it you can hold it
with<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.829> feet<00:00:53.510> next<00:00:54.510> up<00:00:54.660> while<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:56.250> side

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with your feet next up while this side

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.080 
with your feet next up while this side
over<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.329> bend<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> down<00:00:58.789> to<00:00:59.789> fold

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
over here you also bend it down to fold

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.869 
over here you also bend it down to fold
it<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:01.170> put<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:02.070> left<00:01:02.280> hand<00:01:02.460> under

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
your right hand and then create a tree

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.640 
your right hand and then create a tree
circle<00:01:07.049> shape

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
circle shape

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.870 
circle shape
see<00:01:08.640> how<00:01:09.360> easy<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.770> remember<00:01:11.610> I'll

see how easy was that so remember I'll
fold<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:14.630> then<00:01:16.970> move<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
fold it like so you then move it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.270 
fold it like so you then move it
down<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.979> create<00:01:19.979> three<00:01:20.390> circle<00:01:21.390> shape

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
down like so create three circle shape

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
down like so create three circle shape
boom<00:01:24.259> finish<00:01:26.000> second<00:01:27.000> way<00:01:28.460> yes<00:01:29.460> oh<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.630> hurt

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
and then just this side over here put it

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.770 
and then just this side over here put it
in<00:01:57.410> while<00:01:58.410> you<00:01:58.680> are<00:01:59.010> you<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.660> rotate<00:02:00.660> it

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
in while you are you kind of rotate it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
in while you are you kind of rotate it
to<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.200> front<00:02:01.470> like<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:03.420> will

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
to the front like so and it will

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.260 
to the front like so and it will
automatically<00:02:05.900> fold<00:02:06.900> itself<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.820> creating

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
automatically fold itself and creating

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.199 
automatically fold itself and creating
three<00:02:09.660> light<00:02:09.929> circle<00:02:10.730> probably<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
three light circle probably it's

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
three light circle probably it's
probably<00:02:12.270> kind<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.690> hard<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
probably kind of hard if you see this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130 
probably kind of hard if you see this
but<00:02:13.830> if<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.160> do<00:02:14.910> doing<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.540> know<00:02:15.660> it's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
but if you do doing and you know it's

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.510 
but if you do doing and you know it's
fairly<00:02:16.380> easy<00:02:16.560> actually<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.250> like

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
fairly easy actually it's like

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.150 
fairly easy actually it's like
automatically<00:02:18.180> create<00:02:18.660> tree<00:02:19.530> shape<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.130> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
automatically create tree shape like so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.460 
automatically create tree shape like so
then<00:02:20.520> all<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:22.490> put<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.660> case

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
then all you do is put it in this case

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.080 
then all you do is put it in this case
right<00:02:25.709> here<00:02:25.880> haha

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
