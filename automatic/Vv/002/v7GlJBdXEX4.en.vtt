00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
we're gonna take the little end that's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.550 
we're gonna take the little end that's
left<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> braid<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.260> we're<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.500> to

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
left of the braid and we're going to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.450 
left of the braid and we're going to
tuck<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:35.720> underneath<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.170> hair<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:37.530> above

the<00:03:38.930> ponytail<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.290> left-hand<00:03:40.830> side<00:03:41.270> so

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
the ponytail on the left-hand side so

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.660 
the ponytail on the left-hand side so
it's<00:03:42.450> not<00:03:42.660> visible<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.860> it's<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.100> hidden<00:03:44.430> in

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it's not visible so it's just hidden in

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:53.660 
it's not visible so it's just hidden in
there<00:03:50.270> now<00:03:51.270> when<00:03:51.540> we<00:03:51.690> wrap<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.370> braid<00:03:53.640> on

the right side you want to start tucking

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.480 
the right side you want to start tucking
it<00:03:56.160> underneath<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.050> hide<00:03:58.490> the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
it underneath so that you hide the

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.670 
it underneath so that you hide the
elastic<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.360> we'll<00:04:00.510> pin<00:04:00.870> if<00:04:01.140> there's<00:04:01.410> still

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
elastic and we'll pin if there's still

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.620 
elastic and we'll pin if there's still
any<00:04:01.890> showing<00:04:04.580> so<00:04:05.580> bring<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> over<00:04:06.360> in<00:04:06.510> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
then wrap it and cover the elastics that

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.370 
then wrap it and cover the elastics that
are<00:04:21.540> showing<00:04:22.280> right<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.460> top<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:27.200> now<00:04:28.200> you've

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
got your ends from your your final braid

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.170 
got your ends from your your final braid
that<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.480> just<00:04:33.720> tuck<00:04:34.020> underneath<00:04:34.640> so<00:04:35.640> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
that you can just tuck underneath so the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.580 
that you can just tuck underneath so the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
then pin that so it's hidden and then

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.390 
then pin that so it's hidden and then
you<00:04:45.300> can<00:04:45.510> come<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.169> tidy<00:04:46.470> up<00:04:46.650> wherever<00:04:47.070> it
