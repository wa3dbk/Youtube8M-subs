really literal brick I must say actually

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.580 
really literal brick I must say actually
this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.310> surprisingly<00:02:27.420> inexpensive<00:02:28.590> that

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
this is surprisingly inexpensive that

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.990 
this is surprisingly inexpensive that
