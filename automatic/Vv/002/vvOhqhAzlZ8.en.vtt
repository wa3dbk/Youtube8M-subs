00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
to try it out from a first time that I

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.750 
to try it out from a first time that I
did<00:00:41.320> not<00:00:41.500> try<00:00:41.680> out<00:00:41.830> the<00:00:41.980> first<00:00:42.190> developer<00:00:42.610> kit

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
did not try out the first developer kit

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.700 
did not try out the first developer kit
I<00:00:42.940> have<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.330> say<00:00:43.480> I'm<00:00:43.630> really<00:00:43.809> impressed<00:00:44.320> I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
I have to say I'm really impressed I

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.290 
I have to say I'm really impressed I
could<00:00:45.100> actually<00:00:45.220> see<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:45.610> pixels<00:00:45.940> with<00:00:46.180> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
could actually see the pixels with the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.799 
could actually see the pixels with the
1080p<00:00:46.720> display<00:00:47.260> in<00:00:47.470> there<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:47.830> o<00:00:47.860> LED<00:00:48.370> display

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
1080p display in there the o LED display

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.810 
1080p display in there the o LED display
I'm<00:00:49.809> still<00:00:50.140> impressed<00:00:50.320> with<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.890> but<00:00:51.489> there

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
I'm still impressed with it but there

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.280 
I'm still impressed with it but there
was<00:00:51.850> you<00:00:52.120> could<00:00:52.300> see<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.600> pixels<00:00:52.900> and<00:00:53.080> a<00:00:53.140> lot

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
was you could see the pixels and a lot

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.360 
was you could see the pixels and a lot
of<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.470> complaints<00:00:53.860> with<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.010> first

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
of the complaints with the first

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.770 
of the complaints with the first
developer<00:00:54.760> cake<00:00:54.940> with<00:00:55.270> that<00:00:55.390> there<00:00:55.690> were

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
developer cake with that there were

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.320 
developer cake with that there were
pixel<00:00:56.170> lines<00:00:56.320> and<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.770> was<00:00:56.860> kind<00:00:57.430> of<00:00:57.489> defeated

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
pixel lines and it was kind of defeated

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.670 
pixel lines and it was kind of defeated
the<00:00:58.510> immersion<00:00:58.960> because<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.260> could<00:00:59.380> see<00:00:59.410> each

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
the immersion because you could see each

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.380 
the immersion because you could see each
individual<00:01:00.160> pixel<00:01:00.280> but<00:01:00.790> I<00:01:00.880> still<00:01:01.090> think

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
individual pixel but I still think

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.880 
individual pixel but I still think
that's<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.630> problem<00:01:01.810> even<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.470> 1080p

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
that's a problem even with the 1080p

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.490 
that's a problem even with the 1080p
displays<00:01:03.400> but<00:01:03.970> it<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.449> lot<00:01:04.720> better<00:01:04.930> it's<00:01:05.290> at

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
displays but it is a lot better it's at

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.600 
displays but it is a lot better it's at
least<00:01:05.710> what<00:01:05.890> I'm<00:01:05.979> guessing<00:01:06.280> what<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.460> have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
least what I'm guessing what I have

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.130 
least what I'm guessing what I have
heard<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:07.030> never<00:01:07.060> got<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.509> try<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.780> first<00:01:07.990> one

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
heard I never got to try the first one

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.719 
heard I never got to try the first one
while<00:01:08.560> no<00:01:08.680> numbers<00:01:09.040> are<00:01:09.190> being<00:01:09.340> thrown<00:01:09.580> out

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
while no numbers are being thrown out

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.340 
while no numbers are being thrown out
there<00:01:09.880> because<00:01:10.090> obviously<00:01:10.690> you<00:01:11.140> don't<00:01:11.290> want

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
there because obviously you don't want

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.770 
there because obviously you don't want
to<00:01:11.500> give<00:01:11.590> it<00:01:11.710> away<00:01:11.740> it<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.490> confirmed<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.660> it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
to give it away it is confirmed that it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.540 
to give it away it is confirmed that it
should<00:01:14.080> be<00:01:14.110> higher<00:01:14.410> than<00:01:14.650> 1080p<00:01:14.920> because

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
should be higher than 1080p because

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.310 
should be higher than 1080p because
1080p<00:01:15.970> still<00:01:16.180> has<00:01:16.330> some<00:01:16.479> problems<00:01:16.840> with<00:01:16.990> being

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
1080p still has some problems with being

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.749 
1080p still has some problems with being
able<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.619> see<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> individual<00:01:18.310> pixels

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
able to see the individual pixels

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.580 
able to see the individual pixels
definitely<00:01:19.509> not<00:01:19.660> as<00:01:19.780> bad<00:01:19.960> as<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.200> original

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
definitely not as bad as the original

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.980 
definitely not as bad as the original
developer<00:01:21.009> kit<00:01:21.190> but<00:01:21.640> still<00:01:22.119> not<00:01:22.390> perfect<00:01:22.690> I

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
developer kit but still not perfect I

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.359 
developer kit but still not perfect I
tried<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.350> out<00:01:23.440> in<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.649> developer<00:01:24.009> kit<00:01:24.190> too

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
tried it out in the developer kit too

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.980 
tried it out in the developer kit too
and<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:24.910> still<00:01:25.060> not<00:01:25.240> perfect<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.840> can

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
and it's still not perfect you can

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.320 
and it's still not perfect you can
definitely<00:01:26.200> see<00:01:26.860> those<00:01:27.130> pixels<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:28.060> then<00:01:28.300> I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
definitely see those pixels and then I

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.370 
definitely see those pixels and then I
also<00:01:28.390> want<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.720> talk<00:01:28.869> about<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.170> facebook

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
