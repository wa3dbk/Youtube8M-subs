00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.019
 part of the oil and gas revolution . 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.590
 of shale gas in the United States 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 occurs here in southern texas and a region 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.859
 call the eagle strong full 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.170
 this area is 80 kilometers wide 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.050
 and extends 640 km from the border 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.920
 with Mexico to the vicinity of 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.079
 rylstone city in the last three years 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.510
 companies have drilled thousands of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.800
 of posts in this region and created 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.309
 complexes similar to those in which 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 extracts oil and gas from shale rocks 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.750
 which are underground 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 the process by which this is done is 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 called hydraulic fracturing in this 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.289
 technology is injected into the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.039
 petroleum with high pressure a mixture of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.150
 water chemicals and sand the impact 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.369
 entry of these substances causes the 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.159
 revenues of shale and partners 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.159
 the release of oil and gas that are 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.280
 in its composition 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.350
 this unconventional technology 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 allowed the United States to take 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 in a spectacular way its production of 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.409
 gas and to increase by 50% the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 oil since 2008 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.290
 last year the united states 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.180
 produced 7.5 million barrels of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.540
 oil per day 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 only the full ford eagle contributed 1 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 million barrels of oil a day 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.780
 this volume is almost half that 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.649
 half of Brazil's total production in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.549
 2003, which was 2.2 million barrels of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.549
 oil per day 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.799
