00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.210
 training with dima weimer the world champion 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.280
 in the kickboxing and he shows us here now 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.910
 a warm up the kickboxer himself 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.460
 heat up 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.679
 I'll do it with you, I'll come too 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 so missions martial arts and I think so 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.590
 be for me like one 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.590
 world champion gets fit 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.790
 we always do something tomorrow 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.740
 before we make rope jumping 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.360
 a little one of mine is with the 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.890
 Cold season is important if you are 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.200
 Come in the joints first 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.760
 smear and make a very small 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.070
 So as I said rather rough 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.230
 joints knee hip shoulder elbow 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.460
 summertime and start here 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.440
 we have great in jump rope so 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.510
 Let's say it exactly from the top 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.720
 completely relaxed exactly what you are 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.640
 Ankles really do it 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.449
 relaxed relaxed tackle so that the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.059
 musculature 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.800
 you see all the pain prepared 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.600
 Blood circulation is promoted more 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:14.720
 do not pour out 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:18.700
 the exact movements quite like 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.700
 two normal people denied 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.250
 because the hips are circling 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:42.110
 music always likes one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.110
 disco 13 you can see how much I am me 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.540
 often times from berlin easy home 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 crisp 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:12.450
 and let it be easy for everyone 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:20.910
 pointy online yet the tension throughout 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:28.630
 loose your hand in the elbow joint 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:32.920
 in a circle without outside 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.850
 Lubricate joints at the elbow and 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.850
 since then alternate each other 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:56.460
 one shoulder still outside 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:56.460
 circling in front of back 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.459
 and very briefly 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.890
 if you can not beat yourself
