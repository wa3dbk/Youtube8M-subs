00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 the universe is really wonderful 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.790
 who sees it so stays pce asked will be here life on other planets 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.559
 I really do not know, did you? 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.019
 all the planets of the solar system loose and punish what has life and planet earth 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939
 more 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.939
 I think this planet 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.039
 to have life 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.039
 god made this planet 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.240
 possibility of life more only here the heart of man 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.660
 it's bad 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.559
 man's heart has 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.210
 I'm going to laugh at 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.400
 kostas g 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.990
 is arrogant 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 of political power at last 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.480
 you notice that on Mars 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.540
 to the planet that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.440
 is almost similar to land only that has no water has no oxygen 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.030
 no ozone layer 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.710
 so this is the closest planet that could have life 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 in my opinion I think this planet 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.880
 God is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.660
 building to pose with av in the future millions of years from now 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.400
 can see life on this planet mars 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 Why the man 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 military valesca 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490
 soon there is no possibility 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 promised to breed a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.700
 How is it going to happen because he 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 no water has no ozone layer 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.730
 this planet 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.660
 marquinhos 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.970
 your state 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.830
 showed interest in my penis 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.790
 No, I do not know why 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.499
 we observe all projects without access to the only show that has life 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:53.810
 is the worst planet earth 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.340
 therefore 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.430
 I know 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.430
 which are the plans of god more 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.720
 I think 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.820
 the human being should marvel his planet earth why 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.010
 it's no use staying 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.889
 researching anita optical searching other galaxies I think it has to 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.370
 I was really crazy 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.470
 to planet earth popcorn of life this global warming 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.469
 man has to avoid global warming 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.500
 because 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 if not the planet earth can become life p 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:37.399
 own the score and the man 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:39.489
 so we'll see 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.899
 this planet without life 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:43.419
 we must preserve 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.099
 our planet 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.830
 and the other planets only god knows 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.830
 because god is in control of everything 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.230
 if god willing yes it is not because plata this planet already has thousands of 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.980
 years 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.459
 or do you think 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.230
 examined 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.389
 on the planet Mars until the moment when it awaits 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.389
 tree though it did not have life 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.509
 human ' 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.979
 the animax but at least life 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.009
 d 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:14.429
 plant life 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:16.989
 there would be on this planet 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.989
 you can see that March has a neighborhood 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.119
 another planet that are dogs 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:25.140
 is unlikely 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.389
 it is unlikely to be experienced any more 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.399
 for sure 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.559
 for god nothing is impossible bush 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.679
 all lurks and could 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.989
 in some way or another 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.310
 life why the earth has a layer of ozone that repels lightning 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.660
 ultraviolet sun 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.449
 So 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.130
 even though mercury is closer 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.989
 closest to the sun 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.199
 How old are you 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.469
 hot that I am 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:55.260
 but in the same way 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.189
 could it have a layer of ozone only that stronger penitent of rays 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.540
 ultraviolet sun 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.780
 It does not seem simple, but for God, nothing is impossible. 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.000
 I'm speaking 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 on the solar system based on faith 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.019
 understood the scientist 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.659
 the scientist 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.659
 it is based on restless inter oriente 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.750
 It's not that it's impossible to live in Mexico. 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.310
 hulu and exu pt 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.740
 that a gaseous planet 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.740
 but I'm going to take a walk 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.620
 theory in faith because 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.279
 if god exists 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.279
 all this planet the only one that has life and the earth 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.560
 only here sir the scientist 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.809
 we looked 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.300
 away to other galaxies 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.499
 we do not know if there's life 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.169
 the infinite universe but his whereabouts 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.580
 god is in control of everything 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.330
 God is eternal 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.680
 he 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.050
 if the land reported 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.979
 of billions of years 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.099
 the other planets also within billions of years 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.419
 there may be life and it depends on the will of our God 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.650
 everyone wonders will be that there is life on other planets and in other galaxies 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:16.459
 no one knows the truth but knows if it's in an infinite universe 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:19.630
 there may be for the owners of life 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.580
 de soto said he said spoke into our solar system 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.339
 in our solar system 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.020
 no scientist detected life then 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.770
 I in my opinion 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.479
 I think these new planets here 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.830
 this new planet in the solar system 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.270
 could well 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.259
 power bird life 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:43.689
 depending on God's will 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:46.599
 because maybe who knows 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.909
 yes the heart of man was not so bad so selfish 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.460
 he is mars would have given 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.029
 it's the way 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:56.770
 possibility life 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.020
 but as the heart of man 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.009
 it's selfish 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.800
 likes to go 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.210
 like to have power 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.249
 want 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.169
 wanting your best 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.080
 I entered 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.559
 in crisis but it is what the other 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:16.559
 I do not think that in my opinion 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.939
 and this is difficult 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.339
 but I have a certain conviction that yes there is no evil on the planet 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.490
 earth if there was no running on this planet earth 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.389
 over billions of years 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.340
 mankind and for more than thousand the year 2000 had commanded stepped on the earth 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.949
 if there was no common work 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.110
 for sure 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.960
 there would be 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.940
 What must be done in order to live prolonged ned form 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.479
 David has a long life. 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.539
 years therefore 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.229
 the time comparsa 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.500
 is the planet earth is full of and could have it 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.389
 s 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.009
 the green city mars there surely I am absolutely certain that 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.250
 There would be today if we would live on Mars. 

00:07:02.869 --> 00:07:06.219
 could live in tents to implement correct 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.089
 as I already said 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.089
 for her it is impossible for many 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.919
 messi 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:15.550
 on this planet more 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.949
 the same way that the ozone layer in Brazil is 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:19.809
 on planet Earth
