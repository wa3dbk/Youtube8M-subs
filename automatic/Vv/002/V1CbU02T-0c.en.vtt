00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.590
 utrecht 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 yes it is just patient around 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 last Friday 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.439
 so completely come around and what 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.989
 has made you decide to go to again 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 to go to Utrecht 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.340
 Actually Utrecht is the club where I am 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.440
 started as a little boy and up 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.420
 training way remains your roots 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 always pull a bit with the plans 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.430
 who is still having to try 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.700
 to achieve structural European football 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.739
 i know tom the shatilla well i have six 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 played for seven years so then all 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.350
 has decided together to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 to go that way 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 so actually not a difficult choice 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.920
 oh yes yes yes because I have eg 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.360
 playing psv back then I already experienced that 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.439
 as a great club last three years 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 train 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.799
 yes where twice chompy championship 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 seafood 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.880
 james football also love some turmoil 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.979
 when we have that just belongs 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.909
 let 's just leave a club plan 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 say 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 So that's a decision that you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 must take to a club that you also go to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.600
 the heart is in a relationship yes yes and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.920
 why 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.810
 do you still leave yes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.149
 the reason that just specify utrecht 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.920
 the certainty here that not even who comes 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.509
 what's going to happen 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.000
 yes then utrecht will intervene 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.799
 always kept pulling so that's why 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.570
 those facets together can be identical 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.830
 decision and with what feeling 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.539
 PSV leave you with a warm feeling that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.860
 I just indicated I have 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.979
 I have a great time playing here 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.450
 had a great time as a train 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.520
 the club is fantastic the people there 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 working is fantastic stadium supporters 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.320
 is it that concerns 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.350
 with the very warm feeling I will certainly
