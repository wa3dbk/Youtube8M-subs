00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.929
 there are good ally boys and as the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 title of the video I'll be doing it 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 super colorful is super easy to make 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.679
 because you are asking me to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.889
 use more colors in my looks instead 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.560
 to use coffees and so with neutral tones and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.450
 because it does not say the best I get out 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 in my comfort zone if you so much 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.130
 are asking and well I did and I 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
 loved it seriously I loved how 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 were left I thought that he was going to see a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.990
 little exaggerated but the truth is that it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 see super that is super good in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.219
 any kind of eyes seriously are the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 I highly recommend it because I hope that you 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.420
 like it and then I'll tell you a little about 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.670
 the products that the products use 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.710
 that I used were from the brand colt phone 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.230
 because I said good they are asking me for code 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 as a look with color because not a 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.760
 brand that has the color color name 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 font and apart this hilarious me 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.719
 they love the products and they are super 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.219
 accessible because it is also something else 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.309
 that you have been asking me to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.989
 the products were massa are excited 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.269
 accessible and that could find them 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.370
 very easily and buying is very easy and 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.290
 that's why I opted for color is part 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.410
 I love I love the brand 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 I love the designs they use and like that and 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.720
 Well, I used this palette that is called 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 Ã¡lex trip and comes with 6 super shades 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.180
 colorful as you can see and something that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 love is that they have very very good 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.480
 pigmentation the shadows 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.980
 It helps a lot so you do not have to spend 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.960
 both the product and so because it only 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.700
 You put like the brochita once and you already 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 pints and already have everything 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.180
 I needed not put with the other 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 shadows that you have to be like a 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.250
 half an hour and scratching to see if it comes out 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.580
 something and then there is this palette 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.310
 comes with two as applicators which 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.369
 has like two sponges in addition and what 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 what I did was that as for example 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.440
 here you are orange but if you flip it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.350
 is purple then use instead of 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.540
 just use two your c4 then you can use 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.490
 eight shadows with tan so only two 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.040
 applicators then you're super good 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.810
 that and then seriously I recommend them 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.300
 very much also use all the rest 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
 products of this brand so they are 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.619
 I will leave in the information box 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.080
 increases by step the video will go 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.820
 appearing and so 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.670
 and well I hope you like it too 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.410
 as I loved it and good to leave it in 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.270
 the comments if they liked that others 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 videos they want me to do if they want me to 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.080
 make more of this kind of looks and we 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.190
 we see then that they have a great time and 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.520
 I love you so much 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.520
 bye 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.980
 to cover my hideous circles under my eyes I'm going 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.900
 to put a concealer a few shades 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.940
 clearer than my skin in the form of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.830
 triangle below the eyes and by 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.840
 all the eyelid so that too 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 In addition to covering the dark circles they cover 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.820
 the little veins on the eyelid and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.740
 I'm going to take my finger and I'm going to blur it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.740
 because it is the easiest way to do it 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 i 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 the first color that I will use from my 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.380
 color palette font is going to be the orange 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.380
 and I'm going to put it with the applicator that 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.130
 comes in the palette I'm going to put it 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.130
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.890
 and then I'm going to take the color green and what 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.409
 I'm going to put on the lacrimal so 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.250
 as to give more light to the look 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:52.220
 but to give it even more luminosity 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.319
 I'm going to put the yellow orange tone 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.319
 just over the jersey 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.210
 to give more definition to the eye and then 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.950
 I'm going to take this pink color and I'm going to 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.950
 put right in my eye socket 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.530
 finally to deepen a little bit 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.449
 more then I'm going to apply this purple on 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.310
 the external view of the eye and on the line 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.330
 bottom of the eyelashes and I'm going to 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.389
 blur so it does not look so marked 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.389
 i 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.870
 and 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 with a concealer the darker shades of 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.490
 my skin will shape my face 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.419
 putting it on the cheek bones 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.370
 and on the ends of my nose and so that 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.819
 I do not have any marks, I'm going to blur it with 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.819
 my finger 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.710
 i 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.639
 so that the makeup lasts all day 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.470
 I'm going to seal it with a compact powder of 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.169
 my tone and I'm going to put it all over 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.130
 face with a brush that does not hold 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.130
 too much product 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.220
 do not 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.230
 t 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.470
 finally for the eyes I will delineate 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.600
 the line my upper lashes with a 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.310
 black liquid eyeliner and then with a 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.380
 mascara of the same color I'm going to put 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.440
 many layers of my eyelashes for 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.240
 so it looks like false eyelashes 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.420
 although not really I 'm not 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.420
 using 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.690
 i 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.380
 and 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.800
 and the last step of this tutorial as 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.199
 the eyes are already very heavy 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.080
 for the lips I will use a lip 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.970
 very natural pink tone so that 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.229
 do not do it as competition to the eyes and 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.229
 the look will be super good 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.610
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.160
 as much as me is super father is 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.320
 super natural but at the same time not 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.360
 It's natural but I love them very much and 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.630
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.110
 in the next have a nice day 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.110
 good bye
