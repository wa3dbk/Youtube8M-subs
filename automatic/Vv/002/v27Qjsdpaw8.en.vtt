00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
absolutely decimating Keith when it came

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.510 
absolutely decimating Keith when it came
to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> cs<00:00:42.149> numbers<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.629> saw<00:00:42.809> about<00:00:43.440> 30<00:00:43.829> CS<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to the cs numbers we saw about 30 CS and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.979 
to the cs numbers we saw about 30 CS and
10<00:00:44.730> minutes<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> game<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.539> by<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> time

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
10 minutes into the game but by the time

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
10 minutes into the game but by the time
24<00:00:46.829> minutes<00:00:47.010> rolled<00:00:47.250> around<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.640> entire

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
24 minutes rolled around in entire

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.410 
24 minutes rolled around in entire
hundred<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.410> century's<00:00:50.039> worth<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.430> cs<00:00:50.850> had

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
hundred a century's worth of cs had

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.689 
hundred a century's worth of cs had
fallen<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.320> favor<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.829> tech<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
fallen in the favor of all tech and that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.340 
fallen in the favor of all tech and that
seemed<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.059> been<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> big<00:00:54.899> factor<00:00:55.140> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
seemed to have been a big factor in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
seemed to have been a big factor in
those<00:00:56.010> late-game<00:00:56.280> team<00:00:56.579> fights<00:00:56.789> yeah<00:00:57.120> even

over keith was really big cuz he's a
consistent<00:01:09.090> damage<00:01:09.360> source<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
consistent damage source and then you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
consistent damage source and then you
look<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.350> fizz<00:01:10.619> he's<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.549> same<00:01:11.729> type<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
look at fizz he's not the same type of

AP burst assassin anymore he's a bruiser

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.789 
AP burst assassin anymore he's a bruiser
that<00:01:14.880> needs<00:01:15.090> time<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.689> take<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.470> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that needs time to take you down and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.760 
that needs time to take you down and
chunk<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.310> over<00:01:17.610> time<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.600> big<00:01:19.320> problem

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
chunk you down over time so big problem

right and given those CS discrepancies

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
right and given those CS discrepancies
right<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.450> really<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.810> sets<00:01:34.049> the

with<00:02:07.829> piglet<00:02:08.220> they<00:02:08.399> were<00:02:08.459> more<00:02:08.670> concerned

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
with piglet they were more concerned

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.790 
with piglet they were more concerned

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
they weren't able to just kind of make

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.970 
they weren't able to just kind of make
these<00:02:12.930> rotations<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.650> play<00:02:13.800> the

these rotations and play the

these rotations and play the
more<00:02:14.670> team-oriented<00:02:15.150> fashion<00:02:15.720> Keith<00:02:16.230> does

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
more team-oriented fashion Keith does

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.740 
more team-oriented fashion Keith does
need<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.040> little<00:02:17.250> bit<00:02:17.489> more<00:02:17.670> farm<00:02:17.970> though<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
late-game damage outputs not just going

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.619 
late-game damage outputs not just going
to<00:02:20.370> come<00:02:20.489> solely<00:02:20.730> from<00:02:20.849> costs<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.450> they

to come solely from costs there they

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.240 
to come solely from costs there they

though<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.159> know<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> wasn't<00:02:26.549> just<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.940> team

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
though you know it wasn't just the team

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.360 
though you know it wasn't just the team
not<00:02:27.750> funneling<00:02:28.290> into<00:02:28.440> him<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:29.280> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
not funneling into him that was what it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800 
not funneling into him that was what it
was<00:02:29.400> laking<00:02:29.909> but<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.239> fact<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.450> he<00:02:30.540> had<00:02:30.690> made

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
was laking but the fact that he had made

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.380 
was laking but the fact that he had made
that<00:02:30.989> discrepancy<00:02:31.349> so<00:02:31.799> early<00:02:32.129> on<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:32.970> huge

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
that discrepancy so early on was a huge

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.570 
that discrepancy so early on was a huge
problem<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.019> Keith<00:02:34.230> does<00:02:34.560> fit<00:02:34.860> their<00:02:35.040> style<00:02:35.069> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
problem but Keith does fit their style a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.130 
problem but Keith does fit their style a
little<00:02:35.849> better<00:02:36.060> because<00:02:36.629> then<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.049> allows

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
little better because then it allows

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
little better because then it allows
quass<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.920> continue<00:02:38.250> farming<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.790> continue

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
quass to continue farming to continue

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.300 
quass to continue farming to continue

in that game where you can see liquid

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.940 
in that game where you can see liquid
actually<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.599> across<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.959> map<00:02:46.319> strategy<00:02:46.829> or

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
actually have across the map strategy or

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.589 
actually have across the map strategy or
it's<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.129> Kwassa<00:02:47.430> split<00:02:47.760> pushing<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.510> we're

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
it's like Kwassa split pushing so we're
