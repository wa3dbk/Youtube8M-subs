00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.530
 to the qg to subscribers welcome to the 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.150
 minute minecraft a show of the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.770
 minecraft zephyr chain that teaches you 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.000
 something on my card in a minute 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.650
 today a small long version 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.059
 so we cheat a little bit because we 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 has a very interesting subject ie 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.409
 the planes 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.570
 so a year ago in pastry at 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:25.810
 bate the jul minecraft mojang 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.429
 introduced the players tijd so we 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.980
 had just 5tet got to bhl 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.779
 in the creative midst and in the game for the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.760
 wall street in school to do the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.870
 beacon and it served us as decoration 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.540
 that you are very interesting 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.580
 afterwards, Ms. Zhang added a 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.440
 function a command that could 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.420
 heal in the cat as in a common 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.550
 ocs that allowed us to have the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.990
 specific joyful sizes that is to say 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.960
 a player who exists only a tale 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.850
 minecraft for example girls that's at 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.870
 tell me so the way to see that I 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.700
 will show you 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.860
 currently in the description he's going 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.380
 absolutely see all the sizes that 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.540
 I used in this tutorial so that 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.860
 it's a small gift you have not 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.360
 need to retain it per case you can 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.670
 to booze it's going to be awesome 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.090
 so it's just a give command 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.950
 to the person closest to the item 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 397 ie a players head a 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.900
 times the type of tahiti number three and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.540
 we will specify that the person to whom 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.000
 belongs the skull it's and girls so 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.990
 by doing this cut you get my 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.550
 head what is really very 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.780
 interesting so really that can you 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.040
 simply make decorations 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.470
 very interesting if you want to have 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.250
 wanted youtuber favorite in your 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.590
 construction 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 so that's pretty interesting but we 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 saw a little bit further than that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.630
 as you saw we have five mob but he 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.400
 there are more people than that in minecraft 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.840
 fexco makes nineteen banks which them 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.220
 responsible at mojang's 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.100
 development tomorrow kraft what was 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.600
 created accounts called dmh fc 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.979
 account there it's just as if 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.400
 you buy your account and you 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.310
 name the girls and your skins and her 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.869
 great and well fcd mechs account that 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.090
 been created by maud young people who are 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.250
 only specialized to have a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.220
 special skin head like for example 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.930
 Justice is another mhf Blaise therefore 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.600
 our mhf blaise was created only 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.840
 for our fans decorating heads of 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.060
 white players 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.940
 very interesting noted that when you 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.260
 use the wheel on a head that 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.730
 walk not really have to use the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.650
 order so that's how we do not 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.629
 may have thanks god bound all the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 sizes of the game modes so that's it 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.480
 really very interesting even ibrahim 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.739
 mythological characters 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.879
 so if you want to put in your 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.519
 constructions that it can be a 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.410
 really cool decoration so this one 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.060
 which is absolutely balannec so that 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.040
 it's really very interesting if we 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.200
 wants to use a chicken head one can 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.390
 use the head as many facts 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.340
 and oil machet or little used the head 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.540
 bass of spades besides the two I 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.099
 do not know why you're on the hen 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.489
 is now you will explain me it's 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.079
 really very funny but so now 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.220
 we want to use we can push more 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.390
 far so those presently we saw 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.190
 the screen which use them to 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.560
 personality to customize everything 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.620
 simply character disks from 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.379
 pnj of mob but could we not more 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.780
 push further and use the skins 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.739
 of characters to become an element 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.269
 decorative 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.610
 that's what we're going to do instinctively 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.049
 so instead of screaming 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.099
 of animals puts skins that could 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.599
 be boilerplate to create a 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.549
 atmosphere or improve our 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.069
 environment and that's what makes 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.049
 the jump in h adds a dma chef 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.130
 cactus for example so you can see 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.190
 that it's really cool in a 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.450
 desert canister mhf axa chest has 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.459
 really your room to small boxes 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.440
 on the edge of the bed for a map 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.139
 adventure is very complete minimal 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.569
 along very interesting way a way of 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.370
 make branches russia in mini 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.590
 tnt thing it's really cool here 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.780
 two types of tnt do justice and a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.069
 wind rose simply for 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.870
 give indications in your 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.450
 master server exclamation points 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.950
 important message for regions its 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.630
 walls zur if you understand this 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.870
 joke and you're a come of the 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.730
 minecraft community 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.299
 I am here now the attentionful eye 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.190
 very high 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.750
 that's what all the heads that 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.970
 god that our good brought in this is 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.260
 that but it does not stop there that stuff 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.230
 because you can now 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.180
 also use random players that 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.410
 you found on minecraft that go 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.750
 simply allow you to have 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.030
 different skins so if we have the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.260
 player called sdz so it's not 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.269
 a beggar that christ is really 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.160
 a player who bought the game and who 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.690
 wrote that and who told him me it's ok 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.530
 to be a beer my account for that it's 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.780
 really very interesting 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.659
 after that there would be angry at barembach 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.510
 soul who made a camera a cake 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:29.450
 a radio so the blue teaches to 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.500
 which radio a mini library c 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.150
 boem beats so great but watch out these 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.390
 seven lots are subject to change 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.430
 for example me michael zephyr 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.990
 it's very interesting I have my skin 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.120
 but if I wanted to change for a head 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.469
 of robot and ben I can also I change 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.909
 for a robot head my skin has to 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.940
 change also for a robot head 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.680
 so if you have the head of a bohemian 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.270
 beats to make a decoration of 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.409
 libraries and that unfortunately he 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.030
 songs what is not yours 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.560
 decoration and to the public and so do 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.289
 attention these topics to change then 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.760
 that the likes chief never changes so 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.650
 that's very interesting indeed 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.140
 in the description game website 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.729
 sober adults who is fully 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.010
 intended to find piles is 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.630
 interesting players so really 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.800
 can be interesting where left 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.030
 in the comments if you have a 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.650
 head that could be useful to the 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.719
 decoration of certain scenes 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.070
 it can be very interesting too 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.159
 last subtlety 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.930
 you could notice if I'm doing f5 that 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.280
 I do not have the moon on my skin 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.719
 simply because what you 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.890
 go on display it's your skull and no 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.599
 not the accessory 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.919
 so you can have accessories 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:33.140
 like for example when you saw 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.099
 skins the sick first example 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.180
 shorty no fish oxygen mask 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.250
 why well simply because 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.169
 it is an accessory to his skin while 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.650
 his head and well as I wanted 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.510
 present 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.150
 so that can really be a look 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.680
 important detail to note society effineo 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.750
 for the chain in fact shows a like 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.909
 said my little avatar here peace and blood 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.440
 stone do not forget to look at the 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.969
 previous minecraft minutes they are 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.969
 very interesting country 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.330
 he
