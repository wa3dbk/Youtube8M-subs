controversy about this image right here
has<00:00:12.599> been<00:00:12.840> solved<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> my<00:00:13.410> satisfaction<00:00:14.389> we

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
has been solved to my satisfaction we

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.120 
has been solved to my satisfaction we
appear<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.839> looking<00:00:16.109> at<00:00:16.260> an<00:00:16.410> anomaly<00:00:16.949> that

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
appear to be looking at an anomaly that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.580 
appear to be looking at an anomaly that
is<00:00:17.460> not<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.940> space<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.050> telescope

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
is not in space that is in a telescope

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.580 
is not in space that is in a telescope
so<00:00:20.279> i<00:00:20.310> want<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> eliminate<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.270> telescope<00:00:22.109> from

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
so i want to eliminate a telescope from

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.060 
so i want to eliminate a telescope from
my<00:00:22.890> investigation<00:00:23.420> it<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.810> telescope<00:00:25.470> cor

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
my investigation it is the telescope cor

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.720 
my investigation it is the telescope cor
to<00:00:26.369> ahead<00:00:27.060> telescope<00:00:28.130> if<00:00:29.130> anybody's<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.670> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to ahead telescope if anybody's going to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.359 
to ahead telescope if anybody's going to
send<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.150> an<00:00:30.300> image<00:00:30.570> using<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.560> soho<00:00:31.830> telescope

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
send me an image using a soho telescope

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
send me an image using a soho telescope
you're<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> use<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.200> right

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you're not going to use this one right

like that never heard of this guy before
but<00:01:08.700> he's<00:01:09.570> talking<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.229> solar<00:01:10.500> animal

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
but he's talking about the solar animal

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
but he's talking about the solar animal
he'd<00:01:11.010> coined<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> phrase<00:01:11.930> he's<00:01:12.930> using<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
he'd coined this phrase he's using the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.490 
he'd coined this phrase he's using the
COR<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.939> head<00:01:15.180> telescope<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.320> same

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
COR to a head telescope the very same

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
COR to a head telescope the very same
way<00:01:17.060> ok<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.810> anomaly<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
way ok this is the anomaly this is this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.370 
way ok this is the anomaly this is this
is<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> again<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.950> another<00:01:23.100> video<00:01:27.380> same

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
is it again in another video same

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
is it again in another video same
telescope<00:01:28.860> CEO<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.610> head<00:01:32.000> ok<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.060> i<00:01:33.240> went<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
telescope CEO or to head ok so i went to

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
telescope CEO or to head ok so i went to
today<00:01:34.470> i<00:01:34.979> went<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.119> own<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.570> know

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
today i went out and got my own you know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
today i went out and got my own you know
i<00:01:36.720> went<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> went<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> stereo<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.920> head<00:01:38.070> for

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
i went to went to the stereo we head for

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.630 
i went to went to the stereo we head for
cor<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.530> look<00:01:40.710> myself<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.280> guess<00:01:41.400> what

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
cor too and i look myself and guess what

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.020 
cor too and i look myself and guess what
here<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.790> same<00:01:44.790> anomaly

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
here it is it's right here same anomaly

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.690 
here it is it's right here same anomaly
it's<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> lens<00:01:47.869> same<00:01:48.869> thing<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.700> from

it's on the lens same thing here from
2008<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> stars<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
2008 you see the stars going by and this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.260 
2008 you see the stars going by and this
thing<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.689> moving<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> stereos<00:01:56.969> as

now<00:02:13.769> here's<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.370> deal<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:15.569> crew<00:02:15.780> 40<00:02:16.260> saw

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
now here's the deal when crew 40 saw

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.100 
now here's the deal when crew 40 saw
this<00:02:16.769> then<00:02:17.579> he<00:02:17.730> associated<00:02:18.209> with<00:02:18.599> what<00:02:18.810> he<00:02:18.900> saw

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this then he associated with what he saw

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.000 
this then he associated with what he saw
around<00:02:19.950> his<00:02:20.780> his<00:02:21.780> his<00:02:22.079> orbitals<00:02:22.590> were<00:02:22.680> popping

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
around his his his orbitals were popping

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.929 
around his his his orbitals were popping
out<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> 330<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.390> red<00:02:24.569> one<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:25.819> seven<00:02:26.819> and

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
out of it 330 the red one at seven and

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.479 
out of it 330 the red one at seven and
nine<00:02:27.569> o'clock<00:02:27.930> he<00:02:28.620> had<00:02:28.739> Orville's<00:02:29.069> coming<00:02:29.340> out

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
nine o'clock he had Orville's coming out

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.059 
nine o'clock he had Orville's coming out
and<00:02:29.700> eleven<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.090> twelve<00:02:30.180> o'clock<00:02:30.829> okay<00:02:31.829> now

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and eleven and twelve o'clock okay now

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.830 
and eleven and twelve o'clock okay now
that's<00:02:32.250> something<00:02:32.549> totally<00:02:32.790> different<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.810> I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's something totally different so I

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.869 
that's something totally different so I
believe<00:02:34.140> he<00:02:34.379> was<00:02:34.530> confused<00:02:35.069> when<00:02:35.280> he<00:02:35.340> saw<00:02:35.610> this

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
believe he was confused when he saw this

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.250 
believe he was confused when he saw this
on<00:02:36.500> may<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.709> 29th<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.430> 30th<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.849> 31st<00:02:39.260> what

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
on may the 29th the 30th and 31st what

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.740 
on may the 29th the 30th and 31st what
he<00:02:40.379> saw<00:02:40.650> was<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.370> event<00:02:41.579> horizon<00:02:41.670> around<00:02:42.510> a

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
he saw was the event horizon around a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.410 
he saw was the event horizon around a
high-density<00:02:43.079> object<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.370> still<00:02:44.579> have<00:02:44.640> 188

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
high-density object so we still have 188

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.339 
high-density object so we still have 188

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
near side of Leo we have our earth axis

consolation<00:03:01.849> okay<00:03:02.849> now<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.750> believe<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.040> NASA

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
consolation okay now I believe that NASA

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.119 
consolation okay now I believe that NASA
was<00:03:05.819> scrubbing<00:03:06.720> information<00:03:07.530> as<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.829> matter<00:03:08.040> of

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
was scrubbing information as a matter of

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.979 
was scrubbing information as a matter of
fact<00:03:08.190> i<00:03:08.579> hope<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.940> i<00:03:08.970> can<00:03:09.030> find<00:03:09.480> i<00:03:09.659> wish<00:03:09.840> i

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
no that's not it okay I wanted to find

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.480 
no that's not it okay I wanted to find
it<00:03:49.970> for<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.240> but<00:03:51.110> I<00:03:51.170> came<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:51.830> my<00:03:52.010> memory<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:52.430> I

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
it for you but I came to my memory but I

it for you but I came to my memory but I
didn't<00:03:52.640> have<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.820> ready<00:03:53.000> in<00:03:53.060> time<00:03:53.270> for<00:03:53.330> this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
didn't have it ready in time for this

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.330 
didn't have it ready in time for this
video<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.140> Mary<00:03:54.290> Greeley<00:03:54.680> did<00:03:54.890> make<00:03:55.040> a<00:03:55.070> video

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
video but Mary Greeley did make a video

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.270 
video but Mary Greeley did make a video
that<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:56.750> information<00:03:57.320> is<00:03:57.650> being<00:03:57.830> scrubbed

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
that the information is being scrubbed

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.930 
that the information is being scrubbed
and<00:03:59.440> NASA<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.710> scrubbing<00:04:00.980> information<00:04:01.790> from

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
and NASA is scrubbing information from

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.270 
and NASA is scrubbing information from
the<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.240> telescopes<00:04:02.810> now<00:04:03.410> that's<00:04:03.650> telling<00:04:04.100> me

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the so telescopes now that's telling me

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.130 
the so telescopes now that's telling me
that<00:04:04.700> they<00:04:04.820> are<00:04:04.940> covering<00:04:05.150> something<00:04:05.480> up<00:04:05.750> but

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
that they are covering something up but

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.600 
that they are covering something up but
it<00:04:06.200> also<00:04:06.410> tells<00:04:06.740> me<00:04:06.980> that<00:04:07.160> we're<00:04:07.280> not<00:04:07.400> gonna<00:04:07.490> be

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
it also tells me that we're not gonna be

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.790 
it also tells me that we're not gonna be
able<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.820> see<00:04:07.970> it<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.600> this<00:04:08.750> anomaly<00:04:09.200> is<00:04:09.560> out

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
able to see it so this anomaly is out

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.080 
able to see it so this anomaly is out
there<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:11.240> was<00:04:11.810> suspicious<00:04:12.170> but<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.760> did<00:04:13.940> put

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
there and I was suspicious but I did put

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.620 
there and I was suspicious but I did put
it<00:04:14.210> out<00:04:14.360> there<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.980> am<00:04:15.980> looking<00:04:16.100> at<00:04:16.340> an<00:04:16.430> object

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
it out there I am looking at an object

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.610 
it out there I am looking at an object
this<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:17.930> shown<00:04:18.230> near<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.620> Sun<00:04:18.890> on<00:04:19.250> 9<00:04:20.239> 15<00:04:20.750> now

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
this was shown near the Sun on 9 15 now

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.190 
this was shown near the Sun on 9 15 now
915<00:04:22.430> was<00:04:22.580> 188<00:04:23.150> day<00:04:23.450> if<00:04:23.570> you<00:04:23.660> go<00:04:23.780> back<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.080> my

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
915 was 188 day if you go back to my

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.340 
915 was 188 day if you go back to my
past<00:04:24.410> videos<00:04:25.150> 188<00:04:26.150> day<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.660> there<00:04:26.840> was<00:04:26.870> two

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
past videos 188 day and there was two

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.370 
past videos 188 day and there was two
earthquakes<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.950> day<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.820> show

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
earthquakes that day that show

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.350 
earthquakes that day that show
seismographs<00:04:30.380> all<00:04:30.680> over<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.190> planet<00:04:31.400> tell

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
seismographs all over the planet tell

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.670 
seismographs all over the planet tell
isn't<00:04:32.570> telling<00:04:32.870> me<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.200> there's<00:04:33.350> something

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
isn't telling me that there's something

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.080 
isn't telling me that there's something
out<00:04:33.830> there<00:04:33.860> that's<00:04:34.010> bigger<00:04:34.340> than<00:04:34.430> our<00:04:34.640> planet

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
out there that's bigger than our planet

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.300 
out there that's bigger than our planet
and<00:04:35.210> that's<00:04:35.900> what<00:04:36.050> we've<00:04:36.170> been<00:04:36.200> tracking<00:04:36.560> now

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
and that's what we've been tracking now

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.520 
and that's what we've been tracking now
what<00:04:37.580> I<00:04:37.610> expected<00:04:38.180> was<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.690> I'm<00:04:39.170> going<00:04:39.320> to<00:04:39.410> be

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
what I expected was that I'm going to be

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.860 
what I expected was that I'm going to be
able<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.770> see<00:04:40.040> some<00:04:40.700> sign<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.060> this<00:04:41.390> thing<00:04:41.630> on

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
able to see some sign of this thing on

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.150 
able to see some sign of this thing on
the<00:04:41.930> right<00:04:42.170> side<00:04:42.440> of<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.620> left<00:04:42.830> side<00:04:43.010> of<00:04:43.100> the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
the right side of the left side of the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.890 
the right side of the left side of the
Sun<00:04:43.370> if<00:04:43.610> it's<00:04:43.760> on<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:43.910> right<00:04:44.180> side<00:04:44.450> then<00:04:44.750> it's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
Sun if it's on the right side then it's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900 
Sun if it's on the right side then it's
still<00:04:45.020> coming<00:04:45.200> inbound<00:04:45.440> towards<00:04:45.920> Leo<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.430> from

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
still coming inbound towards Leo I from

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.200 
still coming inbound towards Leo I from
leo<00:04:47.380> okay<00:04:48.380> now<00:04:49.160> what<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.460> suspect<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:52.210> they

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
leo okay now what I suspect is that they

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
leo okay now what I suspect is that they
were<00:04:53.360> good<00:04:53.570> they<00:04:53.660> were<00:04:53.750> going<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.930> come<00:04:54.110> around

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
were good they were going to come around

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.900 
were good they were going to come around
in<00:04:54.440> orbit<00:04:54.830> and<00:04:55.010> we're<00:04:55.130> going<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.730> with

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
in orbit and we're going to the with

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.220 
in orbit and we're going to the with
that<00:04:56.090> we've<00:04:56.270> been<00:04:56.450> protected<00:04:57.050> by<00:04:57.169> the

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
that we've been protected by the

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.670 
that we've been protected by the
magnetism<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.130> our<00:04:58.490> son<00:04:58.790> because<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.450> 9<00:04:59.900> 15<00:05:00.380> I

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
magnetism of our son because on 9 15 I

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890 
magnetism of our son because on 9 15 I
know<00:05:00.740> where<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.190> is<00:05:01.340> celestial<00:05:01.910> II<00:05:02.000> as<00:05:02.540> far<00:05:02.810> as

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
know where it is celestial II as far as

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.150 
know where it is celestial II as far as
it's<00:05:03.020> less<00:05:03.169> your<00:05:03.320> coordinates<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.830> know<00:05:03.919> where

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
it's less your coordinates I know where

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.350 
it's less your coordinates I know where
it<00:05:04.190> is<00:05:04.310> in<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.550> straight<00:05:04.790> line<00:05:04.820> between<00:05:05.120> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
it is in a straight line between the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.940 
it is in a straight line between the
Earth<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.600> the<00:05:05.690> Sun<00:05:05.870> straight<00:05:06.260> out<00:05:06.410> I<00:05:06.590> do<00:05:06.710> not

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
Earth and the Sun straight out I do not

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.620 
Earth and the Sun straight out I do not
know<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.310> distance<00:05:07.700> I<00:05:07.880> don't<00:05:08.060> do<00:05:08.360> not<00:05:08.510> know

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
know the distance I don't do not know

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.570 
know the distance I don't do not know
the<00:05:08.750> velocity<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.890> this<00:05:10.070> thing<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.280> coming

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
the velocity that this thing is coming

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.510 
the velocity that this thing is coming
in<00:05:11.500> but<00:05:12.500> they<00:05:12.620> I<00:05:12.650> think<00:05:13.040> I've<00:05:13.130> figured<00:05:13.280> out<00:05:13.460> a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
in but they I think I've figured out a

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.650 
in but they I think I've figured out a
way<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:15.530> come<00:05:16.100> up<00:05:16.130> with<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.520> data<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:17.090> think

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
way to come up with that data I think

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.060 
way to come up with that data I think
it's<00:05:17.780> things<00:05:17.930> 106<00:05:18.680> days<00:05:18.890> behind<00:05:20.350> Elenin<00:05:21.350> and

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
it's things 106 days behind Elenin and

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.650 
it's things 106 days behind Elenin and
it's<00:05:22.280> closing<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:22.730> gap<00:05:22.910> in<00:05:23.120> an<00:05:23.210> accordion

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
it's closing the gap in an accordion

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.000 
it's closing the gap in an accordion
it's<00:05:23.840> like<00:05:23.960> an<00:05:24.080> accordion<00:05:24.320> effect<00:05:24.590> because

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
it's like an accordion effect because

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.590 
it's like an accordion effect because
it's<00:05:25.160> still<00:05:25.310> reaching<00:05:25.700> perihelion<00:05:26.000> position

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
it's still reaching perihelion position

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.380 
it's still reaching perihelion position
why<00:05:26.720> Ellen<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.320> beyond<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.160> so<00:05:28.669> Ellen<00:05:29.300> is

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
why Ellen is beyond it so Ellen is

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.080 
why Ellen is beyond it so Ellen is
slowing<00:05:29.690> down<00:05:29.840> so<00:05:30.440> it's<00:05:30.620> not<00:05:30.680> really<00:05:31.040> 106<00:05:31.940> days

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
slowing down so it's not really 106 days

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.140 
slowing down so it's not really 106 days
behind<00:05:32.330> its<00:05:32.690> closing<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.140> gap<00:05:33.970> that's<00:05:34.970> where

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
behind its closing the gap that's where

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.480 
behind its closing the gap that's where
I<00:05:35.180> think<00:05:35.240> it<00:05:35.510> is<00:05:35.770> but<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.830> don't<00:05:37.070> have<00:05:37.160> enough<00:05:37.340> to

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
I think it is but I don't have enough to

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.010 
I think it is but I don't have enough to
end<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:38.000> don't<00:05:38.180> have<00:05:38.270> enough<00:05:38.419> data<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.720> draw

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
end I don't have enough data to draw

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.550 
end I don't have enough data to draw
that<00:05:39.050> conclusion<00:05:39.430> at<00:05:40.430> this<00:05:40.669> time<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:42.260> this

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
that conclusion at this time but this

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.490 
that conclusion at this time but this
here<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:43.130> an<00:05:43.430> anomaly<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:44.570> know<00:05:44.690> if<00:05:45.080> anybody's

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
here is an anomaly you know if anybody's

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.020 
here is an anomaly you know if anybody's
going<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:45.650> send<00:05:45.860> me<00:05:45.950> images<00:05:46.040> is<00:05:46.400> it's<00:05:46.820> not

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
going to send me images is it's not

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.430 
going to send me images is it's not
going<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.300> be<00:05:47.419> from<00:05:47.600> this<00:05:47.690> telescope<00:05:48.230> right

here<00:05:48.680> this<00:05:49.040> does<00:05:49.280> have<00:05:49.520> the<00:05:49.840> anomaly<00:05:50.840> on<00:05:50.870> it

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
here this does have the anomaly on it

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.110 
here this does have the anomaly on it
from<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:51.620> lens<00:05:51.890> not<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.460> anomaly<00:05:52.820> from<00:05:53.000> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
from the lens not the anomaly from the

from the lens not the anomaly from the
in<00:05:53.360> our<00:05:53.510> solar<00:05:53.780> system<00:05:54.169> I<00:05:54.380> just<00:05:55.310> want<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.520> make

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
in our solar system I just want to make

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.380 
in our solar system I just want to make
that<00:05:55.760> clear<00:05:55.820> to<00:05:56.740> everybody<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:58.270> we<00:05:59.270> are
