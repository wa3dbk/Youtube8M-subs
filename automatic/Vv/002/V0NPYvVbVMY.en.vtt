00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.020
 analysis of the song is not the time the sky stars are burning 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.710
 does not start with chord q which 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.690
 clamped on the second fret 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:53.540
 the first 3 strings and on the third fret the second 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:53.540
 string bout joining such down veins 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 then there is a bust which is played like this 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.409
 We pull the first string in vain and in this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.580
 moment 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:12.420
 we clamp on the third fret 1 will become further 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 again we pull the first string and in this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.860
 moment we hold on the fifth fret first 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.200
 string 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:30.329
 here so I will be all further fat again 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:34.640
 stop bush on the third fret further 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:42.420
 on the second fret and at this moment we press 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.530
 on the third one is on 1 string on the second 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.530
 fret first empty 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.679
 all this must be done very quickly 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.570
 followed by the subsequent chords 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.000
 I do not know the name so I will just 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.990
 speak their arrangement on the second fret 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.019
 we clamp bars on the third fret second 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.269
 clamp the string and on the fourth fret 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.349
 the fourth fourth assault we clamp the battle 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:18.560
 exactly the same down up down 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:28.950
 bust is exactly the same as in chord d 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:32.280
 Here below is a chord that is clamped 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.840
 on the third fret bars on the fourth fret 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.890
 the third string and on the fifth fret 4 5 string 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.470
 fight down up down here already bust 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.989
 slightly different from the previous one 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.540
 played so we pull the first string 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.140
 empty and at this moment we clamp on the fifth 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.500
 fret first string 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.830
 still rudder guy and our clamp on 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.830
 on the seventh fret 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:07.510
 find the third fret on 2 frets 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:13.530
 black on the second fret and at this point on 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.530
 third we clamp by 2 to 5 and is empty 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.420
 then comes the chord that deals with 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.090
 the fifth fret bars in the sixth year the third 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.830
 string and on the seventh fret 4 5 string 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.360
 fighting down down and here already too 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.130
 another brute of the seventh fret 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.610
 five 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.370
 2 and at this time we clamp on the third fret 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.370
 Peru countries that is like this 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.340
 and 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.079
 Next comes the same chords 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:23.370
 chords 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:28.300
 bout this down down three times up 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.590
 down up down up up up down 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.590
 up down up 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:45.689
 after playing down up down 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.489
 three times up and when only 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:54.989
 starting to lower down we clamp on 

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:59.729
 third fret first string to come out 

00:04:54.989 --> 00:05:00.959
 such a sound after the battle was played 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.179
 transition time to the next chord 

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:08.219
 just take on the empty strings gave it goes 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:14.279
 I already explained such a chord there 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:17.149
 exactly the same fight will strike a chord on 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.149
 the third fret which 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.139
 at the time of coming again beat on empty 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.139
 so that we have it all very 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.069
 everything
