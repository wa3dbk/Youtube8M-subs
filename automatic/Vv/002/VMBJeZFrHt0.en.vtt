00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.410
 victory of Real Madrid against the 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.899
 fc.barcelona by two goals to one in the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.600
 twenty-sixth day of the bbva league 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:14.290
 the white box again defeated the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.820
 jordi roura's picture on the day that 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.820
 mourinho reserved some players 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.789
 as a Christian ronaldo a very madrid 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.490
 'plugged' that started the match 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.259
 and marking the first goal 6 minutes 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.749
 in an action in which morata hangs 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:32.189
 from the left and benzema just 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.189
 beating the goalkeeper Víctor Váldés 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 was 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 1 to 0 for the set of mourinho 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.680
 first serious arrival of the realmadrid 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.000
 first goal 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 of the Madridista team 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 with maradona watching the game from one 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.360
 of the boxes of santiago bernabéu el 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.309
 barcelona that had a lot of possession about 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.910
 all in the first period and found in 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.330
 this action 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.490
 the goal of the draw the play is of messi 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.970
 that with the left-hander it ends up beating the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.780
 goalkeeper diego lopez and in minute 17 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.540
 equalized the shock tied 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.890
 for the month barca and in an action in the 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.770
 that is not out of the game because it is 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.400
 well enabling the Argentine star and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.390
 here we see the dribble over 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.540
 sergio ramos de león and it ends up marking 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.490
 1 to 1 achieved in this way in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.500
 barcelona exceeded the first quarter of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.500
 time to equalize the shock 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.460
 and have as we said a lot of possession 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.170
 although that did not translate occasionally 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.520
 this was one of the few that had the 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.060
 barça in the match 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.710
 this shot by leo messilandito that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.710
 ends up catching without problems of 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.590
 goalkeeper diego lópez el madrid with less 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.899
 possession but with dangerous arrivals 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.759
 like this one in which morata is about 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 to surprise víctor valdés just 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.219
 morata sending the ball to the net 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.420
 outside of the right post of goal 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.420
 of valdés 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.340
 came to rest with a draw at 1 in 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.660
 the marker and already in the second half 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.850
 the barca had perhaps less control 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 but above all not too many arrivals 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.230
 of danger this is an action to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.230
 backlash that would end with via 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.700
 losing the ball even though he 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.459
 understood that it must have been a corner kick 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.049
 if it seems in the repetition as the gourd 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.370
 he is the last player to touch the ball 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.830
 gave entrance 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.650
 in this second time mourinho to two 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.010
 headlines like khedira and christian 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.420
 ronaldo regained position of 9 or he got 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.670
 of 9 morata who had played 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.709
 Christians throughout the first period 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.440
 and Christian was already on the side 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.960
 left 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.540
 the Portuguese who tried from the front 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.010
 of the area with this shot with this foul 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.380
 that ended up rejecting very well 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.390
 valdés 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.250
 backlash of madrid was opened more the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.370
 party in the second less domain like 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.760
 we said of the barcelona and typical play 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.160
 of Christian with power and speed 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.910
 ends up sending the ball to the end 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.970
 to the right of the goal 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.470
 of valdés and this is a very clear that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.810
 has the madrid for the 2 to 1 great 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.570
 intervention of Victor Vctor and 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.930
 many discussions in defense of the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.930
 team 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.950
 by jordi roura 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.460
 and Madrid would end up finding the goal 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.730
 of victory in this header 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.210
 from sergio ramos minutes 81 from match to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.870
 9 for the final the white central to 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.640
 notary 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.010
 since 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.190
 this play from the corner thrown by 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.940
 modric would put the 2 to 1 that would already be 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.590
 definitive in the match 2 to 1 for the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.530
 madrid that cuts up to 13 points 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.209
 the difference with the club still had 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.890
 Christian opportunity to put the 3 to 1 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.890
 with this ball to the crosshead of the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.590
 squad 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 in a foul in the front of the area 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.750
 it ended with double chance because 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.250
 had there's a second chance pp that he played 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.840
 in the center of the field in this match 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.230
 we have the shot with pepe's left 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.490
 another intervention by valdés was encouraged the 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.949
 madrid in the final straight with a 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.900
 barcelona already very touched but still 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.350
 could tie the barça in this penalty 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.830
 who did not whistle the referee pererez lasa for the 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.380
 lack of sergio bouquets 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.990
 about Adriano one of the games that 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.380
 I enter in the second period plus the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.360
 college 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.159
 He ended up stopping the game 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.919
 and showed yellow to andres iniesta 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:58.500
 for protesting and gave the ball to 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.419
 white box at the end victory of the real 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.699
 madrid who returns to beat the barcelona 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.099
 this time in the league and he did it in the 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.500
 bernabéu on the twenty-sixth day in 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.599
 the bernabéu with final controversy by the 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.979
 expulsion of Valdez Real Madrid 2 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.979
 barcelona 1
