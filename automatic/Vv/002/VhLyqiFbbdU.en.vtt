00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hi, I'm Catalina Alba and today I bring you 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.710
 a recipe with very different chicken 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.260
 let's make a breast fillet 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.740
 chicken with a sauce of plums and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.520
 green olives that is amazing that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.180
 we need plum sauce 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.180
 constancy 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.849
 fruit vinegar the constancy 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 some green olives without the bone 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.770
 cut into half sliced ​​slices 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.770
 teaspoon of oregano 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.380
 a clove of chopped garlic 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:47.070
 Salt pepper a little oil and for 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.350
 course a chicken breast fillet 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.270
 The first thing we are going to do is warm up 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.090
 a pan that has a surface 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.630
 comfortable to work with a bit of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.360
 oil that barely heals and meanwhile 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's pepper the chicken breast 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 and we are going to put pepper to taste 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 when the oil is already hot 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.120
 we can put 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.120
 steak to brown 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.440
 when it is golden on the other side 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.960
 let's remove the chicken breast the 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.790
 we put on a plate and in the same pan 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.940
 let's prepare the sauce very well 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.240
 this chicken breast is already golden brown 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.240
 let's lower the fire to the minimum 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.430
 and I'm going to withdraw it and I'm going to leave it in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.439
 a plate and with the fire very low we go 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.850
 to prepare the sauce and then we have 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.799
 the star ingredient of the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.520
 preparation that is the sauce if it were the 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:58.020
 record we will use 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.020
 a quarter cup 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 let's put the cross a little garlic 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.009
 chopped 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.580
 another very rich ingredient that is going to 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 give a slightly citrusy flavor that is the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.630
 fruit vinegar the constancy we are going to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.630
 put two large spoons 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.370
 and finally 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.980
 the oregano we are going to mix very well 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.590
 Now I can get on the fire 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 leave it medium-low 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 a quarter of green olives in slices 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.900
 we mix 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:50.959
 and again we put the steak pieces 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.959
 of breast in the pan 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:00.420
 and so at low medium heat I'm going to cover 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.870
 and let's let them cook for 5 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.790
 minutes or until approximately 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.670
 let's see that chicken meat is 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.650
 completely white, the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.060
 five minutes we should wait 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.490
 so that the chicken was finished 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.490
 cook so it's time to serve 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.830
 let's put the steaks on a plate 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 and we're going to bathe it with the sauce 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.880
 olives 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.500
 that they have not dared to prepare 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.970
 a sauce 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:47.750
 with plums and olives that attracted me 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.330
 but the turn now is for 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.520
 If you have questions, you know that 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.170
