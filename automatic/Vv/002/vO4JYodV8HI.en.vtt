00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.320
 calculate the logarithm in base 5 of 20 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.890
 well let's call this x and if this were 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.010
 exact 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.580
 we have an exponential equation 5 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.960
 ^ x it would also be necessary to calculate 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 sx 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.890
 if this were accurate it will work and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.900
 we get the logarithm tree 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 to solve this exponential equation 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.669
 5 we break it down into prime factors 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.820
 as 5 are prime numbers is 5 stays 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.820
 same 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.370
 and now 20 we factor them 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:46.190
 cousins we do 20 2 10 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.530
 2 551 texts squared by 5 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.430
 we substitute 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.940
 and now to be able to solve the equation 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.360
 exponential that we have here 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 directly 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.590
 all the powers that appear have 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.050
 have to have the same base and observe that 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.940
 here we have base 52 and base 5 then 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.660
 all the powers that appear not 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.660
 have the same base 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 then you can not solve 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.460
 directly this exponential equation 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 therefore from the equation 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.710
 exponential directly we can not 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.100
 calculate this logarithm and then what 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.430
 What is done is to use the form 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.940
 basic meat formula the formula 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.310
 basic meat says that any 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.620
 logarithm chosen to a base which 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 you want in this case let's take 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.260
 the base number the Neperian logarithm 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.760
 Well, this is the Neperian logarithm 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.220
 neperian logarithm the same base above 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.650
 and down d 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 20 of the number of which we calculate the 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.080
 logarithm neperian logarithm of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.780
 the base of 5 clear for this we are going to 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.790
 have to use the calculator then 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.040
 I'm going to take the calculator and I'm going to 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.040
 calculate each of these things 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.300
 neperian logarithm of 20 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.080
 299 57 collect four decimal places 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.210
 we will achieve period of 5 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.210
 16 094 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.500
 Of course this is an approximate result in 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.250
 issues of figures of bad things for more 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.250
 topics approximate 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.210
 / 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.500
 16 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.020
 4 the result is the logarithm we have left 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.530
 1 rounding to the fourth tenth digit 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:57.870
 as 86 14 approximate result 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 then this is the value of the logarithm 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.650
 let's observe that directly with the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.870
 calculator this could not be done either 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.940
 because there is not a key that tells you how 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.000
 do the logarithm in base 5 but if 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.620
 using the base change form the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 form of base change like we have 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.940
 used logarithm neperian logarithm 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.470
 in base 10 you can use logarithms the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.300
 base you want let's see the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.400
 calculator also do logarithms in 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.530
 base 10 since you could have put the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.959
 logarithm base 10 out of 20 match 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.580
 logarithm in base 10 5 you can check 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.440
 that although the numbers that you 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.330
 would appear in the numerator and in the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.650
 denominator would be different the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.650
 result is the same
