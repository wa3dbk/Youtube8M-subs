okay I think when it comes down to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.589 
okay I think when it comes down to
people<00:02:10.550> standing<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:12.030> front<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.360> other<00:02:12.510> people

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
photographs then you've kind of got to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
photographs then you've kind of got to
do<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.510> mean<00:02:25.319> this<00:02:25.470> officiously<00:02:25.920> it's

do it I mean this officiously it's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.210 
do it I mean this officiously it's
possible<00:02:26.630> way<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:28.260> think<00:02:28.830> there's<00:02:28.980> an<00:02:29.069> art

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
