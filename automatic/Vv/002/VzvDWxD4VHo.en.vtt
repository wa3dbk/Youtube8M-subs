00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:12.940
 I made seasoning with garlic soy sauce and sprinkled with starch and fried and fried 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.940
 I think that everyone can enjoy it deliciously because the smell peculiar to the lever is also gone 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 Hmmm 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.100
 We make combined seasoning for after the turn 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.660
 A book of cloud amount 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 From above 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.080
 To steal the secret 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.080
 Soy sauce 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.300
 It is alcohol 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:44.910
 Trying of his small 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.810
 Add pepper and mix thoroughly 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.490
 The seasoning was done with this 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.420
 Pig levers may be sold in thin slices or in blocks. 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:59.060
 But 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:05.210
 In the case of blocks, it's a bit hard to cut, so it's a bit frozen 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.670
 It cuts in the thickness you like, so if you buy it, put it in the freezer and handle it as easy as half. 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.540
 Will be 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.760
 It's a lever but after 5 minutes of exposure to water 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:21.600
 When the blood removal is over, drain off 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:26.409
 I put the seasoned but not mix well and put the garlic down into the soy sauce 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.280
 The odor of special nutrition disappears by putting on garlic top 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:36.500
 Say about five fins entwined end and give it a seasoned 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:41.869
 After 5 minutes of seasoning, it's like this. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.369
 At the same but often it says Nante only raised this we will put glare of potato starch 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.159
 It is the same method 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.300
 In the feeling that a lot of extra- stark chestnut powder or extraneous powder is dropped again 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.400
 One by one is a little time though 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:00.290
 Just like this , please put on starch 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.290
 And then I left the oil a little longer in the frying pan to warm 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.430
 It is fried fried little or rather fry 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.820
 Here in advance 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.400
 Put on studio and sprinkled with starch 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.400
 We will continue to souvenir that had a lever 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.670
 I will return if the brown color is firm 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:36.260
 When it's all turned over, weaken the fire a little and let it go through completely. 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:42.200
 Please take out the lever once when you feel completely irritated by the fellows. 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:46.390
 I learned 1 but it still looks like this when I continue to fry vegetables with a lever smell si 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:53.520
 I'm going to get my grandson so take it out here 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.520
 Wipe with a once paper who ply bread again oil here 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.319
 And first of all it is onion 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:09.379
 Sing onion 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:12.040
 So I add a lot of mira here, but it's the axis ahead well 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.040
 Put 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:22.870
 1I put all the leaves in the place I hurt 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.310
 Onions and 2 runs through 2 seasons 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.310
 Day is a strength here 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:39.190
 If you feel the oil has changed in the whole 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:43.720
 Stir fry and return all levers removed 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.819
 It had to fit in just beforehand If you return the lever 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.200
 The combined net amount 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.459
 like 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.459
 I can insert it 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.560
 Familiarize the taste while mixing 2 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.540
 The sweet smell of onion is very good and delicious 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:09.120
 I feel like eating early 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.950
 Yes this is the completion of the liver leek Itano 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.069
 Oh 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.069
