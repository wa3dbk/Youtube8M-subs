super well maybe I'll maybe I'll try
this<00:00:21.150> more<00:00:21.330> than<00:00:21.420> once<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.859> take<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.070> book

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

this more than once and take the book
and<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.699> want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.199> one<00:00:25.769> inch<00:00:25.980> border

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
and you want to have a one inch border

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.720 
and you want to have a one inch border
on<00:00:26.939> each<00:00:27.390> side<00:00:27.750> that's<00:00:28.470> big<00:00:28.710> bigger<00:00:29.429> than<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
on each side that's big bigger than the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.600 
on each side that's big bigger than the
book<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.179> kind<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.510> turn<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> over<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.289> way

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
book so I kind of turn it over one way

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.420 
book so I kind of turn it over one way
guess<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.239> inch<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.370> kind<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
guess about an inch or so and kind of

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.840 
guess about an inch or so and kind of
measure<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.880> over<00:00:36.059> across<00:00:37.430> so<00:00:38.430> then<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.790> know

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
measure it over across so then I know

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.350 
measure it over across so then I know
where<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> cut

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
where I'm going so we're going to cut

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.260 
where I'm going so we're going to cut
that<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:45.090> inch

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that you know so it's that one inch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.720 
that you know so it's that one inch
bigger<00:00:45.510> than<00:00:45.809> both<00:00:46.110> edge<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> cover<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
bigger than both edge of the cover and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260 
bigger than both edge of the cover and
the<00:00:48.180> spine<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:50.129> straighter<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> better<00:00:51.059> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the spine the straighter the better is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:01.810 
the spine the straighter the better is
assure<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.129> don't<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.399> crazy<00:00:54.390> perfection

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.479 

sometimes<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> contact<00:01:03.539> paper<00:01:03.750> has<00:01:04.460> like<00:01:05.460> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
sometimes the contact paper has like a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.530 
sometimes the contact paper has like a
grid<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.450> which<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.229> helpful<00:01:11.540> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
grid on it which is really helpful and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
grid on it which is really helpful and
then<00:01:12.659> you've<00:01:12.930> got<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:14.100> size<00:01:14.369> let's<00:01:14.670> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
then you've got your size let's just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.980 
then you've got your size let's just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.540

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
then you're going to put the book in and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
you want the fold line to be right down

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.750 
you want the fold line to be right down
the<00:01:35.050> middle<00:01:35.080> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.650> spinal<00:01:35.920> bit<00:01:36.220> see<00:01:36.580> what<00:01:36.610> I

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
peel back the contact paper to expose

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.010 
peel back the contact paper to expose
just<00:01:54.490> one<00:01:54.880> half<00:01:55.150> of<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:55.630> you're<00:01:55.780> going<00:01:55.960> to

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
just one half of it so you're going to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.190 
just one half of it so you're going to
peel<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.200> back<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> fold<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.780> kind<00:01:59.110> of

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
peel it back to the fold it's kind of

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:06.240 
peel it back to the fold it's kind of
hard<00:01:59.500> you<00:02:04.170> want<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.290> be<00:02:05.410> doing<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.830> like<00:02:06.009> on<00:02:06.220> a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
hard you want to be doing this like on a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.760 
hard you want to be doing this like on a
clean<00:02:06.610> surface<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.330> you<00:02:07.390> get<00:02:07.660> less<00:02:07.990> like<00:02:08.440> dust

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
clean surface so you get less like dust

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.840 
clean surface so you get less like dust
or<00:02:09.100> whatever<00:02:09.850> I<00:02:10.149> wouldn't<00:02:10.600> do<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.869> carpet

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850

or whatever I wouldn't do it on carpet
you<00:02:12.850> get<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:13.090> these<00:02:13.239> carpet<00:02:13.660> fibers<00:02:14.310> okay<00:02:15.310> so

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
you get all these carpet fibers okay so

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.290 
you get all these carpet fibers okay so
I<00:02:16.000> feel<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.390> half<00:02:16.930> way<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.520> just<00:02:18.700> kind<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> do

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
I feel that half way you just kind of do

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.060 
I feel that half way you just kind of do
your<00:02:19.420> best<00:02:19.660> guess<00:02:20.050> line<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.530> up<00:02:20.590> top<00:02:20.890> and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
your best guess line it up top and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.400 
your best guess line it up top and
bottom<00:02:21.540> right<00:02:22.540> down<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.959> middle<00:02:23.790> okay<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:26.260> now

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
bottom right down the middle okay so now

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.400 
bottom right down the middle okay so now
it's<00:02:26.590> sticking<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.250> spine

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's sticking to that spine

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
so then do the other corner straight as

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.589 
so then do the other corner straight as
you<00:04:19.449> can<00:04:20.880> take<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.910> triangle<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:24.639> reinforce

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599

edge<00:04:55.780> to<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.710> very<00:04:57.280> corners<00:04:57.699> by<00:04:57.909> and<00:04:58.030> it's

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
edge to the very corners by and it's

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.649 
edge to the very corners by and it's
going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> look<00:04:58.449> very<00:04:58.510> similar<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.289> this<00:04:59.590> side

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
going to look very similar to this side

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.719 
going to look very similar to this side
we're<00:05:01.659> going<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:01.900> do<00:05:01.990> it<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.229> both<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:03.460> top<00:05:03.669> and

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
we're going to do it on both the top and

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.950 
we're going to do it on both the top and
the<00:05:04.150> bottom<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:05.349> like<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.770> cut<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.039> um<00:05:06.960> to

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the bottom and I like to cut it um to

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.129 
the bottom and I like to cut it um to
wherever<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:09.460> page<00:05:09.759> meets<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.360> cover<00:05:10.630> so<00:05:10.990> if

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
wherever the page meets the cover so if

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.779 
wherever the page meets the cover so if
it's<00:05:11.320> not<00:05:11.470> quite<00:05:11.889> down<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.370> spine<00:05:12.580> like

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
it's not quite down on the spine like

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.379 
it's not quite down on the spine like
this<00:05:12.970> one's<00:05:13.210> not<00:05:13.509> it's<00:05:14.229> not<00:05:14.500> a<00:05:14.560> big<00:05:14.770> deal<00:05:15.389> so

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
this one's not it's not a big deal so

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.659 
this one's not it's not a big deal so
your<00:05:16.539> cut<00:05:16.780> looks<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.229> this<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:18.370> you're

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
your cut looks like this and you're

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:27.439 
your cut looks like this and you're
going<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.849> fold<00:05:19.120> this<00:05:19.360> down<00:05:19.530> just<00:05:20.530> like<00:05:20.710> that

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.430 

then<00:05:28.449> you're<00:05:28.570> going<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.750> do<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.259> the

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
then you're going to do that on the

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.570 
then you're going to do that on the
other<00:05:29.530> side<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.759> that<00:05:30.789> corner<00:05:31.330> is<00:05:31.449> going<00:05:31.599> to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
other side so that corner is going to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.990 
other side so that corner is going to
come<00:05:33.580> right<00:05:34.120> there<00:05:35.310> looks<00:05:36.310> like<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:39.000> and

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
come right there looks like that and

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.510 
come right there looks like that and
fold<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.389> down

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.290 

okay

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.260 

now<00:05:52.300> we're<00:05:52.479> going<00:05:52.570> to<00:05:52.660> do<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:52.960> other<00:05:53.110> side<00:05:54.270> so

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
now we're going to do the other side so

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.830 
now we're going to do the other side so
flip<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.720> book<00:05:55.840> over<00:05:57.210> get<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.330> as<00:05:58.449> close<00:05:58.660> to

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
flip the book over get it as close to

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.540 
flip the book over get it as close to
the<00:05:58.900> kind<00:05:59.110> of<00:05:59.169> sign<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.770> just<00:05:59.949> cover<00:06:00.250> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
the kind of sign and just cover the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.689 
the kind of sign and just cover the
other<00:06:00.699> side<00:06:01.260> with<00:06:02.260> the<00:06:02.410> contact<00:06:02.860> paper<00:06:05.699> like

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
other side with the contact paper like

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.030 
other side with the contact paper like
that<00:06:07.470> press<00:06:08.470> out<00:06:08.680> the<00:06:08.860> bubbles<00:06:10.889> you're<00:06:11.889> going

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
that press out the bubbles you're going

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:34.430 
that press out the bubbles you're going
to<00:06:12.100> make<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.430> corner<00:06:13.030> cut<00:06:13.270> along<00:06:13.780> the<00:06:14.110> edge

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.070 

we'll<00:06:35.440> do<00:06:35.560> our<00:06:35.620> other<00:06:35.889> corner<00:06:36.430> I<00:06:36.780> made<00:06:37.780> it<00:06:37.960> a

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
we'll do our other corner I made it a

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.950 
we'll do our other corner I made it a
little<00:06:38.110> too<00:06:38.380> big<00:06:38.889> that<00:06:39.240> looks<00:06:40.240> like<00:06:40.449> so<00:06:40.900> it

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
little too big that looks like so it

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.990 
little too big that looks like so it
just<00:06:41.169> it's<00:06:41.710> not<00:06:41.949> a<00:06:41.979> big<00:06:42.310> deal<00:06:42.460> it<00:06:42.610> just<00:06:42.639> kind<00:06:42.940> of

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 
just it's not a big deal it just kind of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.400 
just it's not a big deal it just kind of
makes<00:06:43.180> it<00:06:43.389> hard<00:06:43.630> to<00:06:43.690> work<00:06:44.020> with<00:06:44.940> but<00:06:45.940> all<00:06:46.780> of

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
makes it hard to work with but all of

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.800 
makes it hard to work with but all of
this<00:06:47.650> I<00:06:47.979> feel<00:06:48.340> like<00:06:48.370> is<00:06:48.729> better<00:06:49.090> than<00:06:49.360> none<00:06:49.660> of

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
this I feel like is better than none of

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.510 
this I feel like is better than none of
it<00:06:49.990> you<00:06:50.260> know<00:06:50.410> so<00:06:50.860> it<00:06:50.919> doesn't<00:06:50.979> have<00:06:51.280> to<00:06:51.400> be

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 
it you know so it doesn't have to be

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.420 
it you know so it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:06:52.680> now<00:06:53.680> you're<00:06:53.919> going<00:06:54.039> to<00:06:54.130> fall<00:06:54.400> down

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
perfect now you're going to fall down

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.300 
perfect now you're going to fall down
you've<00:06:54.970> got<00:06:55.150> the<00:06:55.330> two<00:06:55.539> corners<00:06:56.020> done<00:06:56.310> like

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
you've got the two corners done like

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.920 
you've got the two corners done like
that<00:06:57.639> and<00:06:57.940> now<00:06:58.060> you're<00:06:58.210> folding<00:06:58.419> down<00:06:58.690> that

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
that and now you're folding down that

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.480 
that and now you're folding down that
side<00:06:59.229> part<00:06:59.860> right<00:07:00.039> here<00:07:02.010> nice<00:07:03.010> and<00:07:03.280> tight

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
side part right here nice and tight

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.190 
side part right here nice and tight
against<00:07:04.090> the<00:07:04.240> book<00:07:04.539> cover<00:07:06.180> obviously<00:07:07.180> you<00:07:08.050> can

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
against the book cover obviously you can

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.780 
only do this on paperback books I've
never<00:07:10.900> tried<00:07:11.320> it<00:07:11.380> on<00:07:11.680> a<00:07:11.710> hardcover<00:07:12.780> although
