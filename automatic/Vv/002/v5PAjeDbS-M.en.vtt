thing they got a brand new capture sort

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.730 
thing they got a brand new capture sort
of<00:01:45.360> game<00:01:45.509> tab<00:01:45.720> coming<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.170> competitive

of game tab coming out as competitive

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550 
of game tab coming out as competitive
game<00:01:47.310> type<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.790> team<00:01:48.000> mole<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> suppose<00:01:48.780> that's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
game type of team mole I suppose that's

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
game type of team mole I suppose that's
that's<00:01:49.829> pretty<00:01:50.040> interesting<00:01:50.280> i'm<00:01:50.610> really

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
that's pretty interesting i'm really

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
that's pretty interesting i'm really
interested<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.810> i'm<00:01:52.079> not<00:01:52.140> sure

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
interested in this actually i'm not sure

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
interested in this actually i'm not sure
exactly<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> team<00:01:53.040> size<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.420> saves

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
exactly what a team size is but it saves

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
exactly what a team size is but it saves
that<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.380> other<00:01:55.530> sort<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.950> classical<00:01:56.399> twist

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that it's other sort of classical twist

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
that it's other sort of classical twist
on<00:01:56.850> capture<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> flag<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.750> cap<00:01:58.320> Gino<00:01:58.710> capture

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
on capture the flag so cap Gino capture

00:01:59.009 --> 00:01:59.899 
on capture the flag so cap Gino capture
the<00:01:59.100> flag<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.700> seems

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the flag so that's that seems

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.100 
the flag so that's that seems
interesting<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.450> exactly<00:02:00.689> capture<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
interesting it's not exactly capture the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.600 
interesting it's not exactly capture the
flag<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:01.920> put<00:02:02.040> their<00:02:02.159> own<00:02:02.250> sort<00:02:02.490> of

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
flag because they put their own sort of

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
flag because they put their own sort of
twist<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:03.479> see<00:02:03.659> sort<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.469> with

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
twist to it as you can see sort of with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.230 
twist to it as you can see sort of with
their<00:02:04.770> own<00:02:04.950> variations<00:02:05.759> but<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.090> different

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
their own variations but for different

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.570 
their own variations but for different
variation<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.899> get<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> raid<00:02:07.229> content<00:02:07.770> hold<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
variation to get a raid content hold and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
variation to get a raid content hold and
GTA<00:02:08.940> they're<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> bring<00:02:09.869> out

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
