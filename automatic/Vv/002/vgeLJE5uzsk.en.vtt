00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.980
 and today we are going to make a cheese frosting 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.440
 chocolate cream that is spectacular 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.889
 because it 's that mixture between the cheese 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.690
 cream and chocolate leaves a flavor 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.090
 special that is not that flavor that the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.700
 typical vanilla and chocolate 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 this has its other little thing its 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.419
 little dot has its point by the dot and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.880
 for that we're going to need a cup of 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.320
 cream cheese cold philadelphia type that 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.810
 they are 225 grams and 8 ounces 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 half a cup of butter at temperature 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.910
 environment that are 115 grams 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.370
 three cups of icing sugar that are 375 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920
 grams 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 60 grams of cocoa powder that is average 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.699
 Cup 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.399
 half a teaspoon of vanilla a pinch 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.280
 of salt a quarter of a teaspoon of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.730
 cinnamon and a cupcake or a cupcake for 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.380
 decorate 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.180
 well you are going to see what facilitated and 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.460
 quickie 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.260
 important easy and quick to have a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.540
 monthly account 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 well let's put the butter 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.620
 in cream cheese 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 the vanilla 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.689
 a pinch of salt that always goes to 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 enhance the flavor and a little secret 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.490
 that we gave him a long time ago 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.039
 and that we repeat it again 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.439
 put cinnamon cinnamon along with the 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.659
 cocoa chocolate will always give you 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.450
 several to perform much more flavor 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.560
 so 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.510
 those tricks are the ones that do 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 different the recipe and now we're going to 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 beat until totally creamy 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 we already have this mixed and now 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.910
 we are going to add the cocoa that previously 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.920
 we have already sifted all the ingredients 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.960
 dry and the amish masters before for 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.910
 that so that it is much better and a 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.060
 trick that like cocoa every time 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.190
 we beat it makes a cloud here that I do not 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.850
 I know if you see but the cloud is formed 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.790
 so if you put him 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.530
 about a cup on top of the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.140
 Sugar helps us not to leave 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.410
 flying so much and now we continue 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 knowing 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 but we have put the icing sugar because 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250
 if we do not get to put the cloud of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.280
 chocolate would have been decided but everything 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.879
 complicated so rich that it was worth it 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.230
 in relax the entity that rich good and 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.230
 now let's put him 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 another bit more sugar 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.490
 and we keep beating 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.360
 now let's place 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.700
 in the second round of sugar 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 and we're going to finish mixing all 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.030
 well, this is already finished 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.880
 ready 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.400
 let's remove a little bit of frosting from 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.220
 the blades 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.590
 you have the consistency that has 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.860
 been that a hard consistency that 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.379
 help us fill in to cover now 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.420
 Handles exactly and to decorate 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.230

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.819

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.819
 also decorate them clear 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.140
 and with the pastry bag 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.760
 so let's decorate a cupcake that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.760
