00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.340
 goo 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.170
 Lay out using a large turn arc to ally on the heel side of the tail 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.410
 There is no need 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:24.880
 Let's be aware that we approach with straight line 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 It is also possible to see the peak of the air that you will draw from now on to get height 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880
 goo 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:38.020
 Even if you open both shoulders in the leading action in order to use the noodles of the board firmly 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.500
 Ode focuses straight on keeping and ice 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:50.840
 However , since it will be out of control if you ore in the previous time , let's save to about 70% of the power 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:55.510
 Let's go out for the forefoot , conscious of the flat on the back of Teal Aichi 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.510
 The twist of this board leads to spin 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 goo 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:12.810
 Because it is holey in the upward direction , the body becomes a little stick standing right after leaving 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:17.830
 At this time, the power in the direction of the spin breaks up into the upper and lower body, but makes use of the kicked kick 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:23.740
 Adjust the smooth rotation by grabbing the lower body 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.100
 While the storm power goes out of sight to make the line of sight go ahead in the spin direction, it does not send the line of sight 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.300
 When 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 Stop at 1 at 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:36.030
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:41.190
 It grabs not to lose the rotational force on the way and locks the body as well as forward and looking at you 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 Must continue ahead to the front side direction using the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:51.230
 Still speaking grabs early if it is determined that the rotational power is insufficient 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.680
 Go to the rioting direction with the lower body alone and match the landing 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.680
 4 minutes 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:02.760
 Using the knee cushions well and having both legs soft at the same time 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:07.330
 If you try to forcibly look at the direction of travel after talking a grab 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:11.020
 Be careful because the board will slip off soon after landing 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.580
 If you send your eyes in reverse to the direction of travel and land on the blinds 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.460
 It is difficult to shift the ode 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.460
 Also it is effective that Chatchisuru in a little 2 way deer
