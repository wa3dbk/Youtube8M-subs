00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.260
 Hello dear friends $ 7 and 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.900
 today I will show you how it works 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 counter-strike bani hop program and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 in general for any games 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.680
 it acts absolutely on any game 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.510
 if you did not know about the general universal 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.250
 Kabaniha in general, I will throw here such 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:45.450
 archivist 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:46.260
 the fire will be the same sniffed run 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.640
 sometimes 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:59.160
 and agree with the launch of this program 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:03.559
 launched like this that is you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:09.020
 can stop it pause 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.020
 can continue to work 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.670
 In principle , we all watch how it works and 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:22.790
 we entered counter-strike weston stays 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 do it just hold the spacebar and that's it 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.750
 don't need anything else just squeezing 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.670
 space and everything works revealed 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.090
 nothing you need to do just works 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.680
 jumps where everything is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.030
 works absolutely 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.030
 come out citizens and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.030
 I did not advise you to include 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 competitive mode because you 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.900
 can ban 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 or patrol brew 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.689
 or patrol banned or 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.689
 quintero ports are generally better not dirt 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.689
 stresses 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.179
 play fair at all without any 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.179
 of programs 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.439
 children that there is nothing to tell 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.439
 more 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.200
 not telling people 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.420
 basically subscribe to the channel 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.130
 put likes 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.130
 liked not playing dates 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.420
 I show the space for plates 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.420
 weren't stupid 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.910
 everything
