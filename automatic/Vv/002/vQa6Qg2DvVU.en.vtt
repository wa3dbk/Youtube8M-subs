00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.379
 hello this is a channel about oxford 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.919
 education and science and my name is 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.670
 Vladimir 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.120
 I would like to tell you about this video. 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.089
 research groups 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.200
 become a game in english and if you 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.260
 student or 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.200
 graduate student and you want to feel that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.520
 is real science or do you want 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.210
 meet the best students 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.680
 scientists of this world or you just love 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.780
 travel yes watch this video 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.329
 the idea of becoming and groups has been suggested a lot 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.800
 years ago professor wives about kendo and 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.770
 by the way he still continues to work 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.170
 so this is a weekly event on 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.490
 which people come from real 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.850
 economy from industry 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.060
 and even some gifts and other scientists and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.490
 here during the week they work on 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.400
 solving real-world problems 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.920
 event format is very simple first 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.870
 day the coat of arms representatives talk about 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.960
 their problems they are made straight 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 20 minute presentation where they talk about 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.100
 volume with which at the moment 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 technological challenges facing 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.420
 or german and usually such firms and somewhere 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 5-6 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.030
 after which scientists break up into groups 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.120
 according to interests, that is, everyone chooses 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 what task they want to do and what 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.820
 tasks he wants to help with the solution and so 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.369
 scientists go to rooms let's say 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.369
 we have five rooms and each one 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.869
 addresses one problem scientists in 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.630
 principle can move from one 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.270
 rooms to another and engage in different 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.270
 tasks simultaneously there if special 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.000
 amenable day 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.060
 and here after four days the scientists 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.259
 each group has its own report 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.360
 work done 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.250
 namely they tell succeeded with it 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.009
 solve a problem or at least 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.020
 somehow both formalize and deliver 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.950
 sometimes the problem here can afford 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.229
 imagine a group of scientists can so here 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.049
 once and for four days 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.429
 solve the problem and sometimes it 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.519
 lets just 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.000
 formulate the problem in detail let's say 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.579
 find who could solve it well there 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.440
 let's say for six months or a year and firm 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.360
 by the way can pay for such research 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.019
 if this is really interesting 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.660
 problem 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.390
 you as a student or graduate student can 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.090
 take the side of scientists and from together 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.220
 with some of the world's leading 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.380
 professionals balls to solve together 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.000
 tasks charge from them some 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 energy with some ideas 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400
 there is like sit down on works applied 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.830
 science is important to notice that usually stages 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.850
 groups he covers all costs 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.280
 living and eating and sometimes they 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.640
 even cover the cost of visa tickets 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.280
 this happened to me personally and the atlas 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.190
 as a student or graduate student is required 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.950
 just show interest and send your 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.500
 application from on stage group by the way group 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.190
 pass around the world absolutely in all 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.239
 corners 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.060
 Europe in America in Asia in general everywhere 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.830
 everywhere even in australia personally i myself 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.350
 participated in the organization 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.870
 research group in Moscow 2011 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.600
 year which in my opinion was very 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.300
 I wonder if we talk about tasks 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.700
 who are decided on the group site who are they 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.180
 may be completely from different areas 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.520
 for example it may be work on 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.390
 any problems associated with 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:42.220
 cancer treatment or it can be 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:45.380
 problem of installing wind generators 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.180
 some kind of valley irish port or 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.410
 this may be a problem with 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.800
 data processing 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.810
 banking or medical system 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.820
 it may be a creation problem 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.070
 resilient green roofs know this when 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.650
 in Europe, lawns are grown on roofs 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.440
 here they want to create these lawns 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.140
 resilient to grow 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.430
 themselves without watering or 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:17.299
 man's participation once in ireland 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.180
 there was a problem associated with foaming 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.270
 and carry or one interesting task was 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.790
 related to how to properly pump 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.800
 milk from farmers and transport 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.140
 him to the dairy to there 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.450
 less foam in general 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.100
 completely different task one of the problems 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.100
 was associated with a decrease in the number 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.620
 rejects in the production of contact lenses and 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.590
 I must say that here is my colleague he 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.050
 got a fairly large screen for a year 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.810
 so that he can concentrate and 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.190
 work exclusively on this task 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.350
 You see, that's how it is created 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.350
 the interaction of stria and science just so 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.790
 science really comes into life and 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.500
 helps us live better 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.020
 as I said all research 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.560
 groups literally around the world 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.480
 and of course they are announced in advance on 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.700
 specific site below this video 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.400
 I will give a link to this site that is 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.730
 to you to take part you only 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.950
 required to follow the link you will see 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.560
 list of research groups they have 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.080
 there is a different focus for example 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.200
 medical subjects or any 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.370
 boost real oil related 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.380
 or something else 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.970
 you choose you are interested 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.120
 research team 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.620
 click on it usually there also in advance 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.820
 list of pending 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.130
 problems and if you feel that they are you 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.060
 interesting or close you can just 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:50.280
 further there on the button or send by 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.930
 email request here with your 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.120
 motivational letter that you would 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.130
 would like to take part of course if you 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.080
 inveterate tourist yes you can choose 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.540
 research group on the principle 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.300
 which country would you like to go and 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.220
 look but it is wrong I tell you 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.110
 This did not say it is important to note that 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.750
 working language of research groups 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.520
 is english naturally you 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.569
 you should know him at least for demolition 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.259
 sets 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.659
 still following the results of the group necessarily 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.029
 a report is written and it looks like 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:24.029
 publication is essentially an article 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:26.879
 article about the work done 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.490
 results and if you will be good 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:33.029
 work literally during these 5 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.169
 days and your part other members 

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:36.659
 will notice 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.510
 about natural matches list sponsors 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.730
 here this report in this way 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.630
 if you are a student you will appear in 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.570
 publications 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.100
 this publication can be with very very 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.160
 good wives 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.590
 which then maybe you can even 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.130
 write a letter of recommendation and here 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.350
 this 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.120
 it can be very important if you suddenly 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.400
 want to do 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.320
 sport or some other 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.900

 and in the next video I will tell you why 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.169
 need scientific publications 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.169
 so don't miss
