it's actually set for digital zoom and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's actually set for digital zoom and
only<00:01:05.239> zooms<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:05.690> about<00:01:05.990> like<00:01:06.280> three<00:01:07.280> times<00:01:07.870> so

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
like three times digital zoom so I

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.200 
like three times digital zoom so I
changed<00:01:12.229> that<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.590> now<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.340> seems<00:01:13.760> really

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
changed that and now it seems really

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.029 
changed that and now it seems really
really<00:01:14.420> well<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.930> seems<00:01:17.960> really<00:01:18.829> good

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
really well and it seems really good

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.219 
really well and it seems really good
yeah<00:01:19.280> pictures<00:01:19.969> coming<00:01:20.180> out<00:01:20.299> mazing<00:01:20.750> quality

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
yeah pictures coming out mazing quality

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.469 
yeah pictures coming out mazing quality
videos<00:01:22.070> coming<00:01:22.369> out<00:01:22.430> really<00:01:22.759> good<00:01:22.969> quality

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
videos coming out really good quality

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.200 
videos coming out really good quality
and<00:01:23.840> their<00:01:24.619> new<00:01:24.770> downside<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.670> batteries

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
and their new downside is the batteries

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.200 
and their new downside is the batteries
the<00:01:26.689> batteries<00:01:27.200> actually<00:01:27.710> are<00:01:27.909> really<00:01:28.909> really

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
the batteries actually are really really

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.740 
the batteries actually are really really
annoying<00:01:29.600> because<00:01:29.960> I've<00:01:30.200> gone<00:01:30.350> through<00:01:31.750> three

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
annoying because I've gone through three

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.380 
annoying because I've gone through three
sets<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.140> batteries<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:33.649> far<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:34.579> they're<00:01:35.060> not

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
sets of batteries so far but they're not

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.389 
sets of batteries so far but they're not
Duracell<00:01:36.079> so<00:01:36.350> that's<00:01:36.590> probably<00:01:36.859> what<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:37.189> is

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
Duracell so that's probably what it is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.090 
Duracell so that's probably what it is
and<00:01:37.759> they're<00:01:37.909> not<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:38.329> yo<00:01:39.109> so<00:01:39.289> plus<00:01:39.619> for<00:01:39.950> like

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
and they're not like yo so plus for like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.359 
and they're not like yo so plus for like
special<00:01:40.549> a<00:01:41.030> higher<00:01:41.899> quality<00:01:42.320> camera<00:01:42.740> finger

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
special a higher quality camera finger

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.760 
special a higher quality camera finger
press<00:01:43.670> something<00:01:44.270> oh<00:01:44.600> no<00:01:44.929> still<00:01:45.259> appointed

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
press something oh no still appointed

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.310 
press something oh no still appointed
and<00:01:47.950> yeah<00:01:49.359> everything<00:01:50.359> seems<00:01:50.630> good

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
and yeah everything seems good

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.620 
and yeah everything seems good
all<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.979> motes<00:01:52.189> in<00:01:52.460> good<00:01:52.700> panorama<00:01:53.240> seems

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
all the motes in good panorama seems

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.989 
all the motes in good panorama seems
very<00:01:53.960> good<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.979> only<00:01:55.130> problem<00:01:55.579> is<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.880> have

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
very good the only problem is you have

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.239 
very good the only problem is you have
to<00:01:56.030> hold<00:01:56.270> them<00:01:56.539> like<00:01:57.200> sometimes<00:01:57.799> if<00:01:58.100> you're

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
to hold them like sometimes if you're

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.520 
to hold them like sometimes if you're
like<00:01:58.909> going<00:01:59.149> long-range<00:01:59.780> and<00:02:00.229> you<00:02:00.289> really

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
like going long-range and you really

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.919 
like going long-range and you really
want<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.740> get<00:02:00.829> up<00:02:00.979> close<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.689> do<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
want to get up close like if you do the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.620 
want to get up close like if you do the
full<00:02:03.109> 26<00:02:03.710> times<00:02:04.009> zoom<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.179> want<00:02:05.390> to<00:02:05.479> get

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
full 26 times zoom and you want to get

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.410 
full 26 times zoom and you want to get
up<00:02:05.780> close<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.109> focus<00:02:06.799> it<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:08.330> only

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
up close and focus it and the only

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.110 
up close and focus it and the only
downside<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.289> sometimes<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:10.880> to

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
downside is that sometimes you have to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.600 
downside is that sometimes you have to
zoom<00:02:11.330> out<00:02:11.569> about<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.410> four<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:14.750> times<00:02:15.610> so

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
zoom out about like four one times so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.430 
zoom out about like four one times so
you<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.850> maybe<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.390> you're<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.660> 26<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.290> have

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
you like maybe if you're in 26 you have

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.400 
you like maybe if you're in 26 you have
to<00:02:18.530> take<00:02:18.680> another<00:02:18.800> 25<00:02:19.460> but<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.990> doesn't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
to take another 25 but that doesn't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.160 
to take another 25 but that doesn't
bother<00:02:21.560> me<00:02:21.680> at<00:02:21.920> all<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.720> when<00:02:23.930> you're<00:02:24.050> in

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170

I'm<00:03:55.850> very<00:03:56.570> also<00:03:57.380> another<00:03:57.950> thing<00:03:58.220> is<00:03:58.459> it's<00:03:58.730> only

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
I'm very also another thing is it's only

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.229 
I'm very also another thing is it's only
output<00:03:59.360> so<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.320> can't<00:04:00.650> put<00:04:01.040> other<00:04:01.280> files<00:04:01.850> back

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
output so you can't put other files back

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.290 
output so you can't put other files back
onto<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:03.130> but<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.220> think<00:04:04.280> there's<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.880> way<00:04:05.030> like

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
onto it but I think there's a way like

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.120 
onto it but I think there's a way like
take<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:06.020> SD<00:04:06.140> card<00:04:06.320> out<00:04:06.830> putting<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.370> into<00:04:07.550> a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
take the SD card out putting that into a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.270 
take the SD card out putting that into a
multi-format<00:04:10.900> card<00:04:11.900> reader<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.650> then

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
multi-format card reader and then

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.850 
multi-format card reader and then
putting<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.610> into<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.910> computer<00:04:14.200> I've<00:04:15.200> tried

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
putting that into a computer I've tried

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.300 
putting that into a computer I've tried
that<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.480> well<00:04:17.480> i'm<00:04:17.780> trying<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.220> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
that as well i'm trying that and the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.190 
that as well i'm trying that and the
moment<00:04:19.669> i<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:22.010> that's<00:04:22.400> about<00:04:22.490> it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
moment i think that's about it

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.150 
moment i think that's about it
this<00:04:24.200> is<00:04:24.350> matt<00:04:24.590> during<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:25.700> review<00:04:26.060> on
