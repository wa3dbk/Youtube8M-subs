00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.240
 fellow walter from here they 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.549
 we will explain how the 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 water pump first here 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.510
 we have a container in which here 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.700
 pour we have what is being the 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.950
 Water 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.289
 that is good that we are going to use to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.090
 can use the pump this has a 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:24.759
 height approximately one and a half meters 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:27.340
 and this tube is being pvc tube that 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.730
 is the conduit through which the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.400
 Water 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 goes to a valve check the 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.649
 what is this 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.100
 we invest the operation in a 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.969
 spring which makes the pounding which 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.420
 this one directs in the water to a container 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.670
 which makes 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.489
 a return system by which 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.960
 directs to a step valve which 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.000
 Here we are heading to a hose 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.840
 which was as tall as more or 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.970
 more like about 4 meters 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.690
 in this there and we will see how the water comes out 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.690
 even though 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.320
 let's activate the valve to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.509
 leave the water as I was telling my 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.570
 partner this valve is modified 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.539
 we put that screw in here that is 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.070
 a spring adjuster this screw 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.200
 from here adjust the spring pressure 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.570
 depending on the flow that the 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.400
 tube 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
 depending also the area where it is 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.320
 used in the same way at the time of 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.030
 knocking on the valve closes and 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.450
 produces what has been the blow of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.880
 ram 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.010
 this blow returns what has been 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.960
 the pressure the pressure looks for a way out 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.240
 the closest main exit is this 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.190
 it contains another check valve that will 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.250
 allows water to enter but does not 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.290
 allows to leave and then later 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.780
 comes out through this conduit let's activate 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.690
 the because beta is so can be said 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.380
 it 's off we're going to activate it for 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.380
 let the water come out
