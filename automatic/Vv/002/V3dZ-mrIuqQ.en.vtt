00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.860
Hey guys! Today I'm doing another DIY. Topic for today is the beautiful Chanel Bagpack.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.080
Some of you guys already know the bagpack.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.200
But I resolved to not just copy the original.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.100
I want it to be personalized nevertheless look as cool as the Chanel bagpack.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.420
You can find everything you need down in the infobox.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.340
Let me show you the bagpack first. I bought this one from H&amp;M Divided for 24,99â‚¬.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.620
If you want to buy one or already have one which you want to use for this DIY

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:39.040
take care to use one with cotton and not to much synthetic fabric or otherwise the color won't  adhere.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.020
Let's start by taking your mixed pallet or a paper plate. Both work just fine.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.020
Put your Colors on it.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:05.800
I put the colors on my mixed pallet. This is acrylic textile color. You just need to take care if it's suitable for dark or light fabric.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:15.620
I bought this awesome neon pink and this textile color is also available in this spray can.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm using this for the first time today but I think it's going to look great.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.220
For color application use one of these usual sponges. I just cut it into pieces.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.780
Let's get started.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.420
I'm not finished yet with color application but I think It's time to put on the Logo.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.560
As I said I want it to be personalized so I'm putting a small "e" on it. The first  letter of my name.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.820
Easy to make.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.820
Cut it out.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.020
Then we have this writing. The Chanel Bagpack has a writing on it too.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.780
For this I chose the fashion metropolises Istanbul,   New York, Milan and Paris.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.920
I just got the idea to bevel this so it's closer to the original.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.720
And I like it better this way.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.140
Put it on your Bagpack.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.580
For fine-tuning use a small brush.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:55.060
Do the same with your writing. Put a magazine in the pocket to obtain more stability.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:21.180
I think it's starting to look good but now take a small brush  to paint a diamond pattern to the bottom. 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.240
It's really easy.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.240
The painting is finished. Now we get to the special part of the bagpack.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.200
I think it is the chains and the decoration.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.040
I bough these necklaces. They look pretty cool because they got this pearly gleam.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.160
They were at the sales at New Yorker. Just 1 Euro. So if you need some...

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.240
Attach them

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.160
I made this colorful bunch of threads. You can buy those.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.200
Now attach this as well.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:39.040
Now divide it into two parts and wrap one string around the other.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.320
Guys my bagpack is finished and I really like it.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:02.640
I also attached some carabiner. Two small ones here and a big one up here.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.560
Just let me show you the backside. Here I attached some chains as well. 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.560
I'm really happy about my new bagpack. Thumbs up if you like it and let me know in the comments.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:31.520
If you made this bagpack yourself share your fotos with me on instagram with #chanelindividuell.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.320
