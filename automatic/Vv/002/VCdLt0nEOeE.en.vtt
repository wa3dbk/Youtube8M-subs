00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello how about friends and youtube 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.089
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 where today more than anything is the 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.910
 first video of this channel since then 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 previously I had a channel where 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 you did not know me that I did 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.430
 tutorials one because I was making the voice of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.100
 loquendo or more than anything because that's that 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.939
 rare voice for nothing because nothing and no 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.269
 I knew who was 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.490
 aside only vabo bebo posts 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 so, nothing , I'm going to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.739
 leave in the description of the video where 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 already in the semi good site my channel in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.230
 where here then I explain more 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.649
 in detail with my voice so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 that you can see, but rather what 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.710
 because I want to show it 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.059
 then, nothing, let's start 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 I also have in the description of 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.670
 video I'm going to leave my channel where 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.730
 According to me, they can be the channel of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.980
 games but but but in his 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.239
 nothing more minecraft ballet so then 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.850
 nothing let's start with this video 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.970
 tutorial where today I would teach them how 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 you can patch our windows 8 so much 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.810
 normal both 8.1 ok it's the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 updates so well nothing and 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.119
 we are going to need these two as one 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.970
 first the next in patch and another one as the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.350
 patch so that this one looks like that 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.350
 it reinforces good vale in the before I do not know 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.479
 what happens when in the room we go and this one 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 since it applied to others, it is worth 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.740
 with the windows updates that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.170
 several versions of 28 of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.050
 suddenly windows 8 without language and so on 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.360
 all those then maybe this 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.759
 alters in some things and then usually 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.399
 happen that it is no longer that no longer 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.040
 they work I've also seen other videos 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.220
 where is a patch but 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.500
 in the green interface where you install it and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.020
 allows you to apply the probable themes 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.110
 I used that for a while but there was 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.960
 times or sometimes that when applying my 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.119
 the issue was not applicable and he had in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.390
 what I have now is worth so 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.510
 nothing at least this year I have more or 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.210
 less like a year and like they do 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.940
 windows updates and I do not know 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.770
 alters for nothing so we're going to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.680
 need these two that I took it out of a 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.320
 website where I do not say they are my 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.830
 credits but there are also I'll leave you 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.600
 in the description as the website is worth 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.480
 also here will be the links on 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.940
 link these two are together is by 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.950
 mediafire and I will also upload it 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.070
 mega- valent so well, we're not going to 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.239
 start first of all first we go to 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.250
 run this so that we can then 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.900
 put this vale then let's give 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.069
 right click run as administrator 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.590
 you are not going to see 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.920
 this little thing about my successes but we're going 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.629
 to allow that says pressure and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.409
 any key to start with that 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:10.010
 let's squeeze I do not know I do not know people and here 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.010
 already tells us 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.849
 that process correctly a file 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.239
 error to process 0 file press 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.360
 any key to finish and here we 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.230
 says now I can apply the patch a 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.480
 extend 2.3 and then we do not close or 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.040
 we just go again enter and if 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.739
 Automatically closes ok 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.739
 once done this now let's give it 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.989
 right click run as administrator 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.450
 put it we put that yes and we see that here 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.780
 already tells us well with everything since he left 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.269
 then we will give next we accept 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.280
 the following and then has launched 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.950
 let's hope this is good this does not take 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.500
 much as you can see and we are going to give 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.230
 next and ready now let's 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.049
 restart our computer and then we 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.540
 let's download a theme and good 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.370
 I can also restart it because I'm 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.150
 recording the voice a little bit because 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.239
 I just played and nothing came to me 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.810
 record so that nothing will see a 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.970
 transcription of those things and right now 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.709
 I come back good as you can see it 's a 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.440
 computer review now let's see 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.600
 yes then the patch works but 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.030
 first of all I want to show you that 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.720
 Well, I have a 28.1 without 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.970
 language 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.260
 this the participle both 32 bits by 64 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.870
 now let's apply a theme 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.750
 and as you can see then this was applied 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.840
 very good and good, I hope that you 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.070
 have liked to subscribe to this 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.580
 it's been the first video 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.740
 and then nothing until the next already 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.320
 better after this video and to this other 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.700
 that just now I'm going up 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.640
 is how you can hide then in the 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.460
 bar they are seeing on screen and 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.390
 how will it look when we take it off 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.640
 okay, I think the bar is called 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.730
 reboot and I do not expect anything that I have 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.570
 liked that they subscribe and until the next 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.570
