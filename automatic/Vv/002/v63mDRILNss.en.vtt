fermenting what's going to happen is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.689 
fermenting what's going to happen is
it's<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> switch<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.010> cool<00:00:53.399> feature

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's going to switch to a cool feature

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.080 
it's going to switch to a cool feature
and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.690> it'll<00:00:55.079> stay<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> cool<00:00:55.739> feature

it's on a standard setting for 8 and you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
it's on a standard setting for 8 and you
could<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.729> ferment<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.900> 24

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
could actually ferment for up to 24

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.520 
could actually ferment for up to 24
hours<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.159> it'll<00:01:09.150> flash<00:01:09.600> until<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> start

hours and it'll flash until you start
the<00:01:10.740> Machine<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.240> happen<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the Machine and what will happen is

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.109 
the Machine and what will happen is
it'll<00:01:12.960> count<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.740> from<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.280> 8<00:01:14.520> hours<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
when the 8 hours is up it'll

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.219 
when the 8 hours is up it'll
automatically<00:01:17.070> switch<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.490> cool<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> when<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
automatically switch to cool and when it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960 
automatically switch to cool and when it
does<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> C<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
does that this will have a C in that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.600 
does that this will have a C in that
display<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.350> how<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.740> adjust<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.580> a

men<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.299> either<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.840> pressing<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.799> minus

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
men time is either by pressing the minus

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.929 
men time is either by pressing the minus
button<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:29.040> how<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> went<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.670> cool

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939

and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:31.079> 1<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.790> 24<00:01:33.240> if

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and then it go 1 all the way up to 24 if

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.679 
and then it go 1 all the way up to 24 if
you<00:01:33.450> hold<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.780> finger<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.470> it'll<00:01:35.220> advance

you hold your finger on it it'll advance

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.780 
you hold your finger on it it'll advance
automatically<00:01:37.189> you'll<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.369> how<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.640> goes

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
automatically you'll see how that goes

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.080 
automatically you'll see how that goes
to<00:01:39.000> 24<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> I'm<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> hit<00:01:41.280> stop<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to 24 so I'm going to hit stop just so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
to 24 so I'm going to hit stop just so
it<00:01:42.210> resets<00:01:42.960> itself<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.189> hold<00:01:44.369> your

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it resets itself and you just hold your

how to put the mixture together to make

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
how to put the mixture together to make
yogurt<00:01:59.700> from<00:02:00.119> scratch<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.350> first<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.799> we're

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
yogurt from scratch so first what we're

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
yogurt from scratch so first what we're
going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> we're<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> add<00:02:02.880> the

you<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.750> do<00:03:00.870> this<00:03:01.019> outside<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.500> machine<00:03:01.830> if

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
you can do this outside the machine if

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.590 
you can do this outside the machine if
you<00:03:02.340> prefer<00:03:02.700> I'm<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.120> pour<00:03:03.420> this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
in you see how smooth and broken up that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.520 
in you see how smooth and broken up that
yogurt<00:03:07.799> was<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.459> started<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.530> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
yogurt was to get it started and I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.710 
yogurt was to get it started and I
started<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:11.130> say<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.700> container<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.269> 50

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
started to say that this container is 50

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.570 
started to say that this container is 50
ounces<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.190> when

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
ounces but just so you know that when

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.770 
ounces but just so you know that when
you're<00:03:14.819> done<00:03:15.090> you'll<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:16.250> more<00:03:17.250> than<00:03:17.489> 6<00:03:17.970> 8

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you're done you'll have more than 6 8

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.199 
you're done you'll have more than 6 8
ounce<00:03:19.140> servings<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.950> yogurt<00:03:20.010> so<00:03:20.670> all<00:03:20.820> we<00:03:20.940> do<00:03:21.090> is

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
ounce servings of yogurt so all we do is

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.670 
ounce servings of yogurt so all we do is
put<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.480> lid<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.680> mentioned<00:03:24.230> put<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
put the lid on like I mentioned put the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.789 
put the lid on like I mentioned put the
top<00:03:25.980> on<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:27.079> we're<00:03:28.079> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.230> hit<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> start

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
top on and we're going to hit the start

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.130 
top on and we're going to hit the start
button<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:29.970> said<00:03:30.180> eight<00:03:30.510> hours

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
button it's on like I said eight hours

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.360 
button it's on like I said eight hours
when<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.799> done<00:03:31.920> going<00:03:32.070> through<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
when it's done going through the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.490 
when it's done going through the
fermentation<00:03:32.670> process<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.750> will<00:03:33.930> switch<00:03:34.200> to

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
fermentation process it will switch to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.979 
fermentation process it will switch to
cool<00:03:34.769> like<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.670> mentioned<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.299> C<00:03:36.540> will<00:03:36.720> be<00:03:36.750> in

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
cool like I mentioned the C will be in

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.590 
cool like I mentioned the C will be in
the<00:03:37.140> display<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.700> it'll<00:03:38.910> stay<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.359> cool

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the display and then it'll stay on cool

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.710 
the display and then it'll stay on cool
until<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.079> either<00:03:40.260> turn<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.950> off<00:03:41.190> or<00:03:41.720> unplug

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
until you either turn it off or unplug
