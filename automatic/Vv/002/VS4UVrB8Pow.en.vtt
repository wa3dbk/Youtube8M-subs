normally<00:00:47.489> build<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> team<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.870> think

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
normally build the team because I think

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
normally build the team because I think
to<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.530> i<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.239> no<00:00:51.719> team<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to be i think in a way no team in the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.860 
to be i think in a way no team in the
world<00:00:52.530> double<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.000> season<00:00:54.270> we
