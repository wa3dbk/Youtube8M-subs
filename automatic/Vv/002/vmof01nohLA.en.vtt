00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.949
 yes but for me what for me what for me I am changed 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:11.859
 256 players at the same time that's amazing 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.880
 we have our numbers are as expected yes yes extremely rough so that 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.689
 fairly 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.559
 light blue runs there are of course already in the participation us it was 

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.980
 Those diesel massive armies that have balls are percent divided into 32 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.350
 you place - and in turn are divided into 8 times 1 4 TSI one here 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.539
 You can not really find anything in the money on it 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:33.680
 screen 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.770
 So that's all about the new Skoda members under the top 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.970
 Although the regime is well off, it is good again 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 So the leader 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 You should watch as much as possible what one does what one wants 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.950
 because that gives you more experience points and you just get faster faster 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.950
 Get off even faster can have certain skills 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.390
 Sometimes it is a foul stung the right to do in general 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.670
 "We've had it hurt by the impact 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 zel 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 To defend 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.500
 all these big need facilities 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.939
 No No I think that's not true that the arrow points backwards so 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.540
 which sky on the left in the picture 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.640
 the resort is somehow out of the way Â»unwell that should be more for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.040
 defend meanwhile 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.730
 - and were rewarded 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.780
 of consistency and we have to watch that they do not 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.750
 get there 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.850
 By the way, I also like these very nice artists 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.530
 3d map on the top right this has not been just flat from the top bird over 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.080
 Animals should be really nice 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.010
 The three-dimensional impression was never even better 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.410
 orientate 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.260
 I saved the human factor Red Red Bull 46 with players 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.500
 Still having an impact is completely silly, often to gold 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.740
 Exploit gameplay 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.510
 Ground fell 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.220
 Find gaps in the system 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.020
 I am very curious what works me well both is second to 64 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.720
 I was already very much in the mood for player matches in advance 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.720
 Excites here what ultimately corrupt 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.489
 yes I think that everything is so nicely subdivided it that night you 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.539
 that would work 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:19.069
 especially those who romp on Rambo under the whole time alone storms the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.109
 Drive much less money from the customer comes the fastest 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.449
 Slower progressing newer 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.449
 enough motivation to do it right 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.639
 Breaks are required to pass to us expiration or around half a half replenishment 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.829
 stockpiled walnut wood come 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.829
 that the expected is concerned 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:45.209
 nearly 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.840
 We have and there is already times in the group to people I then times
