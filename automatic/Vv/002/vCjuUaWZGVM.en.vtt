of<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.420> wave<00:02:49.990> cam<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.890> we<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.070> pull<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.400> off

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
of the wave cam so we can pull that off

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.170 
of the wave cam so we can pull that off
as<00:02:51.850> well<00:02:51.880> set<00:02:52.750> that<00:02:52.930> down<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:54.550> basically<00:02:55.060> what

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
as well set that down now basically what

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.550 
as well set that down now basically what
you<00:02:55.240> need<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.450> do<00:02:55.570> is<00:02:55.690> slide<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.960> hanger<00:02:56.440> out

you need to do is slide the hanger out

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.160 
you need to do is slide the hanger out
of<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.920> baseplate<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.580> base<00:02:57.990> plate<00:02:58.990> is<00:02:59.020> only

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
of the baseplate the base plate is only

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.690 
of the baseplate the base plate is only
notched<00:02:59.470> on<00:02:59.710> one<00:02:59.920> side<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.400> you're<00:03:00.490> gonna<00:03:00.580> have

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
notched on one side so you're gonna have

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.410 
notched on one side so you're gonna have
to<00:03:00.760> slide<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.710> not<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.310> side<00:03:03.580> but

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
to slide this out not to this side but

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.820 
to slide this out not to this side but
to<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.900> side<00:03:05.530> with<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.760> notch<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
to the side with the the notch in it and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.530 
to the side with the the notch in it and
be<00:03:08.830> careful<00:03:09.130> when<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.340> do<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.550> because<00:03:09.760> all

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
be careful when you do this because all

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.210 
be careful when you do this because all
the<00:03:10.750> parts<00:03:10.990> are<00:03:11.080> going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> come<00:03:11.350> apart<00:03:11.650> now<00:03:11.740> so

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
the parts are going to come apart now so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.790 
the parts are going to come apart now so
you<00:03:12.940> don't<00:03:13.090> want<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.300> drop<00:03:13.480> anything<00:03:13.990> work<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
you don't want to drop anything work the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.210 
you don't want to drop anything work the
hanger<00:03:15.160> out<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.510> baseplate<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.980> now<00:03:18.070> they

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
hanger out of the baseplate and now they

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.090 
hanger out of the baseplate and now they
come<00:03:18.340> apart<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.440> usually<00:03:20.440> what<00:03:20.590> happens<00:03:20.620> is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
come apart and usually what happens is

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.400 
come apart and usually what happens is
that's<00:03:21.250> going<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.490> free<00:03:21.790> up<00:03:21.820> your<00:03:22.410> small

and<00:03:52.390> now<00:03:52.480> your<00:03:52.630> truck<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.050> completely<00:03:53.230> apart

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
and now your truck is completely apart

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.690 
and now your truck is completely apart
so<00:03:55.410> pretty<00:03:56.410> simple<00:03:56.620> process<00:03:56.980> it's<00:03:57.550> just

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
so pretty simple process it's just

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.910 
so pretty simple process it's just
knowing<00:03:58.390> how<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.660> restock<00:03:59.170> these<00:03:59.350> parts<00:03:59.740> to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
knowing how to restock these parts to

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.890 
knowing how to restock these parts to
put<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.130> truck<00:04:00.310> back<00:04:00.370> together<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.720> way<00:04:01.750> I

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
put the truck back together the way I

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.900 
put the truck back together the way I
like<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.290> do<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:02.650> it's<00:04:03.400> like<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.640> start<00:04:03.850> with

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
like to do this it's like to start with

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.600 
like to do this it's like to start with
a<00:04:03.970> hanger<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.780> work<00:04:05.110> from<00:04:05.260> there<00:04:05.470> we<00:04:06.400> take

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
a hanger and and work from there we take

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.720 
a hanger and and work from there we take
our<00:04:06.880> large<00:04:07.450> diameter<00:04:08.170> washer<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.830> place<00:04:09.550> it

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
our large diameter washer and place it

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.690 
our large diameter washer and place it
back<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.840> that<00:04:10.930> stud<00:04:11.350> there<00:04:11.680> then<00:04:12.460> your

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
back on and that stud there then your

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.220 
back on and that stud there then your
standard<00:04:13.060> tension<00:04:13.540> spring<00:04:13.780> or<00:04:13.930> whatever

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
standard tension spring or whatever

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.450 
standard tension spring or whatever
tension<00:04:14.590> spring<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:14.860> might<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.070> putting<00:04:15.280> back

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
tension spring you might be putting back

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.700 
tension spring you might be putting back
on<00:04:15.520> goes<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.480> top<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.810> that<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.350> we'll<00:04:17.500> set

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
on goes on top of that and we'll set

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.770 
on goes on top of that and we'll set
that

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
that

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.379 
that
for<00:04:18.959> right<00:04:19.109> now<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.820> next<00:04:21.030> thing<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.209> want<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
for right now the next thing you want to

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.410 
for right now the next thing you want to
do<00:04:21.480> is<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.690> stack<00:04:21.959> up<00:04:21.989> our<00:04:22.320> base<00:04:22.590> plate<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.790> we

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
do is to stack up our base plate so we

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.159 
do is to stack up our base plate so we
take<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:25.010> two<00:04:26.010> pieces<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.850> our<00:04:27.000> wave<00:04:27.180> cam<00:04:27.480> and

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
take the two pieces of our wave cam and

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.960 
take the two pieces of our wave cam and
put<00:04:28.350> them<00:04:28.500> back<00:04:28.680> together<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.730> going

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
put them back together and this is going

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.700 
put them back together and this is going
to<00:04:30.030> be<00:04:30.120> greasy<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:31.230> want<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.560> be

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
to be greasy and you want it to be

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.800 
to be greasy and you want it to be
greasy<00:04:31.950> with<00:04:32.639> white<00:04:32.880> lithium<00:04:33.090> grease<00:04:33.300> so

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
greasy with white lithium grease so

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.240 
greasy with white lithium grease so
you're<00:04:34.290> going<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.470> get<00:04:34.590> that<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.800> your<00:04:34.889> fingers

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
you're going to get that on your fingers

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.460 
you're going to get that on your fingers
but<00:04:35.280> that's<00:04:35.700> what<00:04:35.850> makes<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.180> truck<00:04:36.470> operate

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
but that's what makes the truck operate

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.500 
but that's what makes the truck operate
smoothly<00:04:37.880> you're<00:04:38.880> going<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> take<00:04:39.180> your<00:04:39.330> lock

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
smoothly you're going to take your lock

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.010 
smoothly you're going to take your lock

click-click<00:04:48.180> back<00:04:48.389> in<00:04:48.570> there<00:04:48.780> we'll<00:04:49.680> start

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
click-click back in there we'll start

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.860 
click-click back in there we'll start
out<00:04:50.100> by<00:04:50.130> sliding<00:04:50.700> this<00:04:50.790> piece<00:04:51.060> back<00:04:51.450> into<00:04:51.750> your

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
out by sliding this piece back into your

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.640 
out by sliding this piece back into your
base<00:04:52.020> plate<00:04:52.669> just<00:04:53.669> like<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.590> that<00:04:55.590> just

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
base plate just like that and that just

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.630 
base plate just like that and that just
fits<00:04:56.250> right<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.540> notice<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
fits right in and if you notice the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.610 
fits right in and if you notice the
grooves<00:04:59.640> again<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.510> the<00:05:00.870> base<00:05:01.110> plate<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
grooves again on the base plate and the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.310 
grooves again on the base plate and the
wave<00:05:01.770> can<00:05:02.010> line<00:05:02.340> up<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:03.270> now<00:05:03.419> we<00:05:03.480> take<00:05:03.750> our

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
wave can line up and now we take our

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.810 
wave can line up and now we take our
hanger<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:04.919> we<00:05:04.980> have<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.190> slide<00:05:05.400> our<00:05:05.520> hanger

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
hanger and we have to slide our hanger

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.030 
hanger and we have to slide our hanger
back<00:05:06.030> into<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.390> base<00:05:06.570> plate<00:05:06.840> now<00:05:07.620> if<00:05:07.890> you're

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
back into the base plate now if you're

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.520 
back into the base plate now if you're
unsure<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:09.000> orientation<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:10.290> how<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
unsure of the orientation of how the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.050 
unsure of the orientation of how the
hanger<00:05:10.979> is<00:05:11.100> going<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.400> go<00:05:11.520> into<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.910> base

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
hanger is going to go into the base

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.520 
hanger is going to go into the base
plate<00:05:12.360> we<00:05:13.200> can<00:05:13.229> use<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:14.600> another<00:05:15.600> truck<00:05:15.930> as<00:05:16.200> an

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
plate we can use a another truck as an

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.570 
plate we can use a another truck as an
example<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:18.090> we'll<00:05:18.240> set<00:05:18.479> our<00:05:18.570> two<00:05:18.750> base<00:05:18.990> plates

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
example so we'll set our two base plates

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
example so we'll set our two base plates
together<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:20.880> there's<00:05:21.060> similar<00:05:21.419> orientation

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
together so there's similar orientation

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.960 
together so there's similar orientation
and<00:05:22.290> then<00:05:22.470> we<00:05:22.590> can<00:05:22.740> kind<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.490> take<00:05:23.610> a<00:05:23.669> look<00:05:23.850> at

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
and then we can kind of take a look at

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.460 
and then we can kind of take a look at
our<00:05:24.060> hanger<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:24.630> see<00:05:24.810> how<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.050> hanger<00:05:25.440> is

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
our hanger and see how the hanger is

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.860 
our hanger and see how the hanger is
supposed<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.979> slide<00:05:26.550> back<00:05:26.790> in<00:05:26.970> there<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:27.720> what

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
supposed to slide back in there so what

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.230 
supposed to slide back in there so what
we'll<00:05:27.990> do<00:05:28.110> is<00:05:28.290> we'll<00:05:28.380> take<00:05:28.590> our<00:05:28.770> hanger<00:05:29.240> and

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
we'll do is we'll take our hanger and

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.080 
we'll do is we'll take our hanger and
our<00:05:30.360> base<00:05:30.600> plate<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.550> we<00:05:32.550> have<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.729> take<00:05:32.910> our

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
our base plate and we have to take our

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.900 
our base plate and we have to take our
small<00:05:33.930> inner<00:05:34.350> diameter<00:05:34.770> washer<00:05:35.190> and<00:05:35.370> stack<00:05:35.880> it

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
small inner diameter washer and stack it

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.779 
small inner diameter washer and stack it
on<00:05:36.120> top<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.570> spring<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.650> like<00:05:37.800> that<00:05:37.979> and

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
on top of the spring just like that and

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.790 
on top of the spring just like that and
again<00:05:39.300> this<00:05:39.479> is<00:05:39.660> loose<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.140> this<00:05:40.289> will<00:05:40.500> slide

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
again this is loose so this will slide

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.980 
again this is loose so this will slide
so<00:05:41.100> you<00:05:41.130> want<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.460> hang<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:41.990> we're

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
so you want to hang on to that we're

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.770 
so you want to hang on to that we're
going<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.169> slide<00:05:43.410> this<00:05:43.940> back<00:05:44.940> into<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.600> base

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
going to slide this back into the base

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.549 
going to slide this back into the base
plate<00:05:46.080> while<00:05:46.860> holding<00:05:47.190> onto<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.700> washer

plate while holding onto that washer

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:51.719 
plate while holding onto that washer
and<00:05:49.449> takes<00:05:50.449> a<00:05:50.569> little<00:05:50.719> bit<00:05:50.899> of<00:05:50.959> fidgeting<00:05:51.439> you

and takes a little bit of fidgeting you

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.089 
and takes a little bit of fidgeting you
can<00:05:52.729> pick<00:05:53.059> up<00:05:53.089> your<00:05:53.389> truck<00:05:53.749> and<00:05:53.959> you<00:05:54.709> know<00:05:54.799> tap

00:06:05.799 --> 00:06:05.809 
place it kind of clicks in there we can

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:08.409 
place it kind of clicks in there we can
take<00:06:06.019> our<00:06:06.259> kingpin<00:06:06.949> stitches<00:06:07.819> right<00:06:07.999> here
