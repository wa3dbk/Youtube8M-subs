common question that I receive which is

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.240 
common question that I receive which is
from<00:00:14.790> people<00:00:15.150> who<00:00:15.269> say<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.839> they<00:00:16.560> want<00:00:16.590> to

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
from people who say that they want to

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.760 
from people who say that they want to
start<00:00:17.730> working<00:00:18.090> out<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.449> start<00:00:19.410> putting<00:00:19.590> on

start working out and start putting on

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
start working out and start putting on
some<00:00:19.980> muscle<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.420> don't<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> get

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
some muscle but they don't want to get

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.880 
some muscle but they don't want to get
too<00:00:22.380> big<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:23.039> too<00:00:23.550> bulky<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.539> rather<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.680> aim

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
too big or too bulky and rather just aim

for a more athletic look now the problem
with<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.680> question<00:00:29.039> really<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:29.849> it's

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
with this question really is that it's

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.319 
with this question really is that it's
ultimately<00:00:31.590> coming<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.489> highly<00:00:32.790> skewed

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329

ultimately coming from a highly skewed
perception<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> how<00:00:34.590> quickly<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.510> rather

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
gradual process for you just like it is

are a complete beginner because keep in

mind that the less experienced you are

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
mind that the less experienced you are
the<00:01:03.449> faster<00:01:03.989> you'll<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.260> able<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.559> build<00:01:04.739> new

the faster you'll be able to build new

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.910 
the faster you'll be able to build new
muscle<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.460> vice<00:01:05.700> versa<00:01:06.619> then<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> can

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
muscle and vice versa then you can

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.820 
muscle and vice versa then you can
probably<00:01:08.340> expect<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> put<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.650> anywhere<00:01:10.650> from

probably expect to put on anywhere from

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340

about<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.400> quarter<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.180> half<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.900> pound<00:01:13.110> of

rate<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:05.970> growth<00:04:06.239> steadily<00:04:07.109> decreasing<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:07.859> he

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
rate of growth steadily decreasing as he

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.680 
rate of growth steadily decreasing as he
becomes<00:04:08.220> more<00:04:08.519> experienced<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.510> said

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
becomes more experienced and like I said

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.349 
becomes more experienced and like I said
before<00:04:09.810> women<00:04:10.260> are<00:04:10.560> going<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.090> progress<00:04:12.090> at<00:04:12.299> a

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
before women are going to progress at a

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.650 
before women are going to progress at a
rate<00:04:12.389> roughly<00:04:12.950> half<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.269> top<00:04:15.480> of

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
rate roughly half of that and on top of

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.409 
rate roughly half of that and on top of
this<00:04:15.750> also<00:04:16.019> keep<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.560> mind<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:17.340> there<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.180> no

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
this also keep in mind that there is no

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.529 
this also keep in mind that there is no
such<00:04:18.600> thing<00:04:18.930> as<00:04:19.039> lean<00:04:20.039> muscle<00:04:20.549> versus<00:04:21.090> bulky

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
such thing as lean muscle versus bulky

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.670 
such thing as lean muscle versus bulky
muscle<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.019> some<00:04:22.229> people

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
muscle like some people

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.129 
muscle like some people
think<00:04:22.889> muscle<00:04:23.550> tissue<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.180> muscle<00:04:24.570> tissue<00:04:24.780> and

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
think muscle tissue is muscle tissue and

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.620 
think muscle tissue is muscle tissue and
you're<00:04:25.889> either<00:04:26.070> gaining<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.729> maintaining<00:04:27.419> it

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
you're either gaining it maintaining it

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.740 
you're either gaining it maintaining it
or<00:04:27.960> losing<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.940> someone<00:04:29.940> who<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.240> consider<00:04:30.600> to

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
or losing it someone who you consider to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.499 
or losing it someone who you consider to
be<00:04:30.780> too<00:04:31.199> big<00:04:31.470> is<00:04:31.740> not<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.820> way<00:04:33.030> because<00:04:33.240> they

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
be too big is not that way because they

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.210 
be too big is not that way because they
somehow<00:04:33.840> possess<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.440> different<00:04:34.889> type<00:04:35.190> of

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
somehow possess a different type of

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.570 
somehow possess a different type of
muscle<00:04:36.199> instead<00:04:37.199> they're<00:04:37.380> simply<00:04:37.710> carrying<00:04:38.190> a

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
muscle instead they're simply carrying a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520 
muscle instead they're simply carrying a
larger<00:04:39.060> amount<00:04:39.330> of<00:04:39.539> it<00:04:39.690> and<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.169> appearance

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
larger amount of it and the appearance

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.860 
larger amount of it and the appearance
of<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.740> muscle<00:04:41.160> may<00:04:41.310> also<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.870> further

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
of that muscle may also be further

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.960 
of that muscle may also be further
enhanced<00:04:43.190> because<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> person<00:04:44.789> has

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
enhanced because that person has

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.710 
enhanced because that person has
particularly<00:04:45.449> low<00:04:46.070> body<00:04:47.070> fat<00:04:47.160> levels<00:04:47.669> so<00:04:48.300> if

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
particularly low body fat levels so if

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.270 
particularly low body fat levels so if
you're<00:04:48.930> wanting<00:04:49.259> to<00:04:49.380> put<00:04:49.560> on<00:04:49.680> some<00:04:50.100> muscle

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
you're wanting to put on some muscle

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.939 
you're wanting to put on some muscle
then<00:04:51.090> just<00:04:51.539> aim<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.900> maximize<00:04:52.080> your<00:04:52.560> current
