have<00:00:05.609> particular<00:00:06.029> project<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.049> gyros<00:00:07.500> ready

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
have particular project the gyros ready

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.839 
have particular project the gyros ready
right<00:00:08.099> so<00:00:08.760> if<00:00:09.090> each<00:00:09.389> other<00:00:09.599> James<00:00:10.639> okay<00:00:11.639> don't

then you just left cuz i rly to airport
and<00:00:21.630> he<00:00:22.289> won't<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.820> do<00:00:23.820> playing<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> few

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and he won't be do playing for a few

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
and he won't be do playing for a few
weeks<00:00:25.920> until<00:00:27.470> about<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:28.859> months<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.369> won't

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
weeks until about two months you won't

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.500 
weeks until about two months you won't
be<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.830> we<00:00:31.830> always<00:00:32.189> are<00:00:32.520> let's<00:00:32.969> judge<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
be here so we always are let's judge the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
be here so we always are let's judge the
travel<00:00:34.309> okay<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.370> let<00:00:35.670> me<00:00:35.700> check<00:00:37.160> this<00:00:38.160> one's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
travel okay so let me check this one's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.470 
travel okay so let me check this one's
looking<00:00:38.790> fine<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.180> another<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.620> this

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
looking fine but another thing that this

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.110 
looking fine but another thing that this
throw<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.840> here<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:44.070> move<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
throw all right here to move it and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600 
throw all right here to move it and
gives<00:00:45.390> direction<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.010> i<00:00:47.039> connect<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
gives direction so when i connect it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.049 
gives direction so when i connect it
though<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.950> i<00:00:49.950> connect<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> gyro<00:00:50.700> it's

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
though when i connect to the gyro it's

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.139 
though when i connect to the gyro it's
having<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> torch<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
having like a torch for like this

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.950 
having like a torch for like this
switches<00:00:54.890> yeah<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.390> i<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.870> know

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
switches yeah is it it so i don't know

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
switches yeah is it it so i don't know
how<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.920> happening<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.850> light<00:01:00.059> in

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
how that's happening like the light in

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.310 
how that's happening like the light in
the<00:01:00.770> window<00:01:01.770> gyro<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.789> yet<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the window gyro right yet it's not a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.260 
the window gyro right yet it's not a
steady<00:01:04.769> light<00:01:05.070> make<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> other<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
steady light make the other one it

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.030 
steady light make the other one it
brings<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.920> with

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
brings a little bit as you can see with

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
brings a little bit as you can see with
ya<00:01:08.220> well<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.360> although<00:01:09.630> gyro<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> very

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
ya well the although gyro has a very

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.200 
ya well the although gyro has a very
steady<00:01:10.920> light<00:01:11.250> richer<00:01:12.710> pilsen<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.340> twitch

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
steady light richer pilsen is in twitch

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.560 
steady light richer pilsen is in twitch
or<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> light<00:01:17.310> doesn't<00:01:17.460> blink<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
or the light doesn't blink like the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.840 
or the light doesn't blink like the
other<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> i<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.610> what's

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
other one so i don't know what's

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.340 
other one so i don't know what's
happening<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.360> there<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.110> gonna

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
happening right there right now gonna
