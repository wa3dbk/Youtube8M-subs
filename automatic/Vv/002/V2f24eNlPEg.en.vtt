00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.170
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.389
 note microsoft presents as well 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.790
 at that time for windows 7 also for windows 8 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.369
 a 90 days enterprise version for 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.599
 We already have the disposal here 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.810
 which can be installed as well as 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.990
 the windows 7 version via the command 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.359
 the software license manager four times 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.189
 reactivate that we believe in the end 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.690
 I come for about a year 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.129
 after that, legal means are used 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.650
 No more lame needs to be new 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.379
 be installed an upgrade of 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.269
 this enterprise version later on 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.080
 a normal windows version is 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.820
 not possible 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.860
 link in the description just after 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.170
 scroll down there we have here once 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.890
 the 32 bit version and the 64 bit 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.049
 version 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.670
 the german language is always there 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.460
 so far we just download 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.210
 need a windows live account 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.129
 but you do not necessarily have to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.500
 Enter your correct e- mail address 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.650
 So a very easy way to do that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 whole to test and as I said 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:15.179
 instead of you just a little bit the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.880
 prompt as admin see below 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.649
 I'm running 87 days right now 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 even if I have software here now 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:28.859
 license manager - frame takes 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 a moment command was successful 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.229
 completed 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.229
 and if I restart now 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 start anew 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.710
 and now we have our 90th again 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 of course you should do it first 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.700
 when the 90 days really expired 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.659
 are now only shown here and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.080
 for demonstration 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.080
 OK
