oh yeah they'll come to consult we just

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
oh yeah they'll come to consult we just
don't<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.190> exactly<00:00:17.310> when<00:00:17.850> however<00:00:18.210> one<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
don't know exactly when however one of

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.760 
don't know exactly when however one of
the<00:00:18.600> features<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.990> has<00:00:19.199> been<00:00:19.410> drawn<00:00:19.590> into

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
the features that has been drawn into

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.260 
the features that has been drawn into
doubt<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> ampère<00:00:20.670> vibe<00:00:20.850> wall<00:00:21.060> type

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
doubt is the ampère vibe wall type

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.910 
doubt is the ampère vibe wall type
because<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.869> load<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> pc<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
because when you load it up on the pc it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
because when you load it up on the pc it
does<00:00:23.189> specifically<00:00:23.699> state<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.060> need<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.330> beefy

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
does specifically state you need a beefy

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
does specifically state you need a beefy
PC<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.170> run<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.680> when<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.160> compare<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
PC to run this and when you compare that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
PC to run this and when you compare that
to<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> free<00:00:27.119> six<00:00:27.300> euro<00:00:27.510> Pierce<00:00:27.779> free<00:00:27.990> which<00:00:28.140> off

from 2005 and 2006 respectively you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.389 
from 2005 and 2006 respectively you
might<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.320> oh<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:31.800> kind<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
might think oh that's kind of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.920 
might think oh that's kind of
questionable<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.059> basically<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.690> today's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
basically this will be a feature that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.899 
basically this will be a feature that
will<00:01:04.470> come<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> next<00:01:05.280> update<00:01:05.460> because

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
will come in the next update because

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.179 
will come in the next update because
this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> actually<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> Savannah<00:01:07.140> M<00:01:07.350> bumps<00:01:08.010> so

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this is actually the Savannah M bumps so

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
this is actually the Savannah M bumps so
basically<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.540> these<00:01:09.659> savanna

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
basically this is what are these savanna

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
basically this is what are these savanna
prime<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.710> sure<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.100> my<00:01:11.220> peach<00:01:11.369> preview

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
prime I'm sure you see my peach preview

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.710 
prime I'm sure you see my peach preview
but<00:01:11.790> basically<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> cool<00:01:12.360> plan<00:01:12.540> with

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
but basically it's a cool plan with

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
but basically it's a cool plan with
acacia<00:01:12.960> trees<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> version<00:01:14.520> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
acacia trees but this is the version of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.249 
acacia trees but this is the version of
that<00:01:14.729> biome<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.060> comes<00:01:15.360> pre<00:01:15.720> amplified

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that biome that comes pre amplified

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
that biome that comes pre amplified
basically<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> hits<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> height<00:01:17.460> limit<00:01:17.490> very

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
basically and hits the height limit very

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
basically and hits the height limit very
regularly<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:19.080> using<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> plan<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
regularly so I'm using this plan for the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
regularly so I'm using this plan for the
testing<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> basically<00:01:21.299> an

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
testing because this is basically an

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
testing because this is basically an
amplified<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.290> type<00:01:22.500> file<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
amplified you know type file and I can

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
amplified you know type file and I can
use<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.490> isolation<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.450> some<00:01:24.630> tests<00:01:24.869> as

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
use it in isolation to do some tests as

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
use it in isolation to do some tests as
to<00:01:25.200> whether<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> 360<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.220> run<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> because

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to whether the 360 can run it because

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
to whether the 360 can run it because
the<00:01:27.060> big<00:01:27.270> down<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.229> implied<00:01:28.650> coming<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the big down you know implied coming is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
the big down you know implied coming is
that<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.759> 316th<00:01:30.270> appears<00:01:30.540> free<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.990> know

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that the 316th appears free you know

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.780 
that the 316th appears free you know
they<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.409> RAM<00:01:31.619> limitations<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.610> two

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
they have RAM limitations and the two

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.030 
they have RAM limitations and the two
big<00:01:33.030> things<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> PCM<00:01:34.829> fight

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
big things about you know the PCM fight

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
big things about you know the PCM fight
is<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> takes<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> world<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> lot<00:01:36.210> longer<00:01:36.360> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
is it takes the world a lot longer to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
is it takes the world a lot longer to
load<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.380> causes<00:01:37.590> some<00:01:37.740> RAM<00:01:38.009> issues<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
load and it causes some RAM issues and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
load and it causes some RAM issues and
obviously<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> 360<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.470> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> make

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
obviously on the 360 they want to make

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
obviously on the 360 they want to make
sure<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.189> game<00:01:41.340> always<00:01:41.700> runs<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.119> 60fps<00:01:42.829> 720p

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
sure the game always runs at 60fps 720p

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.350 
sure the game always runs at 60fps 720p
and<00:01:44.009> we'll<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.030> actually<00:01:45.060> hold

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
and we'll see if it can actually hold

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
and we'll see if it can actually hold
that<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.079> biome<00:01:46.290> by<00:01:46.710> stress-testing

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that up in this biome by stress-testing

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
that up in this biome by stress-testing
a<00:01:47.430> bit<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.729> obviously<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.570> know<00:01:48.659> we're

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
a bit because obviously you know we're

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
a bit because obviously you know we're
standing<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.710> fine<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.009> 60fps<00:01:50.369> but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
standing in here just fine at 60fps but

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.190 
standing in here just fine at 60fps but
what<00:01:50.970> if<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.180> try<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.479> add<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:51.899> stress

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
what if we try and add a bit more stress

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
what if we try and add a bit more stress
so<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.979> made<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.520> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
so as you can see I made a lot of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.190 
so as you can see I made a lot of
waterfall<00:01:54.090> from<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> bunch<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.540> places<00:01:54.689> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
waterfall from a bunch of places that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
waterfall from a bunch of places that
you<00:01:55.259> notice<00:01:55.649> especially<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.610> high<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:56.939> that

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you notice especially this high up that

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700 
you notice especially this high up that
starts<00:01:57.450> create<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:57.810> real<00:01:58.020> issues<00:01:58.170> I've<00:01:58.500> seen

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
starts create some real issues I've seen

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
starts create some real issues I've seen
that<00:01:58.799> my<00:01:58.920> shoot<00:01:59.130> cane<00:01:59.280> farm<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.759> let's<00:01:59.909> play

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that my shoot cane farm my let's play

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.090 
that my shoot cane farm my let's play
well<00:02:00.259> but<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.439> for<00:02:01.530> good<00:02:01.590> measure<00:02:01.649> let's<00:02:01.979> add

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
well but just for good measure let's add

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.679 
well but just for good measure let's add
one<00:02:02.130> more<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.360> flowing

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
one more because you can see it flowing

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
one more because you can see it flowing
it<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> computation<00:02:04.680> takes<00:02:04.860> does

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
it you know the computation takes does

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.770 
it you know the computation takes does
actually<00:02:05.399> take<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:06.149> RAM<00:02:06.329> usage<00:02:06.479> but

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
actually take a little bit RAM usage but

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300 
actually take a little bit RAM usage but
to<00:02:07.079> add<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.350> top<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> biggest

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
to add on top of that one of the biggest

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
to add on top of that one of the biggest
users<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.700> RAM<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.270> console<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.780> actually

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
users of RAM on the console is actually

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.350 
users of RAM on the console is actually
the<00:02:10.590> mobs<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.370> there's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> mob<00:02:12.120> limb<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the mobs because there's a mob limb in

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.670 
the mobs because there's a mob limb in
place<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.750> have<00:02:12.870> deliberately<00:02:13.170> stopped<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
place to have deliberately stopped that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.080 
place to have deliberately stopped that
so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
so

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.369 
so
I<00:02:14.239> will<00:02:14.480> actually<00:02:14.599> go<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.050> way<00:02:15.080> up<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
I will actually go all the way up to the

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.080 
I will actually go all the way up to the
mob<00:02:15.530> limit<00:02:15.769> on<00:02:15.860> top<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.400> having<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.790> world

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
mob limit on top of having this world

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.729 
mob limit on top of having this world
which<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.420> very<00:02:17.810> very<00:02:18.140> close<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.590> height

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
which is very very close to the height

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.910 
which is very very close to the height
limit<00:02:18.769> at<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.700> now<00:02:19.849> we're<00:02:20.060> only<00:02:20.180> at<00:02:20.680> 156<00:02:21.680> but

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
limit at right now we're only at 156 but

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.350 
limit at right now we're only at 156 but
you<00:02:21.980> know<00:02:22.069> it<00:02:22.310> actually<00:02:22.640> goes<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.819> whip<00:02:23.090> I'm

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
you know it actually goes a whip I'm

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.640 
you know it actually goes a whip I'm
still<00:02:23.569> right<00:02:23.690> here<00:02:23.840> let's<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.319> pawn<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.560> a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
still right here let's just pawn in a

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650 
still right here let's just pawn in a
bunch<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.129> mobs<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.849> test<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.360> point<00:02:26.540> at

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
bunch of mobs just to test that point at

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
bunch of mobs just to test that point at
that<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.680> as<00:02:27.890> soon<00:02:27.920> as<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.220> goes<00:02:28.370> off<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
that and as soon as that goes off the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.160 
that and as soon as that goes off the
screen<00:02:28.700> letters<00:02:28.940> for<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.180> mob<00:02:29.569> eggs<00:02:29.750> away<00:02:29.870> and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
screen letters for the mob eggs away and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.140 
screen letters for the mob eggs away and
as<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.650> now<00:02:30.980> we've<00:02:31.129> got<00:02:31.310> 50<00:02:31.819> or<00:02:31.940> so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
as you can see now we've got 50 or so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.460 
as you can see now we've got 50 or so
 you've<00:02:32.629> got<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.900> water<00:02:33.049> flowing<00:02:33.319> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
 you've got the water flowing and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.619 
 you've got the water flowing and
we've<00:02:33.830> got<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> world<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:34.430> here<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.879> in<00:02:35.060> theory

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
we've got the world up here so in theory

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.390 
we've got the world up here so in theory
if<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.200> old<00:02:36.319> way<00:02:36.620> I<00:02:36.650> sort<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.099> time<00:02:37.310> two

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
if the old way I sort of time two

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.360 
if the old way I sort of time two
friends<00:02:37.700> up<00:02:37.790> there<00:02:37.970> but<00:02:38.150> besides<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
friends up there but besides that and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.500 
friends up there but besides that and
okay<00:02:40.370> well<00:02:40.549> let's<00:02:40.670> simply<00:02:41.000> get<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.150> again

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
okay well let's simply get that again

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.259 
okay well let's simply get that again
yeah<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.620> in<00:02:42.769> theory<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.640> can<00:02:43.819> run<00:02:43.970> just

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
yeah and in theory if this can run just

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.210 
yeah and in theory if this can run just
fine<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:44.900> not<00:02:44.989> constantly<00:02:45.739> dropping

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
fine and it's not constantly dropping

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.559 
fine and it's not constantly dropping
then<00:02:46.549> it<00:02:46.670> would<00:02:46.790> mean<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.329> know<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
then it would mean that you know the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.660 
then it would mean that you know the
game<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:47.930> actually<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.650> entirely<00:02:49.340> fit

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
game is actually you know entirely fit

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.160 
game is actually you know entirely fit
to<00:02:49.849> run<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.239> played<00:02:50.420> well<00:02:50.599> because<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
to run and played well because the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.020 
to run and played well because the
consoles<00:02:51.650> are<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.160> big<00:02:52.340> thing<00:02:52.489> about<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.730> PC

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
consoles are the big thing about the PC

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.339 
consoles are the big thing about the PC
is<00:02:53.209> they<00:02:53.390> use<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> different<00:02:53.840> type<00:02:54.079> of<00:02:54.140> world

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
is they use a different type of world

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.990 
is they use a different type of world
type<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.739> consoles<00:02:55.069> right<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:55.430> which<00:02:55.790> means

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
type that consoles right now which means

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.610 
type that consoles right now which means
the<00:02:56.209> in<00:02:56.329> theory<00:02:56.690> they<00:02:56.959> might<00:02:57.170> be<00:02:57.260> able<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.440> cope

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the in theory they might be able to cope

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.589 
the in theory they might be able to cope
better<00:02:57.829> with<00:02:57.980> am<00:02:58.190> fight<00:02:58.430> or<00:02:58.610> worse<00:02:58.849> but<00:02:59.269> as<00:02:59.450> you

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
better with am fight or worse but as you

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.720 
better with am fight or worse but as you
can<00:02:59.690> see<00:02:59.750> right<00:03:00.049> here<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.560> 60fps<00:03:01.099> even<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
can see right here the 60fps even on a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.400 
can see right here the 60fps even on a
360<00:03:01.940> even<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.510> all<00:03:02.720> these<00:03:02.870> extra<00:03:03.140> stress

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
360 even with all these extra stress

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.259 
360 even with all these extra stress
packs<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.799> play<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.370> actually<00:03:04.730> running<00:03:05.030> just

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
packs in play it's actually running just

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.360 
packs in play it's actually running just
fine<00:03:05.360> I'm<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.079> saw<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:06.980> friend<00:03:07.190> drop

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
fine I'm I saw that one friend drop

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
fine I'm I saw that one friend drop
earlier<00:03:07.670> but<00:03:07.879> besides<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.629> I'm<00:03:08.810> saying

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
earlier but besides that I'm saying

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.930 
earlier but besides that I'm saying
everything<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.530> working<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:09.920> fine<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:10.519> that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
everything is working just fine so that

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.280 
everything is working just fine so that
is<00:03:11.060> really<00:03:11.209> interesting<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.750> video<00:03:11.959> will<00:03:12.170> be

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
is really interesting the video will be

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.750 
is really interesting the video will be
rendered<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.650> 60fps<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.579> check

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
rendered in 60fps so you can check

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.970 
rendered in 60fps so you can check
yourself<00:03:13.879> but<00:03:14.420> as<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.660> can<00:03:14.780> see<00:03:14.840> from<00:03:15.590> my<00:03:15.620> very

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
yourself but as you can see from my very

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500 
yourself but as you can see from my very
basic<00:03:16.400> testing<00:03:16.730> obviously<00:03:17.120> there's<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.360> lot

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
basic testing obviously there's a lot

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.780 
basic testing obviously there's a lot
more<00:03:17.599> you<00:03:17.690> can<00:03:17.750> do<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.350> can<00:03:18.530> see<00:03:18.739> that<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.100> 360

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
more you can do you can see that the 360

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.370 
more you can do you can see that the 360
is<00:03:19.819> perfectly<00:03:20.540> capable<00:03:20.750> of<00:03:21.079> running<00:03:21.200> an

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
is perfectly capable of running an

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.199 
is perfectly capable of running an
amplified<00:03:21.739> world<00:03:22.010> even<00:03:22.459> once<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.910> account

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
amplified world even once you account

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.819 
amplified world even once you account
for<00:03:23.299> all<00:03:23.389> these<00:03:23.569> extra<00:03:23.870> things<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.290> that<00:03:24.680> is

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
for all these extra things so that is

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.370 
for all these extra things so that is
very<00:03:25.100> cool<00:03:25.370> by<00:03:25.609> itself<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.840> me<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.019> kind

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
very cool by itself and to me that kind

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.650 
very cool by itself and to me that kind
of<00:03:27.470> signifies<00:03:27.859> that<00:03:27.889> even<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.030> takes<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.540> little

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
of signifies that even it takes a little

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.910 
of signifies that even it takes a little
bit<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.930> work<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.319> make<00:03:30.470> sure<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.650> runs<00:03:30.739> in

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
bit of work to make sure it runs in

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.009 
bit of work to make sure it runs in
every<00:03:31.130> situation<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.880> 360<00:03:32.359> can<00:03:32.569> run<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.870> so

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
every situation the 360 can run it so

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.599 
every situation the 360 can run it so
one<00:03:33.200> thing<00:03:33.349> I<00:03:33.440> didn't<00:03:33.709> test<00:03:33.859> is<00:03:34.010> item<00:03:34.310> friends

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
one thing I didn't test is item friends

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.009 
one thing I didn't test is item friends
because<00:03:34.760> they<00:03:34.880> make<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.209> current<00:03:35.599> world<00:03:35.750> rumble

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
because they make a current world rumble

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.289 
because they make a current world rumble
of<00:03:36.109> 60<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:37.130> I<00:03:37.160> figure<00:03:37.549> anything<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.150> you

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
of 60 but I figure anything that you

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.819 
of 60 but I figure anything that you
know<00:03:38.389> current<00:03:38.840> world<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.139> take<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.590> looks

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
know current world can take that looks

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.650 
know current world can take that looks
like<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.310> amplified<00:03:40.790> world<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.180> take<00:03:41.329> -<00:03:41.510> or

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
like the amplified world can take - or

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.360 
like the amplified world can take - or
at<00:03:41.720> least<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.870> amplified<00:03:42.260> by<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:42.769> yeah<00:03:43.130> that's

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
at least the amplified by so yeah that's

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.270 
at least the amplified by so yeah that's
pretty<00:03:43.609> cool<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:45.500> means<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.919> to<00:03:46.069> me

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
pretty cool and that means that to me

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.830 
pretty cool and that means that to me
even<00:03:46.940> if<00:03:47.030> takes<00:03:47.180> a<00:03:47.209> little<00:03:47.359> bit<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.510> work<00:03:47.660> the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
even if takes a little bit of work the

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.720 
even if takes a little bit of work the
amplified<00:03:48.290> by<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.919> employed<00:03:49.160> world<00:03:49.340> type<00:03:49.519> has

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
amplified by the employed world type has

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.789 
amplified by the employed world type has
no<00:03:50.090> real<00:03:50.329> excuse<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.900> come<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.169> 360<00:03:51.650> I

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
no real excuse not to come to the 360 I

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.170 
no real excuse not to come to the 360 I
mean<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.160> RAM<00:03:52.280> limitation<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:52.760> one<00:03:52.880> thing<00:03:53.060> and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
mean the RAM limitation is one thing and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.699 
mean the RAM limitation is one thing and
the<00:03:53.269> second<00:03:53.630> limitation<00:03:53.930> could<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:54.560> be<00:03:54.680> a

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the second limitation could just be a

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.770 
the second limitation could just be a
bypass<00:03:55.220> near<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.549> world<00:03:55.730> load<00:03:56.209> time<00:03:56.419> could

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
bypass near the world load time could

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.629 
bypass near the world load time could
you<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.930> bypassed<00:03:57.319> by<00:03:57.410> saying<00:03:57.769> okay<00:03:58.190> then<00:03:58.430> guys

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
you be bypassed by saying okay then guys

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.339 
you be bypassed by saying okay then guys
if<00:03:59.000> you're<00:03:59.359> willing<00:03:59.569> to<00:03:59.599> wait<00:03:59.780> double<00:04:00.079> as<00:04:00.169> long

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
if you're willing to wait double as long

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.900 
if you're willing to wait double as long
you<00:04:00.620> can<00:04:00.769> get<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:00.980> really<00:04:01.220> cool<00:04:01.340> bomb<00:04:01.669> and

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
you can get this really cool bomb and

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.490 
you can get this really cool bomb and
hopefully<00:04:02.389> the<00:04:02.750> next<00:04:02.930> update<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.470> update

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
hopefully the next update the update

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.990 
hopefully the next update the update
that<00:04:03.799> changes<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.130> world<00:04:04.280> a<00:04:04.519> lot<00:04:04.760> of<00:04:04.819> what

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
that changes the world a lot of what

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.400 
that changes the world a lot of what
they're<00:04:05.090> focusing<00:04:05.480> on<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.810> making<00:04:06.349> this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
they're focusing on is making this

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.020 
they're focusing on is making this
happen<00:04:06.799> because<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.370> know<00:04:07.459> having<00:04:07.639> new<00:04:07.790> bombs

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
happen because you know having new bombs

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.849 
happen because you know having new bombs
about<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.480> outfit<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:09.049> at<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.440> same<00:04:09.590> time

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
about the outfit that at the same time

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.170 
about the outfit that at the same time
would<00:04:09.980> be<00:04:10.130> kind<00:04:10.370> of<00:04:10.400> disappointing<00:04:10.880> I'm

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
would be kind of disappointing I'm

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.400 
would be kind of disappointing I'm
really<00:04:11.510> looking<00:04:11.750> forward<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.989> seeing<00:04:12.169> both

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
really looking forward to seeing both

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.990 
really looking forward to seeing both
and<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.739> think<00:04:13.010> there's<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.340> decent<00:04:13.489> chance<00:04:13.700> that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
and I think there's a decent chance that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.300 
and I think there's a decent chance that
we<00:04:14.209> will<00:04:14.389> based<00:04:14.690> on<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.169> yeah<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.799> hope<00:04:16.130> you

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
we will based on this so yeah I hope you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.099 
we will based on this so yeah I hope you
also<00:04:16.729> one<00:04:17.030> more<00:04:17.120> point<00:04:17.359> actually<00:04:17.539> that<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
also one more point actually that it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.509 
also one more point actually that it
just<00:04:18.260> kind<00:04:18.320> of<00:04:18.440> relates<00:04:18.620> this<00:04:18.769> is<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:19.340> reason

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
just kind of relates this is one reason

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.979 
just kind of relates this is one reason
that<00:04:19.700> we<00:04:19.940> might<00:04:20.180> not<00:04:20.299> seen<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:20.780> far

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
that we might not seen it so far

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.330 
that we might not seen it so far
especially<00:04:21.289> on<00:04:21.590> this<00:04:21.709> last<00:04:21.889> update<00:04:22.190> is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
especially on this last update is

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.250 
especially on this last update is
because<00:04:22.880> of<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.210> fact<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.570> they're<00:04:24.050> trying

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
because of the fact that they're trying

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.380 
because of the fact that they're trying
because<00:04:24.650> like<00:04:25.039> $0.85<00:04:25.669> players<00:04:25.909> still<00:04:26.180> play<00:04:26.330> on

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
because like $0.85 players still play on

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.090 
because like $0.85 players still play on
the<00:04:26.510> 360<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.200> ps3<00:04:27.349> to<00:04:27.890> make

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the 360 and the ps3 to make

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.680 
the 360 and the ps3 to make
-<00:04:28.160> all<00:04:28.310> features<00:04:28.730> that<00:04:28.850> possibly<00:04:29.180> can<00:04:29.420> go<00:04:29.630> on

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
- all features that possibly can go on

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.600 
- all features that possibly can go on
both<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.170> that's<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.770> another<00:04:31.070> reason<00:04:31.160> to

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
both and that's just another reason to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.520 
both and that's just another reason to
try<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.850> try<00:04:32.060> and<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.390> so<00:04:32.660> yeah<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.290> hope

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
try to try and do this so yeah I hope

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.170 
try to try and do this so yeah I hope
you<00:04:33.590> did<00:04:33.890> enjoy<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.280> video<00:04:34.370> please<00:04:34.730> do<00:04:34.910> liked

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
you did enjoy the video please do liked

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.520 
you did enjoy the video please do liked
it<00:04:35.300> if<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.420> did<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.870> share<00:04:36.200> week<00:04:36.350> really

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
it if you did like it share week really

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.170 
it if you did like it share week really
liked<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.800> before<00:04:37.070> actually<00:04:37.430> finish<00:04:37.670> you

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
liked it before actually finish you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.950 
liked it before actually finish you
might<00:04:38.300> be<00:04:38.390> wondering<00:04:38.540> about<00:04:38.720> all<00:04:38.810> these

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
might be wondering about all these

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.780 
might be wondering about all these
acacia<00:04:39.290> trees<00:04:39.590> everywhere<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.190> these<00:04:40.370> are<00:04:40.640> in

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
acacia trees everywhere so these are in

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.460 
acacia trees everywhere so these are in
the<00:04:40.880> game<00:04:41.060> coach<00:04:41.300> right<00:04:41.540> now<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.350> know

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
the game coach right now and you know

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.870 
the game coach right now and you know
this<00:04:42.620> entire<00:04:42.920> biome<00:04:43.220> is<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.550> game<00:04:43.670> code

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
this entire biome is in the game code

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.550 
this entire biome is in the game code
which<00:04:44.060> hints<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.480> maybe<00:04:44.780> it's<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.170> lot<00:04:45.320> easier

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
which hints that maybe it's a lot easier

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.750 
which hints that maybe it's a lot easier
to<00:04:45.650> come<00:04:45.800> in<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.920> future<00:04:46.190> because<00:04:46.370> you<00:04:46.520> know

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
to come in the future because you know

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.760 
to come in the future because you know
the<00:04:46.910> big<00:04:47.270> parts<00:04:47.540> verily<00:04:47.840> there<00:04:48.020> are<00:04:48.230> one<00:04:48.650> thing

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
the big parts verily there are one thing

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.310 
the big parts verily there are one thing
that's<00:04:48.950> really<00:04:49.040> interesting<00:04:49.160> is<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:50.900> savanna

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
that's really interesting is the savanna

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.900 
that's really interesting is the savanna
the<00:04:51.620> acacia<00:04:52.070> blocks<00:04:52.340> aren't<00:04:52.550> entirely

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
the acacia blocks aren't entirely

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.280 
the acacia blocks aren't entirely
working<00:04:53.300> because<00:04:53.540> if<00:04:53.720> you<00:04:53.780> break<00:04:53.930> them<00:04:54.080> into

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
working because if you break them into

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.660 
working because if you break them into
the<00:04:54.350> Bible<00:04:54.650> they<00:04:54.770> still<00:04:55.040> have<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.280> idea<00:04:55.610> that

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
the Bible they still have the idea that

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.890 
the Bible they still have the idea that
oak<00:04:55.940> wood<00:04:56.150> which<00:04:56.300> means<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.570> just<00:04:56.630> get

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
oak wood which means you just get

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.540 
oak wood which means you just get
awkward<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.410> even<00:04:57.680> if<00:04:57.740> you<00:04:57.830> get<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.190> block<00:04:58.370> in

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
awkward and even if you get the block in

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.040 
awkward and even if you get the block in
creative<00:04:58.940> off<00:04:59.090> the<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.600> know<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.810> acacia

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
creative off the you know the acacia

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.630 
creative off the you know the acacia
wood<00:05:00.170> this<00:05:00.440> wood<00:05:00.650> right<00:05:00.800> here<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.130> still<00:05:01.490> won't

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
wood this wood right here it still won't

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.890 
wood this wood right here it still won't
convert<00:05:01.940> plank<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.480> there's<00:05:02.660> still<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> little

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900

M<00:05:16.640> by<00:05:16.910> its<00:05:17.270> pre<00:05:17.600> amplified<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:18.320> even<00:05:18.500> if<00:05:18.560> we

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
M by its pre amplified so even if we

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.990 
M by its pre amplified so even if we
don't<00:05:18.860> get<00:05:18.950> amplified<00:05:19.280> you<00:05:19.460> still<00:05:19.670> get<00:05:19.820> this

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
don't get amplified you still get this

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.670 
don't get amplified you still get this
but<00:05:20.420> hopefully<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.870> rest<00:05:21.050> of<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.260> biomes<00:05:21.530> can

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.310 
but hopefully the rest of the biomes can
be<00:05:21.800> implied<00:05:22.130> to<00:05:22.400> be<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.910> Chevy<00:05:23.840> if<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.050> really
