00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 bush 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.910
 expensive 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.280
 the assembly 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.570
 from there 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.900
 Besides that 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.500
 AI Ai Ai Ai Ai 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.540
 Besides that 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.240
 still 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
 clear 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.960
 the counselor 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.860
 the municipality 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.050
 It's strange because he 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.310
 jean is it 2008 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 convictions friend 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.870
 electronics 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.570
 I also found the technology where they were very advanced and what I thought 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.140
 the people 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.140
 his testimony the worker 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.850
 dona marina in those absolutely improvised conditions 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 even better 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.579
 case 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 sebastian vettel 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.789
 stocking as christmas 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.049
 watching the video 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.049
 I realized that the piece profession is a profession of risk 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.009
 the least care should be taken 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.999
 with the work he did and how 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.349
 it can be seen permanent then the American president in court 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.449
 and through that limit he still can do everything 

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.689
 we lost everything 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.999
 caused by any problem 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
 there are also these guys forced 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.179
 he too after taking this leap 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.619
 as the therapist says 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.359
 and ergonomist 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.290
 we observe in that working condition 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.689
 analyzed 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.880
 want to make it difficult to date bruises 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.109
 of work 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.459
 when in fact a team that has a condition is completely different from 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.000
 work had to be adapted to David the 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.169
 we observe 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.099
 we are in posture arrangements 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.140
 the title of virtually all body segments 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.620
 according to the rupture of its cervical segment thoracic and lumbar 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.610
 the movement of integration and voting of the column 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 and in static postures maintained for long period 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.930
 a long work 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.939
 he is 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:39.800
 also 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.110
 he would come back 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.900
 there was a posture of lower limbs and a personal posture of work then 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.330
 all these items mentioned 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.360
 they do not lead one to believe 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.470
 what a hugo that this individual 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.900
 who stays all this time in this working condition 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.279
 can suffer from the seven headlines 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.169
 muscle shortening 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.470
 and a series of injuries provoked by these postures because the postures they 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:07.949
 can 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.620
 they are with the compex given in fact of a standard 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.240
 what do you mean, a plant 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.260
 Who produces it saved it and I said I did not say yes 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.889
 and it was just place 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.020
 has to be bernardo consolidated the 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.830
 can chain that 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.039
 this is the absolutely improvised care 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.989
 mistake she would be an adaptation of the eponymous book that she after working 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:45.680
 way to mitigate 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.930
 if you think of an ergonomic design 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.830
 adaptation of the work or to qualify this task 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.499
 not being an operator doing more bad than not 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.139
 in the device with mars cone being controlled in another way 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.250
 so I would be the braga for this working condition
