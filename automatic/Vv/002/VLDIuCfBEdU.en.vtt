 the Arcandor would be tomorrow we stand in front of the apple store at 6 o'clock in 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.679
 Munich the sun was laughing, namely the Helgerth stands 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.959
 "He is allowed to call a horse with their children 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.670
 exactly and we stand here 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.260
 and the revolutionary iPad itself no shoes me 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.219
 the Schorsch was clearly better felt and would 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.939
 if now the federal government 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.319
 who is allowed yesterday 11 clock in the morning 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.300
 since yesterday 11 clock in the morning is almost 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.610
 as I imagined hours before their mission was over 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.729
 and how 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.590
 what in the night 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.480
 the night was not the best because the old one 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.690
 many were going to suffer the same for everyone, it was cold 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.400
 and save 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.390
 yes we have been well looked after Apple has kindly donated water to us now 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.850
 just the coffee 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.420
 and that was okay everyone agrees the morning must have set 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.490
 and the bulls are standing alone with umbrella 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.420
 "That was the worst part, that is, getting up at eleven o'clock 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 Chair built see below I have with me packaging 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.380
 maybe a cart is indisputable 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.680
 and around 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 We do not know the sausage is about percent 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010
 Dr, I have previously asked if it is ok and so on and where I am 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 ask me the best 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.950
 so that they had no problems with it and they found a super action 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.610
 the chamber is greeted on the Main and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.600
 Yes, he found his cool action 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.620
 and reactions of the 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.870
 Passers-by must pass through forums or astonishingly many 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.570
 knew what it was all about, so I did not think that people from all 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.490
 Ages and classes kept knowing exactly what was happening here 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.540
 Pound the most francs is not funny and and good and 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.020

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.020
