 you type the source when in the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.180
 description you will have this source 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.039
 here they x info myeurop to the space of which 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.239
 click on it 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.489
 you will have to download the tweet 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 haye the ex-miss but first of all you 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.299
 will also have to download the tweak 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.549
 mobile terminal so when these two 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.369
 tweak will be downloaded and installed 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.350
 on your iphone we will go to the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.229
 springboard and one goes the movable teeth 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 terminal once ruby ​​terminal 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.500
 we will have to type the activation code 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.960
 did not observe was 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 so that's your identifier for 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.530
 everyone is the identifier 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 general we click on the top and we 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 enter the alpine password 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.720
 so if you do not have to change to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 again to pass exactly the same as 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.960
 me alp yens 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.540
 if you have changed your password 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.579
 before you type your password 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.829
 then we will type the code to activate 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.829
 the thing we had on time so ceyrat 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.840
 Blick has missed you and this return is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.140
 a nice menu its part and you under your 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.420
 eyes 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 so you have several numbers that 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 range from 1 to 12 each number to a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.590
 precise action so it's very very 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.899
 simple if for example you want 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 simply restore applications 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.950
 electric iphone without losing everything 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.840
 what is music photos and all that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 you just have to type number one so 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.819
 I present you number by number so 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230
 it's first the number one game 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 it's delete all cydia tweaks 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.980
 plus all apps in the app 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.659
 store so that just wants to do that 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.870
 you will not lose neither photos nor 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.980
 music neither video nor settings nor notes and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.939
 all that stuff you're going to keep it 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.319
 then number 2 you simply have 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.030
 restore all the settings of your 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.620
 money so I'm not sure it 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 remove all the stuff from cydia but 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.239
 it should remove that will restore 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 all tricks settings then 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.639
 number 3 it will clear all the caches 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.739
 of cydia number 4 it will detect all 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.930
 the problems of cydia so when you 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.280
 have bugs with time when we have 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.510
 an iphone and break collages and with 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.709
 the time there are some small bugs to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.980
 force to download tweets via the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.409
 delete all that sorry actually you 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.819
 have little bugs so here it's going to do 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.449
 a little research 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.949
 then you do number 5 for 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.549
 repair and clean cydia following this 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.069
 research 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.000
 you can also do number 6 for 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.219
 re install cydia 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 so when I say lucid rest I know 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.389
 not if it removes all your tricks so 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.769
 loud and I inquire about that so that 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.329
 can not be bad if we look and everything 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.650
 This is the app store applications 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.569
 music all that etc 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.069
 but just delete the stuff from 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.549
 cydia to return to zero on cydia 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.909
 number 7 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.349
 it will remove all the cages from the ios 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.970
 number 8 savard initialized the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.250
 settings to help them down so 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.180
 all that is settings on iphone that 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.189
 will be restored number 9 we will 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.650
 make layout and location 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.150
 of all the icons so if you have 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.889
 you if you have as according to 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.239
 change the location the icons on the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.269
 first page all that is all right 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.939
 put back number zero it's going 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.609
 remove all apps from 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.169
 the app store so you do the action of 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.060
 your choice then you have the number 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.030
 10 and the 11 which are complementary which 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.290
 will allow you to save all 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.090
 your hairless cydia tweaks and then you 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.579
 will be able to put number 11 for 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.310
 restore all your cydia apps 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.079
 that you have saved before so 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.439
 not filled when you re install 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.509
 cydia 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.889
 you will lose all your tricks sense 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.530
 at the biggest restaurants l'iphone 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.299
 before two cydia restaurants you do 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.979
 a backup docter number 10 okay 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.590
 allow to save all your tweaks 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.389
 cydia in a small folder once 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.310
 you have rest in cydia there will be more 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.620
 right now so it'll be so diatou 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.370
 900 and install it on the iphone you 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.960
 do number 11 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.360
 and you will see all your tweaks 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.400
 cydia saved thanks to the number 10 on 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.529
 hope at least I understood then we 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.150
 will go to number 12 which is going to be the 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.589
 number the most used by all 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.120
 youtube hour and by all 

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:49.310
 iphone users it's going to be 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.639
 completely restored his iphone to nine 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.909
 so Thursday at 9 it's going to be empty and 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.520
 while keeping cydia so in fact it's 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.870
 as if you are going to have an iphone you 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.120
 open from a box you just come 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.219
 to buy had quoted me two years so that 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.560
 will be as if you have made 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:08.510
 restorations via itunes so we know 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.190
 itunes offers you to restore your 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.349
 iphone but in the restaurant there you 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.729
 update the ios and we know 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.960
 all that the latest updates 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.370
 when it was done 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.360
 you can not make jealous break 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.380
 so that's what's causing us problem 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.990
 for iphone 5 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.029
 we can not do restoration or 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.650
 another thing why keep the jeanne 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.229
 drecq so the grace of that makes you a 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.610
 complete restoration of the iphone which 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.120
 can be music photos videos 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.430
 applications cydia apps app 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.159
 store all all to your iphone will be put 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.839
 to nine while having cydia so and 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:41.150
 let's look at the updates to make a 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:44.810
 quarter in the original ios so more 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.880
 need to wait for a new cottage 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.969
 bricks for others igo is this so 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.070
 I hope you have all this 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:56.150
 thinning so to show an example 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.370
 we will do a search for errors on 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.820
 cydia which will type number 4 you 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.919
 type 4 and you click this back here it 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.779
 is going to be a list of codes and its 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.259
 wise who will allow to do this 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.210
 cleaning 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.550
 so you see before your eyes that in 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.289
 be done so there he finally 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.050
 look for all the bugs and all 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:19.580
 all the mistakes that has on cydia at the 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.940
 end he tells you enter your turn and there 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:26.180
 you can again put a number 5 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.860
 so after doing the analysis we go 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.229
 now do the cleaning so 6000 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.579
 euros 5 I click on the 5 and there by 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:34.550
 against the fact a discomfort he is going 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:35.810
 completely removed and clean all 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.520
 errors and both 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.600
 2 cydia so it can be pretty good 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.430
 when you want nothing to touch your 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.160
 iphone but who are the freest and 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.960
