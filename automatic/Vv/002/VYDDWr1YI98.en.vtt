anything<00:01:39.939> missing<00:01:40.390> that's<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.259> lot<00:01:41.560> of

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
anything missing that's a lot of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.249 
anything missing that's a lot of
styrofoam<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.460> zero<00:01:42.880> accessories<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.840> guess

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
styrofoam and zero accessories I guess

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.200 
styrofoam and zero accessories I guess
it's<00:01:44.409> okay<00:01:44.740> though<00:01:44.979> because<00:01:45.219> Voltron<00:01:45.820> never

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
it's okay though because Voltron never

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.029 
it's okay though because Voltron never
used<00:01:46.570> any<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.869> that<00:01:46.960> stuff<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.409> show<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
used any of that stuff in the show the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
used any of that stuff in the show the
sword<00:01:48.310> least<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.850> all

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.290 

hold<00:02:14.500> on<00:02:14.710> missiles<00:02:16.410> right<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.860> sky

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.880 

so<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.360> put<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> matchbox<00:02:23.200> version<00:02:23.620> together

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
so you put the matchbox version together

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.220 
so you put the matchbox version together
and<00:02:24.160> you'd<00:02:24.580> have<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> statue<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.540> robot<00:02:26.050> with

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230
