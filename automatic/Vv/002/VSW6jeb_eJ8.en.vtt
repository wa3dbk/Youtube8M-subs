okay<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.949> video<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.370> gonna<00:00:02.550> show<00:00:02.760> you

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
okay so this video I'm gonna show you

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.650 
okay so this video I'm gonna show you
had<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.380> benchmark<00:00:04.380> your<00:00:04.560> computer<00:00:05.660> it's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
had a benchmark your computer it's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.570 
had a benchmark your computer it's
really<00:00:07.080> really<00:00:07.290> cool<00:00:07.529> it<00:00:07.919> does<00:00:08.280> take<00:00:08.550> some

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
really really cool it does take some

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.089 
really really cool it does take some
time<00:00:09.000> at<00:00:09.330> least<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> program<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.290> got<00:00:10.530> my

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
time at least in the program I got my

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.799 
time at least in the program I got my
basically<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:11.790> wanted<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.389> second

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
basically just wanted to like the second

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.360 
basically just wanted to like the second

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
going to try not to skip through it as

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.490 
going to try not to skip through it as
much<00:00:26.609> as<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> might<00:00:31.019> skip<00:00:31.289> through

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
much as I can so you might skip through

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.110 
much as I can so you might skip through
the<00:00:31.560> boring<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.399> parts<00:00:32.669> ugly<00:00:32.850> cool

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
the boring some these parts ugly cool

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
the boring some these parts ugly cool

time<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> score<00:00:35.910> 640<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.530> remember<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
time I score 640 so remember that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.290 
time I score 640 so remember that
because<00:00:38.550> I'm<00:00:38.670> probably<00:00:38.850> not<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
because I'm probably not going to be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
because I'm probably not going to be
able<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.739> 24<00:00:41.190> bucks<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> buy<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
able to so it's 24 bucks if you buy the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
able to so it's 24 bucks if you buy the
thing<00:00:42.660> but<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> can't<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> free

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
thing but you can't just get the free

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.459 
thing but you can't just get the free
trial<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> show<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> has

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
trial so when you show up here it has

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
trial so when you show up here it has
the<00:00:46.800> basic<00:00:47.430> map<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.180> circuit<00:00:48.780> board<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the basic map of your circuit board and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.510 
the basic map of your circuit board and
everything<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.710> tells<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.190> info

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
everything and it tells you like info

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.040 
everything and it tells you like info
about<00:00:50.640> everything<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> get

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
about everything but I'm going to get

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.250 
about everything but I'm going to get
rid<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> benchmark<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> run<00:00:54.629> benchmark

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.139 

you<00:00:57.379> bet<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.679> run<00:00:57.829> all<00:00:57.920> tests<00:00:58.219> you<00:00:58.399> sure<00:00:58.699> may

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
you bet to run all tests you sure may

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.380 
you bet to run all tests you sure may
take<00:00:59.329> several<00:00:59.539> minutes<00:00:59.719> yes<00:01:00.379> I'm<00:01:00.589> sure

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 

I<00:01:03.510> don't<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.080> how<00:01:04.229> well<00:01:04.530> my<00:01:05.010> computer's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
I don't know how well my computer's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
I don't know how well my computer's
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.060> since<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
going to do this time since it has the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to do this time since it has the
video<00:01:08.070> recording<00:01:08.670> software<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.330> while<00:01:09.960> I'm

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
video recording software going while I'm

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.420 
video recording software going while I'm
doing<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> test<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.050> we<00:01:13.140> go

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
doing the test so here we go

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
doing the test so here we go
running<00:01:15.150> CPU<00:01:15.600> integer<00:01:16.200> math<00:01:16.500> okay

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
running CPU integer math okay

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
running CPU integer math okay
this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.870> boring<00:01:19.230> parts<00:01:19.620> right

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
this is kind of the boring parts right

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
this is kind of the boring parts right
here<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.310> first<00:01:20.550> thing<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
here the first thing you know like a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
here the first thing you know like a
minute<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.660> so<00:01:21.870> or<00:01:22.110> something<00:01:22.730> well<00:01:23.730> once<00:01:23.940> it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
minute or so or something well once it

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.700 
minute or so or something well once it
gets<00:01:24.180> after<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.690> then<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> starts<00:01:25.590> getting

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gets after that then it starts getting

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
gets after that then it starts getting
really<00:01:25.980> cool<00:01:26.220> shows<00:01:26.760> a<00:01:26.790> bunch<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.300> graphics

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
really cool shows a bunch of graphics

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.070 
really cool shows a bunch of graphics
intensive<00:01:28.850> processes<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.000> everything<00:01:30.390> which

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
intensive processes and everything which

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.810 
intensive processes and everything which
really<00:01:31.320> gets<00:01:31.530> cool<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.160> then<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> goes<00:01:32.580> back

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
really gets cool and then it goes back

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.630 
really gets cool and then it goes back
to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.480> boring<00:01:33.840> stuff<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.320> end<00:01:34.490> which<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
to the boring stuff at the end which is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
to the boring stuff at the end which is
the<00:01:35.790> Wichita<00:01:38.720> configure<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.870> like<00:01:39.960> your

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the Wichita configure it's like your

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.050 
the Wichita configure it's like your
disk<00:01:40.350> speed<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.920> everything<00:01:40.980> and<00:01:41.760> I'm

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
disk speed and everything and I'm

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
disk speed and everything and I'm
probably<00:01:42.240> getting<00:01:42.600> error<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.500> I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
probably getting error on that because I

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.320 
probably getting error on that because I
don't<00:01:43.830> have<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> disk<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.210> going

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
don't have a disk in so I'm just going

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.020 
don't have a disk in so I'm just going
to<00:01:45.420> skip<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.110 

so<00:01:48.660> it's<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:48.990> CPU<00:01:49.530> physics<00:01:50.190> right<00:01:50.400> now<00:01:50.610> what

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
so it's on CPU physics right now what

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.930 
so it's on CPU physics right now what
and<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.680> video<00:01:53.190> right<00:01:53.580> here<00:01:53.790> you're

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and here is the video right here you're

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.880 
and here is the video right here you're
going

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.840 

so<00:02:01.520> that's<00:02:01.820> pretty<00:02:02.150> cool<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.870> then<00:02:03.850> image

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
so that's pretty cool it and then image

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.370 
so that's pretty cool it and then image
filters<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.450> everything<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:05.990> showing<00:02:06.290> all

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
filters and everything it's showing all

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.999 
filters and everything it's showing all
the<00:02:06.560> stuff<00:02:06.920> so

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.500 

all<00:02:10.549> these<00:02:10.729> things<00:02:10.909> are<00:02:11.060> pretty<00:02:11.299> cool<00:02:11.450> and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
all these things are pretty cool and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.600 
all these things are pretty cool and
then<00:02:11.840> it<00:02:11.959> zooms<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.409> everything<00:02:13.010> for<00:02:13.340> image

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
then it zooms in everything for image

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.000 
then it zooms in everything for image
rendering<00:02:14.140> all<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.319> stuff<00:02:15.620> really<00:02:15.860> is

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
rendering all this stuff really is

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.039 
rendering all this stuff really is
pretty<00:02:16.579> cool<00:02:16.909> and<00:02:17.239> it<00:02:17.540> does<00:02:17.659> it<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:17.870> super

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
pretty cool and it does it like super

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.259 
pretty cool and it does it like super
fast<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.620> everything<00:02:19.069> this<00:02:19.640> might<00:02:19.909> give<00:02:20.060> some

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
fast and everything this might give some

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.610 
fast and everything this might give some
people<00:02:20.540> seizures<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.200> everything

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
people seizures and everything

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.440 
people seizures and everything
especially<00:02:22.400> when<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.879> starts<00:02:23.090> moving<00:02:23.180> really

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
especially when it starts moving really

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
especially when it starts moving really
fast<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.989> this<00:02:24.049> text<00:02:24.530> and<00:02:24.650> everything<00:02:24.760> like

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
fast in this text and everything like

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.580 
fast in this text and everything like
this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.470 

but<00:02:30.190> it<00:02:30.370> doesn't<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.700> me<00:02:30.819> sick<00:02:31.150> you're<00:02:31.300> giving

but it doesn't get me sick you're giving
me<00:02:31.540> seizures<00:02:31.870> or<00:02:32.019> anything<00:02:32.170> it'd<00:02:33.099> be<00:02:33.190> pretty

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
me seizures or anything it'd be pretty

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.009 
me seizures or anything it'd be pretty
funny<00:02:33.610> though<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.420> fell<00:02:34.660> down<00:02:34.840> how

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
funny though I just like fell down how

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.930 
funny though I just like fell down how
to<00:02:35.080> seizure<00:02:37.890> but<00:02:38.890> yeah<00:02:39.220> yeah<00:02:39.489> here<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.819> go

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to seizure but yeah yeah here you go

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.040 
to seizure but yeah yeah here you go
it's<00:02:40.120> like<00:02:40.239> zooming<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.750> out<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
it's like zooming in and out and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.330 
it's like zooming in and out and
changing<00:02:41.440> all<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.560> thoughts<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.129> everything

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
changing all the thoughts and everything

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.110 
changing all the thoughts and everything
you<00:02:42.640> see<00:02:42.849> how<00:02:42.910> well<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.269> renders

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.640 

and<00:02:49.209> then<00:02:49.599> here's<00:02:49.780> some<00:02:49.959> stuff<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.349> gets<00:02:50.440> just

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and then here's some stuff it gets just

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.500 
and then here's some stuff it gets just
like<00:02:50.860> scrolling<00:02:51.190> window<00:02:51.819> windows<00:02:52.239> interface

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
like scrolling window windows interface

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.860 
like scrolling window windows interface
yeah

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.750 

so<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.620> stuff<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:00.950> pretty<00:03:01.099> cool<00:03:01.340> what<00:03:01.610> does

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
so this stuff is pretty cool what does

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.059 
so this stuff is pretty cool what does
this<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.120> does<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.390> super<00:03:02.780> fast

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.280 

that's<00:03:07.519> 2d<00:03:08.269> graphics<00:03:08.720> right<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.080> little

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
that's 2d graphics right here a little

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.199 
that's 2d graphics right here a little
it'll<00:03:09.590> go<00:03:09.709> into<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.950> 3d<00:03:10.310> graphics<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.909> I'm<00:03:11.060> in

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
it'll go into the 3d graphics and I'm in

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.960 
it'll go into the 3d graphics and I'm in
in<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.140> minute<00:03:12.379> or<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.680> which<00:03:13.370> gets<00:03:13.610> really<00:03:13.819> cool

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
in a minute or so which gets really cool

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.089 
in a minute or so which gets really cool
structure<00:03:14.360> like<00:03:14.689> planes<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.349> everything<00:03:15.470> and

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
structure like planes and everything and

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.210 
structure like planes and everything and
I<00:03:16.370> don't<00:03:16.970> know<00:03:17.120> if<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.299> are<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.450> show<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.720> balls

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
I don't know if it are to show the balls

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.710 
I don't know if it are to show the balls
the<00:03:19.220> ball<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.519> bouncing<00:03:19.939> or<00:03:20.000> whatever

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
the ball is bouncing or whatever

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.990 
the ball is bouncing or whatever
oh<00:03:21.750> there<00:03:22.530> they<00:03:22.680> are<00:03:23.180> that's<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.440> DirectX

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
oh there they are that's a DirectX

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.330 
oh there they are that's a DirectX
graphics<00:03:27.000> or<00:03:27.150> whatever<00:03:27.710> see<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:28.920> French<00:03:29.250> for

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
graphics or whatever see that French for

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.199 
graphics or whatever see that French for
second<00:03:29.820> top-left<00:03:30.330> corner

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
second top-left corner

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.509 
second top-left corner
it's<00:03:32.599> pretty<00:03:32.810> fun<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.080> watch<00:03:33.319> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
it's pretty fun to watch the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.750 
it's pretty fun to watch the
don't<00:03:35.970> know<00:03:36.060> how<00:03:36.239> well<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:37.310> screen<00:03:38.310> recording

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
don't know how well the screen recording

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.160 
don't know how well the screen recording
thing<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.180> getting<00:03:39.360> this<00:03:39.569> because<00:03:39.780> they<00:03:40.079> are

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
thing is getting this because they are

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.280 
thing is getting this because they are
moving<00:03:40.379> kind<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.680> fast<00:03:40.739> so<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:43.230> other

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
moving kind of fast so and the other

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.020 
moving kind of fast so and the other
stuff<00:03:43.620> is<00:03:43.769> moving<00:03:44.010> fast<00:03:44.250> too<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.579> how<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:44.879> was

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
stuff is moving fast too and how I was

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.119 
stuff is moving fast too and how I was
getting<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.689> here's<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.349> plane<00:03:46.890> right

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
getting that and here's the plane right

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:54.729 
getting that and here's the plane right
here<00:03:49.010> pretty<00:03:50.010> fun<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:50.459> watch

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.589 

it's<00:03:55.189> like<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.370> video<00:03:55.700> game<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.390> you're<00:03:56.510> not

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
it's like a video game but you're not

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.530 
it's like a video game but you're not
playing<00:03:56.780> it<00:03:57.110> just<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:59.060> kind<00:03:59.299> of<00:03:59.329> like<00:03:59.420> a

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
playing it just like kind of like a

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.400 
playing it just like kind of like a
video<00:03:59.689> and<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.110> a<00:04:00.560> video<00:04:01.519> in<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.790> video<00:04:01.909> game

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.160 

and<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.890> screen<00:04:06.160> goes<00:04:06.340> blank<00:04:07.080> changes<00:04:08.080> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
and the screen goes blank changes the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.020 
and the screen goes blank changes the
resolution<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:10.060> plays<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.540> full<00:04:10.780> screen<00:04:11.080> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
resolution and plays in full screen and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.449 
resolution and plays in full screen and
slower

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
slower

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.420 
slower
it's<00:04:15.209> not<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.629> imager<00:04:16.220> recording<00:04:17.220> thing

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
it's not the imager recording thing

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.740 
it's not the imager recording thing
that's<00:04:17.579> making<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.910> slower<00:04:18.209> either<00:04:18.509> it<00:04:18.660> was

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
that's making this slower either it was

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.790 
that's making this slower either it was
already<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.139> this<00:04:19.320> before<00:04:20.030> so

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.650 

just<00:04:25.400> how<00:04:25.520> they<00:04:25.669> move<00:04:25.879> I<00:04:26.210> guess

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660

your<00:04:37.870> video<00:04:38.199> card<00:04:38.560> does<00:04:38.740> not<00:04:38.770> support<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.340> yet

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
your video card does not support it yet

it's gonna show the number so I'm just
gonna<00:05:25.220> probably<00:05:25.490> skip<00:05:25.820> through<00:05:26.000> this<00:05:26.090> part

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.080 

okay<00:06:20.460> so<00:06:20.520> I<00:06:20.729> got<00:06:20.969> much<00:06:21.270> lower<00:06:21.629> this<00:06:21.900> time<00:06:23.090> 3:17

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
okay so I got much lower this time 3:17

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.339 
okay so I got much lower this time 3:17
last<00:06:24.840> time<00:06:25.050> I<00:06:25.080> got<00:06:25.259> a<00:06:25.319> 460<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:26.999> the<00:06:27.389> recording

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
last time I got a 460 so the recording

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.469 
last time I got a 460 so the recording
software<00:06:28.529> does<00:06:28.889> bring<00:06:29.099> it<00:06:29.189> down<00:06:29.370> over<00:06:30.090> a

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
software does bring it down over a

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.689 
software does bring it down over a
hundred<00:06:30.960> so<00:06:31.909> that<00:06:32.909> kind<00:06:33.090> of<00:06:33.150> sucks<00:06:33.449> foot<00:06:33.960> huh

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
hundred so that kind of sucks foot huh

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.309 
hundred so that kind of sucks foot huh
like<00:06:35.699> I<00:06:35.819> said<00:06:36.060> earlier<00:06:36.509> I<00:06:36.569> did<00:06:36.870> get<00:06:36.990> an<00:06:37.110> error

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
like I said earlier I did get an error

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.929 
like I said earlier I did get an error
on<00:06:37.529> the<00:06:37.710> CD<00:06:38.039> reading<00:06:38.430> because<00:06:38.610> I<00:06:38.639> don't<00:06:38.789> have<00:06:38.849> a

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:38.939 
on the CD reading because I don't have a

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:41.899 
on the CD reading because I don't have a
CD<00:06:39.180> and<00:06:39.389> so<00:06:39.719> that's<00:06:40.229> it<00:06:40.439> for<00:06:40.560> that<00:06:40.740> we<00:06:41.610> here<00:06:41.789> my

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
CD and so that's it for that we here my

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.309 
CD and so that's it for that we here my
processor<00:06:42.479> it's<00:06:42.689> like<00:06:43.520> going<00:06:44.520> at<00:06:44.639> 53%

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
processor it's like going at 53%

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.529 
processor it's like going at 53%
I<00:06:47.840> guess<00:06:48.840> that's<00:06:49.080> ok<00:06:49.590> ok<00:06:50.129> so<00:06:50.189> that's<00:06:51.090> it<00:06:51.389> for

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
I guess that's ok ok so that's it for

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.420 
I guess that's ok ok so that's it for
this<00:06:51.689> make<00:06:52.620> sure<00:06:52.650> you<00:06:53.090> download<00:06:54.090> the
