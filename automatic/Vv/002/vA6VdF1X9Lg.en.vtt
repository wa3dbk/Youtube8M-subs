00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
shed and helping it out a little I guess

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.980

this<00:03:55.950> humidity<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.520> not<00:03:56.730> really<00:03:56.940> high<00:03:57.150> I'll<00:03:57.870> to

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
this humidity is not really high I'll to

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.860 
this humidity is not really high I'll to
check<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:59.240> Stella<00:04:00.240> was<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> tank
