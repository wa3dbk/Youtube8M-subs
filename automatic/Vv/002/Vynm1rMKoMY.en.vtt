I just drained the almonds out of the
pan<00:01:14.819> as<00:01:15.179> you<00:01:15.390> saw<00:01:15.630> before<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.140> had<00:01:16.499> water

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
pan as you saw before I had water

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.389 
pan as you saw before I had water
boiling<00:01:17.069> I<00:01:17.429> threw<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:17.969> my<00:01:18.950> two<00:01:19.950> pounds<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
boiling I threw in my two pounds of

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.520 
boiling I threw in my two pounds of
almonds<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.210> boiled<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.109> a<00:01:22.139> minute

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
almonds and i boiled them for a minute

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.129 
almonds and i boiled them for a minute
and<00:01:22.829> this<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.789> water<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.960> made

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:25.139 
and this is the water that actually made

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:26.660 
and this is the water that actually made
and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.710> that's<00:01:25.889> almond<00:01:26.310> milk<00:01:26.490> I've

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and I think that's almond milk I've

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.120 
and I think that's almond milk I've
never<00:01:26.880> made<00:01:27.149> almond<00:01:27.539> milk<00:01:27.749> before<00:01:27.929> so<00:01:28.619> i<00:01:29.009> think

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
never made almond milk before so i think

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
never made almond milk before so i think
i'm<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> look<00:01:29.700> into<00:01:29.880> doing<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:31.170> i

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
i'm going to look into doing that when i

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.899 
i'm going to look into doing that when i
blanch<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.799> almonds<00:01:32.219> maybe<00:01:32.459> I'll<00:01:32.609> have<00:01:32.880> some

get those it put those in a dehydrator

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.360 
get those it put those in a dehydrator
around<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> cookie<00:02:18.630> sheet<00:02:18.800> put<00:02:19.800> your<00:02:19.980> oven<00:02:20.250> on

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370

a<00:02:20.400> low<00:02:20.640> temperature<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.450> let<00:02:21.570> them<00:02:21.690> dry<00:02:22.080> out

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
a low temperature and let them dry out

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.110 
a low temperature and let them dry out
and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:22.830> you've<00:02:23.010> got<00:02:23.040> blanched<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and then you've got blanched on the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.220 
and then you've got blanched on the
flour<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:25.230> believe<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:28.860> pound<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:30.230> almonds

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
flour and I believe one pound of almonds

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.120 
flour and I believe one pound of almonds
is<00:02:32.330> three<00:02:33.330> cups<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.810> flour<00:02:34.200> but<00:02:34.800> when<00:02:34.980> you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
is three cups of flour but when you

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.860 
is three cups of flour but when you
blanch<00:02:35.550> them<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.920> might<00:02:38.220> be<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.480> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
blanch them it might be a little more so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 
blanch them it might be a little more so
you<00:02:39.930> might<00:02:40.290> be<00:02:40.500> having<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.920> did<00:02:41.100> two<00:02:41.220> pounds<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you might be having I did two pounds of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.520 
you might be having I did two pounds of
almonds<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.210> this<00:02:42.420> might<00:02:42.630> equal<00:02:43.020> out<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.380> be

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
almonds here this might equal out to be

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.730 
almonds here this might equal out to be
about<00:02:43.650> eight<00:02:43.980> cups<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.700> almond<00:02:45.120> flour<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.380> I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
right one question you might be asking

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.590 
right one question you might be asking
is<00:03:11.100> are<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.610> are<00:03:11.910> my<00:03:11.970> nuts<00:03:13.820> dried<00:03:14.820> out<00:03:14.850> yet<00:03:15.030> well

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
is are my are my nuts dried out yet well

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.030 
is are my are my nuts dried out yet well
one<00:03:15.780> thing<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.140> know<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.830> look<00:03:17.010> very

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
one thing to know is if you look very

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.940 
one thing to know is if you look very
closely<00:03:17.630> they<00:03:18.630> will<00:03:18.810> not<00:03:18.960> look<00:03:19.110> wet<00:03:19.440> you'll

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
closely they will not look wet you'll

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430 
closely they will not look wet you'll
see<00:03:20.340> some<00:03:20.760> they'll<00:03:21.030> sweat<00:03:21.420> off<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:22.200> water

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
see some they'll sweat off the the water

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.650 
see some they'll sweat off the the water
so<00:03:23.160> you'll<00:03:23.340> see<00:03:23.610> that<00:03:23.790> right<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.480> just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so you'll see that right now I'm just

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.620 
so you'll see that right now I'm just
completely<00:03:24.840> dry<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.740> had<00:03:26.400> my<00:03:26.670> oven<00:03:27.060> on<00:03:27.240> warm

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
completely dry I had my oven on warm

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.830 
completely dry I had my oven on warm
which<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.410> believe<00:03:28.650> was<00:03:28.770> 175<00:03:29.700> degrees<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.570> had

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
which I believe was 175 degrees I had

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.590 
which I believe was 175 degrees I had
the<00:03:30.990> oven<00:03:31.260> shut<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.580> probably<00:03:32.850> took<00:03:33.330> I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
the oven shut and it probably took I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410 
the oven shut and it probably took I
would<00:03:33.810> say<00:03:34.050> two<00:03:34.110> hours<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.520> to<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.270> them

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
would say two hours of that to get them

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.740 
would say two hours of that to get them
completely<00:03:36.900> dried<00:03:37.290> out<00:03:38.390> two<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.510> three<00:03:39.720> hours

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
completely dried out two to three hours

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.180 
completely dried out two to three hours
so<00:03:40.290> you're<00:03:40.440> just<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.800> have<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.950> play

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
powder on the very bottom of the food

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.930 
powder on the very bottom of the food
processor<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.230> then<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> threw<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.550> some<00:04:05.820> of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
processor and then I threw in some of

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.310 
processor and then I threw in some of
the<00:04:06.000> blanched<00:04:06.360> almonds<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.930> added<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.290> little

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
the blanched almonds I added a little

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.860 
the blanched almonds I added a little
bit<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.680> arrowroot<00:04:08.010> powder<00:04:08.250> onto<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.360> top<00:04:09.570> and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
bit of arrowroot powder onto the top and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.080 
bit of arrowroot powder onto the top and
just<00:04:09.990> kind<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> move<00:04:11.100> the<00:04:11.130> almonds<00:04:11.700> around<00:04:11.970> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
just kind of move the almonds around a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.520 
just kind of move the almonds around a
little<00:04:12.239> bit<00:04:12.390> with<00:04:12.570> my<00:04:12.780> hands<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.410> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
little bit with my hands to get the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.560 
little bit with my hands to get the
arrow<00:04:13.680> route<00:04:14.040> down<00:04:14.190> there<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.670> find<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.360> if<00:04:15.480> I

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
arrow route down there I find that if I

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.690 
arrow route down there I find that if I
don't<00:04:15.720> put<00:04:15.959> any<00:04:16.200> arrowroot<00:04:16.980> on<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> bottom<00:04:17.609> of

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
don't put any arrowroot on the bottom of

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.190 
don't put any arrowroot on the bottom of
the<00:04:17.790> food<00:04:17.970> processor<00:04:18.600> there<00:04:18.810> will<00:04:18.900> be<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.020> lot

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
the food processor there will be a lot

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.900 
the food processor there will be a lot
of<00:04:19.230> caking<00:04:19.739> down<00:04:19.919> there<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.310> hard<00:04:20.520> to<00:04:20.640> get<00:04:20.760> out

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
of caking down there and hard to get out

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.039 
of caking down there and hard to get out
and<00:04:21.030> just<00:04:21.209> have<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.450> scoop<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.780> out<00:04:21.870> which<00:04:22.020> is

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and just have to scoop it out which is

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.909 
and just have to scoop it out which is
fine<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:23.060> less<00:04:24.060> caking<00:04:24.710> here's<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
fine but just less caking here's the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.180 
fine but just less caking here's the
almond<00:04:26.250> flour<00:04:26.960> as<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.169> can<00:04:28.350> see<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.890> is

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
almond flour as you can see it is

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.110 
almond flour as you can see it is
in<00:04:29.900> fine<00:04:30.900> granule<00:04:31.500> form<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.130> this<00:04:32.880> will

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
in fine granule form and this will

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.810 
in fine granule form and this will
probably<00:04:33.690> make<00:04:33.840> about<00:04:34.110> eight<00:04:34.440> cups<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:35.010> almond

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
probably make about eight cups of almond

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.060 
probably make about eight cups of almond
flour
