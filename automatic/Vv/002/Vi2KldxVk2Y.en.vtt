a<00:00:13.759> good<00:00:14.759> place<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.000> start<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.509> vert<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.900> terms

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
a good place to start on vert in terms

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.260 
a good place to start on vert in terms
of<00:00:16.230> tricks<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.740> errors<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> know<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.029> can

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
of tricks or errors you know if you can

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.730 
of tricks or errors you know if you can
drop<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.630> even<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> can't<00:00:19.230> drop<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.590> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
drop in even if you can't drop in you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
drop in even if you can't drop in you
can<00:00:19.859> work<00:00:20.010> your<00:00:20.130> way<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> Ayres<00:00:20.840> frontside

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
can work your way up to Ayres frontside

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.000 
can work your way up to Ayres frontside
is<00:00:21.960> probably<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.380> best<00:00:22.560> way<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> start

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
is probably the best way to start

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.230 
is probably the best way to start
because<00:00:23.369> frontside<00:00:23.730> means<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.119> you're

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
because frontside means that you're

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
because frontside means that you're
facing<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.720> wall<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.859> actually<00:00:26.010> look

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
facing the wall you can actually look

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.250 
facing the wall you can actually look
where<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> work<00:00:27.689> your<00:00:27.840> way<00:00:27.900> up

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
where you're going and work your way up

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.169 
where you're going and work your way up
as<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> go<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.340> when<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.519> start<00:00:29.699> ollie<00:00:29.880> on

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
as you go so when you start ollie on

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
as you go so when you start ollie on
hurt<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> different<00:00:31.500> technique<00:00:31.830> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
hurt it's a different technique you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160 
hurt it's a different technique you
actually<00:00:32.309> ollie<00:00:32.600> upward<00:00:33.600> instead<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.020> out

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
actually ollie upward instead of out

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 
actually ollie upward instead of out
from<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> wall<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.100> know<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.820> little

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
from the wall you know and it's a little

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.729 
from the wall you know and it's a little
more<00:00:36.149> subtle<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:37.260> doesn't<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
more subtle but it doesn't take that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.470 
more subtle but it doesn't take that
much<00:00:37.860> effort<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.640> now<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.120> start

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
much effort you can now you can start

frontside air with my gravity on between
your<00:00:41.340> legs<00:00:41.489> before<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.940> call<00:00:42.120> stinkbug<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
your legs before you call stinkbug and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.569 
your legs before you call stinkbug and
then<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.620> more<00:00:43.680> comfortable<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.250> end

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
then as you get more comfortable you end

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
then as you get more comfortable you end
up<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:45.600> around<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.170> knee<00:00:46.289> called<00:00:46.590> tuck<00:00:46.800> me

remember<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.760> frontside<00:00:51.120> air<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> take-off

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
remember on frontside air the take-off

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
remember on frontside air the take-off
you<00:00:54.420> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> ollie<00:00:54.840> out<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.289> too<00:00:55.500> far<00:00:55.800> not

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
you want to ollie out not too far not

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
you want to ollie out not too far not
too<00:00:56.280> hard<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.140> hand<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
too hard but just into your hand you can

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
too hard but just into your hand you can
actually<00:00:58.649> start<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.129> learning<00:00:59.250> kick<00:00:59.579> turns

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
actually start by learning kick turns

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
actually start by learning kick turns
and<00:01:00.090> grabbing<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.590> start<00:01:01.890> pulling

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and grabbing them and then start pulling

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
and grabbing them and then start pulling
off<00:01:02.280> eventually<00:01:02.809> you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> make<00:01:04.080> sure<00:01:04.110> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
off eventually you want to make sure you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
off eventually you want to make sure you
got<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.530> hold<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.760> know<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
got a good hold of it you know and that

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.789 
got a good hold of it you know and that
you<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> turn<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> full

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you actually are going to turn the full

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
you actually are going to turn the full
180<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.400> sometimes<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.720> end<00:01:09.840> up

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
180 because sometimes you can end up

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.830 
180 because sometimes you can end up
coming<00:01:10.200> short<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.920> falling<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.720> you're

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
coming short and falling back so you're

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.330 
coming short and falling back so you're
kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.140> top<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
kind of on top of it and then the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
kind of on top of it and then the
landing<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.060> let<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> go

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
landing you just let it go

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.070 
landing you just let it go
drop<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.310> lean<00:01:17.820> forward<00:01:17.960> what<00:01:18.960> else

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
drop it down and lean forward what else

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
drop it down and lean forward what else
don't<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> lean<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> lean

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
don't want to lean back as if you lean

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.429
