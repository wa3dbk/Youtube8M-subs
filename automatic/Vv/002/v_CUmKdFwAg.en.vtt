naturals I took that into I pulled it a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.930 
naturals I took that into I pulled it a
separate<00:02:53.560> again<00:02:53.800> into<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.220> four<00:02:54.490> sections

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
separate again into the four sections

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.470

a big ol handful a palm for to each
section<00:03:04.950> 1<00:03:05.950> section<00:03:06.190> put<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:08.020> didn't

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
section 1 section put it in and I didn't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.290 
section 1 section put it in and I didn't
detain<00:03:09.040> go<00:03:09.220> anymore<00:03:09.430> because<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.850> did<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.180> in

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300

then<00:03:13.240> I<00:03:13.390> did<00:03:13.570> this<00:03:13.690> moving<00:03:14.140> I<00:03:14.350> didn't<00:03:15.130> do<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
then I did this moving I didn't do the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.479 
then I did this moving I didn't do the
scrunch<00:03:15.640> thing<00:03:15.880> because<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.510> want<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:17.489> knock

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
girls already define pretty much and I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.070

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.420 
want them to be as they long gated as
possible<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.800> didn't<00:03:24.040> want<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.250> do<00:03:24.340> the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
possible so I didn't want to do the

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.640 
possible so I didn't want to do the
scruncher<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.300> just<00:03:25.540> did<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.900> smoothing

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
scruncher so I just did the smoothing

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.320 
scruncher so I just did the smoothing
and<00:03:26.769> stretching<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:30.220> did<00:03:31.120> that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
and stretching like that and I did that

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.220 
and stretching like that and I did that
to<00:03:31.600> each<00:03:31.780> four<00:03:32.080> sections<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.769> then<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.660> shook

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
to each four sections and then I shook

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.110 
to each four sections and then I shook
it<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.739> little<00:03:35.769> bit<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.370> didn't<00:03:36.940> do<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
it just a little bit I didn't do the

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.070 
it just a little bit I didn't do the
extra<00:03:37.900> heart<00:03:38.140> shaking<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.160> used<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.880> do

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
extra heart shaking that I used to do

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.390 
extra heart shaking that I used to do
because<00:03:41.080> my<00:03:41.260> again<00:03:41.830> because<00:03:42.100> my<00:03:42.510> curls<00:03:43.510> are

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
because my again because my curls are

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.530 
because my again because my curls are
already<00:03:45.400> pretty<00:03:45.610> separated<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.300> clumped

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
already pretty separated and clumped

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.699 
already pretty separated and clumped
together<00:03:46.600> pretty<00:03:46.930> good<00:03:47.200> i<00:03:47.350> didn't<00:03:47.590> really

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
together pretty good i didn't really

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.900 
together pretty good i didn't really
feel<00:03:47.800> the<00:03:48.010> need<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:49.030> um<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.700> did<00:03:51.880> a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
feel the need to and um so I did a

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.370 
feel the need to and um so I did a
little<00:03:51.970> shake<00:03:52.269> like<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.110> I

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
little shake like that and then I

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.580 
little shake like that and then I
flipped<00:03:53.860> my<00:03:54.010> head<00:03:54.220> forward<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.500> did<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.530> little

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
flipped my head forward and did a little

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.759 
flipped my head forward and did a little
shaken<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.670> then<00:03:57.880> flip<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.769> then

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
shaken and then flip the back then

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.850 
shaken and then flip the back then
that's<00:04:00.160> when<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.400> apply<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.420> gel<00:04:01.450> up<00:04:01.989> top<00:04:02.440> and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
that's when I apply the gel up top and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.490 
that's when I apply the gel up top and
so<00:04:03.790> that's<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.150> so<00:04:04.330> i'ma<00:04:04.480> let<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.720> dry<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.200> see

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
so that's it so i'ma let it dry and see

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.479 
so that's it so i'ma let it dry and see
how<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.980> looks<00:04:07.890> again<00:04:08.890> like<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.130> tell<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.400> all

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
how it looks again like I tell you all

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.330 
how it looks again like I tell you all
the<00:04:09.610> time<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.000> back<00:04:10.450> area<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:11.350> my<00:04:14.340> dryer

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
the time the back area here is my dryer

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.470 
the time the back area here is my dryer
and<00:04:16.200> Kiki<00:04:17.200> your<00:04:17.290> texture<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.519> I<00:04:18.640> applied<00:04:19.269> more

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
and Kiki your texture so I applied more

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.230 
and Kiki your texture so I applied more
more<00:04:22.320> conditioner<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.890> that<00:04:23.040> section<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.730> so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
more conditioner to that section and so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.730 
more conditioner to that section and so
I'm<00:04:24.360> hoping<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.690> that<00:04:24.900> section<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.350> turn<00:04:25.560> out

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
I'm hoping that that section to turn out

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.560 
I'm hoping that that section to turn out
really<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.820> cuz<00:04:26.970> usually<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
really good cuz usually that's the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.160 
really good cuz usually that's the
section<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.990> does<00:04:28.320> not<00:04:28.530> hold<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.130> arm<00:04:30.170> curl

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
section that does not hold the arm curl

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
section that does not hold the arm curl
pattern<00:04:31.590> very<00:04:32.130> well<00:04:33.470> because<00:04:34.470> of<00:04:34.590> its<00:04:34.740> texture

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
pattern very well because of its texture

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.100 
pattern very well because of its texture
so<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.670> said<00:04:35.730> that's<00:04:35.940> why<00:04:36.120> I<00:04:36.150> apply<00:04:36.360> extra

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
so like I said that's why I apply extra

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.900 
so like I said that's why I apply extra
back<00:04:37.380> there<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.680> hopefully<00:04:37.800> that<00:04:38.340> helps<00:04:38.370> out

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
back there so hopefully that helps out

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.560 
back there so hopefully that helps out
and<00:04:39.150> I'll<00:04:40.050> try<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.500> come<00:04:40.740> back<00:04:40.950> later<00:04:41.850> on

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
and I'll try to come back later on

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.930 
and I'll try to come back later on
tonight<00:04:42.870> when<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.200> completely<00:04:43.590> try<00:04:43.940> and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
tonight when it's completely try and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.180
