00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
if I would recommend one thing that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.919 
if I would recommend one thing that
would<00:01:40.250> immediately<00:01:40.550> probably<00:01:41.240> drastically

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
would immediately probably drastically

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.620 
would immediately probably drastically
improve<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.490> way<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.700> fly<00:01:44.060> would<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.509> to

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
improve the way you fly would be to

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.359 
improve the way you fly would be to
learn<00:01:44.840> how<00:01:44.869> to<00:01:45.110> fly<00:01:45.319> outside<00:01:45.890> your<00:01:46.099> cockpit

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
learn how to fly outside your cockpit

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.710 
learn how to fly outside your cockpit
because<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.240> gives<00:01:47.390> you<00:01:47.539> much<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:49.720> what's

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
because that gives you much more what's

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.900 
because that gives you much more what's
the<00:01:50.840> word<00:01:50.899> I'm<00:01:51.080> looking<00:01:51.110> for<00:01:51.289> line<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.429> sight<00:01:52.459> I

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
the word I'm looking for line of sight I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.219 
the word I'm looking for line of sight I
don't<00:01:53.179> know<00:01:53.239> if<00:01:53.330> that's<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.539> right<00:01:53.599> word<00:01:53.720> just

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
don't know if that's the right word just

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.370 
don't know if that's the right word just
more<00:01:54.410> sight<00:01:55.160> more<00:01:55.550> vision<00:01:55.970> on<00:01:56.300> your<00:01:56.929> potential

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
more sight more vision on your potential

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.839 
more sight more vision on your potential
targets<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:57.920> see<00:01:58.099> I<00:01:58.130> just<00:01:58.190> picked<00:01:58.550> this<00:01:58.640> guy

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
targets you see I just picked this guy

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.699 
targets you see I just picked this guy
up<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.599> I'm<00:01:59.660> going<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.810> go<00:01:59.929> ahead<00:01:59.959> and<00:02:00.170> do<00:02:00.679> a

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
up so I'm going to go ahead and do a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.969 
up so I'm going to go ahead and do a
little<00:02:01.099> half<00:02:01.910> loop<00:02:02.479> here<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:02.989> he's<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.800> my

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
little half loop here and he's on my

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.199 
little half loop here and he's on my
buddy<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.459> I'm<00:02:04.520> going<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.670> switch<00:02:04.849> back<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.149> the

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
buddy so I'm going to switch back in the

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.600 
buddy so I'm going to switch back in the
cockpit<00:02:05.390> mode<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.530> mop<00:02:07.130> up<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.340> kill

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
cockpit mode and just mop up the kill

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.419 
cockpit mode and just mop up the kill
and<00:02:07.819> it's<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:08.929> just<00:02:09.349> like<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.770> if<00:02:10.009> I<00:02:10.280> can

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
and it's it's just like that if I can

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.390 
and it's it's just like that if I can
actually<00:02:10.690> get<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.840> him<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.260> really<00:02:13.099> overshot

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
actually get on him I really overshot

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.750 
actually get on him I really overshot
him<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:13.910> but<00:02:14.390> he<00:02:14.660> is

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
him there but he is

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.809 
him there but he is
is<00:02:16.230> disabled<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.319> that<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.620> dead<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.069> that's

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
is disabled and that is dead so that's

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.339 
is disabled and that is dead so that's
kind<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.060> how<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.239> cockpit<00:02:19.840> view<00:02:19.989> work<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.290> you

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
kind of how the cockpit view work so you

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.100 
kind of how the cockpit view work so you
get<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.470> much<00:02:20.650> more<00:02:20.890> much<00:02:21.670> larger<00:02:22.360> field<00:02:23.019> of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
get a much more much larger field of

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.020 
get a much more much larger field of
view<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.470> then<00:02:23.950> once<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.579> maneuver

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
view and then once you can maneuver

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.640 
view and then once you can maneuver
around<00:02:25.150> behind<00:02:25.750> your<00:02:25.900> enemy<00:02:26.230> target<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.590> can

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
around behind your enemy target you can

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.559 
around behind your enemy target you can
switch<00:02:26.980> back<00:02:27.159> in<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> cockpit<00:02:27.549> mute<00:02:27.939> mode<00:02:28.329> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
switch back in the cockpit mute mode and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.710 
switch back in the cockpit mute mode and
take<00:02:28.750> them<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.799> that's<00:02:30.519> one<00:02:30.819> thing<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
take them out so that's one thing the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.229 
take them out so that's one thing the
second<00:02:32.079> thing<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.409> definitely<00:02:33.250> going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.909> be

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
second thing is definitely going to be

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.240 
second thing is definitely going to be
using<00:02:36.900> using<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.140> deceleration<00:02:38.680> key<00:02:39.010> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
using using the deceleration key and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.479 
using using the deceleration key and
your<00:02:39.670> afterburner<00:02:40.209> correctly<00:02:41.079> now<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.980> always

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
your afterburner correctly now I always

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.740 
your afterburner correctly now I always
use<00:02:42.609> my<00:02:42.760> afterburner<00:02:43.180> where<00:02:43.359> I'm<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
use my afterburner where I'm going in a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.690 
use my afterburner where I'm going in a
straight<00:02:43.810> line<00:02:43.989> because<00:02:44.560> makes<00:02:45.220> me<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:45.489> faster

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
straight line because makes me go faster

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.119 
straight line because makes me go faster
of<00:02:46.000> course<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:46.840> don't<00:02:47.230> use<00:02:47.439> my<00:02:47.470> afterburner

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
of course but I don't use my afterburner

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.399 
of course but I don't use my afterburner
to<00:02:48.579> go<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.239> thought<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.510> bailed<00:02:50.079> out<00:02:50.230> there<00:02:50.379> I

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
to go so I thought I bailed out there I

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.020 
to go so I thought I bailed out there I
don't<00:02:50.739> use<00:02:50.890> my<00:02:50.920> afterburner<00:02:51.519> to<00:02:51.670> go<00:02:51.790> into<00:02:51.940> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
don't use my afterburner to go into a

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.599 
don't use my afterburner to go into a
turn<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.569> don't<00:02:53.109> use<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.349> an<00:02:53.530> intern<00:02:53.799> what<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.459> do

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
turn I don't use it an intern what I do

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.020 
turn I don't use it an intern what I do
is<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.769> decelerate<00:02:56.769> using<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> S<00:02:57.190> key<00:02:57.220> turn

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
is I decelerate using the S key turn

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.879 
is I decelerate using the S key turn
into<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.599> then<00:02:58.750> accelerate<00:02:59.260> out<00:02:59.409> it's

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
into it and then accelerate out it's

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.770 
into it and then accelerate out it's
it's<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.879> simple<00:03:00.909> that<00:03:01.450> makes<00:03:01.659> you

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's really that simple that makes you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.280 
it's really that simple that makes you
turn<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.139> much<00:03:02.349> faster<00:03:02.799> see<00:03:03.340> decelerate

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
turn that much faster see decelerate

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.160 
turn that much faster see decelerate
coming<00:03:05.290> out<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.379> the<00:03:05.500> turn<00:03:05.819> accelerate<00:03:06.819> out

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
coming out of the turn accelerate out

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.069 
coming out of the turn accelerate out
decelerate<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.790> accelerate<00:03:09.790> out<00:03:10.079> decelerate

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
decelerate in accelerate out decelerate

decelerate in accelerate out decelerate
in<00:03:11.200> accelerate<00:03:12.159> out<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.430> when<00:03:12.549> you<00:03:12.609> get<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:12.790> a

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
in accelerate out and when you get in a

in accelerate out and when you get in a
circle<00:03:13.060> jerk<00:03:13.269> which<00:03:13.599> is<00:03:13.720> what<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:13.900> call<00:03:14.139> two

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.309 
Hut about 320 to 370 I don't know I
think<00:03:38.049> that's<00:03:38.260> km/h<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.430> have<00:03:39.549> no<00:03:39.730> idea<00:03:39.879> I<00:03:40.319> hope

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
think that's km/h I have no idea I hope

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.559 
think that's km/h I have no idea I hope
that's<00:03:41.470> not<00:03:41.620> km/h<00:03:42.280> that's<00:03:42.489> really<00:03:42.669> slow<00:03:42.940> but

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
that's not km/h that's really slow but

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.550 
that's not km/h that's really slow but
anyway<00:03:43.840> around<00:03:44.609> 320<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:46.030> 370<00:03:46.900> speed<00:03:47.199> is<00:03:47.349> your

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
anyway around 320 to 370 speed is your

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.050 
anyway around 320 to 370 speed is your
optimal<00:03:48.010> turning<00:03:48.340> speed<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.849> kind<00:03:49.000> of

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
optimal turning speed and you kind of

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.309 
optimal turning speed and you kind of
want<00:03:49.209> to<00:03:49.269> hover<00:03:49.389> around<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.870> when<00:03:50.109> you're<00:03:50.230> in

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
want to hover around that when you're in

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.689 
want to hover around that when you're in
one<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.470> these<00:03:50.620> Circle<00:03:50.980> Jerks<00:03:51.010> with<00:03:51.370> an<00:03:51.459> enemy

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
one of these Circle Jerks with an enemy

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.550 
one of these Circle Jerks with an enemy
jet<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.599> let's<00:03:52.840> go<00:03:52.959> try<00:03:53.139> and<00:03:53.169> find<00:03:53.319> an

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
jet so let's go try and find an

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.110 
jet so let's go try and find an
immediate<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.129> actually<00:03:54.400> shoot<00:03:54.609> down<00:03:54.849> and

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
immediate to actually shoot down and

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.059 
immediate to actually shoot down and
looks<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.959> this<00:03:56.109> one<00:03:56.260> over<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.530> horizon

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
looks like this one over the horizon

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.490 
looks like this one over the horizon
there<00:03:57.389> yeah<00:03:58.389> ok<00:03:58.930> so<00:03:59.139> I'm<00:03:59.230> going<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.379> go<00:03:59.470> ahead

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
there yeah ok so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.140 
there yeah ok so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:59.680> decelerate<00:04:00.159> into<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.430> turn<00:04:00.609> catch<00:04:00.849> up<00:04:01.000> to

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
and decelerate into the turn catch up to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.599 
and decelerate into the turn catch up to
him<00:04:01.239> i<00:04:01.389> am<00:04:02.199> going<00:04:02.349> to<00:04:02.409> decelerate<00:04:02.919> on<00:04:03.250> behind

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
him i am going to decelerate on behind

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.610 
him i am going to decelerate on behind
him<00:04:03.760> now<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.239> i'm<00:04:04.599> going<00:04:04.690> to<00:04:04.750> lead<00:04:04.989> him<00:04:05.169> with

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
him now and i'm going to lead him with

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.509 
him now and i'm going to lead him with
my<00:04:05.859> gun<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:07.530> decelerate<00:04:08.530> to<00:04:08.709> make<00:04:09.310> sure<00:04:09.489> i

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
my gun and decelerate to make sure i

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.399 
my gun and decelerate to make sure i
don't<00:04:09.609> overshoot<00:04:10.060> him<00:04:10.180> here<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:10.510> then<00:04:11.019> then

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
don't overshoot him here and then then

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.110 
don't overshoot him here and then then
basically<00:04:11.769> at<00:04:12.129> this<00:04:12.220> point<00:04:12.489> he's<00:04:12.699> mine<00:04:12.909> he's

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
basically at this point he's mine he's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.819 
basically at this point he's mine he's
not<00:04:13.419> getting<00:04:13.599> away<00:04:13.659> it's<00:04:14.319> just<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.530> matter<00:04:14.680> of

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
not getting away it's just a matter of

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.569 
not getting away it's just a matter of
time<00:04:14.919> until<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:16.239> kill<00:04:16.510> them<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:16.989> their<00:04:17.229> yes

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
time until I kill them and their yes

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.599 
time until I kill them and their yes
so<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.780> most<00:04:18.959> important<00:04:19.439> thing<00:04:19.650> decelerate

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
so the most important thing decelerate

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.219 
so the most important thing decelerate
into<00:04:20.879> your<00:04:21.000> turn<00:04:21.180> accelerate<00:04:21.780> out<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:22.079> that's

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
into your turn accelerate out if that's

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.809 
into your turn accelerate out if that's
one<00:04:22.560> thing<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.889> take<00:04:23.099> from<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.370> even<00:04:23.669> if<00:04:23.729> you

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 
one thing you take from this even if you

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.480 
one thing you take from this even if you
don't<00:04:24.030> want<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.240> fly<00:04:24.389> outside<00:04:24.659> your<00:04:24.810> cockpit

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
don't want to fly outside your cockpit

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.010 
don't want to fly outside your cockpit
accelerate<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.610> decelerate<00:04:26.719> into<00:04:27.719> your<00:04:27.840> turn

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
accelerate or decelerate into your turn

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.110 
accelerate or decelerate into your turn
accelerate<00:04:28.710> out<00:04:28.889> that's<00:04:29.219> the<00:04:29.370> most<00:04:29.490> important

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
accelerate out that's the most important

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.200 
accelerate out that's the most important
thing<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.569> get<00:04:30.719> across<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.400> now<00:04:32.400> you're

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
thing I can get across to you now you're

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.610 
thing I can get across to you now you're
probably<00:04:33.330> wondering<00:04:33.539> what<00:04:34.050> my<00:04:34.199> vehicle

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
probably wondering what my vehicle

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.649 
probably wondering what my vehicle
specializations<00:04:35.370> are<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.699> i<00:04:35.759> I'm<00:04:36.060> sorry<00:04:36.360> din

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
specializations are and i I'm sorry din

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.670 
specializations are and i I'm sorry din
say<00:04:36.870> in<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.050> beginning<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:37.409> video<00:04:37.620> I

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
say in the beginning of the video I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.080 
say in the beginning of the video I
probably<00:04:37.919> should<00:04:38.159> have<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:38.699> vehicle

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
probably should have but my vehicle

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.080 
probably should have but my vehicle
specializations<00:04:39.840> our<00:04:40.110> stealth<00:04:40.889> flares<00:04:41.849> as

you<00:04:42.210> see<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.389> just<00:04:42.599> dropped<00:04:42.840> there<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.370> uh

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
you see I just dropped there and uh

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.360 
you see I just dropped there and uh
Heatseekers<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.169> use<00:04:46.289> heat<00:04:46.530> seekers<00:04:46.919> over

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370

Heatseekers and I use heat seekers over
guided<00:04:47.669> missiles<00:04:48.000> or<00:04:48.150> rocket<00:04:48.449> pods<00:04:48.629> because

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
guided missiles suck even worse and heat

guided missiles suck even worse and heat
seekers<00:04:54.360> i<00:04:54.509> use<00:04:54.719> to<00:04:54.840> take<00:04:55.020> out<00:04:55.139> choppers

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
seekers i use to take out choppers

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.379 
seekers i use to take out choppers
that's<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.949> only<00:04:56.069> reason<00:04:56.159> i<00:04:56.310> use<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:56.729> I<00:04:56.940> see

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
that's the only reason i use it so I see

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.700 
that's the only reason i use it so I see
this<00:04:57.539> guy<00:04:57.690> I'm<00:04:57.900> decelerating<00:04:58.590> I'm

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
this guy I'm decelerating I'm

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.559 
this guy I'm decelerating I'm
accelerating<00:04:59.340> back<00:04:59.490> in<00:04:59.669> I'm<00:04:59.819> decelerating

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
accelerating back in I'm decelerating

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.540 
accelerating back in I'm decelerating
again<00:05:00.840> trying<00:05:01.319> to<00:05:01.379> stay<00:05:01.560> at<00:05:01.650> that<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:02.099> golden

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
again trying to stay at that that golden

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.129 
again trying to stay at that that golden
speed<00:05:02.940> I'm<00:05:03.210> going<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.539> little<00:05:03.659> slower<00:05:03.960> now

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
speed I'm going a little slower now

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.189 
speed I'm going a little slower now
because<00:05:04.349> I'm<00:05:04.440> about<00:05:05.219> 20<00:05:05.400> verse<00:05:05.669> over<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.199> shoot

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
because I'm about 20 verse over a shoot

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.200 
because I'm about 20 verse over a shoot
in<00:05:07.259> there<00:05:07.409> but<00:05:07.590> now<00:05:07.710> I'm<00:05:07.830> slowing<00:05:08.129> down<00:05:08.310> I<00:05:08.580> got

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
in there but now I'm slowing down I got

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.809 
in there but now I'm slowing down I got
him<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.599> got<00:05:09.840> him<00:05:10.080> in<00:05:10.199> my<00:05:10.259> sights<00:05:10.379> and<00:05:10.979> he's<00:05:11.580> dead

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
him I got him in my sights and he's dead

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.830 
him I got him in my sights and he's dead
so<00:05:12.569> that's<00:05:13.139> basically<00:05:13.409> how<00:05:14.009> a<00:05:15.000> dogfight<00:05:15.569> works

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
so that's basically how a dogfight works

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.600 
so that's basically how a dogfight works
and<00:05:16.139> when<00:05:16.319> you're<00:05:16.439> in<00:05:16.590> one<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.770> those<00:05:16.860> little

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
and when you're in one of those little

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.839 
and when you're in one of those little
circle<00:05:18.150> jerked<00:05:18.990> things<00:05:19.560> which<00:05:20.460> basically

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
circle jerked things which basically

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.969 
circle jerked things which basically
once<00:05:21.150> again<00:05:21.419> is<00:05:21.539> just<00:05:21.569> games<00:05:22.529> over<00:05:22.800> but

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
once again is just games over but

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.800 
once again is just games over but
basically<00:05:23.279> one<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.639> those<00:05:23.759> things<00:05:24.479> where<00:05:24.629> you

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
basically one of those things where you

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.379 
basically one of those things where you
circle<00:05:25.199> around<00:05:25.259> the<00:05:25.560> enemy<00:05:25.860> jet<00:05:26.389> basically

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
circle around the enemy jet basically

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.089 
circle around the enemy jet basically
it's<00:05:27.599> just<00:05:27.750> whoever<00:05:27.870> can<00:05:28.139> turn<00:05:28.379> faster<00:05:28.889> winds

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
it's just whoever can turn faster winds

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.899 
it's just whoever can turn faster winds
so<00:05:29.870> that's<00:05:30.870> my<00:05:31.080> basic<00:05:31.409> jet<00:05:31.830> tutorial<00:05:32.310> if<00:05:32.669> you
