depending on your shader but I'm going

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.600 
depending on your shader but I'm going
to<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.680> through<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> couple<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.220> shaders<00:01:23.430> right

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to go through a couple of shaders right

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.780 
to go through a couple of shaders right
here<00:01:23.759> just<00:01:23.909> showing<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> looks<00:01:24.990> in

here just showing you how it looks in

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:38.640 
here just showing you how it looks in
different<00:01:26.790> shaders<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.240> course<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.600> go

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:02:11.540

so<00:02:12.550> those<00:02:12.700> are<00:02:12.730> those<00:02:13.000> shaders<00:02:13.420> now<00:02:13.569> let's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so those are those shaders now let's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.930 
so those are those shaders now let's
move<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.110> with<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.920> Exile<00:02:15.430> full<00:02:15.849> armor<00:02:16.300> set
