aspect<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.900> it<00:00:54.399> navigation<00:00:55.399> controls<00:00:56.239> on<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
steering wheel and I think the Jeep

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.729 
steering wheel and I think the Jeep
Patriot<00:00:59.000> this<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.260> perfect<00:01:00.470> combination

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
Patriot this is the perfect combination
