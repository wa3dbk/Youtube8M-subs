00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the noise behind threats 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 north korea follows next 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 strengthening US military in the region on 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 stage xianyang answers even more 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.639
 serious warnings 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.860
 and although the defense minister united 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.560
 states chuck heigl called north korea 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.359
 clear and obvious threat american 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 the government claims it did not find 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 signs that north korea 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.990
 preparing for military action therefore 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.599
 perhaps threats are just words but for now 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.550
 kndr says usa acts besides 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.019
 f-22 fighters and others 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.880
 bombers sent to 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.270
 undergoing military trials in the south 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.370
 korea 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.710
 The Pentagon decided to place the elements about 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.170
 on guam the largest US military base 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 Asia, Armed Forces announced that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 authorities sanctioned 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.559
 US nuclear strike reportedly 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 North Korean missiles will not be able to reach 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 continental america but may 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.640
 be dangerous for usa bases in asia south 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 Korea are 28 thousand American 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 military personnel 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 is it possible that before our eyes 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.270
 unleashes the most powerful nuclear 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 confrontation since the caribbean 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.650
 crisis and although there are statements as always 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.930
 no one believes in hostility 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.210
 can strike the North Korean leader 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.280
 young but perfectly aware of what it is 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.979
 the decision would be suicide he drink 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.740
 your own volume you ass well flow 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.119
 sciences xianyang understands that attacks on 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.759
 usa will be suicidal 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.170
 United States retaliation will be terrible 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 North Korea does not want to commit 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.509
 suicide and i believe that dcp is going on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 this is to start peace talks 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.520
 agreement with the us in the american media 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.740
 Experts say essentially the same thing 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 North Korea will not strike but because 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 that this suicide understands that country 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 trying to make some kind of agreement with 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.229
 washington but will not get it 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.630
 say former officials and others 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 experts but the North Korean military 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.009
 rhetoric and escalation of American 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.689
 military presence in the region 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.729
 causes some to fear that because 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.680
 haste or slightest mistakes any 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.850
 the parties the situation may come out from under 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 control and brain and start ocean rt 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.509
