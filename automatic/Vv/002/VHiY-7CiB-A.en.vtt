00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
in sunglasses probably wouldn't bother

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.410 
in sunglasses probably wouldn't bother
me<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.890> much<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> lot<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.119> who<00:01:06.299> are

looking<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.110> coverage<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.939> know<00:01:08.939> may

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
looking for more coverage you know may

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
looking for more coverage you know may
not<00:01:09.780> may<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.430> ideal

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
not may not think that these are ideal

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.039 
not may not think that these are ideal
you<00:01:11.970> want<00:01:12.150> something<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.630> gives<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you want something that gives you a

you want something that gives you a
little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.470> more<00:01:13.680> coverage<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.130> want

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
little bit more coverage you want

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
little bit more coverage you want
something<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.060> bit<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.390> rap<00:01:15.689> but

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
something with a little bit more rap but

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
something with a little bit more rap but
these<00:01:16.619> are<00:01:16.799> fairly<00:01:17.430> basic<00:01:17.820> fairly<00:01:18.509> simplistic

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
these are fairly basic fairly simplistic

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
these are fairly basic fairly simplistic
and<00:01:19.490> again<00:01:20.490> seems<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> most

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540

all sorts of different sizes and styles
this<00:01:37.799> again<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> double<00:01:38.759> bar<00:01:39.000> again<00:01:39.720> not

this again is the double bar again not

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.730 
this again is the double bar again not
giving<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> any<00:01:40.710> more<00:01:40.979> protection<00:01:41.640> than<00:01:42.740> then

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
giving you any more protection than then

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.230 
giving you any more protection than then
you<00:01:43.860> would<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.189> had<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.790> one

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
you would if you had you know one

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.740 
you would if you had you know one
without<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:47.509> little<00:01:48.509> bit<00:01:48.630> more

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
without it but a little bit more

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.399 
without it but a little bit more
coverage<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.100> more

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
coverage so you get a little bit more

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.020 
coverage so you get a little bit more
more<00:01:52.409> sunglass<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.250> still<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> sides

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
more sunglass but still on the sides

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
more sunglass but still on the sides
you're<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.869> getting<00:01:55.100> total<00:01:56.100> coverage

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you're still not getting total coverage

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
you're still not getting total coverage
and<00:01:56.670> again<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> bottom<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.140> out

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and again from the bottom I can see out

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.609 
and again from the bottom I can see out
of<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.759> in<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.180> end<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:00.780> these<00:02:01.469> are

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
of them so in the end you know these are

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.190 
of them so in the end you know these are
just<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.950> user<00:02:02.310> discretion<00:02:02.719> ask<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.930> optician

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
how many you know obviously this is a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.839 
how many you know obviously this is a
fairly<00:02:06.780> wide<00:02:07.229> breadth<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:08.099> selection<00:02:08.729> in

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
fairly wide breadth of selection in

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.660 
fairly wide breadth of selection in
terms<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.270> metal<00:02:09.690> sunglasses<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.560> ask<00:02:11.250> your

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
optician you know what choices they

optician you know what choices they
have<00:02:13.959> what<00:02:14.110> kind<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.349> coverages<00:02:14.920> they<00:02:15.129> have

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
have what kind of coverages they have

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.380 
have what kind of coverages they have
how<00:02:15.610> wrapped<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.180> frame<00:02:16.420> comes<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:18.390> but

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
how wrapped a frame comes in and but

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.940 
how wrapped a frame comes in and but
again<00:02:19.510> these<00:02:19.720> are<00:02:19.870> very<00:02:20.080> adaptable<00:02:20.739> as

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
again these are very adaptable as

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.500 
again these are very adaptable as
opposed<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.519> plastic<00:02:21.760> ones<00:02:22.150> generally

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
opposed to the plastic ones generally

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.750 
opposed to the plastic ones generally
speaking<00:02:22.989> they<00:02:23.140> have<00:02:23.260> longer<00:02:23.680> temples<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:24.700> you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
speaking they have longer temples so you

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.690 
speaking they have longer temples so you
couldn't<00:02:25.060> adjust<00:02:25.390> them<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> little<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:26.049> more

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
couldn't adjust them a little bit more

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.970 
couldn't adjust them a little bit more
so<00:02:27.989> that's<00:02:28.989> really<00:02:29.110> about<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.590> for<00:02:29.769> men's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so that's really about it for men's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.090 
so that's really about it for men's
