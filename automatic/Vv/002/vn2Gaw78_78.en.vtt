damage now this card is special this us
magicians<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:43.690> can<00:00:43.839> actually<00:00:43.960> make<00:00:44.409> cards

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
magicians we can actually make cards

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.140 
magicians we can actually make cards
float<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.670> we<00:00:45.790> can

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
float and we can

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.880 
float and we can
they're<00:00:46.479> simply<00:00:46.720> good<00:00:46.930> dark<00:00:47.229> matter<00:00:47.589> in<00:00:47.860> the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
they're simply good dark matter in the

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.119 
they're simply good dark matter in the
world<00:00:48.159> and<00:00:48.879> we<00:00:49.030> can<00:00:49.210> use<00:00:49.510> it<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:49.960> actually<00:00:50.949> make

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
world and we can use it to actually make

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.549 
world and we can use it to actually make
a<00:00:51.159> card<00:00:51.519> floats<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.030> free<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.869> watch<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.320> cars

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
a card floats in free to watch the cars

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.700 
a card floats in free to watch the cars
it's<00:00:53.860> just<00:00:54.040> going<00:00:54.159> to<00:00:54.220> go<00:00:55.619> like<00:00:56.619> that<00:00:56.769> and<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
it's just going to go like that and and

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's just going to go like that and and
sometimes<00:01:00.250> this<00:01:00.549> isn't<00:01:00.790> what<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.030> first<00:01:01.299> time

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
sometimes this isn't what the first time

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.380 
sometimes this isn't what the first time
so<00:01:01.720> we're<00:01:01.839> just<00:01:01.869> shredding<00:01:02.320> them

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.560 

there<00:01:08.930> we<00:01:09.050> go

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.870 

now<00:01:14.570> yeah<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:15.740> can<00:01:15.950> find<00:01:16.220> it<00:01:16.310> was<00:01:16.430> move<00:01:16.730> I

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
now yeah and we can find it was move I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.600 
now yeah and we can find it was move I
hunt<00:01:17.120> people<00:01:17.720> vanish<00:01:18.110> emissions<00:01:18.560> up<00:01:18.710> to<00:01:19.460> the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
hunt people vanish emissions up to the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.150 
hunt people vanish emissions up to the
generally<00:01:20.030> exciting<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.720> IET<00:01:21.530> check<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:22.070> can

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
generally exciting and IET check you can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.250 
generally exciting and IET check you can
check<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.460> card<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:22.880> anything<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.110> can

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
check the card for anything and you can

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.110 
check the card for anything and you can
also<00:01:24.410> check<00:01:24.770> my<00:01:24.920> hand<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.760> anything

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.440 

well<00:01:29.120> it's<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.600> performance<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.450> the

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
well it's not the performance and the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.420 
well it's not the performance and the
reason<00:01:33.290> why<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.920> am<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:35.890> really<00:01:36.890> enjoyed<00:01:37.160> from

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
reason why I am I really enjoyed from

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.370 
reason why I am I really enjoyed from
this<00:01:37.610> trick<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:37.940> because<00:01:38.120> it's<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.570> simple<00:01:39.050> so

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
this trick is because it's so simple so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.790 
this trick is because it's so simple so
they<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.460> pick<00:01:40.700> any<00:01:41.300> card<00:01:41.570> literally<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.380> say

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
they can pick any card literally so say

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.840 
they can pick any card literally so say
that<00:01:43.009> one<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.640> ace<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:44.000> diamonds<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.650> I<00:01:45.850> wait

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
that one the ace of diamonds and I wait

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.609 
that one the ace of diamonds and I wait
for<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.119> I'm<00:01:47.270> going<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.600> make<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:48.020> rope<00:01:48.320> by

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
for it I'm going to make this rope by

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.460 
for it I'm going to make this rope by
using<00:01:48.979> my<00:01:49.220> spit<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.000> your<00:01:50.330> spit<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:51.080> can<00:01:51.200> lick

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
using my spit so your spit you can lick

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.010 
using my spit so your spit you can lick
your<00:01:51.619> hand<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:52.759> that<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.090> now<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.479> hand<00:01:53.780> is

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
your hand like that so now the hand is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.200 
your hand like that so now the hand is
actually<00:01:54.170> lipped<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:55.490> you're<00:01:55.850> going<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.030> put

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
actually lipped and you're going to put

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.810 
actually lipped and you're going to put
a<00:01:56.360> card<00:01:56.810> any<00:01:57.110> card<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.430> acts<00:01:58.610> just

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
a card any card on it and it acts just

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.060 
a card any card on it and it acts just
like<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.270> blue<00:01:59.720> but<00:01:59.960> it's<00:02:00.050> invisible<00:02:00.680> it's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
like in blue but it's invisible it's

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.940 
like in blue but it's invisible it's
really<00:02:02.060> it's<00:02:02.660> really<00:02:02.750> ceases<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:05.950> sticks

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
really it's really ceases and sticks

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.609 
really it's really ceases and sticks
like<00:02:07.190> that<00:02:08.229> just<00:02:09.229> like<00:02:09.380> that

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
like that just like that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.850 
like that just like that
and<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:10.070> can<00:02:10.220> also<00:02:10.340> find<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.940> no<00:02:11.870> but<00:02:12.380> if<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
and you can also find that no but if you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.190 
and you can also find that no but if you
don't<00:02:13.190> put<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.400> lot<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.700> spit<00:02:14.000> spit<00:02:14.600> on<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.080> it's

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
don't put a lot of spit spit on but it's

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.320 
don't put a lot of spit spit on but it's
just<00:02:15.380> hanging<00:02:15.799> on<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.430> tap<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.880> can<00:02:17.150> do<00:02:17.299> a

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
just hanging on you tap it you can do a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.750 
just hanging on you tap it you can do a
magic<00:02:17.540> thing<00:02:17.870> like<00:02:18.049> I've<00:02:18.560> kept<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:19.310> fingers

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
magic thing like I've kept my fingers

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.940 
magic thing like I've kept my fingers
and<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.239> will<00:02:20.330> just<00:02:20.360> there<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.320> it's<00:02:21.830> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and then it will just there so it's a
