really frustrating and the calls went

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.649 
really frustrating and the calls went
our<00:02:00.979> way<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.190> they<00:02:01.490> didn't<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:02.450> we<00:02:02.539> were

our way and they didn't and we were

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.420 
our way and they didn't and we were
heavily<00:02:02.869> penalized<00:02:03.200> then<00:02:03.649> we<00:02:04.039> just<00:02:04.159> didn't

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
heavily penalized then we just didn't

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.800 
heavily penalized then we just didn't
react<00:02:04.640> what<00:02:05.149> do<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.299> think<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.570> turning

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
react what do you think the turning

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.120 
react what do you think the turning
point<00:02:06.140> was<00:02:06.289> then<00:02:06.909> not<00:02:07.909> really<00:02:08.119> sure<00:02:08.329> um<00:02:08.630> I

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
point was then not really sure um I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.960 
point was then not really sure um I
don't<00:02:10.130> know<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.519> was<00:02:10.579> a<00:02:10.640> turning<00:02:10.850> point

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.650 
don't know if there was a turning point
I<00:02:11.329> I<00:02:11.630> think<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.260> first<00:02:12.860> 25<00:02:13.459> 30<00:02:13.790> minutes<00:02:14.120> in

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I I think that first 25 30 minutes in

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.080 
I I think that first 25 30 minutes in
the<00:02:14.810> first<00:02:15.019> half<00:02:15.200> year<00:02:15.590> perhaps<00:02:16.430> at<00:02:16.760> hynes<00:02:16.940> I

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the first half year perhaps at hynes I

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.670 
the first half year perhaps at hynes I
gave<00:02:17.329> us<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.630> last<00:02:17.810> five<00:02:18.140> minutes<00:02:18.380> ten

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
gave us that last five minutes ten

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.500 
gave us that last five minutes ten
minutes<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.190> they're<00:02:19.340> 22<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.209> keep<00:02:20.359> them

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
minutes and they're 22 just to keep them

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.060 
minutes and they're 22 just to keep them
down<00:02:20.660> there<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:20.989> apart<00:02:21.739> from<00:02:21.829> the<00:02:22.040> obvious

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
down there and apart from the obvious

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.349 
down there and apart from the obvious
what<00:02:22.579> was<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.760> highlight<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.329> game

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359

what was the highlight of the game

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
girls and you know and just the the

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.560 
girls and you know and just the the
fords<00:02:31.160> knew<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.430> had<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.579> step<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.420> kick

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
fords knew we had to step up in and kick

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.420 
fords knew we had to step up in and kick
that<00:02:32.750> ballin<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.410> retain<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.340> we

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that ballin and retain it so that we

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.910 
that ballin and retain it so that we
could<00:02:34.609> we<00:02:34.790> could<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.090> shot<00:02:35.359> and<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:36.230> think

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
could we could have a shot and I think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.440 
could we could have a shot and I think
they<00:02:37.040> really<00:02:37.519> did<00:02:37.730> just<00:02:38.000> battle<00:02:38.329> up<00:02:38.420> front

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
they really did just battle up front

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.599 
they really did just battle up front
with<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.019> with<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.590> English<00:02:39.890> packing<00:02:40.400> and

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
with the with the English packing and

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.610 
with the with the English packing and
then<00:02:40.640> our<00:02:41.209> backline<00:02:41.870> they<00:02:42.079> might<00:02:42.260> not<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.410> big

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
then our backline they might not be big

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.050 
then our backline they might not be big
but<00:02:42.859> they<00:02:43.010> certainly<00:02:43.250> stop<00:02:43.670> some<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
but they certainly stop some of the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.699 
but they certainly stop some of the
English<00:02:44.299> players<00:02:44.540> running<00:02:44.750> at<00:02:44.900> them<00:02:45.019> well<00:02:45.620> we

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:50.419 
ah the whole time yeah it was pretty

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.649 
ah the whole time yeah it was pretty
tense<00:03:51.370> very<00:03:52.370> frustrating<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.150> be<00:03:53.180> honest<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
tense very frustrating to be honest I

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.949 
tense very frustrating to be honest I
felt<00:03:53.989> we<00:03:54.230> were<00:03:54.849> quite<00:03:55.849> dominant<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.389> times<00:03:56.419> and

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
felt we were quite dominant at times and

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.539 
felt we were quite dominant at times and
just<00:03:57.169> couldn't<00:03:57.379> I<00:03:57.680> mean<00:03:58.129> we<00:03:58.219> just<00:03:58.430> get

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
just couldn't I mean we just get

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.309 
just couldn't I mean we just get
penalized<00:03:58.939> or<00:03:59.299> sumthin<00:03:59.629> to<00:03:59.750> whatever<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:00.169> that

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
penalized or sumthin to whatever so that

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.720 
penalized or sumthin to whatever so that
was<00:04:00.409> really<00:04:00.439> hard<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.159> get<00:04:01.280> any<00:04:01.459> momentum

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
was really hard to get any momentum

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.970 
was really hard to get any momentum
going<00:04:02.269> but<00:04:02.419> I<00:04:02.750> did<00:04:03.349> think<00:04:03.379> we<00:04:03.680> were<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.799> better

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
going but I did think we were the better

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.190 
going but I did think we were the better
team<00:04:04.069> and<00:04:04.969> what<00:04:05.659> we<00:04:05.689> said<00:04:05.959> at<00:04:06.079> halftime

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
team and what we said at halftime

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.809 
team and what we said at halftime
because<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:06.799> girl<00:04:06.950> seemed<00:04:07.219> to<00:04:07.310> come<00:04:07.400> back<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.639> lot

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
because a girl seemed to come back a lot

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.670 
because a girl seemed to come back a lot
stronger<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.389> second<00:04:08.659> half<00:04:08.840> yeah<00:04:09.349> just<00:04:09.530> we

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
stronger in the second half yeah just we

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.170 
stronger in the second half yeah just we
just<00:04:09.859> keep<00:04:10.099> doing<00:04:10.340> what<00:04:10.370> we're<00:04:10.549> doing<00:04:10.579> we<00:04:10.909> felt

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
just keep doing what we're doing we felt

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.030 
just keep doing what we're doing we felt
funny<00:04:11.989> enough<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.530> probably<00:04:12.680> had<00:04:12.919> them

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
funny enough that we probably had them

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.649 
funny enough that we probably had them
up<00:04:13.159> front<00:04:13.400> keep<00:04:13.699> yarn<00:04:13.940> at<00:04:14.090> them<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.359> garnet

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
up front keep yarn at them and garnet

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.149 
up front keep yarn at them and garnet
them<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:14.959> then<00:04:15.049> just<00:04:15.229> wait<00:04:15.379> for<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.680> time<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
them and then just wait for the time to

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.759 
them and then just wait for the time to
come<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.340> strike<00:04:16.760> but<00:04:17.470> couldn't<00:04:18.470> quite<00:04:18.590> get

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
come and strike but couldn't quite get

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.170 
come and strike but couldn't quite get
it<00:04:18.829> together<00:04:18.979> what<00:04:19.820> do<00:04:19.909> you<00:04:19.940> think<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
it together what do you think the

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.990 
it together what do you think the
turning<00:04:20.359> point<00:04:20.720> was<00:04:20.870> then<00:04:21.199> I<00:04:21.820> thinking<00:04:22.820> that

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
turning point was then I thinking that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.939 
turning point was then I thinking that
Troy<00:04:23.210> when<00:04:23.449> we<00:04:23.479> were<00:04:23.659> 13<00:04:23.990> players<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:24.889> the

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
Troy when we were 13 players in the

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.120 
Troy when we were 13 players in the
field<00:04:25.039> was<00:04:25.250> useful<00:04:26.139> yeah<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.169> met<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:28.010> the
