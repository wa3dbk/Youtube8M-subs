00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the concealer again bigger than I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.740 
the concealer again bigger than I
thought<00:01:19.170> um<00:01:20.210> but<00:01:21.210> great<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:23.450> color<00:01:24.450> palette

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
thought um but great the color palette

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660 
thought um but great the color palette
that<00:01:25.020> you've<00:01:25.170> probably<00:01:25.350> seen<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.890> ads<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that you've probably seen on the ads so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
that you've probably seen on the ads so
that's<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.049> didn't<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that's that some people didn't get the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.020 
that's that some people didn't get the
mirror<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.009> tough<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> was<00:01:29.759> fortunate

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
mirror and tough but I was fortunate

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.530 
mirror and tough but I was fortunate
enough<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.509> get<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
enough to get it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
enough to get it
the<00:01:33.110> base<00:01:33.410> graphic<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.370> the<00:01:35.150> two<00:01:35.540> brushes<00:01:35.900> and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
the base graphic to the two brushes and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.240 
the base graphic to the two brushes and
being<00:01:37.010> scared<00:01:37.520> i'm<00:01:37.820> scared<00:01:37.850> i<00:01:38.390> think<00:01:39.250> more

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
being scared i'm scared i think more

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.370 
being scared i'm scared i think more
like<00:01:40.430> great<00:01:40.730> on<00:01:40.910> me<00:01:41.060> because<00:01:41.240> I'm<00:01:41.750> really

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
like great on me because I'm really

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.680 
like great on me because I'm really
loyal<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.310> false<00:01:43.550> lash<00:01:43.790> effect<00:01:43.940> board<00:01:44.510> and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
loyal to the false lash effect board and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.820 
loyal to the false lash effect board and
I<00:01:44.780> think<00:01:45.050> this<00:01:45.170> will<00:01:45.290> probably<00:01:45.500> do<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.800> same

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
I think this will probably do the same

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.440 
I think this will probably do the same
so<00:01:46.700> that's<00:01:46.880> what<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> brush<00:01:47.450> looks<00:01:47.780> like

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
so that's what the brush looks like

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.560 
so that's what the brush looks like
right

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.210
