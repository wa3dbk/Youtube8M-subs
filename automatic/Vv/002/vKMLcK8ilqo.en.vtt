I'll here we go okay so now that you're
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.320> nether<00:00:52.530> you're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> want<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in the nether you're going to want to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.479 
in the nether you're going to want to
avoid<00:00:53.489> lava<00:00:53.820> quite<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> lot<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.949> well<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
avoid lava quite a lot because well it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.110 
avoid lava quite a lot because well it
kills<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.000> obviously<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> I'm<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:59.609> easiest

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
kills you obviously and I'm the easiest

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
way to make a house is basically to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
way to make a house is basically to
bunker<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> want<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.049> bring<00:01:04.140> torches

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bunker in if you want to bring torches

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
bunker in if you want to bring torches
that's<00:01:04.949> perfectly<00:01:05.640> fine<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.119> because

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's perfectly fine but because

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
that's perfectly fine but because
there's<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.720> much<00:01:06.840> lava<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.890> usually<00:01:08.070> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
there's so much lava you usually just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.330 
there's so much lava you usually just
leave<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.180> window<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:09.810> and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.210 
on no lamps yeah it's really awesome and
there's<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.019> much<00:04:03.170> lover<00:04:03.470> in<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.680> nether<00:04:03.950> and

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
there's so much lover in the nether and

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.059 
there's so much lover in the nether and
I<00:04:04.489> think<00:04:04.790> that's<00:04:04.940> why<00:04:05.120> it's<00:04:05.269> so<00:04:05.450> lucky<00:04:05.840> because

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
I think that's why it's so lucky because

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.590 
I think that's why it's so lucky because
lava<00:04:07.069> moves<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.819> has<00:04:07.970> like<00:04:08.239> different

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
lava moves and has like different

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.840 
lava moves and has like different
textures<00:04:09.049> see<00:04:09.290> went<00:04:09.920> bright<00:04:10.160> yellow<00:04:10.459> back<00:04:10.730> to

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
textures see went bright yellow back to

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.770 
textures see went bright yellow back to
orange<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.829> reddish<00:04:12.829> than<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.310> yellow<00:04:13.780> it's

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
orange to reddish than to yellow it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.380 
orange to reddish than to yellow it's
like<00:04:14.959> must<00:04:15.590> create<00:04:15.859> a<00:04:15.950> lot<00:04:16.130> of<00:04:16.160> lag<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.700> I'm

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
like must create a lot of lag and I'm

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.120 
like must create a lot of lag and I'm
while<00:04:17.659> you're<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.959> nether<00:04:18.229> you<00:04:18.830> might<00:04:19.010> as

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
while you're in the nether you might as

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.400 
while you're in the nether you might as
well<00:04:19.190> make<00:04:19.430> sure<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.820> collect<00:04:19.970> as<00:04:20.299> much

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
well make sure to collect as much
