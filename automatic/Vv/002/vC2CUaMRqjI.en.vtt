 for tight fastening of parts 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.579
 inserted in the clamp for 45 minutes exactly on 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.109
 the time required for firmware 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.109
 just one shield 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.970
 after cutting off excess work 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:29.750
 cover the polyurethane skin flap this 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.970
 called overlay last layer for 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.490
 This uses a line consisting of
