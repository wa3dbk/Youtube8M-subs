00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 tour of the best applications for 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.949

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 available for android that you are 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.269
 watching a video game right now 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.350
 pretty cool we have to dodge 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.910
 all the zombies that go to us 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.559
 appearing at our pace for the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.390
 I'm stuck and we have to go 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 taking the wires our little things that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.780
 me avanta combination that kills me good 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 this sense the truth is that we have 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 that go dodging the different ones I do not know if 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.450
 we go normal or we kill them they are going 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.950
 to eat at us good let's do 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.300
 another part and it's always in quick to 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.980
 that you see how the video game works 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.570
 really because there are objects by the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.550
 path that we have to go catching the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.289
 trunks usually give us weapons as you are 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.850
 seeing we can move to the right to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.140
 the left if we press in the middle 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.539
 we shoot we are going to kill that tome 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 frampton has died annihilated and good 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.210
 let's see why we also 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.950
 we found another series of objects that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.420
 they are going to give us coins for example this 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.979
 It is full of comics and they are not happening 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.390
 nothing to another dead come let's see that 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.020
 do not look here for example this here 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 we have it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.409
 also because as you can see they are going to give us 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.869
 dots coins and all these things that 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.179
 they will help us to take improvements and 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.009
 They go further in this great game 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.679
 I recommend it and continue because I 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.719
 they kill good guys and girls halloween 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.520

 we have a series of objects that we can 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.209
 go catching to disguise us to 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.369

 that we also have some more options 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.160
 here below the padlock are for payment of 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.080

 good time at halloween and we continue to 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 what piece of video game I have 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.250
 prepared zombie putt available for 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.050
 it is universal and also available 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.400
 for android good the truth is that it is 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.230
 a video game that I already recommended in the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.700
 gone but so long ago and you are 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.080
 So many of you are not saying that 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.120
 I recommend this application and I've already 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.680
 recommended that I like to repeat 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.760
 the good applications and more now that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.170
 we are in halloween 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.580
 let's continue the game so that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.959
 You see how it is played but before you leave me 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.700
 let me tell you that we have a way 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.830
 multiplayer where we can challenge to 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.560
 our friends to play online we go 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.030
 to give it to continue let's give this 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.010
 mission for example so that you see a 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 little bit how to play but it 's a 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.060
 kill zombies seen from above in 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.040
 isometric perspective in which to 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.239
 it makes me a delight to play this 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 videogame the truth is that the graphics 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.800
 They are very bright this time 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.450
 we have to defend these balls of 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.580
 ice cream that we have here in half balls 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.140
 of toys or cakes or doubles is not what 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.280
 which is because to notice that the purest 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.500
 ' call of duty style 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.180
 and a lot of zombies are going to appear 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.910
 for these barriers we have to go 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.870
 annihilating look here we have with mid 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.310
 we shoot we shoot 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.500
 we can guide where we 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.940
 we shoot perfect annihilated here we 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.640
 are appearing more let's kill them 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.590
 there are an infinite number of levels and 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.510
 different difficulties the truth is that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.340
 we can play static maps like 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.770
 we are locked in a square 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.420
 or we can play maps pretty 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.220
 more open where we have to move 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.440
 freely by the map to go looking 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.690
 to the enemy combis and it's going to kill 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.150
 them before they end up 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.440
 course with us in this game 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.660
 just as I tell you we have to 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.580
 to be able to do these two and in the middle 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.380
 truth is that it is super super addictive since 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.820
 we have passed it, not good, it's the same 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.000
 I continue to play and you continue 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.860
 watching the free ones until then 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.600
 well for all those who do not 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.370
 like halloween because this video is going to 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.359
 be pretty dedicated to halloween I'm going 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.670
 to recommend an application of 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.140
 pretty normal photography and for 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.970
 true if you're liking the video 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.650
 support us with your like we will thank you 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.210
 very much all the guys from the team 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.100
 aysÃ©n a couch bueno is an application of 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.140
 photography we can take a picture with 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.730
 a photo of the chopped reel that when 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.290
 let's finish we can share for all 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.790
 these social networks the photography that 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.200
 we are editing when we have the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.030
 photography we have taken it to the reel or 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.620
 we have done it and we can apply a 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.490
 series of pretty cool filters like 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.770
 you are seeing here simply 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.260
 we play the one we like the most and it goes to 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.110
 apply that filter we have filters 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.940
 artistic hdr we have white filters 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.800
 and contrast black to note that these 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.240
 they are the most artistic plan there are some 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.610
 which are in plan to convert a 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.140
 photograph in a drawing plus one thing 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.669
 a lot of latex here we can adjust 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.740
 all levels as you are seeing 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.530
 we adjust the radius here but that we are 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.300
 adjusting stress not force and by 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.370
 here we are going to adjust the soft the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.200
 smoothness of the smooth end good let's go to 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.880
 see what we can adjust all all 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.160
 parameters of the filters that we are 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.360
 applying we can apply profits as 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.010
 you are seeing good that is not more than 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.790
 put a mask on top for example 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.710
 is here 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.480
 to give it a touch more and quite like 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.220
 old and good photograph here we have 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.990
 also the ink being that we can 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.030
 apply it so you can see a little bit the 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.230
 objective is another filter plus it is a 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.150
 application of filters but they have 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.440
 Recommended loads of filters you the 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.040
 I recommend to all of you and 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.150
 we continue with the special halloween 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.520
 Well, let's talk about zombie 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.740
 zombie zombie if they were not enough 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.270
 zombies is that halloween already plays there is no 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.190
 miedito to go there to dress and 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.930
 having a good night of 31 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.520
 october to celebrate halloween good 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.350
 I will recommend a video game this is 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.850
 the intro let's have a super super 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.200
 addictive also zombies but this 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.700
 time those who are going to be scared I think that 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.680
 it's the zombies we're going to see a little bit 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.510
 how the truth is played is that it is super 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.920
 addictive pretty simple graphics the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.630
 true video you play or to the divided by 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.700
 different missions we are going to play this 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.280
 mission here but the gameplay is me 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.230
 Amazing appetite is super addictive 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.730
 superchulo I loved these are 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.050
 three characters and so we have to 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.060
 annihilate zombies but how are we going to 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.410
 do making geometric figures in 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.660
 this case we are going to make triangles 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.550
 we touch one we touch another one we touch 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.510
 another we form the triangle and all the 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.270
 in between are automatically left 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.860
 destroyed see that this is the 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.390
 video game besides tell you face are 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.740
 appearing all in green 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.840
 soon they will be appearing 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.100
 also in other colors with which 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.590
 will also do much more 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.820
 complicated to annihilate them all to fix 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.400
 that we have to be very careful 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.230
 because if we leave a color out there 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.390
 we are not going to really go through badly because 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.160
 we will be able to annihilate the mother herself 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.840
 We're not going to have a bad time because I'm just 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.190
 there is a white one but if another one arrives 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.110
 green at least if we make a 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.910
 perfect triangle and we encourage them to 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.860
 all a strategy videogame has 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.870
 I liked it enough I wanted to recommend it and 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.550
 a second good wave well here we go 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.530
 to finish the tour today I hope that you 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.240
 I liked that you have a very good 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.550
 Halloween night have a good exit 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.870
 home do not be bored like me and nothing 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.580
 See you in a next video 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.580
 have a great time until goodbye soon
