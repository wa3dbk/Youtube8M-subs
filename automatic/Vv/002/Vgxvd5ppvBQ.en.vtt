 very well and welcome to a new 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.250
 tutorial video of tecno tüttös pc and 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.080
 good first of all if you did not know my 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.510
 I invite you to channel you know it around 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.180
 by checking my videos if you like them 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.220
 subscribe you give me a like and I 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.920
 leave a comment about what you 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.039
 they look like videos and good as they can 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.050
 see in the title on this occasion we will see 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.460
 how to take a picture of a part 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.860
 specifically from our computer 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.870
 for this we are going to occupy a tool 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.910
 that is called cuts and that fortunately 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.550
 of all comes pre-installed in what is 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.739
 windows 8 and windows 7 so they will not have 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.989
 that downloading it is a tool that 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.820
 will be very useful because for example many 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.340
 Sometimes we want to take a picture of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 something that we have on the computer and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.149
 for most people what 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.850
 they do is press the print key 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.489
 screen but with this it simply comes out 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.809
 all your screen however with this 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.300
 tool you can take a 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.340
 photograph to something specific that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.200
 you want to highlight or something you want 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.240
 take a picture 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.240
 I do not bore you anymore let's start 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.400
 well the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.440
 write cuts this way we're going to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.150
 open the application as you can see it is 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.220
 a very simple application is already coming 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.710
 pre-installed in what is windows 8 and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 windows 7 now what I'm going to do is 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.710
 show them how it works for this I can 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.270
 put this example simply if 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.370
 they want to take the photograph they will have to 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.010
 where it says new and now it's going to put 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.010
 a little gray your screen you're going to 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.500
 select with one click and drag the 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.660
 mouse to the only part you want to take 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.600
 the photograph and suppose that I want 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.240
 simply take this part once 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.370
 we already have the option or the part secure 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.800
 we want to take a picture we 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.540
 to release the click and it will leave us 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.160
 automatically photograph now 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.350
 we can see that we have added three 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.900
 options one that is pencil that serves 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.810
 just to mark with a pencil 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.070
 virtual what is an area for example 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.620
 let's say I want to make an arrow 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.500
 here 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.319
 well imagine that this is an arrow 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.180
 now I'll delete this and Well 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.409
 basically we can choose a pencil 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.150
 personalized 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.730
 a black pencil or a colored pencil 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.319
 blue now if we go to this part 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.450
 we can see that it's like a brand type 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.700
 texts to highlight any area 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.069
 suppose I want to highlight this 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.750
 folder or these two folders for that 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.900
 we simply have to select what 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.629
 what is this part and can you see that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.099
 highlighting what is the parts of 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.459
 down then it is a very tool 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.859
 useful for all those who want 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.940
 so take a picture to a part in 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.440
 specific 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.299
 now if we give here is for 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.519
 copy the image we can paste now 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.319
 wherever we want without needing 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.629
 save it as you can see it is a 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.200
 very very simple tool here 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.270
 we have 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.980
 Well basically the same thing that we have 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.080
 down here in tools in 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.760
 contradiction can copy is really 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.760
 these tools are these that we have 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.430
 here but with what the text is not 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.370
 the file so we can save it or 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.410
 make a new cut to save them and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.060
 it's very simple they 're going to have four 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.430
 options but to save it they will give 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.440
 click here as you can see now if what 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.500
 I commented that the four options 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.510
 first is called png file that good 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.940
 It is a high quality file type 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.489
 but that is a bit heavier than what 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 conventional now a gif file that 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.510
 it serves then to give animations 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.090
 later to the image if it is that 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.720
 you know a little about this how to do 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.690
 animations gif jpg file which is the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.120
 regular format the classic format that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.519
 it is much less heavy than the png file 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.640
 but that also has a lower quality 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.500
 and html which is for web pages 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.299
 suppose I want the code to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 insert it automatically on my website 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.530
 Well here you can also save it from 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.630
 this way in this case I want it in 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.500
 png because I'm interested in good quality 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.060
 we go 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.010
 in a folder where we go to 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.290
 save and we're going to give it a name in 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.720
 this case to call test let's see 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.570
 where to store and how can you see here 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.930
 has already appeared I'm going to close this and I'm going 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.970
 to open it and here I already have the file 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.470
 what I have taken pictures of, I hope 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.210
 I liked the video 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.430
 worked yes that this tool already the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.680
 they knew many people but I also know 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.990
 that many newbies who did not know her and 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.490
 that will be very useful and good 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.280
 see you in a next video tutorial 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.280
 of techno all pc until next time
