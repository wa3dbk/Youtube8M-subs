think really a part of looking younger

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.660 
think really a part of looking younger
and<00:00:44.640> more<00:00:44.969> youthful<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.649> having<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:47.070> youthful

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and more youthful is having a youthful

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
and more youthful is having a youthful
glow<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.059> skin<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.539> comes<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:48.870> the

inside<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.579> feel<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> only<00:00:51.390> way

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
inside out and I feel like the only way

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
inside out and I feel like the only way
to<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.649> fake<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.890> with<00:00:53.129> makeup

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to get that you can fake it with makeup

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.119 
to get that you can fake it with makeup
but<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.050> you<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.079> you're<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.530> always<00:00:55.829> going

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
to wear a ton of makeup there's some

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.729 
to wear a ton of makeup there's some
days<00:00:57.600> where<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:57.899> don't<00:00:58.289> put<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.530> any

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
days where you just don't put on any

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
days where you just don't put on any
makeup<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.149> still<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.510> your

you get that from

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.560 
you get that from
maybe<00:01:06.360> diet<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.900> exercise<00:01:07.580> so<00:01:08.580> anyway<00:01:09.330> while
