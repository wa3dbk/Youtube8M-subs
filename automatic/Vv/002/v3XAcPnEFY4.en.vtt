00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:12.390
 what I will tell you seems absurd but 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.390
 you must listen to me 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.059
 but this depends on your lives 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960
 see it's not the first time 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.699
 that we make this conversation that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.989
 day is the day of judgment six 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.989
 just arrived with new recruits 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 s 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.070
 the invasion will fail like the soldiers who 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.070
 you're sending everything down 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.510
 when you wake up, come and find me 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 you know what 's happening to me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.640
 it happens to the tea it happened to me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.079
 absorbed their power 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.260
 you have to help her do what exactly 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.600
 win the war 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.110
 we can make it come here every day e 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.110
 theater 3 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.550
 whatever I do you don't go 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.720
 over 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.720
 because you should care less 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.520
 I'm not a soldier 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.800
 of course you are not a weapon
