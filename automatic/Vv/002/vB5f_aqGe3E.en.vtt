all the major scales all three forms of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.440 
all the major scales all three forms of
the<00:01:59.980> minor<00:02:00.220> scales<00:02:00.610> diminished<00:02:01.030> scales<00:02:01.270> and

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
the minor scales diminished scales and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.210 
the minor scales diminished scales and

versions and why is it a great book

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.249 
versions and why is it a great book
because<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.340> does<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.090> has<00:02:07.660> a<00:02:07.690> whole<00:02:07.990> page

because it does like it has a whole page

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.130 
because it does like it has a whole page
of<00:02:08.440> justice<00:02:08.830> e<00:02:08.979> scale<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.000> does<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.239> C<00:02:10.539> scale<00:02:10.810> C

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
of justice e scale so does a C scale C

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.589 
of justice e scale so does a C scale C
to<00:02:11.290> C<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.129> it<00:02:12.220> does<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> C<00:02:12.700> scale<00:02:13.030> starting<00:02:13.480> on

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
to C then it does a C scale starting on

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.630 
to C then it does a C scale starting on
D<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.470> see<00:02:14.739> skill<00:02:15.069> started<00:02:15.489> on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
D and then you see skill started on

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.479 
D and then you see skill started on
beating<00:02:15.910> C<00:02:16.269> scale<00:02:16.569> starting<00:02:16.989> on<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.440> etc<00:02:18.129> all

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
beating C scale starting on now etc all

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.009 
beating C scale starting on now etc all
the<00:02:18.700> way<00:02:18.730> through<00:02:19.150> all<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.510> notes<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.900> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
the way through all the notes of the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.140 
the way through all the notes of the
scale<00:02:20.160> you're<00:02:21.160> thinking<00:02:21.519> well<00:02:21.670> why<00:02:21.879> is<00:02:21.939> that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
scale you're thinking well why is that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.510 
scale you're thinking well why is that
so<00:02:22.540> important<00:02:23.079> well<00:02:23.739> as<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.310> know<00:02:25.109> starting<00:02:26.109> on

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
so important well as we know starting on

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.490 
so important well as we know starting on
Gail<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.390> know<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.570> get<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.960> down<00:02:28.140> where<00:02:28.410> it's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
Gail you know you get it down where it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.990 
Gail you know you get it down where it's
not<00:02:28.650> hard<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.070> what<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.340> you<00:02:29.460> start<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.850> that

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
not hard but what if you start on that

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.970 
not hard but what if you start on that
same<00:02:30.210> scale<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.140> second<00:02:31.560> or<00:02:31.680> third<00:02:31.710> or

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
same scale but on the second or third or

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.350 
same scale but on the second or third or
fourth<00:02:32.220> scale<00:02:32.430> degree<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.970> can't<00:02:33.150> play

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
fourth scale degree and you can't play

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.240 
fourth scale degree and you can't play
the<00:02:33.510> piece<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> music<00:02:33.960> all<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> sudden<00:02:35.100> has<00:02:35.220> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
the piece of music all of a sudden has a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.820 
the piece of music all of a sudden has a
different<00:02:35.640> feel<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.990> particularly

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
different feel to it and particularly

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.170 
different feel to it and particularly
with<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> young<00:02:38.100> influence<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.880> really

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
with the young influence I can really

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.970 
with the young influence I can really
put<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> bump<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.840> their<00:02:39.960> technique<00:02:40.500> because

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
put a bump in their technique because

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
put a bump in their technique because
they're<00:02:41.130> not<00:02:41.250> used<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.480> what

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
they're not used to that and so what

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.690 
they're not used to that and so what
makes<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.990> scale<00:02:43.290> book<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.710> unique<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.340> like

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
makes a scale book so unique that I like

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.720 
makes a scale book so unique that I like
is<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:46.050> forcing<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.860> practice<00:02:47.490> all

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
is that it's forcing you to practice all

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.250 
is that it's forcing you to practice all
these<00:02:47.880> scales<00:02:48.240> starting<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.930> different

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
these scales starting on the different

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.470 
these scales starting on the different
scale<00:02:49.500> degrees<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.370> scale<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.970> of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
scale degrees of that scale and of

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.060 
scale degrees of that scale and of
course<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.840> always<00:02:51.990> do<00:02:52.230> with<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> metric<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
course you always do with the metric and

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.790 
course you always do with the metric and
then<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.300> arpeggio<00:02:54.630> notes<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> same<00:02:55.530> way

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
then the arpeggio notes are the same way

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.090 
then the arpeggio notes are the same way
you<00:02:56.460> have<00:02:56.490> major<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.840> have<00:02:58.050> minor<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.920> have

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you have major you have minor you have

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.340 
you have major you have minor you have
diminish<00:02:59.550> you<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.180> augment<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.110> later

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
diminish you have augment and then later

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660 
diminish you have augment and then later
in<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.530> book<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.890> even<00:03:02.100> goes<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.550> the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
in the book it even goes up to the

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.140 
in the book it even goes up to the
seventh<00:03:03.500> later<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.770> jazz<00:03:05.040> studies<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.760> even<00:03:06.000> had

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
seventh later my jazz studies I even had

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.750 
seventh later my jazz studies I even had
to<00:03:06.240> go<00:03:06.360> through<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.660> 9th<00:03:06.870> 1113<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.640> whole

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
to go through the 9th 1113 so the whole

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.220 
to go through the 9th 1113 so the whole
point<00:03:09.000> again<00:03:09.330> by<00:03:09.480> doing<00:03:09.540> all<00:03:09.900> these<00:03:10.020> different

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
point again by doing all these different

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.560 
point again by doing all these different
versions<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.100> see<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.550> really<00:03:11.820> covers<00:03:12.060> again

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
versions you see it really covers again

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.000 
versions you see it really covers again
and<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.320> things<00:03:13.560> you're<00:03:13.740> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> see

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
actually what makes it work well it

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
actually what makes it work well it
actually<00:03:33.090> covers<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:34.050> in<00:03:34.290> different

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
actually covers it in different

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
actually covers it in different
intervals<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.810> great<00:03:36.990> book<00:03:37.820> I

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
intervals so it's really a great book I

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.610 
intervals so it's really a great book I
would<00:03:39.270> always<00:03:39.420> practice<00:03:40.050> scales<00:03:40.350> with<00:03:40.590> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
would always practice scales with a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.830 
would always practice scales with a
metronome<00:03:41.100> if<00:03:41.490> you're<00:03:41.820> if<00:03:42.120> you're<00:03:42.150> student

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
metronome if you're if you're student

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.720 
metronome if you're if you're student
that<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.110> working<00:03:43.290> with<00:03:43.530> can't<00:03:44.250> play<00:03:44.520> them

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
that you're working with can't play them

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.940 
that you're working with can't play them
to<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> metronome<00:03:45.360> chances<00:03:46.320> are<00:03:46.530> they're<00:03:46.770> never

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
to a metronome chances are they're never

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.510 
to a metronome chances are they're never
going<00:03:47.250> slow<00:03:48.030> enough<00:03:48.410> I've<00:03:49.410> had<00:03:49.680> them<00:03:49.830> going<00:03:50.010> 60

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
going slow enough I've had them going 60

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.710 
going slow enough I've had them going 60
beats<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.060> quarter<00:03:51.420> note<00:03:51.600> da<00:03:52.850> da<00:03:53.850> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
beats to the quarter note da da the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.360 
beats to the quarter note da da the
whole<00:03:54.900> point<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.380> they<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:55.980> learn<00:03:56.160> how<00:03:56.340> to

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
whole point is they have to learn how to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.790 
whole point is they have to learn how to
follow<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.940> metronome<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.410> they<00:03:58.560> do<00:03:58.680> it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
follow the metronome and if they do it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.770 
follow the metronome and if they do it
once<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.100> twice<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.580> quit<00:03:59.850> well<00:04:00.150> that's<00:04:00.570> not

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
once or twice and quit well that's not

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.090 
once or twice and quit well that's not
going<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.990> happen<00:04:01.200> they've<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.740> to<00:04:01.860> stick

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
going to happen they've got to stick

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.030 
going to happen they've got to stick
with<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.570> find<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.959> temple<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.590> get

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
with it so you find a temple you get

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.320 
with it so you find a temple you get
where<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:05.280> complain<00:04:05.580> these<00:04:05.790> things<00:04:06.060> at<00:04:06.300> a

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
where they complain these things at a

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.260 
where they complain these things at a
temple<00:04:06.810> if<00:04:07.020> they<00:04:07.440> gradually<00:04:08.070> slowly<00:04:08.790> but

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
temple if they gradually slowly but

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.720 
temple if they gradually slowly but
surely<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.959> work<00:04:10.230> them<00:04:10.500> up<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:11.220> eventually

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
surely you work them up to eventually

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.830 
surely you work them up to eventually
get<00:04:11.910> them<00:04:12.030> up<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.270> 120<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.580> have<00:04:14.660> six<00:04:15.660> and

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
get them up to 120 I have six and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180 
get them up to 120 I have six and
seventh<00:04:16.169> grade<00:04:16.350> fluent<00:04:16.709> students<00:04:17.070> I've

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
seventh grade fluent students I've

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.640 
seventh grade fluent students I've
started<00:04:17.549> in<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.940> fifth<00:04:18.150> grade<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.720> by<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
started in a fifth grade and by the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.740 
started in a fifth grade and by the
sixth<00:04:20.220> or<00:04:20.280> seventh<00:04:20.669> grade<00:04:20.730> I've<00:04:21.120> got<00:04:21.419> him<00:04:21.570> in<00:04:21.660> a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
sixth or seventh grade I've got him in a

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.750 
sixth or seventh grade I've got him in a
fabrica<00:04:22.230> flute<00:04:22.470> plant<00:04:22.710> I've<00:04:22.919> got<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> ninja<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
fabrica flute plant I've got a ninja and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.790 
fabrica flute plant I've got a ninja and
what<00:04:24.330> we<00:04:24.450> do<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.690> take<00:04:25.110> them<00:04:25.260> through<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.500> book

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
what we do I take them through the book

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.909 
what we do I take them through the book
the<00:04:25.950> first<00:04:26.190> time<00:04:26.490> just<00:04:26.850> to<00:04:27.060> learn<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.450> scales

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
the first time just to learn the scales

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.250 
the first time just to learn the scales
just<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:29.160> learn<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.669> then<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> second<00:04:30.750> time<00:04:30.960> I

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
just to learn and then the second time I

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.500 
just to learn and then the second time I
get<00:04:31.560> them<00:04:31.710> through<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.070> book<00:04:32.310> at<00:04:32.520> some<00:04:33.180> kind

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
get them through the book at some kind

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.409 
get them through the book at some kind
of<00:04:33.690> temple<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.729> then<00:04:35.729> we<00:04:35.850> go<00:04:36.000> through<00:04:36.300> the

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
of temple and then we go through the

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.230 
of temple and then we go through the
book<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.720> third

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
book of third

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.200 
book of third
and<00:04:37.660> then<00:04:38.380> we<00:04:38.590> start<00:04:38.889> cranking<00:04:39.430> up<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.759> tempo

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
and then we start cranking up to tempo

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.499 
and then we start cranking up to tempo
and<00:04:41.190> by<00:04:42.190> then<00:04:42.460> this<00:04:42.639> is<00:04:42.819> from<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> seventh

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
and by then this is from the seventh

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.180 
and by then this is from the seventh
eighth<00:04:43.660> ninth<00:04:44.050> grade<00:04:44.380> and<00:04:44.560> usually<00:04:44.919> by<00:04:45.130> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
eighth ninth grade and usually by the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.309 
eighth ninth grade and usually by the
ninth<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.729> tenth<00:04:46.000> grade<00:04:46.360> I've<00:04:46.780> got<00:04:47.050> them<00:04:47.199> up<00:04:47.289> to

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
ninth of tenth grade I've got them up to

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.909 
ninth of tenth grade I've got them up to
120<00:04:48.130> 126<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.930> takes<00:04:50.139> them<00:04:50.319> a<00:04:50.380> couple<00:04:50.410> years

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
120 126 so it takes them a couple years

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.480 
120 126 so it takes them a couple years
but<00:04:51.699> then<00:04:51.940> what<00:04:52.210> happens<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.780> develop<00:04:53.199> this

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
but then what happens I develop this

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.600 
but then what happens I develop this
rock-solid<00:04:54.630> technique<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:56.160> it's<00:04:57.160> just<00:04:57.370> it's

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
rock-solid technique and it's just it's

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.390 
rock-solid technique and it's just it's
just<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.990> just<00:04:59.050> incredible<00:04:59.770> now<00:04:59.949> as<00:05:00.160> you

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
just it's just incredible now as you

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.820 
just it's just incredible now as you
work<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:00.819> these<00:05:00.970> scales<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.630> our<00:05:01.720> panels<00:05:02.229> make

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
work on these scales and our panels make

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.469 
work on these scales and our panels make
sure<00:05:03.069> you<00:05:03.340> don't<00:05:03.550> move<00:05:03.669> harder<00:05:04.120> in<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.330> high

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
sure you don't move harder in the high

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.480 
sure you don't move harder in the high
range<00:05:04.810> we're<00:05:05.259> not<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> trumpet<00:05:06.039> we<00:05:06.160> don't<00:05:06.340> have

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
range we're not a trumpet we don't have

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.029 
range we're not a trumpet we don't have
to<00:05:06.639> do<00:05:06.789> that<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.270> flourish<00:05:08.020> use<00:05:08.319> your<00:05:08.530> officer

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
to do that a flourish use your officer

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.499 
to do that a flourish use your officer
you<00:05:09.190> should<00:05:09.400> be<00:05:09.490> able<00:05:09.550> in<00:05:09.729> fact<00:05:09.940> you<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:10.300> even

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
you should be able in fact you can even

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.779 
you should be able in fact you can even
play<00:05:10.660> your<00:05:10.690> scale<00:05:11.080> starting<00:05:11.530> participa<00:05:12.250> when

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
play your scale starting participa when

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.909 
play your scale starting participa when
you<00:05:12.849> get<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.240> top<00:05:13.449> note<00:05:13.780> peanuts<00:05:14.650> ammo

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
you get to the top note peanuts ammo

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.040 
you get to the top note peanuts ammo
when<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.490> go<00:05:15.580> down<00:05:15.789> go<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.330> testimonia

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
when you go down go for testimonia

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.960

where<00:05:55.120> you<00:05:55.750> eventually<00:05:56.440> can<00:05:56.860> get<00:05:57.009> through<00:05:57.219> the

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
scales and the arpeggios and then you

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.430 
scales and the arpeggios and then you
start<00:06:00.460> working<00:06:00.669> at<00:06:00.969> a<00:06:01.180> temple<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.870> some<00:06:02.139> kind

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
and then you gradually over the days

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.920 
and then you gradually over the days
weeks<00:06:05.289> months<00:06:05.919> in<00:06:06.219> years<00:06:06.969> you<00:06:07.449> work<00:06:07.719> that

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
weeks months in years you work that

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
and eventually in time I mean you could

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.490 
and eventually in time I mean you could
win<00:06:14.650> on<00:06:14.770> these<00:06:14.889> scales<00:06:15.190> on<00:06:15.460> 126<00:06:16.389> and<00:06:17.169> what

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
hear the problems so he said that's a

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.430 
hear the problems so he said that's a
really<00:06:57.730> deep<00:06:57.940> temple<00:06:58.390> to<00:06:58.570> work<00:06:58.780> towards<00:06:59.260> and

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
really deep temple to work towards and

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.410 
really deep temple to work towards and
that<00:06:59.950> we<00:07:00.100> eventually<00:07:00.520> could<00:07:00.940> work<00:07:01.090> out<00:07:01.270> all

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.380 
that we eventually could work out all
the<00:07:01.540> books<00:07:01.780> so<00:07:02.530> you<00:07:02.740> know<00:07:03.000> begin<00:07:04.000> to<00:07:04.120> scales

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
the books so you know begin to scales

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.040 
the books so you know begin to scales
begin<00:07:04.870> to<00:07:04.990> our<00:07:05.110> panels<00:07:05.650> work<00:07:06.160> on<00:07:06.370> a<00:07:06.400> temple

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
begin to our panels work on a temple

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.360 
begin to our panels work on a temple
eventually<00:07:08.050> you<00:07:08.200> get<00:07:08.350> up<00:07:08.470> to<00:07:08.590> that<00:07:08.770> temple<00:07:09.250> and

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
eventually you get up to that temple and

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.280 
eventually you get up to that temple and
I<00:07:09.520> think<00:07:09.790> you'll<00:07:09.940> be<00:07:10.060> well<00:07:10.300> on<00:07:10.330> your<00:07:10.600> way<00:07:10.660> so

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
I think you'll be well on your way so

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.990 
I think you'll be well on your way so
this<00:07:11.440> is<00:07:11.590> a<00:07:11.620> really<00:07:11.920> neat<00:07:12.130> technique<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.850> work

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
this is a really neat technique to work

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000 
this is a really neat technique to work
with<00:07:13.240> your<00:07:13.390> students<00:07:13.780> over<00:07:14.080> time<00:07:14.290> and<00:07:14.620> I<00:07:14.950> think

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
with your students over time and I think

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.650 
with your students over time and I think
you'll<00:07:15.310> find<00:07:15.460> that<00:07:15.610> will<00:07:15.850> really<00:07:16.120> help<00:07:16.390> them

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
you'll find that will really help them

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.510 
you'll find that will really help them
in<00:07:16.780> your<00:07:16.900> literature<00:07:17.380> just<00:07:17.770> a<00:07:17.920> doctor<00:07:18.250> David
