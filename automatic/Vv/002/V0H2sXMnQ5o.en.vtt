00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
this recording actually was mechanical

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.779 
this recording actually was mechanical
so<00:00:48.329> my<00:00:48.480> voice<00:00:48.629> started<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.260> digital<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.550> was

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
so my voice started out digital it was

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.450 
so my voice started out digital it was
etched<00:00:50.969> mechanically<00:00:51.960> into<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.890> plastic

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
etched mechanically into this plastic

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
etched mechanically into this plastic
plate<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.480> here<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.579> is

that<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.119> made<00:01:09.330> some<00:01:09.570> improvements<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> my

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
that I made some improvements to my

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.280 
that I made some improvements to my
recording<00:01:11.070> process<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.270> adjusted<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
recording process was I adjusted the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.969 
recording process was I adjusted the
weight<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> record<00:01:14.790> cutting<00:01:15.210> tonearm<00:01:15.979> by

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
weight of the record cutting tonearm by

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
weight of the record cutting tonearm by
adjusting<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.820> weight<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.360> making<00:01:18.990> some

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
adjusting the weight and making some

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.950 
adjusting the weight and making some
adjustments<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> speed<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.960> other

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
adjustments to the speed and other

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.899 
adjustments to the speed and other
adjustment<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.979> able<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> adjust<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
adjustment so I was able to adjust the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.780 
adjustment so I was able to adjust the
adjustments<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> may<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.960> adjustment<00:01:25.790> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
adjustments that may be adjustment that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.840 
adjustments that may be adjustment that
may<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.060> improvement<00:01:27.720> I'm<00:01:28.670> really<00:01:29.670> just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
may be improvement I'm really just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.190 
may be improvement I'm really just
kidding<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.329> didn't<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.869> all<00:01:30.900> those

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
kidding I didn't really do all those

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
kidding I didn't really do all those
adjustments<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.920> did<00:01:32.490> make<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:32.850> adjustments
