00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 me 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.039
 - 005 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.230
 the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.539
 even 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.789
 the american shuttle 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490
 even 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 hello to everyone for sure that after six who comes back after 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.499
 a month of absence 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.429
 to this music of a too much 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.260
 but had missed for frankly this is this is the kind of music 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.079
 who early 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.460
 that makes you happy if you agree me I say rap 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.489
 for F 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.600
 this is me this classic Indian case after a month but why for me 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.100
 I did not make videos I'll explain it's just because 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.530
 than 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.789
 I worked full time in the aude with a student job 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 squirrel that I was so raw and the evening that I was not there 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.510
 the motivation to make videos 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.200
 and seeing that I do not like making videos when I'm 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.339
 when I am very motivated and well here I have not done just 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.339
 but I reassure you I have plans to close the projects 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.679
 of sickness touch the land fa cup with the commune was nonexistent I 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.490
 will soon begin the adventures in the landscape 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.439
 and I'm going to do crazy tutorials on the small road like for example if 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.120
 I will show you right away 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.200
 look good ladies and gentlemen this is 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090
 da replaced in Europe their killers 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.780
 r some will say 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.780
 why that shit thing but it's used for nothing 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 I can tell you already that compaction circuit is enough 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.590
 previous 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.600
 % I will develop today and this 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.160
 very compact 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.200
 eyi despite the unwillingness what you can think 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.470
 and by year c 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.350
 really useful especially for writing things on years walls because 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.719
 no doubt you know but most people on the server 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.740
 what are they doing he is actually writing a relief 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.240
 of letters from members on the walls 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.149
 but not with this replacement system you can simply 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.080
 replace an area that is covered with stone everywhere some blocks 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.170
 if your hair 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.960
 they will go 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410
 to replace themselves and create a word in the wall 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.569
 it's so good a lot of studies 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.169
 than to create a relief years 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.149
 using issues that only affect blogs 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.939
 so this is this study 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.169
 a little thing that I wanted to tell you is to house from 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:19.900
 many 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.239
 then everything 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.200
 and percent and that are really worth it so much the worse if it's the same 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.260
 principle that the one we may have just come to see there 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 except that it is with several blocks 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.269
 see that the sto is not replaced by buffoonery 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.199
 so obviously he knows if tricks but I can do very well 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:38.659
 asymmetrical stuff 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.859
 look at it 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.969
 the high-performance platforms 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.119
 anders b anglo-saxon 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.199
 if I now press the button I read very high story that we 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.199
 let's see the change 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.559
 it changes beyond the oracles 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.669
 but now imagine that you are on a death map that kills death and that 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.379
 you do not have the opportunity because the rules aimed at you 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.239
 forbade the 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.479
 all 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.949
 it is to stifle the fire to be otherwise 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.939
 and paf you can 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.039
 search 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.139
 with a little bit of 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.719
 to wriggle I'll say that but it would not have 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.750
 on the way 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.950
 by thinking a little 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.829
 you have via a button that could be placed 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.579
 % in certain places 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.289
 well you can put out the fire 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.429
 and allow you to remember green to the room approach pass things 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.429
 that I could do if I ever do an adventure map again 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 for those who may not know it or maybe not yet, it's 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.839
 now safe for version 3 1 points 5 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:42.809
 doman hatches besides it is necessary to test it but not in version 3 5 because 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:43.480
 that if you are 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.629
 lax with the current version there is some damage that does not work anymore 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.729
 besides me I liked it this complaint it's a pity that he designates 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.470
 who are slower 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.770
 but hey it's things that happen against the brief major crisis 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.859
 gold guys a lot of things i'm going to show you like for example here 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.959
 look there is an open door 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.029
 now I lift my foot the door is closed 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.329
 so I tell myself that six active players leverage 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.789
 it will open and balloons see that it is not 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.990
 it's pretty problematic that way 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.249
 you click on the button 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.930
 but nothing happens if now you get up 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.840
 the lever and that you press the bitter facebook page button 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.169
 with the pope 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.500
 see that the door closes for blows too fast and I'm not going to the door 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:27.490
 the possibility of putting its doors 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.860
 so there it was ahead schematic inevitably 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.500
 I can run all sides 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.650
 I want to say 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.490
 it's now there are walls everywhere 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.490
 he was passing this door you can not like this 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.180
 so what do you think maybe if 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.879
 bush and not you click the button and you 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.319
 all this 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.039
 it leaves the door open to a balloon it does not work 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.490
 in fact this is the only combination that can work 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.569
 these scenes to press the button and lifestyle coupet and that's you 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.930
 see that the door remains activated 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.270
 and these are circuits 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.720
 which are very interesting that actually allow you to lock 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.770
 doors he brings what else 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.950
 so 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.330
 not so difficult 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.059
 and that is done thanks to the geeks to flip flop on the other side clippers 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.409
 all these little mechanisms of restos of the heart its interesting attachment and 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.570
 important to them 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.710
 to personalize 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.689
 these passwords always 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.069
 it's just beautiful corner 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.059
 the next days pretty much goes around austria 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.699
 puf ice cube 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.349
 an adventure whose heroes 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.439
 tutorials to restore our future 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.009
 were also server visits I will visit day servers 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:39.339
 several on my list 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.009
 as you can comment it had already had to know I already did a 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.110
 dozens of remote aptilon servers 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.240
 petrify that makes us very good sense the key role I highly recommend 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.849
 for people who wish 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.249
 the newspaper relies on servers so that's about 5% 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:59.620
 puyol has many others a message that goes between obviously 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.710
 and I will introduce some soon so possible 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.809
 possible also because it's true that 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:07.630
 I tend to forget it 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.830
 it is to thank you ladies and gentlemen because the Middle East 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.970
 gold today the same fields protect there at home reaches the 5000 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.660
 subscribers 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.570
 it's totally ballistic you have to know that for this student is not 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.159
 given to everyone 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.789
 that me unlike a lot of people who make videos youtube 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.349
 then I started ground 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.270
 I'm always alone 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.919
 she is even more optimistic or not no in fact I feel very very well 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:31.599
 alone 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.029
 but ladies and gentlemen I intend to make videos soon 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.469
 summer they kill us board that are ours 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.289
 they are more or less known or simply unknown 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.139
 who knows I will try to make contact with his wife you sleep that I like 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.250
 reims maybe I'll do some videos with them soon 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.080
 less I hope 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.189
 he can widen a little horizon 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.550
 and percent 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.830
 it allows me to discover beautiful things with those people 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.129
 it can be very promising 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.309
 it is possible also because young according to his right there but not 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.309
 free to make you lottery distributors that's 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:11.909
 he can be transported 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:13.629
 top is beautiful 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.289
 it is also a vector the replacement system of black 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:20.459
 Well, it can really do a lot of things that's the little thing 

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:22.050
 parenthesis of the day 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.479
 and so here 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:26.529
 of these videos that will maybe soon on the channel no 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:27.319
 hands 

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:30.339
 because tomorrow I will spend my day cutting wood 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:32.969
 to saint-pierre saint-paul elapsed it's things that I have to do to 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:33.869
 my family 

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.949
 so percent so here are some things that are going to be done little by little 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.490
 but I promise you to do a lot more videos this month 

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.339
 which was completely empty 

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:45.529
 so I see there I thank you anyway for looking forward to watching this 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:47.419
 video to follow me 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:49.469
 I hope you will always be a 

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.740
 forever 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.759
 I do not always say but you will not follow 

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.759
 still offers some time I say I hope you can not stand 

00:07:57.509 --> 00:07:58.610
 There you go 

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.819
 for television and at the next jon
