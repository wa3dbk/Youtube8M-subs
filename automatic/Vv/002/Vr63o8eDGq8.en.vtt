win one of the backs
how<00:01:01.780> about<00:01:01.870> Pegasus<00:01:03.809> sorry<00:01:04.809> altar<00:01:05.259> No<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.090> here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
how about Pegasus sorry altar No so here

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.990 
how about Pegasus sorry altar No so here
we<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.780> God<00:01:08.080> well<00:01:08.800> basically<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.220> spaces<00:01:09.789> it's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
we have God well basically I spaces it's

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760 
we have God well basically I spaces it's
maybe<00:01:10.270> like<00:01:10.630> it's<00:01:10.810> basically<00:01:10.960> shield<00:01:11.380> Pegasus

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
maybe like it's basically shield Pegasus

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.660 
maybe like it's basically shield Pegasus
right<00:01:11.950> there<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.460> guess<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:13.660> is<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.840> whole<00:01:14.140> wave

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
right there I guess this is a whole wave

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.279 
right there I guess this is a whole wave
cuz<00:01:15.670> it's<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:16.030> like<00:01:16.240> cosmic<00:01:16.750> I'll<00:01:16.899> drag<00:01:17.140> on

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
cuz it's just like cosmic I'll drag on

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.400 
cuz it's just like cosmic I'll drag on
Leone<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.009> guessing<00:01:18.580> there's<00:01:18.759> not<00:01:18.940> any<00:01:19.060> more

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
Leone so guessing there's not any more

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.560 
Leone so guessing there's not any more
from<00:01:20.410> this<00:01:20.649> wave<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.970> now<00:01:22.119> I'm<00:01:22.270> going<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.479> show

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
from this wave so now I'm going to show

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.319 
from this wave so now I'm going to show
you<00:01:22.659> one<00:01:22.840> by<00:01:22.869> one<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.729> after<00:01:25.180> I'm<00:01:25.270> going

moving<00:02:23.109> on<00:02:23.350> we've<00:02:23.500> got<00:02:23.590> l-drago<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.670> for<00:02:24.880> no

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
moving on we've got l-drago which for no

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.910 
moving on we've got l-drago which for no
reason<00:02:25.420> spins<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.049> opposite<00:02:26.440> way<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.620> should

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
reason spins the opposite way it should
