they're not around anymore which means

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
they're not around anymore which means
it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.310> probably<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.729> bad<00:01:20.909> idea<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> first

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
it was probably a bad idea in the first

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.800 
it was probably a bad idea in the first
place<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.920> mini<00:01:23.100> Dorito<00:01:24.090> burger

things<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.470> let's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
things are just let's just not do that I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
things are just let's just not do that I
got<00:01:27.900> pretty<00:01:28.110> excited<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.710> saw<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
got pretty excited when I saw this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
got pretty excited when I saw this
coming<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> thought<00:01:29.670> maybe<00:01:29.729> was<00:01:30.119> written<00:01:30.360> by

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
coming so I thought maybe was written by

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
coming so I thought maybe was written by
Dennis<00:01:30.960> Quaid<00:01:31.200> even<00:01:31.470> though<00:01:31.560> he<00:01:31.680> spelled<00:01:32.189> his

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
Dennis Quaid even though he spelled his

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
Dennis Quaid even though he spelled his
name<00:01:32.340> wrong<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.360> I'm<00:01:33.750> realizing<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
name wrong but now I'm realizing that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
name wrong but now I'm realizing that
it's<00:01:34.409> probably<00:01:34.560> Randy<00:01:35.280> Quaid<00:01:35.520> which<00:01:36.150> really

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
it's probably Randy Quaid which really

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's probably Randy Quaid which really
