00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
I guess I these are two socks rolled

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.630 
I guess I these are two socks rolled
together<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.920> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.460> already

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
together and as you can see I already

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.299

have my hair in a ponytail I just put it
on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> side<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.210> easier<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.600> me<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.129> see

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
on the side so it's easier for me to see

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.569 
on the side so it's easier for me to see
without<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> mirror<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.440> anything<00:00:46.980> um

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.730 

keep<00:03:37.610> going<00:03:37.970> up<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:39.880> further<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.030> go<00:03:41.420> up

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
keep going up and the further you go up

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.210 
keep going up and the further you go up
the<00:03:42.740> more<00:03:43.010> hair<00:03:44.440> kinda<00:03:45.440> gets<00:03:45.650> trapped<00:03:46.010> in

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.300 

and<00:04:14.330> as<00:04:15.080> you<00:04:15.230> can<00:04:15.380> see<00:04:15.410> i'm<00:04:15.770> just<00:04:16.010> about<00:04:16.250> done

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
and as you can see i'm just about done

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.920 
and as you can see i'm just about done
there's<00:04:16.820> probably<00:04:17.150> going<00:04:17.329> to<00:04:17.390> be<00:04:17.450> like<00:04:17.630> one

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there's probably going to be like one

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.750 
there's probably going to be like one
more<00:04:18.140> little<00:04:18.440> push<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.610> go<00:04:19.820> through<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.360> um

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
more little push I go through and um

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.620 
more little push I go through and um
generally<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:23.300> will<00:04:23.450> stay<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.110> my<00:04:24.620> head

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
generally it will stay on my head

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:33.730 
generally it will stay on my head
however<00:04:29.110> just<00:04:30.110> to<00:04:30.260> be<00:04:30.590> sure<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.200> stays<00:04:33.530> on

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
however just to be sure see it stays on

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.540 
however just to be sure see it stays on
pretty<00:04:34.100> good<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.530> have<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.740> lot<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:36.980> hair<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
pretty good but I have a lot of hair and

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.630 
pretty good but I have a lot of hair and
my<00:04:37.670> spots<00:04:38.030> my<00:04:38.390> sock<00:04:38.630> bun<00:04:38.900> is<00:04:39.110> really<00:04:39.440> big<00:04:39.770> so

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
my spots my sock bun is really big so

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.000 
my spots my sock bun is really big so
it's<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.390> little<00:04:41.540> bit<00:04:41.660> heavier<00:04:42.080> then<00:04:42.860> it

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it's a little bit heavier then it

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.090 
it's a little bit heavier then it
probably<00:04:43.220> would<00:04:43.490> be<00:04:43.520> normally<00:04:44.920> trust<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.070> old

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
probably would be normally trust the old

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.620 
probably would be normally trust the old
safety<00:04:46.550> pins<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:48.760> I'd<00:04:49.760> grab<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.060> couple<00:04:50.480> at<00:04:50.600> the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
safety pins and I'd grab a couple at the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.750 
safety pins and I'd grab a couple at the
top<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.200> then<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.350> couple<00:04:51.590> at<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.800> bottom<00:04:57.760> what

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
top and then a couple at the bottom what

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:12.940 
top and then a couple at the bottom what
is<00:04:59.030> that<00:05:00.400> I'm<00:05:01.400> going<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.790> fuzzy

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.920 

and<00:05:13.520> at<00:05:13.700> this<00:05:13.820> point<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.210> can<00:05:14.450> just<00:05:14.630> kind<00:05:14.870> of

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
and at this point you can just kind of

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.890 
and at this point you can just kind of
like<00:05:15.140> tuck<00:05:15.860> in<00:05:16.100> this<00:05:16.820> way<00:05:17.030> of<00:05:17.210> doing<00:05:17.570> it<00:05:17.690> it

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
like tuck in this way of doing it it

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.000 
like tuck in this way of doing it it
does<00:05:18.110> leave<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.970> it's<00:05:19.970> not<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.390> tight<00:05:20.750> as<00:05:21.170> the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
does leave it it's not as tight as the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.730 
does leave it it's not as tight as the
other<00:05:22.190> way<00:05:22.490> but<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.180> looks<00:05:23.450> bigger<00:05:24.290> because

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
other way but it looks bigger because

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.250 
other way but it looks bigger because
you're<00:05:25.190> like<00:05:25.340> wrapping<00:05:25.700> your<00:05:25.820> hair

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
can see that and there's probably like a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.930 
can see that and there's probably like a
little<00:05:32.440> little<00:05:33.440> bald<00:05:33.860> spot<00:05:34.280> as<00:05:34.430> you<00:05:34.580> would<00:05:34.700> say
