00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.220
 And then people, I trust, this is good. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.540
 I'm going to make a video today too. 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 now the people who are more experienced 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.170
 It's a little video, but that's a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 exercise I do not know if I was that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.029
 I invented you because I've never seen this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.949
 number no but is to develop here 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 to train a little 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.490
 It's a matter of having sines, right? 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 It's good so basically exercise is just 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.770
 A joke is for you a little 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.890
 more coordination if I do not already have 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 then it will be the next in one of the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.030
 hands and we 'll score then it's four 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 times of four beats while the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.530
 another hand will score six beats this 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.020
 to the same measure 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.739
 or you will have one riding with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.219
 full 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.809
 let's assume the other hand is playing 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 have notes and minimum notes 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 So I went in the result of this is that 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 here you will have a compass with four 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.159
 notes in the left hand and in the same 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.150
 compass you will have six notes for the hand 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.740
 right and the notes reminding 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.810
 interval between one note and another has 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.770
 be the same interval or each note 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 of the left hand has to have the same 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 duration of the left hand note and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 six notes on the right hand must have the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.670
 same note gives six notes have to have the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 same time again 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.310
 each note on the right hand has to have the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.299
 same time it is for six notes ie 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.610
 with source of all nÃ© 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.680
 well I'll explain here what stays 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.360
 easier to understand what I 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.310
 trying to pass on to you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.390
 basically it's going to be cool because 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.960
 You will have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.430
 let's say a four note start 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.930
 with six notes so the mmc of it here 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.549
 would be four times six from a24 then 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.280
 every twenty-four notes 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.509
 You're going to play, will you start the riff? 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.610
 always in the same direction and to give 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.730
 a complicated but still in that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 I'm speaking 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.860
 The river is going to be like this is not going to be 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:20.260
 simply four notes not us 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.810
 We're going to use let's spread this. 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.360
 pro 5 for the five fingers of the hand 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.840
 in sequence then you will have yes 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.629
 five fingers touching four notes 5 fingers 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.269
 playing six notes at different times 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.430
 This becomes difficult, really cool, for example. 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.720
 stay and all that I tried to pass 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.150
 for you to be easier to understand 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.150
 then I would look more or less like this 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.489
 and I made this letter is just to mark it well 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.319
 notes but does not need to be highlighted 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.849
 exercise 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.519
 in fact the ideal is for you to practice 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.319
 yes at speeds is starting from the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.810
 slow down to one more time 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.420
 for example about 60 beats per 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.780
 minute and will accelerate this until the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.910
 as you can make exercise 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.549
 more exciting then I did this 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.849
 so the right hand is doing 6 ea. 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.540
 left hand doing four in the middle did not 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:35.400
 It's during the hit you get reverse then 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.280
 You started the sentence with your left hand. 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.549
 making 4 that you finish one 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.950
 set of notes you start now 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.230
 but I want to do it on the six notes and the hand 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.530
 right doing the 4 would be something else or 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.530
 less so 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:22.620
 Good thing is a short video, okay? 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.060
 Guys, it's more of a joke even for 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.290
 to test coordination a bit more 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 motor 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.100
 the people who already have the most experience are 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.290
 It's always cool to do this kind of thing. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.560
 try to develop some 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.470
 exercise so personalized for you 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.200
 It's for yourself and you create a 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.140
 exercise for you practice something 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.610
 which suddenly is interesting, is not it 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.230
 kind of coordination for example when 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.370
 You're playing rock music. 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.780
 progressive is essential 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.100
 good people this is the video yes 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.210
 Short and I hope you have 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.550
 It's liked, please help me not yet 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.260
 liked the video 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.310
 visit our facebook page too 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.580
 is facebook.com keyboard bar easier 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.420
 and also visit our blog keyboard more 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:15.620
 That's it.
