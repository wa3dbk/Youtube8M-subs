that was the friends hope everything is

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.480 
that was the friends hope everything is
fine<00:00:01.650> this<00:00:02.280> is<00:00:02.340> crash<00:00:02.790> from<00:00:03.330> empty<00:00:07.130> so<00:00:08.130> friends

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
fine this is crash from empty so friends

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.190 
fine this is crash from empty so friends
as<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:08.910> already<00:00:09.090> guessed<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.050> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
as you have already guessed and this is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.669 
as you have already guessed and this is
the<00:00:10.410> review<00:00:10.740> video<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:12.049> power<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.290> power

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the review video of the power is power

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.099 
the review video of the power is power
back<00:00:15.049> 10400<00:00:16.049> milliampere<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.539> used<00:00:18.840> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
back 10400 milliampere I have used it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
back 10400 milliampere I have used it
for<00:00:19.520> one<00:00:20.520> wait<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.850> think<00:00:21.020> maybe<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:23.820> video

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
for one wait I think maybe the video

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.839 
for one wait I think maybe the video
last<00:00:24.810> time<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> told<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.550> can't

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
last time I told you that you can't

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.640 
last time I told you that you can't
charge<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.740> part<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.039> ampere<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
charge from the two part one ampere and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.799 
charge from the two part one ampere and
that<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.920> don't<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.329> happened<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
that I don't know what happened at that

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.770 
that I don't know what happened at that
time<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.829> charge<00:00:35.130> from<00:00:35.430> 0.1<00:00:36.090> milli

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
time but you can charge from 0.1 milli

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.600 
time but you can charge from 0.1 milli
ampere<00:00:37.320> port<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.969> your<00:00:39.360> smartphone<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:41.250> am

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
ampere port to your smartphone like I am

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.450 
ampere port to your smartphone like I am
using<00:00:41.850> Moto<00:00:42.180> G<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.770> let<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.100> show<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
using Moto G and here let me show you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.639 
using Moto G and here let me show you
but<00:00:45.450> before<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.899> let<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.200> tell<00:00:46.320> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
but before that let me tell you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.670 
but before that let me tell you
something<00:00:47.250> about<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.440> there<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> an

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
something about this that there is an

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
something about this that there is an
instruction<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.670> must<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.600> turn

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
instruction that you must have to turn

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
instruction that you must have to turn
off<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.320> power<00:00:53.129> bank<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
off the power bank and then you have to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.490 
off the power bank and then you have to
charge<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.570> phone<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.820> tested<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
charge your phone but I have tested it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.639 
charge your phone but I have tested it
if<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.739> don't<00:00:59.039> turn<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.840> just

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
if I don't turn it on and then I just

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
if I don't turn it on and then I just
start<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.489> start<00:01:03.059> charging<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.570> device<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
start my start charging my device it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.859 
start my start charging my device it
starts<00:01:05.010> charging<00:01:05.220> don't<00:01:05.700> know<00:01:05.850> why<00:01:06.060> maybe

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
starts charging don't know why maybe

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
starts charging don't know why maybe
that's<00:01:07.350> device<00:01:07.710> fault<00:01:07.979> or<00:01:08.189> something<00:01:08.580> else<00:01:08.760> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that's device fault or something else I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.039 
that's device fault or something else I
don't<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.240> about<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.970> thing<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.420> if

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
don't know about that the thing is if

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.810 
don't know about that the thing is if
you<00:01:13.140> charge<00:01:13.590> from<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:13.950> point<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.430> ampere

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you charge from two point one ampere

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.520 
you charge from two point one ampere
then<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:16.020> phone<00:01:16.290> gets<00:01:16.650> charged<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.430> 15

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
then your phone gets charged from 15

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.510 
then your phone gets charged from 15
percent<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.920> 40<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.960> 50<00:01:22.470> percent<00:01:22.650> within

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
percent to 40 or for 50 percent within

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.810 
percent to 40 or for 50 percent within
20<00:01:24.150> minutes<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.780> T<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.200> 25<00:01:26.189> percent<00:01:26.729> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
20 minutes that T is 25 percent of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.940 
20 minutes that T is 25 percent of
charge<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.780> 15<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:29.240> 20<00:01:30.240> minutes

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
charge you can get in 15 to 20 minutes

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.719 
charge you can get in 15 to 20 minutes
but<00:01:31.950> after<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.000> gets<00:01:33.210> slow<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
but after that it gets slow and

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.420 
but after that it gets slow and
obviously<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.450> time<00:01:36.890> your<00:01:37.890> device<00:01:38.189> gets

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
obviously at that time your device gets

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.240 
obviously at that time your device gets
hotter<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:41.869> it<00:01:42.869> gets<00:01:43.170> usually<00:01:43.710> while

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
hotter like it gets usually while

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.450 
hotter like it gets usually while
charging<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:45.299> dipped<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.990> charge<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:47.220> gets

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
charging or dipped on charge it gets

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.389 
charging or dipped on charge it gets
hotter<00:01:47.729> many<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.600> had<00:01:48.899> felt<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
hotter many of you had felt that that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.389 
hotter many of you had felt that that
your<00:01:50.579> device<00:01:50.909> screen<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:52.049> becoming<00:01:52.619> hot<00:01:52.950> or

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
your device screen is becoming hot or

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
your device screen is becoming hot or
something<00:01:53.850> that's<00:01:54.210> not<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> device<00:01:54.840> fault

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
something that's not the device fault

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.880 
something that's not the device fault
since<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.719> kept<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.960> charge<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.799> is

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
since you have kept it on charge that is

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.499 
since you have kept it on charge that is
why<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.610> becomes<00:01:59.850> hot

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
why it becomes hot

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.490 
why it becomes hot
there's<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.530> point<00:02:01.799> here

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
there's a point here

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.370 
there's a point here
it<00:02:03.590> gets<00:02:03.920> charged<00:02:04.430> but<00:02:05.060> with<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> faster<00:02:06.200> rate

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
it gets charged but with a faster rate

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.400 
it gets charged but with a faster rate
but<00:02:06.680> after<00:02:07.010> some<00:02:07.190> time<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.730> gets<00:02:07.910> slowly

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
but after some time it gets slowly

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.870 
but after some time it gets slowly
charged<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.770> with<00:02:10.490> one<00:02:10.759> ampere<00:02:11.350> charts<00:02:12.880> while

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
charged and with one ampere charts while

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.200 
charged and with one ampere charts while
charging<00:02:14.420> from<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.840> ampere<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.410> get<00:02:15.680> charged

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
charging from one ampere it get charged

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.110 
charging from one ampere it get charged
around<00:02:17.380> 120<00:02:18.380> minutes<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:20.150> get<00:02:20.270> full<00:02:20.540> charge

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
around 120 minutes to get full charge

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.820 
around 120 minutes to get full charge
that's<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.270> point<00:02:23.480> which<00:02:23.990> I<00:02:24.140> was<00:02:24.320> talking<00:02:24.709> out

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
that's the point which I was talking out

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.010 
that's the point which I was talking out
right<00:02:25.130> now<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:26.390> main<00:02:26.630> thing<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
right now and the main thing that is it

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.530 
right now and the main thing that is it
is<00:02:30.260> ten<00:02:31.160> thousand<00:02:31.730> four<00:02:32.090> hundred<00:02:32.209> milli

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540

do<00:03:40.549> note<00:03:40.760> one<00:03:41.450> thing<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.930> if<00:03:42.140> your<00:03:42.320> device<00:03:42.500> is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
do note one thing that if your device is

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:43.420 
do note one thing that if your device is
hot

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
hot

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.440

it<00:03:43.700> won't<00:03:44.000> charge<00:03:44.269> rapidly<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:46.459> means<00:03:46.790> you

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
it won't charge rapidly that means you

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.280 
it won't charge rapidly that means you
think<00:03:47.480> that<00:03:48.019> if<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:49.130> were<00:03:49.820> playing<00:03:50.209> with<00:03:50.510> your

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
think that if you were playing with your

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.160 
think that if you were playing with your
device<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.769> your<00:03:51.950> device<00:03:52.220> was<00:03:52.579> got<00:03:53.420> hot<00:03:53.780> and

device and your device was got hot and
you<00:03:55.010> put<00:03:55.750> two<00:03:56.750> point<00:03:56.989> one<00:03:57.579> charger<00:03:58.579> two<00:03:59.060> point

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
you put two point one charger two point

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.979 
you put two point one charger two point
one<00:03:59.420> point<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.829> connected<00:04:01.760> your<00:04:02.000> USB<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
one point and connected your USB and

plug it with your device and you think

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.620 
plug it with your device and you think
that<00:04:06.019> your<00:04:06.500> device<00:04:06.980> would<00:04:07.190> get<00:04:07.430> charged<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:08.000> up

to 50 percent or 40 percent within 15 to
20<00:04:11.390> minutes<00:04:11.660> it<00:04:11.930> would<00:04:12.290> happen<00:04:12.500> happen<00:04:13.370> cause

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
20 minutes it would happen happen cause

100%<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:43.240> could<00:04:43.990> say<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.950> just<00:04:45.010> plug<00:04:45.490> in

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
100% you could say that you just plug in

two<00:04:51.130> or<00:04:51.490> three<00:04:51.550> hours<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.630> may<00:04:52.810> think<00:04:53.470> that

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
two or three hours you may think that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.159 
two or three hours you may think that
your<00:04:53.980> charger<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.490> wasted<00:04:55.000> or<00:04:55.210> something<00:04:55.600> but

your device get charged to 2 and it is
three<00:05:05.260> LEDs<00:05:05.620> okay<00:05:06.460> don't<00:05:07.390> worry<00:05:07.540> about<00:05:07.750> that

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140
