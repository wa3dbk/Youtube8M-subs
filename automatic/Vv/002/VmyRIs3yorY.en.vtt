this<00:04:00.099> but<00:04:00.669> I've<00:04:00.760> been<00:04:00.880> hearing<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.389> the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
this but I've been hearing that the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.830 
this but I've been hearing that the
ump45<00:04:02.169> is<00:04:02.709> really<00:04:03.190> popular<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:04.599> modern

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
ump45 is really popular the modern

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.920 
ump45 is really popular the modern
warfare<00:04:04.900> 3<00:04:05.639> which<00:04:06.639> does<00:04:07.239> not<00:04:07.389> surprise<00:04:07.690> me<00:04:07.720> at

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
warfare 3 which does not surprise me at

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.690 
warfare 3 which does not surprise me at
all<00:04:08.049> because<00:04:08.230> every<00:04:08.799> call<00:04:08.980> of<00:04:09.069> duty<00:04:09.310> has<00:04:09.459> has

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
all because every call of duty has has

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.650 
all because every call of duty has has
had<00:04:10.060> some<00:04:10.389> overpowered<00:04:10.959> submachine<00:04:11.889> gun<00:04:12.069> and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
had some overpowered submachine gun and

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.120 
had some overpowered submachine gun and
especially<00:04:13.660> since<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.049> UMP<00:04:14.440> was<00:04:14.620> powerful<00:04:15.099> in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
especially since the UMP was powerful in

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.759 
especially since the UMP was powerful in
modern<00:04:15.430> warfare<00:04:15.459> 2

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
modern warfare 2

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.099 
modern warfare 2
so<00:04:17.699> that's<00:04:18.060> not<00:04:18.329> even<00:04:18.569> good<00:04:18.720> either<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.079> know

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so that's not even good either you know

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.170 
so that's not even good either you know
I<00:04:19.199> don't<00:04:19.379> want<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> see<00:04:20.430> another<00:04:20.459> overpowered

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
I don't want to see another overpowered

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.570 
I don't want to see another overpowered
going<00:04:21.770> there's<00:04:22.770> always<00:04:22.889> going<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.099> be<00:04:23.160> one<00:04:23.400> gun

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
going there's always going to be one gun

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.790 
going there's always going to be one gun
that's<00:04:23.729> overpowered<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.539> understand<00:04:25.349> that<00:04:25.470> but

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
that's overpowered I understand that but

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.369 
that's overpowered I understand that but
it<00:04:26.159> just<00:04:26.190> depends<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.669> how<00:04:27.389> much<00:04:27.720> better<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.259> is

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
it just depends on how much better it is

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.149 
it just depends on how much better it is
and<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:30.150> ump<00:04:30.690> in<00:04:31.020> modern<00:04:31.379> warfare<00:04:31.409> 2<00:04:31.800> was

00:04:32.149 --> 00:04:32.159 
and the ump in modern warfare 2 was

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.490 
and the ump in modern warfare 2 was
miles<00:04:33.000> ahead<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:33.750> rest<00:04:33.900> of<00:04:34.080> them<00:04:34.199> which<00:04:34.349> is

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
miles ahead of the rest of them which is

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.719 
miles ahead of the rest of them which is
why<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:35.009> it<00:04:35.250> stood<00:04:35.580> out<00:04:35.699> so<00:04:35.879> much<00:04:36.120> and

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
why it was it stood out so much and

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.430 
why it was it stood out so much and
though<00:04:38.729> though<00:04:39.509> the<00:04:39.659> beginning<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.020> black<00:04:40.229> ops

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
though though the beginning of black ops

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.110 
though though the beginning of black ops
was<00:04:40.680> bad<00:04:40.919> now<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.970> ak-74<00:04:42.780> isn't<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:44.120> like

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
was bad now the ak-74 isn't as like

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.520 
was bad now the ak-74 isn't as like
powerful<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.560> mp5<00:04:47.099> is<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> really<00:04:47.970> good

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
powerful like the mp5 is a really good

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.480 
powerful like the mp5 is a really good
substitute<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:49.830> really<00:04:50.009> hold<00:04:50.220> its<00:04:50.400> own

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
substitute it can really hold its own

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.879 
substitute it can really hold its own
against<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.909> AK<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.630> you<00:04:52.560> know<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.800> other

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
against the AK and you know the other

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.770 
against the AK and you know the other
ones<00:04:53.099> are<00:04:53.159> pretty<00:04:53.280> good<00:04:53.520> too<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.940> like<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.389> MPL

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
ones are pretty good too I like the MPL

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.820 
ones are pretty good too I like the MPL
and<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.169> spectrum<00:04:56.090> my<00:04:57.090> point<00:04:57.240> is<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.500> UMP

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
and the spectrum my point is the UMP

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.290 
and the spectrum my point is the UMP
could<00:04:59.039> be<00:04:59.190> really<00:04:59.580> bad<00:04:59.819> we're<00:05:00.150> definitely

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
could be really bad we're definitely

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.480 
could be really bad we're definitely
gonna<00:05:00.539> see<00:05:00.720> a<00:05:00.750> lot<00:05:00.930> and<00:05:01.560> since<00:05:02.220> we<00:05:02.310> don't<00:05:02.340> have

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
gonna see a lot and since we don't have

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.520 
gonna see a lot and since we don't have
this<00:05:02.639> honeymoon<00:05:03.000> stage<00:05:03.259> it's<00:05:04.259> going<00:05:04.409> to<00:05:04.440> be

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
this honeymoon stage it's going to be

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.689 
this honeymoon stage it's going to be
interesting<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.979> see<00:05:05.159> how<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.340> works<00:05:05.490> out

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
interesting to see how this works out

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.219 
interesting to see how this works out
because<00:05:05.909> this<00:05:06.240> is<00:05:06.449> not<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.659> new<00:05:06.900> fresh

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
because this is not a new fresh

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.320 
because this is not a new fresh
experience<00:05:07.560> it's<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.520> same<00:05:08.729> thing<00:05:08.759> that<00:05:09.180> we

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
experience it's the same thing that we

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.219 
experience it's the same thing that we
had<00:05:09.539> two<00:05:10.139> years<00:05:10.409> ago<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:12.000> that's<00:05:12.690> basically<00:05:12.840> it

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
had two years ago so that's basically it

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.930 
had two years ago so that's basically it
that's<00:05:13.620> all<00:05:13.680> I<00:05:13.740> wanted<00:05:14.069> to<00:05:14.130> say<00:05:14.219> it's<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:14.729> it

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
that's all I wanted to say it's just it

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.240 
that's all I wanted to say it's just it
is<00:05:15.180> scary<00:05:15.330> for<00:05:15.659> one<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.590> bigger<00:05:16.770> YouTube

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
is scary for one of the bigger YouTube

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.010 
is scary for one of the bigger YouTube
commentators<00:05:17.819> who<00:05:17.969> has<00:05:18.240> had<00:05:18.509> a<00:05:18.539> passion<00:05:18.990> for

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
commentators who has had a passion for

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.320 
commentators who has had a passion for
call<00:05:19.289> of<00:05:19.319> duty<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.430> not<00:05:20.669> like<00:05:20.969> it<00:05:21.150> right

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
call of duty to just not like it right
