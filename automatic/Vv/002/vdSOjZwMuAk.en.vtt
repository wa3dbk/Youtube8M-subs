he's just gonna want to go for the fake

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
he's just gonna want to go for the fake
out<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> switch<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.189> i<00:00:32.250> go<00:00:32.399> into<00:00:32.520> sand<00:00:32.790> /

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
out and switch so i go into sand /

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.459 
out and switch so i go into sand /
knowing<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.420> take<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> fake<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.050> or<00:00:34.260> high

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
knowing I could take a fake out or high

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889 
knowing I could take a fake out or high
jump<00:00:34.770> kick<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.670> use<00:00:35.850> sand<00:00:36.149> /<00:00:36.329> /<00:00:36.660> claydol

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
jump kick and I use sand / / claydol

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.190 
jump kick and I use sand / / claydol
because<00:00:37.670> sand<00:00:38.670> /<00:00:38.910> has<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> 100<00:00:39.780> base<00:00:39.899> attack

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
because sand / has a 100 base attack

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.830 
because sand / has a 100 base attack
stat<00:00:40.500> santhosh<00:00:41.309> has<00:00:41.489> better<00:00:41.820> HP<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.450> defense

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
stat santhosh has better HP and defense

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.299 
stat santhosh has better HP and defense
and<00:00:43.020> they're<00:00:43.170> both<00:00:43.260> physically<00:00:43.860> defensive

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and they're both physically defensive

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.400 
and they're both physically defensive
walls<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.510> sands<00:00:45.780> laughs<00:00:45.989> doesn't<00:00:46.230> have

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
walls and the sands laughs doesn't have

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
walls and the sands laughs doesn't have
the<00:00:46.590> psychic-type<00:00:47.039> which<00:00:47.460> hinders<00:00:47.910> claydol

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the psychic-type which hinders claydol

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
the psychic-type which hinders claydol
so<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.050> pretty<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.680> set<00:00:49.950> up<00:00:50.070> stealth

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so I pretty much I just set up stealth

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.439 
so I pretty much I just set up stealth
rocks<00:00:50.520> knowing<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:50.969> he<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
rocks knowing that he does have a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
rocks knowing that he does have a
spinner<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> form<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> clay<00:00:52.559> doll<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
spinner in the form of clay doll but I

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.790 
spinner in the form of clay doll but I
can<00:00:53.550> be<00:00:53.730> clay<00:00:54.000> doll<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:55.230> spin<00:00:55.559> blocker

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
can be clay doll because my spin blocker

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
can be clay doll because my spin blocker
can<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.399> an<00:00:56.579> earthquake<00:00:57.090> which<00:00:57.510> is

can take an earthquake which is

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
can take an earthquake which is
Chandelure<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.010> ohko<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.520> an

Chandelure and it can ohko with an

overheat or a shadow ball because I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
quite odd new you but it actually does

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
quite odd new you but it actually does
work<00:01:09.530> because<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.920> does<00:01:11.159> work<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:11.670> match

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
work because not does work in this match

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.899 
work because not does work in this match
but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.270> works<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.840> general<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
but it works in general because it can

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
but it works in general because it can
it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.450> speedy<00:01:15.720> threat<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.140> once

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it's a really speedy threat and once

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.170 
it's a really speedy threat and once
you've<00:01:16.350> ever<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.680> steel<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.979> rock<00:01:17.310> types<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you've ever the steel and rock types and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
you've ever the steel and rock types and
the<00:01:18.360> only<00:01:18.479> rock<00:01:18.750> type<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.259> use<00:01:19.439> rhyperior

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
the only rock type and you use rhyperior

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.289 
the only rock type and you use rhyperior
so<00:01:20.189> once<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.520> rid<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> steel<00:01:21.030> types

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so once you get rid of the steel types

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.289 
so once you get rid of the steel types
it<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> sweep<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> pretty<00:01:23.850> much<00:01:23.970> I

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
it just it can sweep so I pretty much I

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.510 
it just it can sweep so I pretty much I
just<00:01:24.509> set<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.780> spikes<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.470> after<00:01:25.890> taunting<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
suicune I didn't think he would stay in

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
suicune I didn't think he would stay in

and if he comes into his amoonguss my

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.970 
and if he comes into his amoonguss my
overheat<00:02:51.420> can<00:02:51.690> too<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:52.080> ko<00:02:52.260> everything<00:02:52.740> on<00:02:52.860> his

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
overheat can too at ko everything on his

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.530 
overheat can too at ko everything on his
team<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.670> what<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.850> really<00:02:54.090> should<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.360> done

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
team so what I really should have done

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.880 
team so what I really should have done
here<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:54.870> went<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.170> chandelure<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.740> just

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
here was went to chandelure and just

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.130 
here was went to chandelure and just
overheated<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.670> go<00:02:57.240> into<00:02:57.360> my<00:02:57.510> dorm<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.900> attend

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
overheated I go into my dorm and attend

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.600 
overheated I go into my dorm and attend
based<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.709> often<00:02:58.950> I've<00:02:59.190> been<00:02:59.370> over

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
based on how often I've been over

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.250 
based on how often I've been over
predicting<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.209> don't<00:03:00.540> think<00:03:00.630> he'll<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.110> go

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
predicting I don't think he'll just go

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.590 
predicting I don't think he'll just go
into<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> suicune<00:03:02.040> thinking<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.270> go<00:03:03.450> for

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
into a suicune thinking that all go for

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.750 
into a suicune thinking that all go for
the<00:03:03.690> u-turn<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.070> thought<00:03:05.250> he<00:03:05.370> would<00:03:05.459> stay
