and I think I want to go like 8 times ok
so<00:04:43.860> now<00:04:44.039> let's<00:04:44.070> go<00:04:44.460> ahead<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.700> hit<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:45.030> play

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
so now let's go ahead and hit the play

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.290 
so now let's go ahead and hit the play
button<00:04:45.560> or<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.130> spacebar<00:04:47.610> whichever<00:04:48.030> one<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
button or the spacebar whichever one you

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.500 
button or the spacebar whichever one you
want<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:49.229> now<00:04:49.919> it's<00:04:50.250> looking<00:04:50.610> like<00:04:50.729> a<00:04:50.789> proper

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
want and now it's looking like a proper

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.460 
want and now it's looking like a proper
time-lapse<00:04:52.289> video<00:04:53.750> well<00:04:54.750> that's<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.200> that's

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
time-lapse video well that's it that's

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.450 
time-lapse video well that's it that's
the<00:04:55.680> tutorial<00:04:56.479> basically<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.510> use<00:04:57.810> my<00:04:57.960> GoPro

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
the tutorial basically I use my GoPro

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.550 
the tutorial basically I use my GoPro
set<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.669> for<00:05:00.060> one<00:05:00.479> picture<00:05:00.660> every<00:05:00.810> 10<00:05:01.080> seconds

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
set it for one picture every 10 seconds

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.380 
set it for one picture every 10 seconds
which<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.490> one<00:05:02.640> of<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.820> settings<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.300> do

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
which is one of the settings you can do

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.020 
which is one of the settings you can do
1<00:05:03.570> second<00:05:03.990> 5<00:05:04.169> seconds<00:05:04.620> whatever<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.220> then

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
1 second 5 seconds whatever and then

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.800 
1 second 5 seconds whatever and then
imported<00:05:06.810> all<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.050> images<00:05:07.350> in<00:05:08.510> made<00:05:09.510> sure

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
imported all the images in made sure

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.970 
imported all the images in made sure
before<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.229> actually

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
before I actually

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.270 
before I actually
imported<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.040> images<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.640> that<00:05:13.820> my<00:05:15.280> settings

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
imported the images in that my settings

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.270 
imported the images in that my settings
were<00:05:16.460> set<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.970> no<00:05:17.360> Ken<00:05:17.660> Burns<00:05:17.930> was<00:05:18.290> fit<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.040> I

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
were set to no Ken Burns was fit and I

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.940 
were set to no Ken Burns was fit and I
was<00:05:19.430> as<00:05:19.580> short<00:05:19.820> as<00:05:19.910> possible<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.450> clip<00:05:20.660> time

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
was as short as possible on a clip time

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.260 
was as short as possible on a clip time
so<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:21.980> didn't<00:05:22.280> have<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.490> go<00:05:22.580> back<00:05:22.760> in<00:05:22.910> later<00:05:23.060> and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
so I didn't have to go back in later and

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.200 
so I didn't have to go back in later and
edit<00:05:24.040> exported<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.160> as<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.280> movie<00:05:25.640> then<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:25.910> read

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
edit exported it as a movie then I read

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.030 
edit exported it as a movie then I read
it<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:26.900> then<00:05:27.860> sped<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:28.340> up<00:05:28.400> with<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:28.850> faster

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
it and then sped it up with the faster

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.140 
it and then sped it up with the faster
thing<00:05:31.040> we<00:05:31.280> can<00:05:31.400> actually<00:05:31.460> make<00:05:31.730> it<00:05:31.760> shorter<00:05:32.120> to

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
thing we can actually make it shorter to

wasn't good enough I should have done

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.510 
wasn't good enough I should have done
every<00:05:44.570> second<00:05:45.500> or<00:05:45.620> every<00:05:45.650> two<00:05:45.950> seconds<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:46.430> I

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
every second or every two seconds and I

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.040 
every second or every two seconds and I
might<00:05:46.700> actually<00:05:46.940> caught<00:05:47.720> some<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:47.960> the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
might actually caught some of the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.260 
might actually caught some of the
lightning<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.530> was<00:05:48.620> happening<00:05:48.980> but<00:05:49.940> anyways

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
lightning that was happening but anyways

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.910 
lightning that was happening but anyways
it<00:05:50.540> was<00:05:50.630> just<00:05:50.840> an<00:05:50.960> experiment<00:05:51.380> so<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.680> could

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
it was just an experiment so I could

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.460 
it was just an experiment so I could
actually<00:05:52.070> do<00:05:52.400> this<00:05:52.520> tutorial<00:05:53.030> again<00:05:53.990> thanks
