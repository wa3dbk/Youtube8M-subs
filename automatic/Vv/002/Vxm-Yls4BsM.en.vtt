00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.630 
strong AI agent has a couple other
things<00:01:28.409> going<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.009> let's<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.369> guys

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
things going for but let's show you guys

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.219 
things going for but let's show you guys
that<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.299> particular<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.840> i'm<00:01:30.900> gonna<00:01:30.990> try<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that in particular so i'm gonna try to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
that in particular so i'm gonna try to
make<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.530> attacks<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.220> faster

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
make these attacks a little bit faster

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.120 
make these attacks a little bit faster
I've<00:01:32.939> realized<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.570> watch<00:01:34.439> my<00:01:34.650> videos<00:01:34.979> back

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
I've realized that watch my videos back

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.679 
I've realized that watch my videos back
I<00:01:35.340> feel<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:35.759> attacks<00:01:36.030> are<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> little

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I feel like my attacks are just a little

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.450 
I feel like my attacks are just a little
too<00:01:36.840> slow<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.350> am<00:01:37.470> trying<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.829> analyze<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
too slow I am trying to analyze and

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
too slow I am trying to analyze and
stuff<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.810> doesn't<00:01:40.110> always

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
stuff like that but it doesn't always

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.560 
stuff like that but it doesn't always
work<00:01:40.350> out<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.430> well<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.790> I'd<00:01:41.939> hoped<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
work out so well as I'd hoped so

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.850 
work out so well as I'd hoped so
whatever<00:01:42.990> we're<00:01:43.140> gonna<00:01:43.200> destroy<00:01:43.740> these

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
whatever we're gonna destroy these

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.080 
whatever we're gonna destroy these
builders<00:01:44.189> we're<00:01:44.399> probably<00:01:44.670> gonna<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.030> our

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
builders we're probably gonna get our

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
builders we're probably gonna get our
drag<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> take<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.689> out<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:45.899> all<00:01:45.990> good<00:01:46.259> we're

now going to place down our molars place
down<00:01:48.630> our<00:01:48.810> wardens<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> follow<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.829> let's

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
down our wardens to follow it up let's

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.969 
down our wardens to follow it up let's
go<00:01:50.460> saving<00:01:50.880> enough<00:01:51.119> mana<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.649> breadth

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
go saving enough mana for this breadth

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
go saving enough mana for this breadth
of<00:01:53.159> raw<00:01:53.369> skill<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.180> need<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.420> is

matter<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.310> means<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.670> we

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
matter because of this this means if we

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.699 
matter because of this this means if we
snipe<00:02:21.090> off<00:02:21.359> a<00:02:21.569> true<00:02:21.810> Pro<00:02:21.989> like<00:02:22.079> gives<00:02:22.349> us<00:02:22.469> four

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
snipe off a true Pro like gives us four

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.800 
snipe off a true Pro like gives us four
we<00:02:23.099> will<00:02:23.249> immediately<00:02:23.549> get<00:02:24.389> some<00:02:24.629> fire

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
we will immediately get some fire

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.360 
we will immediately get some fire
elementals<00:02:25.409> this<00:02:25.590> means<00:02:25.859> we<00:02:26.040> don't

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
elementals this means we don't

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.699 
elementals this means we don't
necessarily<00:02:26.549> need<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.510> run<00:02:27.840> some<00:02:28.109> Mahler's<00:02:28.500> or

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
necessarily need to run some Mahler's or

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.610 
necessarily need to run some Mahler's or
soldiers<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.639> tank<00:02:29.879> we<00:02:30.030> can<00:02:30.269> run<00:02:30.569> more<00:02:31.139> wardens

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
soldiers as tank we can run more wardens

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.039 
soldiers as tank we can run more wardens
if<00:02:31.769> you'd<00:02:32.069> like<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.579> do<00:02:32.939> some<00:02:33.150> more<00:02:33.239> damage<00:02:33.599> use

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.929 
if you'd like to do some more damage use
the<00:02:34.230> fire<00:02:34.530> elementals<00:02:35.219> to<00:02:35.370> tank<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.819> they

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
the fire elementals to tank now they

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.819 
the fire elementals to tank now they
don't<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.329> most<00:02:36.540> HP<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.230> there's<00:02:37.680> only

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
don't have the most HP and there's only

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.649 
don't have the most HP and there's only
two<00:02:38.069> of<00:02:38.189> them<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.700> still<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.209> very

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
two of them but still a very very

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.119 
two of them but still a very very
effective<00:02:40.109> strategy<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.919> what<00:02:41.040> I'm

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
effective strategy so that is what I'm

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.259 
effective strategy so that is what I'm
going<00:02:41.249> to<00:02:41.280> show<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.519> today<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:42.060> we're<00:02:42.180> going

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
to attack from this side because I do

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.830 
to attack from this side because I do
see<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.069> quite<00:02:44.639> big<00:02:45.000> opening<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.719> who<00:02:45.810> might

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
have the bunker which is summoning some

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.270 
have the bunker which is summoning some
very<00:03:43.139> strong<00:03:43.409> troops<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.859> could<00:03:43.979> use<00:03:44.099> it<00:03:44.250> to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
very strong troops you could use it to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.979 
very strong troops you could use it to
slow<00:03:44.519> them<00:03:44.699> down<00:03:44.729> a<00:03:44.879> little<00:03:45.000> bit<00:03:45.299> overall<00:03:45.959> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
slow them down a little bit overall I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
slow them down a little bit overall I
just<00:03:46.229> find<00:03:46.409> its<00:03:46.620> most<00:03:46.859> effective<00:03:47.340> when<00:03:47.489> you

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
just find its most effective when you

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.649 
just find its most effective when you
need<00:03:47.699> to<00:03:47.790> finish<00:03:47.939> off<00:03:48.209> something<00:03:48.479> it<00:03:48.540> has<00:03:48.629> a

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
little bit health left but it's not

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.909 
little bit health left but it's not
