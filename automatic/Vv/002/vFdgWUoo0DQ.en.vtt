I<00:00:18.840> promised<00:00:19.830> loop<00:00:20.250> stir<00:00:20.550> round<00:00:21.090> too<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.720> I've

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
I promised loop stir round too and I've

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.380 
I promised loop stir round too and I've
spent<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> last<00:00:22.800> two<00:00:23.340> hours<00:00:23.400> trying<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> make

spent the last two hours trying to make
that<00:00:24.600> happen<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.320> cannot<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.369> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
that happen and I just cannot get it to

anyway<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:29.039> put<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> string<00:00:29.580> line<00:00:29.820> down<00:00:30.150> this

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
anyway so I put a string line down this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.430 
anyway so I put a string line down this
hill<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.279> trying<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.300> get<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> cars<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
hill and I was trying to get the cars to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.940 
hill and I was trying to get the cars to
go<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> way<00:00:35.250> down<00:00:35.670> there<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.739> then<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.800> had

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
go all the way down there and then I had

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
go all the way down there and then I had
a<00:00:37.980> loop<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.850> hoping<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.770> they<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a loop and I was hoping that they would

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670 
a loop and I was hoping that they would
loop<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.780> too<00:00:43.020> fast<00:00:43.290> as

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
loop but they just get going too fast as

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.670 
loop but they just get going too fast as
you're<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.289> because<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.469> hill

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you're about to see and because the hill

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.190 
you're about to see and because the hill
is<00:00:46.950> imperfect<00:00:47.489> they<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.360> flying<00:00:48.629> off<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.050> here

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is imperfect they go flying off so here

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.160 
is imperfect they go flying off so here
we<00:00:49.289> go<00:00:50.809> as<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.879> see<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.420> went<00:00:54.809> flying

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we go as you can see it just went flying

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
we go as you can see it just went flying
off<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.420> failed

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
off of there so this is my failed

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
off of there so this is my failed
attempt<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.219> bringing<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> guys<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> round<00:01:01.079> two

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
attempt at bringing you guys a round two

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
attempt at bringing you guys a round two
of<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.890> loop<00:01:02.070> stir<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.570> what

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of a loop stir just so you can see what

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.020 
of a loop stir just so you can see what
we're<00:01:03.899> working<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> pretty

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
we're working with here it's a pretty

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850 
we're working with here it's a pretty
steep<00:01:06.330> hill<00:01:06.360> been<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.560> thing<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
steep hill been up and down this thing a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.039 
steep hill been up and down this thing a
few<00:01:08.159> times<00:01:08.460> today<00:01:08.790> trying<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.869> this

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
few times today trying to get this

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.320 
few times today trying to get this
straight

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
straight

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
straight
finally<00:01:12.330> decided<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> string<00:01:13.680> line<00:01:13.920> as

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
finally decided to get a string line as

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.950 
finally decided to get a string line as
you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> still<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.780> bit

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
crooked but that's a lot better than it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.899 
done shooting that last video and I
picked<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> track<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> occurred

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
picked up all the track and it occurred

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.730 
picked up all the track and it occurred
to<00:01:53.970> me<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.780> hill<00:01:55.110> here

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
to me that I have this little hill here

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.090 
to me that I have this little hill here
beside<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> house<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.500> think<00:01:58.799> we're<00:01:59.009> gonna

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
beside the house so I think we're gonna

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.060 
beside the house so I think we're gonna
give<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.399> a<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.640> on<00:02:00.570> there<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.590> give<00:02:01.860> us<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
give it a go on there so give us a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
give it a go on there so give us a
minute<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> set<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> track<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.509> gonna

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
minute to set up the track we're gonna

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.490 
minute to set up the track we're gonna
give<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> another<00:02:04.170> shot

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
give this another shot

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
give this another shot
all<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:04.770> guys<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.430> nearly<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.909> big<00:02:06.090> as

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
all right guys it's not nearly as big as

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.979 
all right guys it's not nearly as big as
the<00:02:06.299> last<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.429> about<00:02:08.580> 30<00:02:08.849> feet

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
the last one but it's about 30 feet

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.800 
the last one but it's about 30 feet
and<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> loop<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.209> gotta<00:02:12.359> help<00:02:12.569> down

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and we have a loop you gotta help down

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440 
and we have a loop you gotta help down
with<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.140> sledgehammer<00:02:13.620> there<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.370> let's<00:02:15.209> see

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
with the sledgehammer there so let's see

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630 
with the sledgehammer there so let's see
I<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:15.870> loop<00:02:16.379> stir<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:16.980> let's<00:02:17.370> see<00:02:17.519> if

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I got one loop stir here let's see if

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.610 
I got one loop stir here let's see if
it'll<00:02:17.790> loop<00:02:20.689> 1<00:02:21.689> loop<00:02:21.719> sir<00:02:22.049> does<00:02:22.260> pretty<00:02:22.500> good

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
it'll loop 1 loop sir does pretty good

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.339 
it'll loop 1 loop sir does pretty good
there's<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.489> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.909> lift<00:02:24.209> up<00:02:24.450> in<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.689> trek<00:02:24.989> but

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
there's a lot of lift up in the trek but

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.979 
there's a lot of lift up in the trek but
I<00:02:25.829> dress<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.639> here<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> little<00:02:27.030> bit<00:02:27.180> later<00:02:27.359> so

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
I dress that here a little bit later so

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.709 
I dress that here a little bit later so
here<00:02:28.109> comes<00:02:28.319> two<00:02:28.590> loop<00:02:28.799> stirs<00:02:32.209> two<00:02:33.209> loop<00:02:33.450> stirs

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:33.719 
here comes two loop stirs two loop stirs

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.589 
here comes two loop stirs two loop stirs
made<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.109> through<00:02:34.319> there<00:02:34.530> pretty<00:02:34.799> smoothly

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
made it through there pretty smoothly

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.890 
made it through there pretty smoothly
now<00:02:36.599> we<00:02:36.659> move<00:02:37.049> on<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.319> three<00:02:38.010> loop<00:02:38.400> stirs<00:02:41.900> they

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
now we move on to three loop stirs they

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.390 
now we move on to three loop stirs they
made<00:02:43.169> it<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.590> decided<00:02:43.889> that<00:02:44.129> they<00:02:44.340> were

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
made it but I decided that they were

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.250 
made it but I decided that they were
picking<00:02:44.639> the<00:02:44.849> track<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.299> just<00:02:45.540> way<00:02:45.750> too<00:02:45.810> much

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
picking the track up just way too much

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.539 
picking the track up just way too much
so<00:02:47.180> here<00:02:48.180> comes<00:02:48.540> my<00:02:48.870> famous<00:02:49.470> crocks<00:02:50.069> if<00:02:50.400> you

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.059 
about the Crocs and the slo-mo rock
placement<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.469> took<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.769> out<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:55.919> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
placement and took that out of the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.000 
placement and took that out of the
landscaping<00:02:56.639> and<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:58.109> know<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.439> just<00:02:58.799> thought

placement of that rock to hold down the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.479 
placement of that rock to hold down the
track

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
track

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.580 
track
alright<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.609> rock<00:03:05.819> is<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.510> place<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.469> we're

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
alright the rock is in place and we're

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.300 
alright the rock is in place and we're
ready<00:03:07.769> to<00:03:07.950> go

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
ready to go

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.429 
ready to go
coming<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.060> with<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.450> loop<00:03:09.689> stirs<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:10.139> I

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
coming in with for loop stirs now I

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.020 
coming in with for loop stirs now I
changed<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.159> white<00:03:11.340> balance<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.760> little<00:03:11.819> bit

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
changed the white balance a little bit

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.399 
changed the white balance a little bit
for<00:03:12.209> some<00:03:12.359> reason<00:03:12.659> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.840> video<00:03:13.049> but<00:03:13.319> that's

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
for some reason on the video but that's

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.469 
for some reason on the video but that's
okay<00:03:13.829> it's<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.489> four<00:03:14.699> leap<00:03:14.879> stirs<00:03:15.180> made<00:03:15.359> it

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:15.479 
okay it's a four leap stirs made it

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.899 
okay it's a four leap stirs made it
through<00:03:15.659> there<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.409> fine<00:03:16.859> we're<00:03:17.609> gonna<00:03:17.729> go

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
through there just fine we're gonna go

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.789 
through there just fine we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.359> give<00:03:18.449> five<00:03:18.750> loops<00:03:19.019> or<00:03:19.229> to<00:03:19.349> try<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
ahead and give five loops or to try and

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.819 
ahead and give five loops or to try and
see<00:03:19.979> what<00:03:20.099> happens<00:03:21.049> five<00:03:22.049> loops<00:03:22.379> there's<00:03:22.650> no

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
see what happens five loops there's no

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.399 
see what happens five loops there's no
problem<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:23.909> jump<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.419> up<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.690> ten<00:03:25.049> so

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
problem now we jump it up to ten so

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.520 
problem now we jump it up to ten so
there<00:03:25.590> goes<00:03:25.769> ten<00:03:26.220> loop<00:03:26.549> stirs<00:03:26.849> as<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.260> see

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
there goes ten loop stirs as you can see

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.649 
there goes ten loop stirs as you can see
there<00:03:28.859> was<00:03:29.040> some<00:03:29.220> issues<00:03:29.609> pretty<00:03:29.939> epic<00:03:30.150> crash

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
there was some issues pretty epic crash

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.110 
there was some issues pretty epic crash
though<00:03:31.049> which<00:03:31.769> I'll<00:03:32.310> let<00:03:32.549> you<00:03:32.639> see<00:03:32.819> again

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
though which I'll let you see again

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.159 
though which I'll let you see again
right<00:03:33.329> there<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.689> what<00:03:33.840> I've<00:03:33.959> noticed

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
right there so what I've noticed

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.679 
right there so what I've noticed
happened<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.889> slow-mo<00:03:35.370> video<00:03:35.760> it's<00:03:36.449> the

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
happened in that slow-mo video it's the

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.390 
happened in that slow-mo video it's the
ones<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.199> front<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.650> loop<00:03:37.799> started

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
ones in the front of the loop started

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.159 
ones in the front of the loop started
slowing<00:03:38.699> down<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.479> back<00:03:39.689> of<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.019> loop

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
slowing down in the back of the loop

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.319 
slowing down in the back of the loop
came<00:03:40.590> up<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:40.949> started<00:03:41.189> pushing<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.849> which

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
came up and started pushing it which

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.249 
came up and started pushing it which
broke<00:03:42.659> it<00:03:42.810> apart<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.290> caused<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.040> crash<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.729> I

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:45.259 
broke it apart and caused the crash so I

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.319 
broke it apart and caused the crash so I
thought<00:03:46.259> I<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:47.009> 20<00:03:47.400> loop<00:03:47.609> stirs<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> left

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
thought I have 20 loop stirs but I left

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.849 
thought I have 20 loop stirs but I left
one<00:03:48.629> on<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:48.840> hill<00:03:49.049> that's<00:03:49.500> what<00:03:49.620> you're<00:03:49.739> about

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
one on the hill that's what you're about

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.390 
one on the hill that's what you're about
to<00:03:49.919> see<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.340> 19<00:03:51.090> loop<00:03:51.449> stirs<00:03:51.720> go<00:03:52.500> through<00:03:53.099> the

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
to see is 19 loop stirs go through the

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.869 
to see is 19 loop stirs go through the
loop<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:53.939> here<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.299> go<00:03:56.810> yeah<00:03:57.810> total<00:03:58.590> carnage

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
loop so here we go yeah total carnage

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.460 
loop so here we go yeah total carnage
absolutely<00:03:59.879> awesome<00:04:00.120> no<00:04:00.689> it's<00:04:01.199> such<00:04:01.319> an

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
absolutely awesome no it's such an

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.110 
absolutely awesome no it's such an
awesome<00:04:01.680> crash<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.549> wanted<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.909> share

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
awesome crash that I wanted to share

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.280 
awesome crash that I wanted to share
that<00:04:03.359> with<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.689> guys<00:04:03.720> again<00:04:05.959> pretty<00:04:06.959> much<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
that with you guys again pretty much the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.929 
that with you guys again pretty much the
same<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.739> happened<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.220> fact<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.699> front

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
same thing happened the fact the front

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.689 
same thing happened the fact the front
one<00:04:09.090> started<00:04:09.540> slowing<00:04:09.780> down<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:11.009> the<00:04:11.489> back

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
one started slowing down so the back

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.170 
one started slowing down so the back
ones<00:04:12.000> started<00:04:12.419> pushing<00:04:12.689> through<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.939> it<00:04:14.939> just

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
ones started pushing through and it just

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.659 
ones started pushing through and it just
just<00:04:15.889> disintegrated<00:04:16.889> and<00:04:16.979> fell<00:04:17.159> apart<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
just disintegrated and fell apart but I

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.159 
just disintegrated and fell apart but I
think<00:04:17.909> there<00:04:18.029> was<00:04:18.150> actually<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.539> chain<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.840> six

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
think there was actually a chain of six

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.620 
think there was actually a chain of six
of<00:04:19.409> them<00:04:19.590> that<00:04:20.340> did<00:04:20.609> make<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.120> through<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
of them that did make it through the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.710 
of them that did make it through the
loop<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:22.079> at<00:04:22.200> some<00:04:22.409> point

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
loop there at some point

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.740 
loop there at some point
I<00:04:22.870> think<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:24.010> think<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.760> happened<00:04:25.180> anyways

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
I think I think that happened anyways

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.200 
I think I think that happened anyways
that<00:04:26.470> was<00:04:26.590> pretty<00:04:27.010> awesome<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.820> had<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.000> lot<00:04:28.180> of

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
that was pretty awesome I had a lot of

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.440 
that was pretty awesome I had a lot of
fun<00:04:28.480> putting<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:28.840> thing<00:04:29.050> together<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:30.580> don't

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450
