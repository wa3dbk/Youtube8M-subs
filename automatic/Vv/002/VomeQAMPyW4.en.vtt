00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 we will show you how to make a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 chocolate whipped cream so it's not 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 especially very light but what is it 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.340
 that's good you use why 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.080
 could to garnish a Christmas log 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 for a dessert for a small 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.010
 downright verrine - chocolate you go 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.990
 it's super simple we have cream 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.730
 fresh chocolate it rolls alone 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.529
 so we start with what his friend do 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.000
 then melt chocolate chocolate you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.689
 can either make it melt at 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.550
 bath 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.140
 so this not everything to direct contact does not 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.160
 do not have it heats too much otherwise you 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 can do without problem at 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.940
 microwave taking care of not 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
 too much heat because chocolate two 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510
 enemies the water is too much heat then 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.320
 we go to the microwave it's gone 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.450
 while chocolate background was the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 whole fresh cream especially not light 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.320
 and we go there, which is very cold 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.640
 especially that it is cold and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.640
 go the climb or whipped cream 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 at ena I think it's good for the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.840
 Damien whipped cream not look too much 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.400
 orbiter exactly facing these soups 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.159
 here is not showing too much if not beyond 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 genres and the obr okay here 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.590
 we have a cream that is very frothy 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 the islands chocolate and we see it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.910
 must be hot there and in fact we do 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.409
 we do not go to the total sling that 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.390
 should be enough will melt well the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.250
 chocolate 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 if I pour any chocolate two years with 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.509
 the cold of the whipped cream its wave 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.759
 rennais if you pay attention if you 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.830
 want to take a little cream here 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.610
 here here and I'll go with the 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.610
 heat it's no fear 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 there is something a little bit that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.009
 it 's been so already we'll put another one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.619
 the second third 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.670
 and there we lift and there we lift 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.630
 we will try to have something 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630
 well good ugly I think 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.759
 there we were shown how to achieve a 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.989
 chocolate chantilly l propeller and frothy 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 she's really perfect for 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.220
 use it here I had it's simple and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.220
