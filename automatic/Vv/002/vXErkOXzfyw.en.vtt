00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.440 
really think a first-person shooter
could<00:01:31.690> win<00:01:32.490> game<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.640> here<00:01:33.820> because<00:01:34.119> it's<00:01:34.270> just

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
could win game it here because it's just

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.180 
could win game it here because it's just
