 music stops or gets opportunities

 ronson do you think that's the failure mail 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.169
 and i think i think the one is a difference between 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.659
 between getting attention because 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.279

 family music no pain 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.989

 on 10 May 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.079
 he was inspired by the film I read 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.079
 you can set the cup abs 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:45.999

 four times a year 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.019
 have a clearer picture 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.159
 Trial number was already there had to come up with a nice life at a door 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.750
 this year 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.909
 they had to turn that film organ 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.509
 and sigma aldi 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.099
 dry humor that comes for this is thus in the print for the columns 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.479
 ring some sort of connexion or so the final later that some sort of 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.209
 almost tracing or something 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.209
 That worked out well and the but also for many people 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.749
 who, with it, cast the vote on this has turned it into a beautiful club 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:34.019
 yes and just the first time i failed the church from 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.929

 but yeah 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.089
 actually actually he had it not worth it i am i think so 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.089
 the club became very good 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.079
 water and green 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.759

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.110
 brinkman bearing 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.499
 China now you see it once 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.189
 the 4 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.150
 the desk of the focal point 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.559
 very many people have some of that 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:50.650
 the text 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.100
 a lot of mass falls on a cotton ball and you hear them but words 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.639
 it is very good to say how people think with much faster in one 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.860
 with a bowling 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.130
 the repertoire 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.130
 when that says it already covers forbidden fireworks 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.030
 look at the time I meet you 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.900
 or that you know you do 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.900
 justine henin who recently started the game 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:14.050
 well that is 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.499
 he was talked about 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.930
 when i miss a very weird lyrics in europe 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.930
 In addition, it is a serious advance 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.139
 it was breathing through his computer 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.349
 a kind of 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.800
 african behind 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.010
 a lot of sorrow 15 jan since elba should not just be held k 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.020
 the soldiers 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.639
 shadow beard southeast 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.639
 no idea where it would be nice 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.509
 he give this so we even have a dynamic twice 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.509
 it was just like having to learn in another language 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.960
 within therefore with the same conviction than leg of course that is quite difficult 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:53.879
 no importance of the ipod set and then 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.059
 that just stays and then 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:57.710
 what a country say the text 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
 they complain 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.039
 information or something 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.039
 but the turn the vocal lines where naturally 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.469
 katwijk i think i think you learn 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:19.490
 it contains going further or just about it 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.490
 how far I can handle it again 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.889
 last year all turned out to close too quickly 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.949
 I mean engrave you 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.369
 how strong 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:35.199
 you can say what the user knows what I do not 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.869
 we are now working on it 

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:39.639
 just a little hope 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.619
 mail for people with physical questions 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:44.619
 as far as possible, the Dutch doctors explained 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:50.169
 you see through your want to bring your music as far as possible that that is none 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.930
 crumbled place 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.420
 and he speaks of a girl who was at bali and who she through a turkish van 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.080
 autobahnen your police still clear that you saw that and that this 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:02.740
 far goes that 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.979
 but I think you are disadvantageous before you study the Netherlands 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:08.499
 that afternoon is not that big 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.539
 make you happen that nothing makes it difficult for me 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:15.490
 bit we are the are quite a bit now though 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.680
 there are now targeted 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.149
 have only seen this for a year and that is where we are 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:23.319
 with the beginning a little as much do not know about the music world 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:26.139
 that's so exciting 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:30.000
 but nice anyway but I wanted to step every seven years you know this is what we do 

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:30.770
 want 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.399
 we just keep going until 

00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.399
 that you know this it is just my conscience 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:39.949
 where the fed but I think nicer make laugh though 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:47.339
 no yes I will not sing along, but I thought that was a nice ending 

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:48.509
 franky to the interview
