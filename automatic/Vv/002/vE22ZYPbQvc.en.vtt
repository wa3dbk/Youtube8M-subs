00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
we solve the equation by distributing
the<00:02:01.110> negative<00:02:01.409> sign<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> term<00:02:02.490> inside<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
the negative sign to the term inside the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.310 
the negative sign to the term inside the
parentheses<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.899> remove<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
parentheses so we can remove the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.709 
parentheses so we can remove the
parentheses<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:05.790> finally<00:02:06.090> solve<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.479> divide

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
parentheses to finally solve we divide

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
parentheses to finally solve we divide
both<00:02:06.930> sides<00:02:07.229> by<00:02:07.350> negative<00:02:07.469> 1<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> n

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
both sides by negative 1 so that n

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.309

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.229 
the points plotted on a number line
let's<00:04:04.799> look<00:04:04.980> at<00:04:05.070> one<00:04:05.250> last<00:04:05.489> problem<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.150> this

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
let's look at one last problem for this

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.620 
let's look at one last problem for this
video<00:04:07.640> stop<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> video<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:09.329> if<00:04:09.359> you<00:04:09.480> can

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
video stop the video and see if you can

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.090 
video stop the video and see if you can
solve<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.989> then<00:04:10.140> restart<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.769> see<00:04:10.890> if<00:04:11.010> you

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
solve it then restart it to see if you

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.699 
solve it then restart it to see if you
got<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.370> right

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.229 

can<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.919> absolute<00:04:17.280> value<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.639> this<00:04:17.940> or

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
can the absolute value of this or

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.990 
can the absolute value of this or
anything<00:04:18.450> be<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> negative<00:04:19.049> number<00:04:19.260> like

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
anything be a negative number like

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.600 
anything be a negative number like
negative<00:04:21.000> seven<00:04:22.130> there<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.250> no<00:04:23.400> solution

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
negative seven there is no solution

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.580 
negative seven there is no solution
there<00:04:24.030> is<00:04:24.060> no<00:04:24.180> number<00:04:24.540> for<00:04:24.840> n<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.230> makes<00:04:25.410> this

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
there is no number for n that makes this

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.650 
there is no number for n that makes this
a<00:04:25.650> true<00:04:25.740> statement<00:04:26.160> it's<00:04:26.550> like<00:04:26.730> asking<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.419> pig

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
a true statement it's like asking a pig

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.720 
a true statement it's like asking a pig
to<00:04:27.870> fly<00:04:28.080> trying<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.950> solve<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.340> one<00:04:29.550> it's

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
to fly trying to solve this one it's

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.150 
to fly trying to solve this one it's
impossible<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:31.410> get<00:04:31.560> something<00:04:31.889> out<00:04:31.980> of<00:04:32.010> this

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
impossible to get something out of this

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.770 
impossible to get something out of this
last<00:04:32.340> problem<00:04:32.760> let's<00:04:32.970> change<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.570> negative

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
last problem let's change that negative

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.560 
last problem let's change that negative
seven<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:35.100> seven<00:04:35.550> then<00:04:35.730> solve<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:39.150> separate

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
seven to seven then solve it we separate

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.030 
seven to seven then solve it we separate
the<00:04:39.690> absolute<00:04:40.020> value<00:04:40.290> function<00:04:40.320> into<00:04:40.860> two
