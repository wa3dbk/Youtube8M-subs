00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.790
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.920
 this new video 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.510
 today as the title suggests we will see 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.910
 how to install paid apps 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.460
 so completely free of ours 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.320
 mobile devices in the devices 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 question include the ipod iphone 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.769
 touch and the ipad 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 all this without needing to 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.070
 jailbreak so we will not lose the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.230
 warranty on our devices 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.719
 before starting with the real guide 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.879
 but I would like to remind you of some of them 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.469
 premise that I have not put it 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.629
 no responsibility for what 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.489
 your devices could happen e 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.020
 which in any case this is a guide 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.820
 for informational purposes only 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 in fact if you like an application 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.219
 his app has been so much purchased 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.930
 store 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 supporting developers for their 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 work said this let's get started 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 we open a browser in my safari case e 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.340
 we go on the link that they leave you in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.199
 Description 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.140
 once the page is loaded, click 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.689
 on the green button a load will discharge 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.590
 a dmg file weighing 18 megabytes 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.110
 so it shouldn't take much 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.830
 once finished and download we will click on the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.400
 button to go to the download folder 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.840
 and we will mount the dmg file this is here 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.060
 the interface that there is going to 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 present as usual for any 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570
 installation program on mac 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.979
 we will take the application is the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.049
 we will drag to the folder of 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.530
 applications in my case I do not 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.220
 because we can already do it then 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.930
 expel mg once installed 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.310
 the application we connect ours 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.090
 computer device 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.799
 in my case it is maicon 4s with ios and 7.1.1 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.159
 if it opens up as intense as in my case 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.060
 close it because we won't need it 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.280
 then open the application 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.040
 this is the interface here 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.110
 will present how I realized too 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.700
 all application in Japanese though 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.189
 rest assured why install 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.960
 the application is very, very simple 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.240
 here you will appear in yours 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.989
 device with all the indications that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 obviously for privacy I will go to censor 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.750
 after which to install the applications 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.489
 we go on the following menu and then on 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.870
 menu at the top right on the coffin at the top 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.340
 to the right and type in the name 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.660
 application we want to download 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.630
 my case 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 minecraft pocket edition after a fast 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.870
 loading c will appear on the list 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.910
 of applications 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.890
 let's go find what we are 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.690
 it concerns precisely minecraft with choices 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.420
 charming and we lean on the arrow 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.310
 above as we can see there will be 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.950
 two icons and we must click 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.080
 blue icon on the left as you can 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.120
 see the application the title 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.590
 indeed the application is in Japanese 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.230
 but you are calm because 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.870
 the application in English or Italian 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.660
 once clicked one will succeed 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.609
 notification here on the left we click and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.070
 as you can see is the download 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.690
 the application that started the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.609
 application download and its 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.859
 speeds vary depending on the 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.840
 speed of our connection and 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.489
 weight of the application itself 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.480
 in this case minecraft pocket edition 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.670
 weighs only 7.82 megabytes so not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.859
 they should take a lot though in the case 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.650
 of most famous applications as per 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.870
 example gta san andreas who weigh a 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.380
 jig and something could put us 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.019
 even half an hour three quarters of an hour 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.420
 once you have finished downloading as you have 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.750
 just seen the application will disappear 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.330
 from this menu 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.200
 and will appear in the menu below 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.760
 we don't click on it and we will find it here 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.740
 once the device is connected 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.600
 memory must always be connected 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.940
 during this procedure we click on 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.190
 button on the left and how we can 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.140
 see if a synchronization will come 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.140
 application on our device 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.120
 once the synchronization is finished we can 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.940
 go to the device and we will find 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.690
 the application here we are on ours 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.910
 device 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.890
 as we can see by going to the menu a 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.530
 the application will appear on the right 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.390
 just installed but starting in 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.180
 most cases the application 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.410
 will grow in this case is not hunted 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.100
 because we had a lot of luck 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.640
 but in the Greek case crush axis will suffice e 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.430
 open the application dense 25 travel 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.650
 on the menu of our device and falls 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.880
 simply on the key icon e 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.770
 after a couple of seconds 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.990
 we will have the application and all the others 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.300
 applications that first fall with the 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.960
 crash memory as you can see 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.580
 the application works perfectly 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.729
 to it it creates a world in mode 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.380
 creative and as you can see it is 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.260
 fully functional 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.530
 we await the loading of the world like this 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.900
 I can stay away from the application 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.100
 in this video or downloaded minecraft ma 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.780
 you can download any 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.510
 game application or application a 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.740
 payment that is on the app store 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.260
 in case there are not some 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.610
 applications don't worry though 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.840
 because this tool is continuous 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.120
 updating 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.490
 as you can see from the video and minecraft 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.479
 it works if from some snap is because 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.150
 I'm using the iPhone 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.070
 in the application through airplay 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.250
 mirroring but on our device 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.190
 this will work perfectly 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.680
 I go out of the iphone 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.270
 here we are guys for today the video 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.070
