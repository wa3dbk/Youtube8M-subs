00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.230
 7 you were already here with that 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.720
 panorama was found and well they had already 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.930

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.390
 that there were people hurt but no no no 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.630
 that what I saw was not not enough to see 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.849
 nothing but I think the curve that has 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.369
 here of villa voice of the station for 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.250
 this side not the people who cross to the step 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.540
 level of the traffic there as 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.879
 they are fixing some bridges in 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.410
 crowned everyone goes through here 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.820
 believes according to some testimonies that the 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 barrier was apparently low that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.130
 apparently it was low 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.290
 and the truck is when that's why the train does not 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.670
 sorry the barrier was broken so 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.890
 you can see that the truck took her ahead 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.070
 that low and it is believed that the change the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 broke the bankrupt and it's an area where 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.160
 have registered a hundred percent 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.780
 the bonus is that it's a lot that is not 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 they recorded these accidents I keep 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.650
 pretty brave accident not many people 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.030
 has died here in the car everything is but to the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.430
 people sometimes a little unconscious 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.350
 also not 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 that the barrier down there but the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.970
 dodge anise 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
 and the train on this side has high 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 crowned villava speed is a 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 pull that much speed is believed to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.320
 there were some injured is with you 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.500
 I mentioned apparently we have not 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.380
 deceased or deceased not but the driver 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.330
 of the train the motorman says he was 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.190
 quite serious and the truck is 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.210
 downloaded because I think this truck 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.369
 belongs to the company to peugeot the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.710
 Brazilian driver could be the truck 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 Brazilian apparently but that already 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.770
 had downloaded on a peugeot and it came 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.770
 for here six and a half morning that vibrated 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.160
 the whole house I thought good I thought that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.630
 something happened but when I look at the truck it's 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.649
 the moment that the entire house vibrated not 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 when we came with my lady 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.830

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.869
