 let's start with the flags of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930
 ipab 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.130
 let's start the first Spain and 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.720
 you know two colors yellow and red three 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.630
 fringes above and below 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.460
 red and the yellow one of the center and 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.809
 I'm going to give a small grade between 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.809
 and others to make it look more beautiful 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.600
 for all the flags I will use the 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.609
 color water products are activated 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.259
 correct and remove with water so 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.159
 They are perfect for use in 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.159
 lips or in children 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 let's get from my favorite countries 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.450
 Argentina to the albiceleste worth it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.340
 let's start by creating a white area 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.020
 in the central area and then we will apply 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.790
 the second color of the flag that is a 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 celestial blue in the external zone and we're going 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 to do the same gradient process 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.400
 between the two tones and then we will give the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 touch of the sun which is the characteristic 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:02:03.119
 of the flag in the upper area of ​​the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:02:05.490
 lips flag mexico my dear 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.050
 As Mexico love mexico receipt of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.300

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 mexico let's start with the flag 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 they are three colors and in this case they are 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.459
 vertical not horizontal we're going to do 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.520
 the green left side the right side 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.560
 red and in the white center we're going to create 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.020
 the solid colors without any kind of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.820
 grace and on the upper part of the lip 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
 of the white zone apart from creating the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.560
 cupid's bow effect and let's 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.730
 recreate in the best we can the sign 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.170
 distinctive flag that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.170
 an eagle on the top 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.950
 sorry for the accent we're going with Brazil and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.540
 the hosts of the world we are going to 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.910
 start with one of the colors that is the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.319
 Green will paint or add by 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.000
 all the outer part of the lips 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.970
 creating a kind of diamond in the area 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.860
 central that we fill in yellow and 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.470
 in this same round the central zone 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.299
 we will fill in blue then just 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.980
 we have to cross a small line of 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.980
 white through the blue and you 're 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.380
 england that country that welcomed me when 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.690
 I decided to go and experience new things 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.640
 outside Spain is one of the flags 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.950
 that more aesthetics are left very 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.630
 pretty let's make a cross first 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.130
 that we are going to cross by the lips and 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.960
 then an X that we are going to cross by 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.190
 this cross 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.950
 we simply fill in the gaps that 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.200
 stay between these red lines in blue 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.240
 leaving a small space that will be 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.240
 for the white lines and you're 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.930
 and the last usa one of the most 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.550
 cool to recreate let's do 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.919
 just some parallel lines in 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 white and red on the lower lip and 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.940
 in the middle of the top tree in this 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.830
 case I think to see it having made it 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.260
 in a mirror what was done to the contrary had 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.080
 have done the blue part on the side 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.990
 exactly the opposite if you recreate them 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.120
 remember that you have to invest it on 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.160
 side that the lip that is free let's go 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.990
 to paint it blue and we make small 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.930
 dots a star effect are already 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.610
 our lips are not even for global 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.560

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.600

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.130
 easy to do and that is super nice 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.220
 Spanish and I love it because it has a 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.030
 effect so degraded man very cool
