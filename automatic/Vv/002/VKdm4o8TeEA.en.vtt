effects boxes I first started by in

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.839 
effects boxes I first started by in
cueing<00:00:07.810> them<00:00:07.960> making<00:00:08.769> them<00:00:09.040> fit<00:00:09.519> better<00:00:09.549> in

cueing them making them fit better in
the<00:00:09.969> mix<00:00:10.150> and<00:00:10.869> on<00:00:11.589> some<00:00:11.769> of<00:00:11.889> these<00:00:11.950> guitars<00:00:12.429> I

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669 
the mix and on some of these guitars I

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.759 
the mix and on some of these guitars I
added<00:00:12.999> the<00:00:13.150> 11<00:00:13.419> plugin<00:00:13.780> 11<00:00:14.349> is<00:00:14.440> one<00:00:14.589> of<00:00:14.679> my

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
added the 11 plugin 11 is one of my

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.620 
added the 11 plugin 11 is one of my
favorite<00:00:15.129> for<00:00:15.339> guitars<00:00:15.669> especially<00:00:16.449> if

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
favorite for guitars especially if

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.470 
favorite for guitars especially if
they're<00:00:16.810> not<00:00:16.930> recorded<00:00:17.380> will<00:00:18.300> Phoenix<00:00:19.300> is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
they're not recorded will Phoenix is

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.330 
they're not recorded will Phoenix is
used<00:00:19.929> on<00:00:20.140> the<00:00:20.230> rhythm<00:00:20.589> for<00:00:21.429> its<00:00:21.519> color

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
used on the rhythm for its color

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.820 
used on the rhythm for its color
and<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:24.120> DSM<00:00:24.510> compressor<00:00:24.990> was<00:00:25.320> used<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.710> the

and the DSM compressor was used on the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.030 
and the DSM compressor was used on the
lead<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.700> tame<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.030> loud<00:00:27.180> notes<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.650> DSM

processing

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.850 

you

using<00:01:37.790> EQ<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.450> compression<00:01:38.780> or<00:01:39.200> color<00:01:39.880> makes

the<00:01:41.000> guitars<00:01:41.330> fit<00:01:41.660> well<00:01:41.930> in<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.080> mix<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:43.220> I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
the guitars fit well in the mix but I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.190 
the guitars fit well in the mix but I
realized<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.480> they<00:01:44.600> could<00:01:44.780> use<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:44.960> little

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
realized that they could use a little

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.100 
realized that they could use a little
bit<00:01:45.350> more<00:01:45.410> grit<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.280> make<00:01:46.430> them<00:01:46.580> interesting

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
bit more grit to make them interesting

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.440 
bit more grit to make them interesting
for<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.230> I<00:01:48.470> always<00:01:49.040> always<00:01:49.400> rely<00:01:50.030> on<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.240> top

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
for this I always always rely on the top

of<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.840> song<00:01:54.020> it's<00:01:54.290> not<00:01:54.500> even<00:01:54.830> doing<00:01:54.920> one<00:01:55.400> DB

of the song it's not even doing one DB
of<00:01:55.670> compression<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:56.960> I'm<00:01:57.080> using<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.470> for

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
of compression so what I'm using it for

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.520 
of compression so what I'm using it for
is<00:01:57.770> color<00:01:58.360> listen<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.570> how<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.810> guitars<00:02:00.230> come

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
is color listen to how the guitars come

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.060 
is color listen to how the guitars come

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
more alive with it on I'm using this on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.710 
more alive with it on I'm using this on

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:45.490 

you

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.990 

finally<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.890> guitars<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.610> bus<00:02:47.790> B

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
finally all the guitars go to bus B

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.600 
finally all the guitars go to bus B
which<00:02:48.690> are<00:02:48.840> mostly<00:02:49.080> using<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.860> twin<00:02:50.099> tube<00:02:50.310> and

which are mostly using the twin tube and
Phoenix<00:02:51.030> during<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.110> mix<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.709> noticed<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
Phoenix during this mix I noticed that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.550 
Phoenix during this mix I noticed that
by<00:02:53.549> simply<00:02:53.819> having<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.330> twin<00:02:54.720> tube<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.230> the

by simply having the twin tube on the
guitar<00:02:55.830> bus<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> made<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:57.090> track<00:02:57.360> sound

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
guitar bus and made the track sound

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.869 
guitar bus and made the track sound
better<00:02:57.920> even<00:02:58.920> though<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.190> saturation<00:02:59.640> of

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
better even though the saturation of

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.720 
better even though the saturation of
harmonic<00:03:00.299> are<00:03:00.420> set<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.720> zero<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.549> then

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
harmonic are set to zero this is then

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.960 
harmonic are set to zero this is then
followed<00:03:02.760> by<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.390> crane<00:03:03.629> song<00:03:03.870> Phoenix<00:03:04.290> again

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
demonstrate now all I did on the paths

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.539 
demonstrate now all I did on the paths
was<00:03:11.280> EQ<00:03:11.700> them<00:03:11.849> using<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.870> McGee<00:03:13.260> SP<00:03:13.620> retro<00:03:14.250> EQ

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
was EQ them using the McGee SP retro EQ

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.460 
was EQ them using the McGee SP retro EQ
but<00:03:15.239> let's<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.540> ahead<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.810> listen<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.110> bus<00:03:16.319> a

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
now that we have the guitar sounding

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.740 
now that we have the guitar sounding
great<00:03:49.129> let's<00:03:49.910> go<00:03:50.030> ahead<00:03:50.120> and<00:03:50.330> listen<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.629> them
