00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
basically like this lace crop top but
it's<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.379> really<00:02:16.500> cropped<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.069> me<00:02:17.250> because

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000

and read more than just fiction novels

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.990 
and read more than just fiction novels
because<00:03:39.480> um<00:03:40.190> fiction<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.220> obviously<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.790> huge

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
because um fiction is obviously a huge

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.479 
because um fiction is obviously a huge
part<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> literary<00:03:43.200> world<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:44.459> I

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
than just fiction so I thought it would

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.180
