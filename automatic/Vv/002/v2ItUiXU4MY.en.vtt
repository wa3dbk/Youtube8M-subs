00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.360
 what is a corner kick so 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.549
 simple is a way to resume the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 game and when the game resumes with 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 a corner kick is very simple 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 after the ball has surpassed 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.169
 the entire goal line being 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 the defender the last to touch the ball 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.769
 without it having infringed and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.330
 previously the rules of the game and how 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.250
 comes out with corner kick in first 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.960
 place you have to place the ball in the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.839
 nearest corner where the ball 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.420
 came out you have to keep in mind that the 

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:37.769
 player a player of the attacking team 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.449
 will proceed to such launch the ball 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.329
 It can be placed anywhere in 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.879
 said area including those including 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 lines since they belong to the area 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.449
 which delimits although it may be annoying in 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 sometimes it will not be possible to remove 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.199
 under no circumstances the pennant of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.090
 corner since it has important function 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 the serve will have to be advanced 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 only with the foot and not with other 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 knitted parts at the moment the 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.350
 ball to move stay inside the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.550
 playing field and provided that the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.259
 player has not committed any 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 offense to get the ball longer 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.590
 will consider games and may be a deputy 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.940
 the other players who have had 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.740
 be placed at the regulatory distance 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.689
 from the corner 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 before doing those acts in that 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 you can directly score a goal 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 what in the world was called goal 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.649
 Olympic 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.229
 remember that if you are the thrower of 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.000
 said since you will not be able to touch the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.369
 ball until it is going to be touched 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.619
 by another player if you do not touch it 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.250
 will award a free shot in favor of 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.990
 adversary team 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 Do not make nervous results here
