00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.040
 outstanding 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.690
 but it seemed to me that the previous one 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.810
 baranova 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.100

 how did they ride 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.130
 in general, only in comparison with 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.550
 previous pair 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.200
 i tried bats 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 little is clear enough but I have a lot more to do 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 she is 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.970

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.850
 i also think muslim bill glasses 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 and it became clear to me that there would be no more 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 and here all further dramaturgy 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.049
 vip installation and speed theme chosen 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.549
 so deep and open 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.489
 so beautiful that 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.699
 and skill and 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.889
 inspiration united and 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.469
 Of course this is the highest rating I am extremely happy 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.169
 that they stayed a heart and only 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.169
 Polish politicians 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.739
 by the words he really liked you 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:42.759
 First I want to say what is good 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.839
 that Valera said that 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.839
 he thought 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.019
 it seemed to you 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.549
 from the point of view of 300 no I don't want to offend 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.989
 the man who first came to 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.129
 project 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.209
 he has his opinion especially opponents 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:16.739
 but I saw 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.949
 skates 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.309
 in the program time 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.519
 where he was born 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.579
 boys could swim more than 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.009
 to skate 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.079
 so I confess 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.699
 I probably was wrong 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.699
 but time ago his hands what to do 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.779
 we'll see 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.299
 10 5 9 it's a shame 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.299
 because 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.529
 not because i was crying i saw 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.869

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.339

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.399

 I know what to fit this 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.379

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.839
