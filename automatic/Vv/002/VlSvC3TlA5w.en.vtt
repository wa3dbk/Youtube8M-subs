00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
have much of a defined curl pattern so

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:49.559 
have much of a defined curl pattern so
for<00:02:32.970> those<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:33.690> coil<00:02:34.049> them

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.479 

so<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:55.780> did<00:03:56.140> kind<00:03:56.440> of<00:03:56.560> get<00:03:56.709> bored<00:03:57.069> of<00:03:57.250> waiting

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
so I did kind of get bored of waiting

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.550 
so I did kind of get bored of waiting
and<00:03:58.060> painting<00:03:58.540> my<00:03:58.690> nails<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.230> stuff<00:03:59.410> like

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
and painting my nails and stuff like

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.920 
and painting my nails and stuff like
that<00:03:59.769> so<00:03:59.800> I<00:04:00.099> did<00:04:00.519> just<00:04:00.730> decide<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.300> blow<00:04:01.599> dry<00:04:01.900> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
that so I did just decide to blow dry it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.550 
that so I did just decide to blow dry it
off<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.370> end<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.989> it's<00:04:04.989> an<00:04:05.050> old<00:04:05.230> rickety

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
off in the end and it's an old rickety

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.009 
off in the end and it's an old rickety
blow<00:04:06.220> dryer<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:06.970> only<00:04:07.150> got<00:04:07.450> like<00:04:07.629> three

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
blow dryer so it only got like three

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.110 
blow dryer so it only got like three
settings<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.709> I've<00:04:09.220> put<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.640> think<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:10.000> the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
settings and I've put it I think on the

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.630 
settings and I've put it I think on the
second<00:04:10.510> setting<00:04:10.750> so<00:04:11.140> that's<00:04:11.379> quite<00:04:11.739> hot<00:04:11.980> and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
second setting so that's quite hot and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.759 
second setting so that's quite hot and
as<00:04:12.910> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.150> see<00:04:13.330> I'm<00:04:13.420> um<00:04:13.599> concentrating<00:04:14.410> too

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
as you can see I'm um concentrating too

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.819 
as you can see I'm um concentrating too
much<00:04:14.799> in<00:04:15.280> one<00:04:15.519> area<00:04:15.849> zero<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.440> get<00:04:17.590> too

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
much in one area zero on it to get too

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.979 
much in one area zero on it to get too
hot<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.489> water<00:04:18.669> that's<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.419> my<00:04:19.690> hair<00:04:19.959> to

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
hot and the water that's on my hair to

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.909 
hot and the water that's on my hair to
boil<00:04:20.829> because<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.609> causes<00:04:22.030> damage<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.919> so

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
boil because that causes damage and so

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.270 
boil because that causes damage and so
I'm<00:04:24.220> just<00:04:24.250> blow-drying<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:26.380> rest<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.800> my<00:04:26.979> head

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
I'm just blow-drying the rest of my head

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.879 
I'm just blow-drying the rest of my head
feeling<00:04:27.940> around<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> damp<00:04:29.020> sections<00:04:29.650> to

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
feeling around for the damp sections to

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:46.840 
feeling around for the damp sections to
see<00:04:30.130> where<00:04:30.400> I<00:04:30.430> still<00:04:30.760> need<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.240> go

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.020 

and<00:04:47.780> that's<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.650> finished<00:04:48.860> result<00:04:49.520> as<00:04:49.820> you

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
and that's the finished result as you

them now that they dry and you have your

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.110 
them now that they dry and you have your
sort<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.770> fake<00:05:18.770> curls<00:05:19.430> that<00:05:19.640> you've<00:05:19.850> created

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
sort of fake curls that you've created

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:31.840 
sort of fake curls that you've created
there<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:21.230> those<00:05:21.500> sections<00:05:21.830> I<00:05:30.160> do<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.490> style

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
there in those sections I do the style

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.920 
there in those sections I do the style
about<00:05:32.210> once<00:05:32.540> every<00:05:33.010> three<00:05:34.010> days<00:05:34.780> depending<00:05:35.780> on

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
about once every three days depending on

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.540 
about once every three days depending on
if<00:05:36.050> I'm<00:05:36.170> going<00:05:36.470> anywhere<00:05:36.890> if<00:05:36.980> I'm<00:05:37.130> not<00:05:37.340> I'll

if I'm going anywhere if I'm not I'll

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.460 
if I'm going anywhere if I'm not I'll
probably<00:05:37.820> just<00:05:38.060> like<00:05:38.300> Cygnet<00:05:38.960> for<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.230> bit

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
probably just like Cygnet for a bit

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.000 
probably just like Cygnet for a bit
longer<00:05:39.770> but<00:05:40.550> otherwise<00:05:40.820> that's<00:05:41.510> about<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.080> so

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
longer but otherwise that's about it so

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.830 
longer but otherwise that's about it so
