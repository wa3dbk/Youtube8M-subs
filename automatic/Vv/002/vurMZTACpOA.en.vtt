00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.369
 energy efficiency program in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.550
 artisan brick kilns of america 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.700
 Latina to mitigate climate change 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 she the program 'he has started his 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.680
 second phase for a period of four 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.590
 years in seven countries of Latin America 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.720
 until 2016 the program ela 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.630
 will develop activities with near 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.340
 4,300 artisan brickmakers in the 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.200
 region with the aim of achieving 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.020
 massify technological innovations 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.430
 in the production processes the package 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 of measures includes the use of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.700
 fans 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.760
 fuel dispensers 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.760
 extruder machines 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.510
 and improved ovens 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.880
 This will allow 10 percent of 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.369
 artisan producers have a 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.990
 estimated reduction of 30 percent of 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.440
 the emanation of gases of effect 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.290
 greenhouse that adds approximately 800 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.600
 thousand tons of CO2 with an increase 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.159
 of your income of approximately 10 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.770
 million dollars per year for this it 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.210
 promote under a market approach the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.490
 participation of suppliers of 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.560
 technology and microfinance agents 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.050
 to bring the brick makers closer 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 craft the elements that improve 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.560
 their production 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.780
 The ultimate goal is to ensure that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.760
 producers know the benefits of 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.800
 efficient production and that 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.790
 finally migrate to the use of 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.790
 improved ovens 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.369
 In this way, the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.770
 benefits of efficient production in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.450
 this stage of the program 'el a todos 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.259
 we are part of the change 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.259
