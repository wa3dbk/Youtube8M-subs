slightly different there's gonna be a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.039 
slightly different there's gonna be a
slight<00:02:51.640> tweaking<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.359> where<00:02:52.599> stuff<00:02:52.900> is

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
slight tweaking of where stuff is

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.229 
slight tweaking of where stuff is
there's<00:02:53.680> gonna<00:02:53.829> be<00:02:54.069> better<00:02:54.340> resolutions

better graphics on it and the underbelly
I'll<00:02:58.440> probably<00:02:59.440> use<00:02:59.560> that<00:02:59.890> as<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> joke<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.459> a

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
I'll probably use that as a joke in a

I'll probably use that as a joke in a
little<00:03:00.730> bit<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:01.359> underbelly<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.409> going<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.250> be

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
little bit the underbelly is going to be

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.670 
little bit the underbelly is going to be

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
it - so I get both arguments

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.310 
it - so I get both arguments
I<00:05:44.979> get<00:05:45.340> why<00:05:45.520> Blizzard<00:05:46.060> would<00:05:46.539> say<00:05:46.840> yeah<00:05:47.169> we

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
I get why Blizzard would say yeah we

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.630 
I get why Blizzard would say yeah we
want<00:05:47.500> to<00:05:47.590> put<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:47.830> in<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.039> sewers<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.460> Dalaran

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.240 
want to put you in the sewers of Dalaran
but<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.270> also<00:05:49.479> get<00:05:49.990> why<00:05:50.260> rogues<00:05:50.620> themselves

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
but I also get why rogues themselves

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.670 
but I also get why rogues themselves
would<00:05:51.370> say<00:05:51.550> no<00:05:51.820> put<00:05:52.240> us<00:05:52.360> in<00:05:52.510> our<00:05:52.690> spiritual

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.100 
would say no put us in our spiritual
home<00:05:53.890> as<00:05:54.130> mentioned<00:05:54.580> before<00:05:54.700> so<00:05:55.690> instead<00:05:56.050> of

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
home as mentioned before so instead of

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.040 
home as mentioned before so instead of
like<00:05:56.410> debating<00:05:56.919> this<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.639> look<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:58.150> will<00:05:58.780> say

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
like debating this and look I will say

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.469 
like debating this and look I will say
though<00:05:59.260> if<00:05:59.440> you<00:05:59.680> put<00:05:59.889> a<00:05:59.919> gun<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.370> my<00:06:00.760> head<00:06:00.789> I

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
though if you put a gun to my head I

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.560 
though if you put a gun to my head I
would<00:06:01.870> most<00:06:02.080> likely<00:06:02.320> say<00:06:03.039> Raven<00:06:04.000> hold<00:06:04.240> Manor

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
would most likely say Raven hold Manor

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.010
