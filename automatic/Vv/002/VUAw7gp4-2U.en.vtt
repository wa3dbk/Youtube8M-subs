00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.439
 hello everyone I 'm not really the one 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.790
 you hope to find here my name is light 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.799
 and the fact is that this week talking 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.240
 with women he asked me to see if I 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.090
 I would like to have a video made by 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.400
 the channel and I'm a busy guy and 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.400
 with a busy life I said yes 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.949
 wrong 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.199
 well as already saying I'm going to give you the 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.910
 advice this week and I wanted to do it 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.650
 a bit in line with the previous one that 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.789
 it was the first day of class we are going to 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.829
 center a bit the university that is 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.690
 undoubtedly from the student age the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.250
 better and the first step towards this life 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.989
 you are going to have to give it when you have 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.730
 to choose what career to study this 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.320
 people usually very clear ideas in the case 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.150
 of careers as medicine because it's something 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.730
 vocational but with the rest of careers 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.620
 people are deciding 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.620
 there are zombie crows that come to attack me 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.680
 when it's nice, this decision is made 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.200
 half of the people will tend to go in 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.150
 careers like engineering or law 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.160
 because as you say the one who knows knows and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.360
 who does not see my advice with this topic 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.490
 is that you leave of milk when you have 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.620
 to choose career or people tend to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.740
 think about what is well seen 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.540
 the one that earns more money what is it 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 is expected to do by his 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.290
 family of his friends forgotten all this 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 shit because the career he studied was going 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 to define the work that you are going to have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.510
 during all the days of our life 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.630
 tomorrow when I both record a video for 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.549
 his truck 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.600
 and even though I chose it is a job 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.030
 in which you're not supposed to win 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.799
 so much and you like it and you're good you go to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 earn much more money I've said it 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.070
 Once you have decided the career that 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.409
 you are going to make to decide where you want 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.270
 do it or where then on the subject of what 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 university and you can apply the same 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.960
 concept that with what career student 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.850
 chosen university in a place that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.740
 like where you are going to be comfortable in 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.850
 which is not too bad the race 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.399
 that you are going to spend a measure of five 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.079
 years in the city that you choose so if 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.880
 you go to source las matas you will eat 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.960
 the shit now that you have clear the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.640
 career that you will study and where 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.439
 study the touch enjoy life 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.390
 you are going to listen to a lot of people saying 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.330
 that the university is the best time of 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.950
 life and they are absolutely right this is 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.319
 because at last you stop treating like 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.090
 a kid like when we go to school and 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.310
 finally you have more free time and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 ability to decide what to do with it and 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.849
 then here comes the subject in which 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.230
 center today's video that is your can 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.300
 be two people when you're in the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.310
 university there are two extremes one is 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.590
 champagne that is spent all the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.020
 university without leaving home studying 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.970
 and at the other end is the big god 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.220
 absolutely nothing and lose five years 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.810
 of his life he does not want to be neither 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.380
 in the middle term is the one that had 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.380
 all the slogans 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.700
 video of the graphic 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.290
 today well what to do is always make sure 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.620
 that you have covered the responsibility 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.450
 is who asks you for the race and after 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.180
 touch your balls and leave everything 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 when you can spend those five years 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 It really ended you will not be able to stay 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.550
 in your house you will have to go to work 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.200
 and eat poop every day at eight o'clock 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.970
 in the morning why my advice is that 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.100
 when you're in college, do what 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.240
 what you really want is five years 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.070
 where you have the opportunity to 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.900
 learn and have fun and do 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.640
 friends that will last you a lifetime 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.770
 the new baby when there's a party go 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.300
 you will regret if you spend all five 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.760
 years of college and you've stayed 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.770
 at home or you've stayed every day 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.010
 studying and preparing the subject of 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.330
 next day 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.500
 the parties at the university are 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.060
 those in which everyone is 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.099
 in a good mood if you are girls 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.720
 we will find fantastic guys and you are 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.790
 guys are you going to find some aunts 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.560
 great someone do you worry we take 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.299
 We like a bottle of water and go out 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.890
 have fun and I would like to send a 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.120
 message for all those people who 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.150
 they say doubles that the routes of the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.280
 university are important a whore 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.170
 Fuck when I finish college you go 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.930
 to get practices that will last 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.370
 three or six months and after that for 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.349
 get a job the only thing that's going to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.579
 import are those practices the notes 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.200
 that he had taken out will disappear from 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.870
 map faster than a hangover 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.209
 so enjoy life fuck with 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.209
 the fucking crows that street 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.819
 the keys of the university are 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.560
 much more interesting are you going to 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.540
 discover so much more than the things that 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.030
 you study at the school or the institute 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.670
 the classes in institutes are therefore language 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.440
 English math whatever 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.000
 you needed to have things that you really 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.739
 they are interested if you have chosen the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.479
 career that you really want to do 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.579
 well, nothing has been for me 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.100
 I hope you took advantage of this time 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.540
 of your life as I was saying when you see 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.060
 everyone say that that best time 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.740
 Life is really not a topic 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.600
 and it does not matter, I'll regret it if I do not 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.669
 take advantage and it's a time that you 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.100
 you're going to agree on your whole life so 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.630
 make the best of that time and listen 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.039
 Boeing's advice is that you are 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.750
 giving every week that now 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.520
 your life a little simpler and 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.360
 fun so thank you very much everyone 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.360
