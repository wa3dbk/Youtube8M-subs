00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
far as they can and with the help of the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.490 
far as they can and with the help of the
teammates<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.449> sideline<00:00:30.929> through

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
teammates on the sideline through

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.350 
teammates on the sideline through
monitor<00:00:31.830> timings<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> give<00:00:32.550> lap<00:00:32.730> information

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
monitor timings and give lap information

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
monitor timings and give lap information
the<00:00:33.960> idea<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> best<00:00:34.890> performance

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the idea is to get the best performance

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.670 
the idea is to get the best performance
of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> vehicles<00:00:36.000> custody<00:00:36.410> well<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.649> very

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
of the vehicles custody well I'm very

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.799 
of the vehicles custody well I'm very
very<00:00:38.280> exciting<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> first

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
enjoyed here it's been great very
exciting<00:00:58.100> some<00:00:59.100> cars<00:00:59.370> come<00:00:59.609> back<00:00:59.820> each<00:01:00.000> year

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
exciting some cars come back each year

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
exciting some cars come back each year
but<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:00.870> team<00:01:01.170> work<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.590> technical

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
but each team work on technical

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
but each team work on technical
innovations<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> improve<00:01:03.030> their<00:01:03.210> car<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
innovations to improve their car and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.130 
innovations to improve their car and
make<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.170> competitive<00:01:05.510> many<00:01:06.510> teams<00:01:06.810> have

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
make it more competitive many teams have

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.109 
make it more competitive many teams have
results<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.100> higher<00:01:08.280> than<00:01:08.310> last<00:01:08.700> year

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
results that are higher than last year

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.500 
results that are higher than last year
and<00:01:09.299> overall<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.369> designs<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.270> see

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and overall I think the designs we see

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.140 
and overall I think the designs we see
are<00:01:12.689> much<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.500> better<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.610> day<00:01:14.760> goes<00:01:14.939> on

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
are much much better as the day goes on

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.820 
are much much better as the day goes on
more<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.720> teams<00:01:16.080> come<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.619> fuel

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
more and more teams come in for fuel

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
more and more teams come in for fuel
testing<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.729> real<00:01:17.880> buzz<00:01:18.180> takes<00:01:18.479> over<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
testing and a real buzz takes over the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
testing and a real buzz takes over the
technical<00:01:19.259> areas<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> result<00:01:20.430> start<00:01:20.759> coming

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
technical areas as a result start coming

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.760 
technical areas as a result start coming
in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

the favorites there's really very are as

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.109 
the favorites there's really very are as
ever<00:01:25.259> doing<00:01:25.560> well<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:26.369> breaking<00:01:26.729> historic
