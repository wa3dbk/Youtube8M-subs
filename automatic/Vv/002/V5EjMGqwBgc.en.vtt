00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.689
 two 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.290
 I am Pedro, another area 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.789
 welcome to the tradition of wilson tit 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.770
 this time we are going to talk about 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.199
 another way and know what to do in the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.820
 different areas of the court what 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.349
 we are going to do is try to locate ourselves and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.079
 know what things are when the ball 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.120
 is behind when the ball is outside and 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.860
 when the ball is inside normally 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.330
 when we have a good back what 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.510
 what one should look for is to have a 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.070
 grandmother that gives you time deep and you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.199
 helps prepare the point in such a way 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.370
 that you do not have time to go back but 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.660
 at the same time I was making the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.220
 another player go to the bottom of the 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.589
 court and give you some space 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.449
 to later press for example 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.239
 I'm here back normally has a 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.239
 high deep turn and I seek to push the 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.979
 player to back as a base normally 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.770
 crossed or look for the player's back 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.090
 when I have a ball out one my 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.340
 main objective should be 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.860
 take advantage of that I have an angle that does not 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.350
 I have in the rest of the field and here I 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.850
 allows to open the court as I do not 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.530
 allows to open in the rest of the court 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.890
 because it has a better angle an example 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.570
 of this is nothing 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
 it's typical that when he plays against 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.840
 federer I think many people play 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.240
 down the center of the court because they know 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.159
 that is nadal and you are going to play here more 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.650
 It's worth that I kill it, you just go because 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.810
 being on this side of his being left-handed 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.520
 can open the court and you can 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.619
 pull to the pole or to the berm 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.119
 from the side and it's something like that 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.240
 we usually arrive in open position 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.680
 and we seek to make a blow that allows 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.350
 quite open the court this face the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.940
 play outside line 2 when I have 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.150
 a ball inside the court what 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.869
 should i look for the minimum press 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.330
 define attack 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.160
 hurt or kill my body must go back 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.930
 forward should have a semi blow 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.780
 flat and should be flush 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.640
 body back forward 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.050
 flush be my plan good friends 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.670
 thank you very much we hope you a 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.390
 another opportunity with the wilson tips 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.390
 Thank you
