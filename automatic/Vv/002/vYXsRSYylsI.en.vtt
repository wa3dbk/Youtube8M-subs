00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
this and mounted it right to that and I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
this and mounted it right to that and I
can<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:02.430> off<00:02:02.460> very<00:02:02.880> easily<00:02:03.119> it

another<00:02:09.780> thing<00:02:09.899> I'd<00:02:10.020> recommend<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.619> getting<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
another thing I'd recommend is getting a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.670 
another thing I'd recommend is getting a
backup<00:02:11.310> battery<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.910> everything<00:02:12.300> else

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
backup battery just like everything else

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.009 
backup battery just like everything else
kind<00:02:12.829> of<00:02:12.920> expensive<00:02:13.489> but<00:02:13.519> I<00:02:13.849> got<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> long<00:02:14.569> use

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
kind of expensive but I got a long use

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.199 
kind of expensive but I got a long use
backup<00:02:15.620> battery<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.549> that's<00:02:16.670> what<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.849> use<00:02:16.909> is

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
backup battery and that's what I use is

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.849 
backup battery and that's what I use is
my<00:02:17.390> main<00:02:17.629> battery<00:02:18.079> most<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.439> the<00:02:18.500> time<00:02:18.709> and

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
my main battery most of the time and

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.080 
my main battery most of the time and
then<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.010> used<00:02:19.189> the<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.609> came<00:02:19.849> with<00:02:19.879> it

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
then I used the one that came with it

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.349 
then I used the one that came with it
which<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.420> about<00:02:20.719> an<00:02:20.810> hour<00:02:21.219> as<00:02:22.219> my<00:02:22.819> backup

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
which is about an hour as my backup

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.360 
which is about an hour as my backup
battery<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.109> you<00:02:24.560> throw<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.010> here<00:02:25.250> like

much<00:02:49.849> time<00:02:50.120> I've<00:02:50.329> got<00:02:50.359> onto<00:02:50.689> a<00:02:50.810> project<00:02:51.379> I<00:02:51.560> use

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
much time I've got onto a project I use

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.640 
much time I've got onto a project I use
the<00:02:52.129> timer<00:02:52.370> that's<00:02:52.669> on<00:02:52.819> here<00:02:53.090> now<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.840> that's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
the timer that's on here now and that's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.619 
the timer that's on here now and that's
a<00:02:54.769> nice<00:02:54.919> thing<00:02:55.159> sometimes<00:02:55.849> I've<00:02:56.060> noticed<00:02:56.510> that

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
a nice thing sometimes I've noticed that

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.059 
a nice thing sometimes I've noticed that
a<00:02:56.689> little<00:02:57.109> bit<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.290> interference<00:02:57.469> will<00:02:57.889> come

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
a little bit of interference will come

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.309 
a little bit of interference will come
through<00:02:58.310> from<00:02:58.459> your<00:02:58.549> drive<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.299> it<00:03:00.139> will

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
through from your drive and it will

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.199 
through from your drive and it will
affect<00:03:00.469> the<00:03:00.889> sound<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:01.489> your<00:03:01.609> camera

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
it just happens rarely but and it only

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.140 
it just happens rarely but and it only
happens<00:03:07.099> when<00:03:07.189> it's<00:03:07.250> up<00:03:07.489> here<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:07.909> what<00:03:08.030> I've

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
happens when it's up here so what I've

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.179 
happens when it's up here so what I've
done<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.540> I've<00:03:08.689> also<00:03:08.930> mounted<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.620> spot<00:03:09.889> on<00:03:09.919> my

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:10.189 
done is I've also mounted a spot on my

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.580 
done is I've also mounted a spot on my
tripod<00:03:10.519> where<00:03:11.060> I<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.299> set<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.319> stays

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
tripod where I can set this so it stays

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.619 
tripod where I can set this so it stays
with<00:03:12.980> my<00:03:13.250> camera<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:13.730> it's<00:03:13.969> mounted<00:03:14.359> on<00:03:14.450> the

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
with my camera but it's mounted on the

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.199 
with my camera but it's mounted on the
tripod<00:03:14.870> by<00:03:15.260> using<00:03:15.439> this<00:03:15.680> clip<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:17.000> little

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
tripod by using this clip and a little

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.750 
tripod by using this clip and a little
support<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:17.930> that's<00:03:18.500> what<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.769> do<00:03:18.919> to<00:03:19.370> mount<00:03:19.609> it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
support so that's what I do to mount it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.599 
support so that's what I do to mount it
on<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.389> tripod<00:03:21.079> if<00:03:21.859> I<00:03:22.040> am<00:03:22.159> out<00:03:22.310> moving

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
on to the tripod if I am out moving

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.250 
on to the tripod if I am out moving
around<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.209> stuff<00:03:23.419> you<00:03:23.599> know<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.780> got<00:03:24.169> to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
around and stuff you know you got to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.469 
around and stuff you know you got to
give<00:03:24.379> up<00:03:24.500> something<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.549> put<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.150> go<00:03:26.359> ahead

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:26.479 
give up something so I put it I go ahead

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:28.089 
give up something so I put it I go ahead
and<00:03:26.659> mount<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.900> back<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.290> here<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:27.889> just

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
and mount it back up here and I just

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.649 
and mount it back up here and I just
take<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.250> chance<00:03:28.519> I'm<00:03:29.060> going<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.269> get<00:03:29.359> just<00:03:29.569> a

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
take a chance I'm going to get just a

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.599 
take a chance I'm going to get just a
touch<00:03:29.870> of<00:03:29.900> interference<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.859> then<00:03:30.979> but

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
touch of interference now and then but

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.159 
touch of interference now and then but
if<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.849> do<00:03:31.970> notice<00:03:32.180> interference<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:32.900> that

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
if you do notice interference from that

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.539 
if you do notice interference from that
coming<00:03:33.560> through<00:03:33.739> on<00:03:33.829> your<00:03:33.979> sound<00:03:34.220> that's

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
coming through on your sound that's

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.789 
coming through on your sound that's
probably<00:03:35.209> what<00:03:35.419> is<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.720> your<00:03:35.930> your<00:03:36.349> hard<00:03:36.590> drive

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
probably what is is your your hard drive

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.280 
probably what is is your your hard drive
motor<00:03:37.189> and<00:03:37.519> then<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.329> just<00:03:38.510> shuts<00:03:38.780> off<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.169> on

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
motor and then it just shuts off and on

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.050 
motor and then it just shuts off and on
right<00:03:39.530> here<00:03:39.709> it's<00:03:39.889> a<00:03:40.010> real<00:03:40.250> simple<00:03:40.669> system

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
right here it's a real simple system

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.439 
right here it's a real simple system
it's<00:03:41.540> 40<00:03:41.870> gig<00:03:42.049> hard<00:03:42.319> drive<00:03:42.939> it<00:03:43.939> won't<00:03:44.180> work<00:03:44.389> for

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
it's 40 gig hard drive it won't work for

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.629 
it's 40 gig hard drive it won't work for
the<00:03:44.959> high<00:03:45.229> definition<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.189> doesn't<00:03:46.549> hold

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
the high definition it just doesn't hold

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.890 
the high definition it just doesn't hold
enough<00:03:46.909> information<00:03:47.509> you're<00:03:47.599> going<00:03:47.689> to<00:03:47.780> have
