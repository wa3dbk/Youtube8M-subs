00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
ups some people call them verbal

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.650 
ups some people call them verbal
push-ups<00:01:30.980> you're<00:01:31.160> doing<00:01:31.370> from<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.670> knees<00:01:31.910> so

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
push-ups you're doing from the knees so

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.990 
push-ups you're doing from the knees so
if<00:01:32.840> I'm<00:01:32.960> regular<00:01:33.320> push-up<00:01:33.740> is<00:01:33.890> difficult<00:01:34.430> you

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
if I'm regular push-up is difficult you

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.780 
if I'm regular push-up is difficult you
can<00:01:35.180> do<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.480> neat<00:01:35.720> style<00:01:36.170> push-up<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.760> then

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
can do the neat style push-up and then

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.010 
can do the neat style push-up and then
there's<00:01:38.090> also<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.780> guess<00:01:39.500> an<00:01:39.650> advanced<00:01:40.190> push-up

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
there's also I guess an advanced push-up

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.810 
there's also I guess an advanced push-up
where<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.170> use<00:01:42.440> something<00:01:42.860> like<00:01:43.040> this<00:01:43.310> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
where you use something like this and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.140 
where you use something like this and
you<00:01:44.690> get<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.410> little<00:01:46.070> deeper<00:01:46.580> so<00:01:46.760> this<00:01:46.910> gives

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
you get in a little deeper so this gives

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.000 
you get in a little deeper so this gives
you<00:01:47.210> some<00:01:47.240> extended<00:01:47.840> height<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.590> then<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.830> can

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
you some extended height so then you can

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.030 
you some extended height so then you can
