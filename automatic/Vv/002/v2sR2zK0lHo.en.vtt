00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.460
 so welcome you that nice 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.980
 again a write in martial arts 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.030
 lifestyle master back at the start 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.920
 today a very important topic 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 right now that's just okay 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.330
 fitness is out but in martial arts video 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 and very briefly discuss the five 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 distances in the fight a very important 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 break one will say the category 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 because if you do not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 then you can understand yourself 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 actually always wrong distance 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 move and actually everything wrong 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.380
 do what you can do wrong 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.239
 ok first we have the king range what 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.399
 the children are more about every day 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.950
 this distance does not mean much 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.170
 more than that here in the third 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
 range is what in the other range who 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.480
 works because I do not step here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 can 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.039
 ok that means if we are aware of it 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.960
 We can work in the king james 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.969
 also great kick use yes for people the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 like to kick in the king james 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.629
 be firing off what you have okay if 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 So here I stand and now I am each 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.220
 kicking range picking range kicking 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.380
 Major denis that the absolute best rey 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.820
 to kick 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.700
 the poets come that you me the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.439
 second is the boxing ranger is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.600
 Almost too much kicking as well 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.759
 now makes the text comes a short 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 check tag by actually seeing it 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.439
 the boxes major suggestions i am here 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.380
 in binary here 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.610
 kg to that it's the boxing range okay that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.920
 means we have a distance where you can 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.820
 You can also beat it 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 to make power 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.380
 The captain pulled that is a great 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 distance for him more what is this 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.030
 are one of the kick in wayne again not 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630
 but a great idea for the kick 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.909
 then ran under again 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.820
 that's what we mean boxing kings 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.770
 okay next we have the trading 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.960
 range trading range is called the reference 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.579
 point so the contact takes place when 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.930
 Now we should do the city 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.909
 here in the tradingrange that's me 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.470
 know here to take the arm away and can 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.880
 break through and all this 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.890
 Tales the nightshopping trapping 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.110
 is nothing but me my blog 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.299
 and we try that is already 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.979
 trapping what would have for example in the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.170
 course from the caddy or from the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.459
 waving it when I hit and he 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.429
 Make a blog and I'll come here 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.650
 not through 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.840
 then that means my water is like that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.239
 Here, water is simply symbolizing 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.200
 Clever impact is the water and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.659
 I can not get through 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 I have to break the dam because that 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.549
 is now the water stops and I am 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.290
 since that takes the trading range okay 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.849
 would be back in the box people 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.010
 work in gout step back 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.849
 and I'm trying to run stairs now 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.829
 just too accurate 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.739
 I try now had stairs me 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.840
 so that a pure where burma here 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.069
 that's dangerous that's why you have to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.930
 also know from when am i more 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.220
 trapping rain and then in the boxing 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.120
 Human is nothing in the boxing 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.909
 to hit the range 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620
 lost in the eyes because I can from 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.780
 Do not meet me and get here 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.639
 a row 4 1 the skin with a pure one 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.019
 but if I'm tight enough I can 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.510
 his enterprise can now rap 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.650
 then frustration over cross then work here 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.709
 the work can come in 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.049
 that take tradingrange okay then back then 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.639
 So the range klimt quasi the ringer 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.590
 Range that's already the people here 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.930
 are we blocked it here? 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.730
 I come here get a lever now 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.939
 high and steer where I have him 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.799
 want the rendering okay so that means 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.060
 because the fourth wrestles and the fifth 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.409
 range I would like to open here now 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 do not make our holy ground 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.030
 that would be the floor rage okay that is 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.250
 from the ringer attack in the ground 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.620
 you have always had to fight each other 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 be very aware of what range you are 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.579
 you are just then you can 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.750
 fight successfully and then have to 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.930
 you also know that you are in the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.129
 individual Rangers so in the distance 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.439
 you have to train in the perfect way 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.299
 kicking man will be very good kicker 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.189
 you have to be very much in the boxing people 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.259
 good puncher while in the shopping 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.909
 Money must be very good hit in 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.729
 The ringer rage you have to be a very good 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.560
 be trainer and in the ground range 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.620
 you have to be a very good ground fighter 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.259
 be okay that again very briefly to 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.550
 so you understand what svs with us 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:04:00.530
 the five methods are compliant 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.240
 many do not know but I thank you 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.040
 then imagines present the mass 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.850
 and see you when it's time again 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.850
 came shortly
