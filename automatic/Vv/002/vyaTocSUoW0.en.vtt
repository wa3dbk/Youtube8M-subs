00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
gonna start off with a basic triangle

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.060 
gonna start off with a basic triangle
and<00:00:20.539> a<00:00:21.539> circle<00:00:22.400> from<00:00:23.400> here<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:24.449> gonna<00:00:24.570> draw

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
two more lines kind of like into a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700 
two more lines kind of like into a
triangular<00:00:30.510> shape<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
triangular shape just to get the

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.310 
triangular shape just to get the
foundation<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> wings<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:34.079> down

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
foundation of the wings and then down

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
foundation of the wings and then down
here<00:00:34.370> we're<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.850> same<00:00:36.090> thing<00:00:36.149> we're

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
here we're gonna do the same thing we're

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
gonna bring out one more little line

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.490 
gonna bring out one more little line
just<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.480> some<00:00:39.690> guidelines<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
just so you have some guidelines to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.459 
just so you have some guidelines to
follow<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.570> we're<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.140> take

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
follow and from here we're gonna take

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
follow and from here we're gonna take
our<00:00:43.649> marker<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> we're<00:00:45.719> gonna<00:00:45.840> do<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> big

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
our marker and we're gonna do a big

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.560 
our marker and we're gonna do a big
swoop<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.850> come<00:00:48.629> around<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.260> join<00:00:50.390> right<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
swoop and come around and join right to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.799 
swoop and come around and join right to
the<00:00:51.660> point<00:00:51.840> where<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.199> had<00:00:52.410> our<00:00:52.440> line<00:00:53.809> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the point where we had our line and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.330 
the point where we had our line and
we're<00:00:54.930> gonna<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> same<00:00:55.680> thing<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
we're gonna do the same thing on the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.560 
we're gonna do the same thing on the
other<00:00:56.370> side<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> bring<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
other side and bring this in to

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
other side and bring this in to
formulate<00:01:01.050> our<00:01:01.109> line<00:01:01.520> now<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> little

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
formulate our line now we have a little

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
formulate our line now we have a little
guideline<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.680> have<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.979> go

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
guideline here so we know we have to go

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.910 
guideline here so we know we have to go
to<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> edge<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.790> guideline<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
to the edge of this guideline and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.570 
to the edge of this guideline and
another<00:01:07.920> swoop<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.729> come<00:01:09.390> back<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:11.369> again

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
another swoop and come back and again

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
another swoop and come back and again
another<00:01:14.580> swoop<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.450> come<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:16.710> we

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
another swoop to come back so now we

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.620 
another swoop to come back so now we
have<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> foundation<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:18.030> our<00:01:18.090> butterfly

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
have the foundation for our butterfly

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
have the foundation for our butterfly
wings<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:20.070> lines<00:01:20.340> here

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
wings then we can take these lines here

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.990 
wings then we can take these lines here
and<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.830> curvy<00:01:23.189> lines<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.759> some

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and do just some curvy lines to get some

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.289 
and do just some curvy lines to get some
detail<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> wings<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:26.549> again<00:01:26.939> join

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
detail into the wings and again join

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.450 
detail into the wings and again join
these<00:01:27.509> two<00:01:27.780> lines<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> details<00:01:29.070> into

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
these two lines to get the details into

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.230 
these two lines to get the details into
the<00:01:29.670> wings<00:01:30.619> in<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> bottom<00:01:32.100> wings<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:33.030> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the wings in the bottom wings if you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.149 
the wings in the bottom wings if you
think<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> butterfly<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.590> almost<00:01:34.890> like

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
think of a butterfly it's almost like

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.069 
think of a butterfly it's almost like
drawing<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:36.170> veins<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.979> leaf<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
drawing little veins as if in a leaf I

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.160 
drawing little veins as if in a leaf I
will<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.290> continue<00:01:40.530> drawing<00:01:41.780> these<00:01:42.780> veins

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
will just continue drawing these veins

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.999 
will just continue drawing these veins
just<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.159> bit<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> detail<00:01:46.009> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
just to get a little bit of detail and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
just to get a little bit of detail and
we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.270> add<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.780> few<00:01:49.200> little

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we can go back here and add a few little

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
we can go back here and add a few little
veins<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.600> some<00:01:51.600> detail<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.210> we'll

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
veins up here for some detail and we'll

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
veins up here for some detail and we'll
put<00:01:54.540> two<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.930> antennas<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
put two little antennas and you have a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
put two little antennas and you have a
beautiful<00:01:59.340> butterfly<00:02:00.680> this<00:02:01.680> has<00:02:01.860> been

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
beautiful butterfly this has been
