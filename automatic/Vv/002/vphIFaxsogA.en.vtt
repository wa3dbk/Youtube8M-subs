00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.139 
you can also do with stickies but
proximity<00:00:43.530> mines<00:00:43.710> are<00:00:43.890> easiest<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.550> not

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
proximity mines are easiest because not

he wouldn't be running up here's another

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.190 
he wouldn't be running up here's another
keep<00:01:46.950> your<00:01:47.070> distance

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.460 

and<00:01:52.200> also<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:53.159> think<00:01:53.360> be<00:01:54.360> careful<00:01:54.750> where<00:01:55.080> you

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
and also I think be careful where you

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.109 
and also I think be careful where you
stand<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.220> get<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:56.640> car<00:01:56.909> where

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
stand when you get out of your car where

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
stand when you get out of your car where

right in front of your car probably not

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.360 
right in front of your car probably not
a<00:03:16.480> good<00:03:16.720> idea<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:17.380> just<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.710> and<00:03:17.980> park<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.340> right

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
a good idea to just go and park it right

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.450 
a good idea to just go and park it right
beside<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:19.000> explosive<00:03:19.330> explosion<00:03:20.460> right

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
beside that explosive explosion right

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.530 
beside that explosive explosion right
there<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.850> that's<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> other<00:03:22.180> thing<00:03:22.270> with

there and that's the other thing with

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.090 
there and that's the other thing with
high<00:03:22.660> ground<00:03:22.960> really<00:03:23.770> makes<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.070> big

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
high ground really makes a big

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.570 
high ground really makes a big
difference<00:03:24.280> with<00:03:24.820> rocket<00:03:25.210> launchers<00:03:26.580> hand

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
difference with rocket launchers hand

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.050 
difference with rocket launchers hand
grenades<00:03:27.850> things<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:29.820> they<00:03:30.820> can't
