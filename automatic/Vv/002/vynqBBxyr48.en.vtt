00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.060
 the one that passes we see 360 ​​points and good 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.119
 It's natural how to get the password from 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.619
 the wifi networks using these two 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.169
 programs here in the description of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 video I'll leave the link for you 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.660
 you wild ' good and let's start 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.660
 let's open this lizzie rosso wifi 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 inspector 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.790
 and good once 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.930
 we need both to be able to take what 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.120
 that my singular the password of him in 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.120
 the wifi does not expect it to be 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.810
 this study we are going to put it here 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:06.650
 we are going to need to see this and as we see 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:10.230
 this detects what being him 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.590
 the wifi signal 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.850
 here we are going to roll to where they are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.400
 connected 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.820
 and I'm connected to all the others are 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.210
 the networks that are around here in the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.260
 program is good let's use this from 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.540
 here the big pss this is what we are going to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.979
 use to get the password we are going to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.340
 delete this that comes here and we're going to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340
 to write 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:46.390
 the numbers that come 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.259
 and that is all as well as as it comes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.130
 that if you do not put it in the right way 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 but it will not work 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.550
 and we will choose 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.740
 and this we are going to wait for it and here they have 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:10.830
 just knowing web that only has 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.230
 being aid and this patchwork 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.540
 fars word and this is the air is what 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.260
 comes the end of the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.810
 model and they enter this and they go to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.150
 can connect 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.970
 the network by means of the wifi the password 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.730
 and as they see good we did the truth 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.340
 too quickly 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.920
