00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.220
 here we are with this new video for 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.870
 the new video channel of gta 5 and here 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.700
 we have another street race of these 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.470
 not of these it seems that it seems that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.570
 we like them so much not this time we're going to 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.180
 compare the new bike brought with the dlc 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.919
 the cross against our bat and not against 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.570
 our bat and let's see what it is that 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.820
 happen let's see which one is faster 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.619
 what bike is worth more to buy 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.499
 remember also that the price of the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.079
 bati is 15,000 compared to 75 thousand 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.210
 The cost of the cross is very important 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.070
 since bati is considerably 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 cheap said and all this we will see 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.680
 what is happening in the race and 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.269
 here we are already in a race 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.609
 improvised so that our output is 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.469
 more even and everything goes more fluid more 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.969
 perfect fine as you can see the bati has 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.739
 an output much higher than what 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 would be the a-3 this new motorbike of the new 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.000
 dlc and then at speed point when 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.140
 the bikes reach their maximum speed 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.089
 keeps more or less the same distance 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
 that is to say its speed as it is quite 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.070
 similar when they reach the maximum 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.989
 speed both bikes still the bati 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.179
 As you are seeing, it is always maintained 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.230
 throughout the race in the first place 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.480
 in first position 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.610
 Now that we really like this bike as 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.490
 is my case that to me in the truth is that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.909
 It has been a bike that I liked the most 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.890
 I bought it and it truly has 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.270
 brought has not brought me to her 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.649
 Well are you going to give us a tip for 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.200
 increase the speed considerably 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.490
 of motorcycles is worth the only thing that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.799
 you have to do is when you go 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.500
 running with the bike pick up the joystick 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.060
 left analog and give it back 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.810
 as if you were doing a 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.100
 little horse 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.750
 this is worth what you are seeing in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.299
 screen to make a horse worth 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 what you are going to see now is the same 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.380
 motorcycle against the same bat and only that I 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.000
 I'll make you see doing a wheelie 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.850
 a little horse I will keep the joystick 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 left analog downwards worth what 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.060
 you are going to see now do not worry now 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.890
 let's start a countdown of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.810
 exit and you're going to see that first I'm going to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.909
 go out normal okay first I'm going out 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.190
 very normal but then what I'm going to do 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.539
 is to make a horse when it is inside 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.819
 of the race when it is already in full 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.950
 movement are you going to see that the 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.170
 Speed ​​of the cross bike increases 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 considerably very important eye 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.520
 blaster that drives wash and it's not 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.140
 doing if he did it too 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.179
 your speed the speed of the hand of 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.880
 Abate would be quite old but well 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.680
 here you have it the leaves with your think that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.510
 with your exit speed but if you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.700
 You see, we passed him a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.959
 brutal as I have already said making a 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.459
 you see the motorcycle wheel 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.420
 front a little raised that's 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.489
 because I 'm with the joystick 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.769
 left analog moving him towards 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.599
 down we considerably increase the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.159
 speed of the bike and actually hit me 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.959
 well, a good host against the fence 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.940
 but good if you liked the video 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.260
 you should give him live favorites and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.940
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.590
 It has been a pleasure to bring you this video 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.879
 as always and see you in the next 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.360
 video until next time

 goodbye
