00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 Mille Miglia: the most beautiful car rally in the world 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.540
 In 2007 we participated for the first time in the Mille Miglia with a Lancia Aurelia B24 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.660
 We got a place in the top 20 and in 2009 we became 13th with this car, 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.020
 but we had engine problems and we had it again this year. 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.180
 It is a former official car of the OSCA team. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.020
 He drove the Mille Miglia in this configuration in 1954 and 1956, 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:51.100
 with number 4-28, which was the starting time. He became sixth in his category and second in total. 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.740
 We use MICHELIN XAS tires 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.180
 They are very good. 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 We use modern profiles, of course, with a classic design and we get along well. 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.540
 The Mille Miglia is a very sensational race, 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.100
 the people, the villages and the spectators are unique. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.180
 We also participate in speed races, but we prefer long, regular journeys. 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.380
 We inspect the car almost all year round 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 and replace worn parts with new ones. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.060
 So they are "historic" cars with modern parts 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 The car is currently running very well, I knock it off! 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.940
 We use new MICHELIN tires with old designs 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.460
 But these are also modern tires. 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.220
 And the surface of the brakes is renewed manually, because they are mounted on drum brake shoes 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.900
 and they are made by Ferodo, so the materials are the most important. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.220
 We race with this car, 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 which is very special and has a long history full of victories. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.140
 We are considering regularly participating in the best rallies: the Coppa d'Oro delle Dolomiti, 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.820
 the Mitiche Sport a Bassano, the Coppa Franco Mazzotti: that is the top of the Italian rallies 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 Like I said, Mille Miglia is a very special race 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.300
 because of the people, the spectators and the emotion 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.940
 People look so happy when you come by and make a lot of noise 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.740
 It's just that, there is really no reason. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.220
 You drive through almost all major cities 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.420
 It is a unique route that runs from Brescia to Ferrara and from Ferrara to Rome. 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.860
 People are everywhere and the towns and villages are fantastic. 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.300
 If you did not participate in the Mille Miglia, you would never see this.
