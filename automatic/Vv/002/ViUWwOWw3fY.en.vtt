00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
ago or whatever it is like hey this is a

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
ago or whatever it is like hey this is a
monumental<00:01:39.900> day<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.140> history<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
monumental day in history that kind of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.859 
monumental day in history that kind of
thing<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:42.060> there's<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
thing but I think that there's more to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
thing but I think that there's more to
that<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.350> they're<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.820> active<00:01:45.329> on

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that like they're not all that active on

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
that like they're not all that active on
their<00:01:45.750> Facebook<00:01:46.200> page<00:01:46.229> they've<00:01:46.619> been<00:01:46.740> getting

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
their Facebook page they've been getting

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
their Facebook page they've been getting
a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.220> more<00:01:47.399> active<00:01:47.579> recently<00:01:48.149> but

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
a little bit more active recently but

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149 
a little bit more active recently but
they're<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.570> all<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.990> active<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.920> went

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
they're not all that active and I went

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889 
they're not all that active and I went
back<00:01:50.310> through<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
back through and it's not like they you

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.080 
back through and it's not like they you
know<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.369> kind<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> stuff<00:01:53.909> like

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
know do a lot of this kind of stuff like

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
know do a lot of this kind of stuff like
you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.360> looking<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.290> history<00:01:55.409> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you know looking back in the history and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
you know looking back in the history and
stuff<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.369> honestly<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
stuff like that so honestly I think this

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.109 
stuff like that so honestly I think this
might<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:58.049> some<00:01:58.380> sort<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> hint<00:01:59.070> towards<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
might be some sort of a hint towards the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
might be some sort of a hint towards the
next<00:02:00.360> Call<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> Duty<00:02:00.659> game<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> look

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
next Call of Duty game and if you look

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.630 
balancing issues and stuff and obviously
now<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.060> hacked<00:02:48.720> like<00:02:48.989> crazy<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.400> was<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
now it's hacked like crazy but it was a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.340 
now it's hacked like crazy but it was a
great<00:02:50.910> game<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.570> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.050> would<00:02:52.200> be<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
great game and I think it would be a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.259 
great game and I think it would be a
very<00:02:52.890> good<00:02:53.220> game<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.580> see<00:02:53.700> next<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> series

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
very good game to see next in the series

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.509 
very good game to see next in the series
so<00:02:54.540> yeah<00:02:55.080> there<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.440> guys<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.340> a

so yeah there you guys have it just a

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.250 
so yeah there you guys have it just a
it's<00:02:56.970> something<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:57.750> confirmed

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
it's something that it's not confirmed

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.660 
it's something that it's not confirmed
you<00:02:58.440> know<00:02:58.530> don't<00:02:58.739> take<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.220> fact

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
you know don't take this as fact

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.570 
you know don't take this as fact
please<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.260> anything<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.489> we

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
please it's anything but you know if we

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.920 
please it's anything but you know if we
might<00:03:02.760> even<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:03.060> reached<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.450> little<00:03:03.660> bit<00:03:03.750> here

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
might even be reached a little bit here

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.449 
might even be reached a little bit here
but<00:03:04.050> honestly<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.220> seems

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
but honestly like it's just it seems

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.470 
but honestly like it's just it seems
weird<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> me<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.120> would<00:03:06.209> randomly

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
weird to me that they would randomly

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.600 
weird to me that they would randomly
post<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.050> if<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.800> had<00:03:07.890> nothing<00:03:08.100> to<00:03:08.310> do<00:03:08.580> with

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
post this if it had nothing to do with

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
post this if it had nothing to do with
the<00:03:08.850> game<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.180> they're<00:03:09.300> currently<00:03:09.570> working

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the game that they're currently working

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.050

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
what you guys think you think we could

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.370 
what you guys think you think we could
be<00:03:13.769> seeing<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.340> world<00:03:14.610> at<00:03:14.820> war<00:03:14.850> -<00:03:15.239> next<00:03:15.510> year<00:03:15.810> I'm

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
be seeing a world at war - next year I'm

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380 
be seeing a world at war - next year I'm
very<00:03:16.980> excited<00:03:17.459> about<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.820> possibility<00:03:18.030> I

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
very excited about that possibility I

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.030 
very excited about that possibility I
think<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.900> would<00:03:19.019> be<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.170> great<00:03:19.530> game<00:03:19.709> lemma

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
think that would be a great game lemma

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.590 
think that would be a great game lemma
