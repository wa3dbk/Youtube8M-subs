00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.080
 this is the motorola moto e the slip-on 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.340
 in the motor series of motorola 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.990
 and we see many similarities with being 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.640
 big brothers, but boarding is also required 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.800
 not to mean that it is direct and 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.269
 uninteresting device is first it is 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.309
 nice and compact you can easily 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.859
 take it in your hand you would also in your pocket 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.539
 notice less quickly than today's yes 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.550
 mid-range smartphones that often have something 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.199
 be bigger at the back find it 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.659
 well-known motorola that we are seeing one 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.730
 rubbery plastic finish you have 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.859
 also a lot of grip and the motorola 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.180
 logo is nicely dented 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.010
 we have already seen that in the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.780
 moto g to the front natural 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.680
 completely made of glass 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.969
 neither the speaker 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.320
 now it is handy that you are at the front 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.760
 moment that you go to something about it 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.260
 listening is a bad condition anymore 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.789
 then the speaker will not get through 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.829
 blocked so the sound always stays 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.850
 nice and optimally close like one of 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.949
 motorola are used to 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.989
 it runs on android but on in too 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.879
 just on a bare version of android 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.359
 so few adjustments on android itself 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.859
 done in this case android 4 point 4 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.899
 yes you see you actually see all of that 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.800
 just all stick is I find myself 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.420
 very nice because 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.120
 stock android 4 point four eye just 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.710
 very tight very well-arranged and works 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.270
 nice and nice actually the only one 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.190
 adjustment that the real see of motorola 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.990
 are a number of apps that you eft an app 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.960
 what someone can warn you imagine 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.310
 for example you fall somewhere could not 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.410
 you can push the button more upright 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 and will immediately call that one 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.530
 preset emergency numbers 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.750
 who can also let you race it or you 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.460
 share location via gps 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 they mainly think other for what 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.100
 older people who are scared if they 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.290
 fall 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.330
 Still not yes that they ff quickly no help 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 can call in and it becomes moto es ist 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.030
 I find it very handy automatically 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.100
 meetings or when you are sleeping 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.450
 then he thinks you are your phone 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.250
 do not wake up or receive calls 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.720
 disturbed during the meetings so 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.370
 that's a nice addition and there 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.680
 is another app for easy use 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.500
 migrate from other devices to the 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.370
 moto e so to transfer more data properly 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.140
 can put 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.670
 well otherwise the screen is a 4.3 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.620
 inch screen with a resolution of 960 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.630
 at 540 pixels 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.550
 well when you are browsing it 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 you even if the text or smaller than 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.960
 the entire screen that is smaller is the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.670
 Pixel density quite okay so yes 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.470
 it looks actually good look 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.910
 corner advice can be better but in this 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.050
 price range it is one of the best 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.120
 screens 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.260
 now also the processor of 1.2 gigahertz 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.730
 it actually pulls everything pretty well 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.860
 of course you should not have too much of it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.720
 expect in terms of performance but also themselves 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.489
 the basic applications that work without 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.049
 problems to be equal to the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.239
 storage memory so really only real 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.010
 disadvantage you 4 gigabytes of internal storage 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.730
 of which two and half gigabytes really 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.920
 useful 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.799
 so it is advisable to via microsd card 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
 as additional storage space to make gash 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.920
 so that you can possibly use more apps 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.640
 install or more data 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 save 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 is also a camera on a 5 megapixel 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.980
 camera without bottle so take photos in it 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.879
 the dark is not really going well 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.489
 become very beautiful 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.379
 during the day it is pretty okay 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.060
 just really intended only for snapshots 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.739
 you should not expect anything more 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.670
 they have to print them on large ones 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.049
 formats 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.329
 because that is not what camera is meant for 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.239
 filming can be done at 720 p 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.400
 and actually this makes the whole 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.680
 moto e actually a compact smartphone 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.299
 which is really meant for someone who 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.040
 just a simple android smartphone 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.420
 looking for not too much money but it does 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.129
 just want quality in his hands 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.079
 we now have more information about the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.989
 moto e or you might order it 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.489
 we go to pdashop.nl or point bc or k 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.489
 of course in one of our stores
