to pulling it down and having them all
stacked<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:42.730> kind<00:03:42.820> of<00:03:42.940> overlaps<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.350> icons

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
stacked up it kind of overlaps the icons

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.260 
stacked up it kind of overlaps the icons
there<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.250> i<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:45.640> really<00:03:45.910> cool

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270

pull it down icons up here i believe

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.150 
pull it down icons up here i believe
they<00:03:49.600> have<00:03:49.780> mobile<00:03:50.110> data<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.530> can't<00:03:50.740> toggle

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
they have mobile data you can't toggle

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.440 
they have mobile data you can't toggle
anymore<00:03:51.490> there's<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.730> couple<00:03:51.910> they<00:03:52.120> get<00:03:52.270> rid<00:03:52.390> of

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
anymore there's a couple they get rid of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
and you can't swipe over anymore so it's

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.850 
and you can't swipe over anymore so it's

working could be a bug I don't know if

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.240 
working could be a bug I don't know if
they<00:05:01.720> got<00:05:02.110> rid<00:05:02.289> of<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.650> TouchWiz<00:05:03.100> or

I can't get it to work so that's very

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.200 
I can't get it to work so that's very
unfortunate<00:05:12.130> because<00:05:12.580> that's<00:05:12.850> actually<00:05:13.000> a

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
unfortunate because that's actually a

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.420 
unfortunate because that's actually a
really<00:05:13.270> cool<00:05:13.449> feature<00:05:13.810> on<00:05:14.199> jellybean<00:05:14.680> that

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
really cool feature on jellybean that

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
background as you get further down so

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.500 
background as you get further down so
that's<00:05:20.530> just<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:20.949> little<00:05:21.090> aesthetic<00:05:22.090> feature

that's just a little aesthetic feature
there<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:24.610> do<00:05:24.699> have<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.910> quick<00:05:25.389> option<00:05:26.050> to<00:05:26.320> go

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
there you do have a quick option to go

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.360 
there you do have a quick option to go
into<00:05:26.530> settings<00:05:26.919> in<00:05:27.070> your<00:05:27.099> notification

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.950 
drawer setting wise nothing you have
blocking<00:05:30.669> mode<00:05:30.910> right<00:05:31.180> there<00:05:31.449> which<00:05:31.780> I

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
blocking mode right there which I

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.779 
blocking mode right there which I
believe<00:05:32.260> you<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:32.650> disable<00:05:33.010> incoming<00:05:33.580> calls

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.450 
believe you can disable incoming calls
notifications<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.990> other<00:05:35.590> things<00:05:35.979> so<00:05:36.250> if<00:05:36.370> you

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
notifications and other things so if you

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.800 
notifications and other things so if you
go<00:05:36.610> into<00:05:36.789> a<00:05:36.910> meeting<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.479> can<00:05:37.510> turn<00:05:37.750> on

go into a meeting you can turn on

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.360 
go into a meeting you can turn on
blocking<00:05:38.380> mode<00:05:38.560> so<00:05:38.770> you<00:05:38.830> don't<00:05:38.949> have<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.160> worry

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
blocking mode so you don't have to worry

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.279 
blocking mode so you don't have to worry
about<00:05:39.520> any<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:39.970> that<00:05:40.000> that's<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.930> little<00:05:41.080> bit

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
about any of that that's a little bit

updated other than that though you could

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.719 
updated other than that though you could
have<00:05:43.810> lock<00:05:44.050> screen<00:05:44.380> as<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.620> specific<00:05:45.370> option
