00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 that if you want 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.390
 he writes he had to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.680
 perfection 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.850
 not enough to be addicted to write 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.720
 but we must know how to do it almost as perfectly as 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.190
 the mendicino writer 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 which awarded 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.280

 he says that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.280
 we must know how to write 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.480
 says ours 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.190
 reading comprehension 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.909

 ca. love she does common place 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.499
 and rightly so 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.810
 finally with you all you know that 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 anyone I do a thing 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.790
 he understands better when what others do 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520
 this applies to 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.929
 the footballers clement when I watch a game in which I do not play not 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.959
 they understand better than you 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.790
 which for the few who do not understand why they are weak even for the writer 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:19.469
 to read 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.919
 he had 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.609
 trying to write the discounted ones with 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.819
 the difficulties of writing 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.859
 revenge account that difficult 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.289
 understand that it is not enough to rely on the inventive estadio 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.009
 school of all time 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.009
 understand that a much more complicated job 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.639
 in turn, you are used to source a text to read, maybe a little less 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.199
 voluminous than this 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.319
 having experienced how difficult things are to do 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.529
 you realize by the way the studio is reading 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.529
 the invoices solves them more or less 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.799
 I go so much this advice 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.139
 that does it decide through 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.049
 one on first 3d image 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.289
 an activity 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.159
 important 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.439
 to learn to write we can say that it is pure and simple to copy 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.299
 if you want a few hours 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.060
 copiona pase di manzoni 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.069
 you realize how this shoulder pads look like punctuation 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.559
 do you realize how 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:27.119
 the words follow each other 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.539
 second 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.869
 unict a gait that maybe reading 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.629
 recourse to the text you have not noticed 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.060
 no copy s200 extremely analytical way 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.079
 writing also means for homes 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.569
 to understand how the writing works 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.279
 heights 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:49.429
 so friends this motto that 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.429
 if you want to learn to dribble 

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:58.059
 how can you read again 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.049
 101 write 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.389
 the law ceded in writing 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.349
 we are not read so much are not jumeaux 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.209
 all the classics that padi manzoni relief vocations emule 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.219

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.639
 the leccesidentro writing are here 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.769
 piamo ahahah 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.900
 questions &amp; put a camera here 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.139
 behind our head and if we try to observe ourselves while we read 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.150
 it's easy diets like it 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.580
 the interesting question 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.570
 what did you like in this text how you liked it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.710
 simple to find 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.780
 in this state perhaps leopards which is exactly the verse to the test stage 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.180
 because they hit 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.180
 you knew why they hit you 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.529
 if we 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.059
 we reserve ourselves in the act of reading 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.749
 we become able to understand how it works by reading 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.039
 all one moment in which we will begin to write the breast capable of imagining the 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.259
 how others work 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.069
 there is therefore a short tucci circle once 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.589
 virtuous 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:08.669
 learn to read 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.939
 behavioral writing 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.289
 learn to write behavioral 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.270
 to read 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.809
 always that we always keep in mind that 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:18.689
 we don't just have to look 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:19.919
 to the tests 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.719
 but also our relationship with words 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:27.349
 to the way we run we act in the way we find no way in which we give 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.400
 phase by phase speaks for paodva 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.909
 the problem 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.479
 what I say now 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.999
 that then I put it now what is the right one 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.999
 that crazy gemy right 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.620
 not therefore the quantity maroc quality 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.889
 structural plan 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.210
 we need it to learn how to write 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.370
 not therefore 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.620
 the quantity we mark on earth the quality of our writing will be there 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.520
