00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.840
 I'd rather go to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.840
 that lies 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.549
 so I have children's choirs and 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:17.369
 the buttons 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.310
 the gap with the typhoon 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 there is experience 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.150
 and already determined 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.150
 but most of all they are not printed on it 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.660
 the study models 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.150
 just like the head gets it to study 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.150
 setback 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 how now is the time again 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.630
 I'm on mobilyz.com 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.990
 nijmegen 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 b and w wanted this too and then the tour 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 to cry out 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.270
 Vatican CITY 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.500
 jelle van damme 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 her daughter 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.570
 picked up all 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.030
 not every student 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
 pelÃ© 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.650
 hmmm 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.020
 because it is another one 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 when he takes the mouth all the time 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.749
 on which my legs are wrong name 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:20.219
 I decide 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.249
 this is a very difficult part in the bus that put an asx file on trial 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.919
 you must have with actress 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.549
 the Tour de France is being played over 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.549
 within the consisting of 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.189
 if you keep doing that and this trainer 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.189
 but first we have a snake 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.089
 Dudok like this gasoline prices and not allowed those on those in every line 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.939
 I got it from a messiah that was beautiful anyway 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
 this time 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.579
 handy duffy 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:31.669

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.109

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.109
 the playground 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.709
 I've got you out with it too 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.840
 shown on 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.509
 strikingly contributing to the debate 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.509
 what loosened were in a car on it is pretty awkward 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.189
 apparently the kinkel 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:09.479
