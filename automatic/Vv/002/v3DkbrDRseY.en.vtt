00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.460 
but first you have to draw the new
pattern<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.360> redraw<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.810> again<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.380> make

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
pattern and then redraw it again to make

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.470 
sure you got it right right and then the
new<00:03:22.200> pattern<00:03:22.500> saved<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> then<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.210> close<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
new pattern saved so then you close it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.420 
new pattern saved so then you close it
and<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.410> open<00:03:25.710> it<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.960> there<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.340> tell<00:03:29.340> you
