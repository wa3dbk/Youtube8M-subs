00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
seen a lot of roads blocked also a round

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.380 
seen a lot of roads blocked also a round
of<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.190> subdivision<00:03:35.430> I<00:03:35.880> understand<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.269> says

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
of this subdivision I understand it says

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.940 
of this subdivision I understand it says
Windsor<00:03:36.900> place<00:03:37.320> now<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.549> cars<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.150> were<00:03:39.299> not

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
inundated were parked very very close to

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.020 
inundated were parked very very close to
the<00:03:43.500> houses<00:03:43.920> as<00:03:44.040> far<00:03:44.280> from<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.489> water<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:44.880> they

the houses as far from the water as they
can<00:03:45.209> get<00:03:45.359> do<00:03:45.959> we<00:03:46.079> have<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.230> situation<00:03:46.410> where

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
can get do we have a situation where

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.830 
can get do we have a situation where
some<00:03:47.130> vehicles<00:03:47.579> may<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.299> trapped<00:03:48.660> in

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
some vehicles may actually be trapped in

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
certain situations they cannot get out

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.430 
certain situations they cannot get out
that<00:03:51.690> could<00:03:51.870> very<00:03:52.079> well<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.590> case<00:03:52.920> I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
that could very well be the case I

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.130 
that could very well be the case I
in<00:03:53.500> some<00:03:53.740> cases<00:03:54.240> these<00:03:55.240> times<00:03:55.480> appear<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.960> have

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
in some cases these times appear to have

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.410 
in some cases these times appear to have
been<00:03:56.290> built<00:03:56.500> up<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:56.860> bit<00:03:57.070> from<00:03:57.460> from<00:03:58.330> the

been built up a bit from from the
roadway<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.290> was<00:03:59.380> apparently<00:03:59.800> maybe<00:04:00.130> a

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
roadway so there was apparently maybe a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.160 
roadway so there was apparently maybe a
ditch<00:04:00.490> that<00:04:00.520> runs<00:04:00.940> in<00:04:01.150> front<00:04:01.330> of<00:04:01.450> them<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:02.080> the

ditch that runs in front of them and the

ditch that runs in front of them and the
houses<00:04:02.380> are<00:04:02.650> high<00:04:02.830> enough<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.370> they<00:04:03.790> are<00:04:03.820> out

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
houses are high enough that they are out

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.270 
houses are high enough that they are out
of<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.360> water<00:04:04.570> but<00:04:05.200> perhaps<00:04:05.590> some<00:04:05.770> homeowners

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
of the water but perhaps some homeowners

vehicle I was doing some serious damage
to<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.140> just<00:04:11.710> park<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.190> car<00:04:12.400> as<00:04:12.880> close<00:04:13.240> as<00:04:13.390> they

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
to it just park the car as close as they

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.150 
to it just park the car as close as they
could<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.900> house<00:04:14.140> realizing<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:14.980> maybe

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
could to the house realizing that maybe

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.800 
could to the house realizing that maybe
it<00:04:15.370> would<00:04:15.460> be<00:04:15.610> okay<00:04:16.000> and<00:04:16.269> then<00:04:16.480> they<00:04:16.630> just

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
it would be okay and then they just

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.840 
it would be okay and then they just
decided<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.260> walk<00:04:17.530> out<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:18.070> maybe<00:04:18.489> they<00:04:18.700> got<00:04:18.730> a

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
decided to walk out or maybe they got a

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.670 
decided to walk out or maybe they got a
ride<00:04:19.090> for<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.390> guys<00:04:19.540> that<00:04:19.570> can<00:04:19.959> do<00:04:20.080> that's<00:04:20.500> it

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
ride for the guys that can do that's it

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.340 
ride for the guys that can do that's it
that's<00:04:20.830> as<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:21.160> an<00:04:21.280> explanation<00:04:21.489> as<00:04:22.200> we<00:04:23.200> have

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
that's as good an explanation as we have

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.130 
that's as good an explanation as we have
up<00:04:23.560> here<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:24.790> tell<00:04:25.000> me<00:04:25.180> from<00:04:25.930> from

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
the air at one point we thought we were

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.610 
the air at one point we thought we were
over<00:04:27.880> Glengarry<00:04:28.750> subdivision<00:04:29.350> this<00:04:29.500> is
