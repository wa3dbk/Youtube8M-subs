00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.839
 the first step is to apply a base 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:17.219
 enamel later I make a 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.219
 single color with a glaze 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.439
 and now creates the camouflage effect with 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.559
 the help of a daughter and three colors a 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.220
 chocolate brown a khaki green and a 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.220
 military green 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.399
 now I wait for the enamel to dry 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.399
 which passed to the top coat application 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 and this dessert is the end result 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.040
 as you have seen it is a nail art 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.869
 very simple to make in a 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.520
 comment as always let me know 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.250
 what do you think 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.350
 I send you a very big kiss there 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.350
 see you in a next video bye
