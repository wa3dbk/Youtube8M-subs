now<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:47.930> first<00:00:48.320> time<00:00:48.560> you<00:00:48.620> do<00:00:48.860> this<00:00:49.340> the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
now the first time you do this the

secondary graphing screen may appear

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.920 
secondary graphing screen may appear
over<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.400> original<00:00:52.910> screen<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:53.660> might

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
over the original screen so you might

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.590 
over the original screen so you might
need<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:54.470> change<00:00:55.280> between<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.090> two<00:00:56.240> alive

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
need to change between the two alive

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.080 
need to change between the two alive
screens<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.320> bottom<00:00:57.650> or<00:00:58.220> restore<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
screens in the bottom or restore the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.640 
screens in the bottom or restore the
window<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.660> move<00:00:59.810> it<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.170> your<00:01:00.290> desired

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
window and move it to your desired

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.530 
window and move it to your desired
location<00:01:03.879> next<00:01:04.879> you're<00:01:05.120> gonna<00:01:05.180> want<00:01:05.300> to

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
location next you're gonna want to

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.540 
location next you're gonna want to
choose<00:01:05.870> which<00:01:06.170> graph<00:01:06.530> you're<00:01:07.040> going<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.430> be

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
choose which graph you're going to be

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.870 
choose which graph you're going to be
viewing<00:01:08.410> so<00:01:09.410> for<00:01:09.620> example<00:01:10.100> I'm<00:01:10.340> gonna<00:01:10.580> choose

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
viewing so for example I'm gonna choose

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
viewing so for example I'm gonna choose
the<00:01:11.030> accumulated<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.810> spectral<00:01:12.290> graphs<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
the accumulated and spectral graphs and

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.580 
the accumulated and spectral graphs and
you<00:01:13.760> see<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.330> says<00:01:14.570> start<00:01:14.930> a<00:01:15.020> session<00:01:15.260> in

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you see that it says start a session in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.400 
you see that it says start a session in
the<00:01:15.710> main<00:01:15.890> alive<00:01:16.190> window<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.750> let's<00:01:17.930> run<00:01:18.110> dual

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
the main alive window so let's run dual

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.130 
the main alive window so let's run dual
drive<00:01:18.740> on<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.250> other<00:01:19.400> side<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.050> this

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
drive on the other side so in this

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.960 
drive on the other side so in this
situation<00:01:21.350> I'm<00:01:21.979> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.400> be<00:01:22.490> able<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.790> see

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
situation I'm going to be able to see

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.210 
situation I'm going to be able to see
detailed<00:01:23.479> statistics<00:01:24.380> about<00:01:24.740> heart<00:01:25.040> rate

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
detailed statistics about heart rate

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.430 
frequency spectrum while on the other
screen<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:31.009> perhaps<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.119> client<00:01:32.630> we're

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
screen and perhaps with a client we're

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.650 
screen and perhaps with a client we're
going<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.619> be<00:01:33.740> running<00:01:33.890> dual<00:01:34.250> drive<00:01:34.580> so<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.570> a

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
going to be running dual drive so in a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.540 
going to be running dual drive so in a
clinical<00:01:36.020> setting<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.770> might<00:01:36.979> be<00:01:37.130> looking<00:01:37.430> at

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
clinical setting you might be looking at

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.340 
clinical setting you might be looking at
the<00:01:37.640> graphs<00:01:37.910> whereas<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.630> client<00:01:39.020> might<00:01:39.200> be

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the graphs whereas the client might be

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.260 
the graphs whereas the client might be
playing<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.710> game<00:01:39.740> like<00:01:40.220> dual<00:01:40.460> drive<00:01:40.759> or<00:01:41.030> one<00:01:41.180> of

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
playing a game like dual drive or one of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.780 
playing a game like dual drive or one of
the<00:01:41.390> environments<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:43.040> can<00:01:43.070> also<00:01:43.369> set<00:01:43.670> this

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the environments you can also set this

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.850 
the environments you can also set this
up<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.180> display<00:01:44.420> two<00:01:44.840> different<00:01:45.229> graphs<00:01:45.440> if

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
up to display two different graphs if

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.040 
up to display two different graphs if
you<00:01:45.979> wish<00:01:46.190> by<00:01:47.000> launching<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.479> graph<00:01:47.690> on<00:01:47.899> the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
you wish by launching a graph on the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.840 
you wish by launching a graph on the
secondary<00:01:48.500> screen<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.490> could<00:01:49.729> be

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
secondary screen so you could be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.950 
secondary screen so you could be
watching<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.360> heart<00:01:50.570> rate<00:01:50.720> variability

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
watching the heart rate variability

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.559 
watching the heart rate variability
graphs<00:01:51.619> on<00:01:51.890> one<00:01:52.100> screen<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.450> other

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
graphs on one screen and on the other

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.930 
graphs on one screen and on the other
screen<00:01:53.869> viewing<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.830> detailed<00:01:55.250> information

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
screen viewing the detailed information

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.550 
screen viewing the detailed information
provided<00:01:56.509> about<00:01:56.569> skin<00:01:56.990> conductance<00:01:57.470> level<00:01:59.560> so

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
provided about skin conductance level so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.440 
provided about skin conductance level so
now<00:02:00.709> you<00:02:00.770> see<00:02:01.039> my<00:02:01.250> training<00:02:01.670> has<00:02:01.759> started<00:02:02.209> and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
now you see my training has started and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.830 
now you see my training has started and
