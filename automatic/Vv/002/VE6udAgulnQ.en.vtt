00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.280 

let's<00:00:02.100> take<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> look<00:00:02.939> at<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.389> same<00:00:03.810> test

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
let's take a look at this same test

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.299 
let's take a look at this same test
using<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.370> brain<00:00:06.180> activity<00:00:07.049> map<00:00:07.130> that<00:00:08.130> is

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
using the brain activity map that is

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.640 
using the brain activity map that is
available<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.970> people<00:00:09.360> with<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.929> consumers

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
available to people with the consumers

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.539 
available to people with the consumers
addition<00:00:11.340> you'll<00:00:12.330> notice<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:13.080> have<00:00:13.549> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
addition you'll notice that I have the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.150 
addition you'll notice that I have the
buffer<00:00:15.089> set<00:00:15.450> at<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.839> minimum<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.890> gain

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
buffer set at the minimum and the gain

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.950 
buffer set at the minimum and the gain
set<00:00:17.670> at<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.000> maximum<00:00:19.340> now<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:20.670> see<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.330> this

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
set at a maximum now let's see how this

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.660 
set at a maximum now let's see how this
is<00:00:22.230> affected<00:00:22.890> by<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.970> telephones<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.670> moving

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
is affected by the telephones and moving

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
is affected by the telephones and moving
the<00:00:26.820> feet<00:00:34.489> will<00:00:35.489> place<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> call<00:00:37.219> with<00:00:38.219> our<00:00:38.430> cell

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
the feet will place a call with our cell

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.110 
the feet will place a call with our cell
phone<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:42.920> we<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> see<00:00:44.370> we're<00:00:44.550> getting<00:00:44.700> lit

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
phone and we can see we're getting lit

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.630 
phone and we can see we're getting lit
up<00:00:45.300> pretty<00:00:45.600> good<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.980> couple<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
up pretty good here in a couple of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
up pretty good here in a couple of the
frequencies

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:45.040 

let's<00:01:02.410> try<00:01:02.739> this<00:01:02.800> with<00:01:04.409> regular

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.320 

okay<00:01:45.620> now<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:45.920> have<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.220> call<00:01:46.610> going<00:01:46.940> through

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
okay now we have a call going through

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.650 
okay now we have a call going through
here<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:49.430> see<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:49.850> have<00:01:50.060> some<00:01:50.330> activity<00:01:52.660> it's

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
here you see we have some activity it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.300 
here you see we have some activity it's
a<00:01:53.720> little<00:01:53.870> tough<00:01:54.260> to<00:01:54.290> determine<00:01:54.650> what's

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
a little tough to determine what's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.670 
a little tough to determine what's
actually<00:01:55.610> phone<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:56.990> to<00:01:57.200> actually

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
actually phone and what to actually

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.700 
actually phone and what to actually
static<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:59.120> static<00:01:59.150> effect<00:02:00.050> when<00:02:00.290> I<00:02:00.320> rub<00:02:00.680> my

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
static the static effect when I rub my

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.430 
static the static effect when I rub my
feet<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:01.550> can<00:02:01.760> see<00:02:02.000> how<00:02:02.210> pronounce<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.140> is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
feet you can see how pronounce that is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.780 
feet you can see how pronounce that is
then<00:02:04.400> as<00:02:04.550> I<00:02:04.730> bring<00:02:05.060> my<00:02:05.270> hands<00:02:05.690> close<00:02:06.200> by

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
then as I bring my hands close by

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.630 
then as I bring my hands close by
rubbing<00:02:07.790> my<00:02:08.000> feet<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.840> mat<00:02:09.250> makes<00:02:10.250> things

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
rubbing my feet on the mat makes things

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.460 
rubbing my feet on the mat makes things
very<00:02:10.790> pronounced<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> based<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.290> would

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
very pronounced so based on this I would

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.120 
very pronounced so based on this I would
say<00:02:15.710> the<00:02:15.920> single<00:02:16.400> biggest<00:02:16.840> interference<00:02:17.840> is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
say the single biggest interference is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.190 
say the single biggest interference is
rubbing<00:02:19.130> your<00:02:19.280> feet<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> plastic<00:02:20.630> man<00:02:20.900> in

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
rubbing your feet on a plastic man in

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.170 
rubbing your feet on a plastic man in
creating<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.860> static<00:02:22.340> charge<00:02:22.370> in<00:02:23.240> yourself
