00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 hi friends today we are going to try the new 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.320
 system of these tracking missiles that 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.539
 can point to the players that are 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.610
 they find in vehicles because we bring a 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:14.429
 sabah this war helicopter here 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.350
 we have like 2 4 or 6 players below 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 that's why we are at a distance 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.090
 let's say that very very high floor of the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
 So, here we already identify 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 our enemy we are identifying 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 our prey here goes forward brings a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 insurgent and that's what we're going to try to 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
 liquidate that we have it we have it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 in front of us we go down we are down 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.040
 at a totally acceptable height 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.620
 let's go, let's start with this hunt here 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 we are already proving that it really is 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.989
 pointing to this player how many rifles 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.030
 van guagua is already a batch of missiles and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.670
 is doing some evasive maneuvers it 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 he wants to escape 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.130
 how many missiles goes with sad thing 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 how many how many stories do we go 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.309
 come on let's go one plus one plus one is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 enduring a lot what happens is that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.300
 they make explosion 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 as about two meters behind 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.570
 of the insurgent that's why he's 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 holding too much let's see here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.700
 how are we going to let go? 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.640
 continue until you get tired of come 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.950
 of her that nothing nothing 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.350
 being too much in a meeting some 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.939
 player explanation I went through the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.950
 front of a missile I do not hit 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.170
 We are going to give you another one here 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.670
 it 's going a little bit but nothing here 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.860
 has to bend will lose happiness 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.410
 we are not going back we are going to lose 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.110
 speed because we already passed it ok 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.400
 we follow video 23 points impact this 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.700
 is imparting are giving today low 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.970
 approach and being closer to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 this insurgent is advancing apart already 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.050
 we are almost assured that it does not end 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.660
 of nothing one more no more in the new 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.300
 easy more visible 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.970
 it can not be just to destroy it 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.790
 it was the time it took me to destroy it the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.340
 chase too long this 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.890
 it only checks us that really 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.090
 this type of missiles for the insurgent 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.020
 they are still let's say not very lethal 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.760
 not very lethal I could almost 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.830
 ensure that I will not continue insurgents 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.080
 because really if it's a bit 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.150
 difficult to liquidate them with this new 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.680
 missile technology as good 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.680
 friends this was all goodbye 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.959
 d 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.050
 no longer
