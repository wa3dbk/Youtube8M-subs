week's transmission fluid change for the
Ford<00:00:05.759> Focus<00:00:05.879> went<00:00:06.270> so<00:00:06.390> well<00:00:06.569> I<00:00:06.779> thought<00:00:07.319> I

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
Ford Focus went so well I thought I

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.430 
Ford Focus went so well I thought I
would<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.770> my<00:00:08.100> Dodge<00:00:08.910> Caravan<00:00:09.210> next<00:00:09.990> this<00:00:10.230> is<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
would do my Dodge Caravan next this is a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.690 
would do my Dodge Caravan next this is a
2003<00:00:11.280> Dodge<00:00:12.030> Caravan<00:00:12.330> SAE<00:00:13.260> I<00:00:13.500> bought<00:00:14.490> this

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
2003 Dodge Caravan SAE I bought this

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.640 
2003 Dodge Caravan SAE I bought this
less<00:00:14.970> than<00:00:15.180> a<00:00:15.210> month<00:00:15.480> ago<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.289> figured<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
less than a month ago and I figured that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
less than a month ago and I figured that
the<00:00:16.740> transmission<00:00:17.160> fluid<00:00:17.400> hadn't<00:00:18.029> been

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the transmission fluid hadn't been

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.599 
the transmission fluid hadn't been
changed<00:00:18.509> in<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:18.900> time<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> possibly<00:00:20.160> never

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
changed in some time and possibly never

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.630 
changed in some time and possibly never
so<00:00:21.509> I'm<00:00:22.019> going<00:00:22.349> to<00:00:22.410> give<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.679> a<00:00:22.740> go<00:00:23.009> let<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
so I'm going to give this a go let you

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.939 
so I'm going to give this a go let you
know<00:00:23.759> the<00:00:23.880> process<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:25.050> any<00:00:25.380> differences

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
know the process and any differences

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.060 
know the process and any differences
between<00:00:26.159> the<00:00:26.429> focus<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.089> caravan<00:00:28.070> step

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
between the focus and the caravan step

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
between the focus and the caravan step
number<00:00:29.249> one<00:00:29.579> is<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> locate<00:00:30.359> your

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
number one is to locate your

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
number one is to locate your
transmission<00:00:31.589> fluid<00:00:32.070> pan<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.330> at

the front of the vehicle we will go
underneath<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.810> there<00:00:37.740> it<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.090> it's<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.240> black

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
underneath and there it is it's a black

pan a number of bolts surrounding it
this<00:00:43.650> is<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> pan<00:00:44.280> we'll<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.450> removing<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.380> get

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this is the pan we'll be removing to get

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.550 
this is the pan we'll be removing to get
out<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> fluid<00:00:47.540> this<00:00:48.540> pen<00:00:48.900> is<00:00:49.110> held<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.440> place

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
out the fluid this pen is held in place

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.800 
out the fluid this pen is held in place
by<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.920> number<00:00:50.130> of<00:00:50.280> ten<00:00:50.760> millimeter<00:00:51.560> bolts<00:00:52.560> and

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
by a number of ten millimeter bolts and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.450 
by a number of ten millimeter bolts and
I've<00:00:54.810> already<00:00:55.080> taken<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.650> off<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.070> drained

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I've already taken it off and drained

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.090 
I've already taken it off and drained
all<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:56.610> fluid<00:00:57.060> I<00:00:57.210> did<00:00:57.810> my<00:00:57.960> usual<00:00:58.470> siphon

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
all the fluid I did my usual siphon

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.640 
all the fluid I did my usual siphon
trick<00:00:59.310> like<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> did<00:00:59.790> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> focus<00:01:00.650> siphoning

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
trick like I did on the focus siphoning

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.800 
trick like I did on the focus siphoning
I<00:01:01.830> was<00:01:01.980> able<00:01:02.130> to<00:01:02.280> remove<00:01:02.730> three<00:01:03.420> litres<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
I was able to remove three litres of

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.739 
I was able to remove three litres of
fluid<00:01:04.219> then<00:01:05.219> when<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> finally<00:01:06.299> did<00:01:06.539> pull<00:01:06.719> off

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:06.749 
fluid then when I finally did pull off

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:08.480 
fluid then when I finally did pull off
the<00:01:06.990> pan<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.469> only<00:01:07.590> half<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> liter<00:01:08.249> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the pan there was only half a liter in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.810 
the pan there was only half a liter in
the<00:01:09.090> pan<00:01:09.329> so<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.960> very<00:01:10.200> helpful<00:01:11.070> convenient

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the pan so it's very helpful convenient

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.819 
the pan so it's very helpful convenient
and<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.289> less<00:01:13.439> messy

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
and a lot less messy

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.870 
and a lot less messy
if<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.159> siphon<00:01:14.579> it<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:15.229> if<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:17.460> do<00:01:17.640> choose

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
if you siphon it first if you do choose

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.130 
if you siphon it first if you do choose
to<00:01:17.939> siphon<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.780> when<00:01:19.289> you're<00:01:19.649> refilling<00:01:20.219> later

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
to siphon or when you're refilling later

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
to siphon or when you're refilling later
that<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.499> be<00:01:22.619> done<00:01:22.829> right<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that will be done right here this is the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.469 
that will be done right here this is the
transmission<00:01:25.109> fluid<00:01:25.409> dipstick<00:01:26.210> pulls<00:01:27.210> right

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
transmission fluid dipstick pulls right

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.129 
transmission fluid dipstick pulls right
out<00:01:27.539> and<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.799> wide<00:01:29.069> enough<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.359> funnel

00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:31.139 
out and it's wide enough that a funnel

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:32.929 
out and it's wide enough that a funnel
fits<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.649> and<00:01:31.889> this<00:01:32.249> is<00:01:32.429> also<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
fits there and this is also where the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.139 
fits there and this is also where the
refilling<00:01:33.539> happens<00:01:34.429> just<00:01:35.429> from<00:01:35.639> dropping<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
refilling happens just from dropping the

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.940 
refilling happens just from dropping the
pan<00:01:36.359> I<00:01:36.389> was<00:01:36.719> able<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.229> three<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> half

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
pan I was able to get three and a half

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.270 
pan I was able to get three and a half
liters<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.619> transmission<00:01:40.619> system<00:01:40.889> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
liters out of the transmission system I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.959 
liters out of the transmission system I
read<00:01:41.999> online<00:01:42.179> that<00:01:42.450> there's<00:01:43.079> nine<00:01:43.950> quarts

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
read online that there's nine quarts

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.699 
read online that there's nine quarts
my<00:01:45.240> guess<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.479> actually<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.229> less<00:01:46.350> than

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
my guess is actually a little less than

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.669 
my guess is actually a little less than
that<00:01:46.859> but<00:01:47.219> online<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.880> read<00:01:48.479> nine<00:01:48.929> quarts

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679

I<00:01:49.709> went<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.429> Napa<00:01:50.609> last<00:01:50.969> week<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:51.840> asked<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
I went to Napa last week and I asked the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
I went to Napa last week and I asked the
fellow<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.859> and<00:01:53.039> he<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.909> sure<00:01:54.270> that<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.479> only

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
fellow there and he was sure that I only

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.230 
fellow there and he was sure that I only
needed<00:01:54.899> four<00:01:55.289> quarts<00:01:55.709> so<00:01:55.920> he<00:01:56.189> sold<00:01:56.429> me<00:01:56.609> four

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
needed four quarts so he sold me four

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.660 
needed four quarts so he sold me four
quarts<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.719> Valvoline<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.429> after<00:01:59.429> some

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
quarts of Valvoline and after some

quarts of Valvoline and after some
online<00:01:59.999> research<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> discovered<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.170> needed

online research I discovered I needed

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.830

well as mobile the type of fluid you're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.310 
well as mobile the type of fluid you're
going<00:02:10.409> to<00:02:10.500> need<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.860> ATF<00:02:11.519> plus<00:02:12.090> four

whenever<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.100> buy<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.550> stuff<00:02:15.820> all<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
whenever you buy this stuff all the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.240 
whenever you buy this stuff all the
labels<00:02:16.780> as<00:02:16.990> well<00:02:17.140> as<00:02:17.260> these<00:02:17.440> two<00:02:17.710> are<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
labels as well as these two are going to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.600 
labels as well as these two are going to
say<00:02:18.460> recommended<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:19.600> Chrysler<00:02:20.610> recommended

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
say recommended for Chrysler recommended

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.970 
say recommended for Chrysler recommended
for<00:02:21.790> Chrysler<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.720> reason<00:02:22.990> why<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.560> ATF

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
for Chrysler the reason why is that ATF

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.440 
for Chrysler the reason why is that ATF
plus<00:02:24.310> four<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:25.450> Chrysler<00:02:25.930> fluid<00:02:26.620> they

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
plus four is a Chrysler fluid they

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.390 
plus four is a Chrysler fluid they
created<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:29.500> regulate<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.100> as<00:02:30.220> well

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
created it and they regulate it as well

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.980 
created it and they regulate it as well
so<00:02:30.580> everything<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.360> going<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.660> say<00:02:31.780> for

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
so everything is going to say for

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.960 
so everything is going to say for
Chrysler<00:02:32.350> vehicles<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.070> if<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> Dodge

do that is to pull one of the two hoses
you'll<00:03:54.070> see<00:03:54.250> down<00:03:54.460> here<00:03:54.630> so<00:03:55.630> it's<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.290> below

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
you'll see down here so it's just below

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.060 
you'll see down here so it's just below
the<00:03:57.010> coolant<00:03:57.790> reservoir<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.500> look<00:03:59.680> down

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
the coolant reservoir if you look down

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.790 
the coolant reservoir if you look down
in<00:04:00.520> there<00:04:00.730> you'll<00:04:01.120> see<00:04:01.420> two<00:04:02.080> lines<00:04:02.380> right

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
in there you'll see two lines right

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.750 
in there you'll see two lines right
there<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.230> what<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.500> want<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.770> do<00:04:05.980> see

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
there and what you want to do see

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.520 
there and what you want to do see
there's<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:07.570> on<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.810> left<00:04:08.050> there's<00:04:08.440> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
there's the one on the left there's the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.190 
there's the one on the left there's the
one<00:04:08.680> on<00:04:08.800> the<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.100> is<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:10.720> want<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.960> take

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
one on the right is you want to take

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.620 
one on the right is you want to take
from<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.890> position<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.970> one<00:04:13.090> on<00:04:13.240> the<00:04:13.390> left

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
from this position the one on the left

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.500 
from this position the one on the left
so<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.710> hose<00:04:14.970> it's<00:04:15.970> referred<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.359> as

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
so this is the hose it's referred to as

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.229 
so this is the hose it's referred to as
the<00:04:16.900> right<00:04:17.170> side<00:04:17.500> hose<00:04:17.859> because<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:18.640> refer<00:04:19.210> to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the right side hose because you refer to

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.320 
the right side hose because you refer to
sides<00:04:19.590> from<00:04:20.590> as<00:04:21.100> if<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:21.609> were<00:04:21.729> seat<00:04:22.000> sitting

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
sides from as if you were seat sitting

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.950 
sides from as if you were seat sitting
in<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.479> vehicle<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.440> it's<00:04:24.430> this<00:04:24.729> one<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.750> want

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
in the vehicle so it's this one you want

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.700 
in the vehicle so it's this one you want
to<00:04:26.050> disconnect

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
to disconnect

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.180 
to disconnect
you<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.630> maybe<00:04:28.630> see<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.050> connector<00:04:29.710> here<00:04:29.949> as

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
you can maybe see the connector here as

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.820 
you can maybe see the connector here as
oom<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.610> there<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:31.090> is

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
oom in there it is

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.070 
oom in there it is
it's<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.310> clamp<00:04:33.699> you<00:04:34.180> just<00:04:34.360> need<00:04:34.509> some<00:04:34.750> pliers

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
it's a clamp you just need some pliers

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.150 
it's a clamp you just need some pliers
and<00:04:35.620> give<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.190> good<00:04:36.340> squeeze<00:04:36.729> yank<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.810> off

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and give it a good squeeze yank that off

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.520 
and give it a good squeeze yank that off
you<00:04:39.160> can<00:04:39.400> then<00:04:39.610> set<00:04:40.180> up<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.599> catch<00:04:41.229> pan

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
you can then set up a catch pan

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.370 
you can then set up a catch pan
underneath<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.599> you<00:04:43.599> don't<00:04:43.780> need<00:04:43.960> an<00:04:44.080> extra

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
underneath and you don't need an extra

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.059 
underneath and you don't need an extra

old fluid out of that the torque

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.029 
old fluid out of that the torque
converter<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.750> cooler<00:05:05.050> it'll<00:05:05.889> come

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
converter and the cooler it'll come

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.100 
converter and the cooler it'll come
right<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.220> of<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.550> line<00:05:06.810> while<00:05:07.810> it's

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
right out of that line while it's

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.310 
right out of that line while it's
pouring<00:05:08.470> out<00:05:09.449> simultaneously<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:10.960> have<00:05:11.139> your

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
pouring out simultaneously you have your

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.529 
pouring out simultaneously you have your
dipstick<00:05:11.620> out<00:05:11.889> you<00:05:12.460> have<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.669> funnel<00:05:13.090> here<00:05:13.330> and

dipstick out you have a funnel here and

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.560 
dipstick out you have a funnel here and
you're<00:05:14.110> pouring<00:05:14.410> new<00:05:14.710> fluid<00:05:15.009> in<00:05:15.250> as<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:16.419> old

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
you're pouring new fluid in as the old

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.870 
you're pouring new fluid in as the old
fluid<00:05:16.870> drains<00:05:17.289> out<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.159> much<00:05:18.310> easier<00:05:18.759> to

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
fluid drains out this is much easier to

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.149 
fluid drains out this is much easier to
do<00:05:19.030> if<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.599> have<00:05:19.810> an<00:05:20.080> assistant<00:05:20.440> somebody
