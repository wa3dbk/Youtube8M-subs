00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello everyone my name is ark and here 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.010
 I bring you the level number guide here 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.010
 4 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.740
 welcome to level number 15 which is the 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.410
 Poseidon temple here on your left 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.189
 they will appreciate the powerful chicken 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.329
 I will use later or maybe not 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.550
 depending on which direction you decide to take in 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.710
 this guide I will tell you about it more 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.449
 forward for now keep to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.519
 signed peking that comes here that 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.600
 wait for them to subscribe to spend on 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.250
 a gap and well down here we are going to 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.409
 tell a secret that is the only 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.180
 secret that you find all the level and 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.220
 this is the only opportunity they have 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.049
 to grab it you can not grab it from 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.049
 it is or not children over the eyes 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.810
 because I tell people that you are 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 good person and nothing exhibitionist you 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.720
 I defend you I defend before those who 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.410
 they walk the one who dismissed baby no no no no 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.080
 the scream is decent and it will not help me 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.050
 help you learn learn this new 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.530
 step I discovered wow do not like it but if 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.840
 that's the way it is but good 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.840
 we must sometimes spend 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.289
 it's the only opportunity they have of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.289
 grab that secret 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.429
 because then it closes and they can no longer 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.960
 grab so take advantage ok ok 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.990
 here find a few more attempts 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.539
 but being skeletons as always and 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.539
 I'll wait for them to come 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:48.020
 but good the purpose of this level is 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.200
 accommodate already I finally did not wait for this 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.899
 concentrate here direct is to accommodate 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.580
 the four presidents we got 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.520
 in the previous level we are going to put it in 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.179
 this one that is supposed to be poseidon to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.009
 same but good in this we put them 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.349
 there and ready 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.640
 begins to run the water there are four 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.340
 roads 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.560
 obviously 4 tridents of having 4 way 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.959
 really and everyone is activated this guy 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.319
 source that will serve to fill a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.870
 bag with water that is in the center of 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.519
 this road here 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.830
 and this is the purpose of this part 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.190
 the level of and we went to 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.900
 or goddess how good is the bookstore 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.970
 odious loss will be good 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.740
 and well, each path has its 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.690
 level of difficulty you already saw in the 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.760
 past was with fire this is one of 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.490
 the difficult because here there is no need 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.710
 burn or perfect can make you like 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.790
 want you can approach with little steps and 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.640
 small step 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.590
 until I hit them the fire I do 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.180
 well because it makes me faster so 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.460
 it's the most efficient but it's the most 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.950
 fast you see how I like it I like it 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.950
 make the fast track something curious and that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.950
 not many know is that I do the guides 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.470
 fast but at first it was not like that or 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.500
 be it if you associate it fast but it was not 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.230
 because I would like but because my 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.709
 computer has a hard drive of 80 GB 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 and then the flash recorded or 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.420
 I do not know 20 minutes were already 40 and 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.230
 my memory ran out and that's why 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.840
 you have to be quick to the little one and 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.640
 this one and it's kind of funny because apart from 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.550
 from there I started doing all the 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.800
 quick guides and I liked it and it made me 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.140
 to do and is faster than the others 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.030
 I've seen out there but good some 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.730
 they say where I am going to enjoy the level 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.200
 in the first guides that says why 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.600
 It should be mentioned that the discourse does not 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.390
 I bought this I think that to the almost 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.030
 ending tomb raider underworld well 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.460
 that then the history behind the myth 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.800
 why the ark were born antilles 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.850
 fast and keeps making it clear that yes 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.950
 and well, we have all of us 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.080
 there are two others that are missing 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.730
 here will go up on this side because this one 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.390
 does not publish faster back and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:12.230
 you have to learn me as that is 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.160
 if you see I use a lot in this and varying 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.160
 between the shotgun 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.910
 between the guns to destroy this 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.390
 gun does not go well to destroy these 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.040
 pots the shotgun to kill and dance 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.490
 the dance 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.170
 the perfect item well very well have 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.810
 turned the dances to tomb raider 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:40.980
 wake up old it's time to swim 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.600
 so then I do not eat anything but I do not think 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.900
 that nobody very well the skeleton does not have 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.450
 with which to float with bones will float good 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.930
 I must stop rambling my god 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.020
 I was telling you if I change a lot 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.210
 of weapons although I had to learn that 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.530
 weapon to use in what pieces for example 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.790
 right now I have to remember that I have the 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.380
 shot put so that for the 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.870
 next enemy I must have the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.360
 shotgun list and then take them out 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.090
 right now if I'm not wrong, well, another 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.340
 What I was going to tell you was that in 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.290
 this level is going to leave us a ghost a 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.040
 about electro or how they made me 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:20.040
 understand recently in a comment 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.410
 chokers spirits and the Lord I've 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.690
 said the choirrero spirit will come out in 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.850
 this level of what we are going to do good 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.190
 you saw at the beginning the level the 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.140
 powerful hen which destroys the 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.830
 choker spirits 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.320
 but there is a good little problem to me if not 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.300
 it's a problem that when I go up with the 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.920
 hen when he left the last one this 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.770
 source the hen does not work is not it 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.780
 he does not grab the ghost and there he is giving me 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.910
 turns until it kills me and what I've 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.420
 decided to take me a little bit more 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.790
 forward they are going to take me to the spectrum 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:02.580
 I do not like a small one as they come out of 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:04.560
 ajaja and then it will not go out more 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.840
 go ahead if you want to do it like that 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.840
 well, if not, then you know where 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.060
 kill the powerful chicken from the beginning 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.700
 is if it makes me a little bit slower 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.650
 but it's fine 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.150
 and well, I think we're going to 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.000
 finish 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.930
 What is missing is to throw the nail 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.870
 center and ready can no longer prevent 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.640
 we hit the spectrum true but good 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.700
 let's give it here is going to come out of there 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:36.460
 the mouth of that Mayan statue that is in 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.720
 egypt in Roman structures like this is 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.770
 the rapids do not want us to touch and 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.410
 or misfortunes not because I'm closer 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.860
 lost temple not the lost bookstore no 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.860
 I want 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.720
 who sends you 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:01.020
 this is where he says he has complicated 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.330
 the thing because we are going to get two 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.160
 Elusive spectra in total are going to be 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:11.230
 three and you have to wait for us in attempts 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:13.870
 this the 323 perfect for ones or is 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:16.120
 true now we have to grab good 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:19.180
 first the beginning of the game we have 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.030
 that get the link we get the anc 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.580
 bongrain a little bit, we scampered abro 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.380
 peacock that today we do not reach it I think 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.270
 that we have to be good walking line 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.390
 but they do not have the armor of I think that 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.700
 it's gold we have to put together 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:36.070
 said armor and that's what we 're going to do 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.780
 and everything has been done as they should 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:41.050
 have done at this time should 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:43.210
 have 49 secrets of 70 and here 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.280
 we finish this guide my name is 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:50.310
 close thank you very much for having seen 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.310
 video and I see them in the next 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.820
 but the lost library not goodbye
