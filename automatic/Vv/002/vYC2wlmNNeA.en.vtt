00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
before and we don't know what we're

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330

going<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> find<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.200> anything<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.979> we've

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
going to find if anything well we've

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.200

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
already found a relic here but so that I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
got a feeling the pickings are going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.609 
got a feeling the pickings are going to
be<00:01:20.310> slim<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:20.960> we'll<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.110> what<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.409> find

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
be slim but we'll see what we can find
