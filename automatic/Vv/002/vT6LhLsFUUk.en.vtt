00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
yo guys spoke about here we've got an

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.390 
yo guys spoke about here we've got an
achievement<00:00:12.060> guide<00:00:12.270> for<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:13.230> facing<00:00:14.070> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
achievement guide for you for facing the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
achievement guide for you for facing the
dragon<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.240> rise<00:00:15.480> face<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.110> dragon

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
dragon and I rise face the dragon

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.400 
dragon and I rise face the dragon
head-on<00:00:17.040> before<00:00:17.790> reaching<00:00:18.270> round<00:00:18.869> 2<00:00:19.110> so

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
head-on before reaching round 2 so

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.380 
head-on before reaching round 2 so
basically<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.220> got<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> do<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.640> on<00:00:20.700> round<00:00:21.029> 1

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
basically we got to do it on round 1

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.630 
basically we got to do it on round 1
what<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> got<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.860> go<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> elevator

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
what you got to do is go in the elevator

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
what you got to do is go in the elevator
and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.090> think<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.450> elevator<00:00:24.599> drops<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:26.070> all

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and I think the elevator drops with all

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
and I think the elevator drops with all
the<00:00:26.550> players<00:00:26.790> that<00:00:27.119> happen<00:00:27.329> to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.419> playing<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the players that happen to be playing in

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.569 
the players that happen to be playing in
that<00:00:28.110> game<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.619> if<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.130> playing<00:00:29.310> four

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
that game so if you're playing four

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.310 
that game so if you're playing four
players<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.060> need<00:00:30.180> all<00:00:30.329> four<00:00:30.599> players<00:00:30.840> for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
players you need all four players for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.490 
players you need all four players for
the<00:00:31.380> elevator<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.739> drop<00:00:31.980> 3<00:00:32.279> 3<00:00:32.610> 2<00:00:33.150> 2<00:00:33.390> 1<00:00:33.420> 1<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the elevator to drop 3 3 2 2 1 1 so you

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.819 
the elevator to drop 3 3 2 2 1 1 so you
can<00:00:34.770> actually<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.820> solo<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.649> 2<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.800> 3

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can actually do this solo or with 2 or 3

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.460 
can actually do this solo or with 2 or 3
or<00:00:38.040> 4<00:00:38.220> players<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.360> come<00:00:39.810> down<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
or 4 players so we come down into the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.020 
or 4 players so we come down into the
other<00:00:40.560> building<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.160> jump<00:00:41.400> down<00:00:41.580> here<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
other building we jump down here and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
other building we jump down here and
what<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.110> gonna<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.740> build<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.130> some

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
what we're gonna do is build up some

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.400 
what we're gonna do is build up some
points<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.940> only<00:00:45.060> need<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.390> open<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.870> door<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
points you only need to open one door in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.080 
points you only need to open one door in
order<00:00:46.560> to<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.580> get<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> rest

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
order to do this and we can get the rest

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
order to do this and we can get the rest
of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> way<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:49.500> I'm<00:00:49.710> gonna<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.070> enough
