00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
but um I don't think they should know if

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.200 
but um I don't think they should know if
it<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.729> they<00:01:47.820> should<00:01:48.000> never

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it that much I think they should never

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.179 
it that much I think they should never
to<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> point<00:01:48.540> where<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> damage<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
soldier in like three shots but the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200
