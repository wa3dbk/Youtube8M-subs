goes<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:08.270> battery<00:01:09.270> meter

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
goes into your battery meter

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.050 
goes into your battery meter
like<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> said<00:01:11.970> they<00:01:12.270> trial<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> error<00:01:14.060> but

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
like I said they trial and error but

and<00:01:17.030> she's<00:01:18.030> working<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
and she's working now as you can see I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.929 
and she's working now as you can see I
got<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:21.290> well

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.850 

got<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:26.960> there<00:01:27.170> you<00:01:27.500> can<00:01:27.649> make<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.250> constant

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
got it there you can make it constant

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.609 
got it there you can make it constant
with<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:32.060> lever<00:01:32.299> here<00:01:32.630> speed<00:01:33.170> control

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
with the the lever here speed control

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.910 
with the the lever here speed control
works

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.970 

and<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:46.410> can't<00:01:47.410> see<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.680> because<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:47.920> don't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
and well can't see that because I don't

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.000 
and well can't see that because I don't
have<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.250> collar<00:01:48.460> on<00:01:48.700> there<00:01:48.880> but<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.920> the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
have the collar on there but you see the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.270 
have the collar on there but you see the
transmission<00:01:51.430> works<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.500> Motors<00:01:53.920> still<00:01:54.100> good

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
transmission works so Motors still good

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.980 
transmission works so Motors still good
in<00:01:54.340> there<00:01:54.460> I<00:01:54.610> actually<00:01:54.880> had<00:01:55.330> this<00:01:55.510> torn<00:01:55.900> apart

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
in there I actually had this torn apart

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.770 
in there I actually had this torn apart
a<00:01:56.440> few<00:01:56.950> days<00:01:57.130> ago<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:58.030> tested<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.450> motor

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
a few days ago and I tested that motor

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.630 
a few days ago and I tested that motor
same<00:01:59.740> way<00:01:59.920> hooked<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:01.410> white<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.710> black<00:02:03.400> up

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
same way hooked the white and black up

to a 12 volt battery which is I used the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.180 
to a 12 volt battery which is I used the
optimum<00:02:07.930> here<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.290> just<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.590> spare<00:02:08.800> battery<00:02:08.920> a

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
optimum here is just a spare battery a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.160 
optimum here is just a spare battery a
head<00:02:09.399> laying<00:02:09.550> around<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:12.400> her<00:02:12.490> working

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
they knew what they're doing as you can

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.930 
they knew what they're doing as you can
see<00:02:43.600> here<00:02:43.840> here's<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.110> old<00:02:44.380> pedal<00:02:45.040> a<00:02:45.430> torn

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
see here here's the old pedal a torn

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.449 
see here here's the old pedal a torn
apart<00:02:46.030> here's<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.690> old<00:02:46.840> control<00:02:47.110> board<00:02:47.459> but

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
apart here's the old control board but

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.790 
apart here's the old control board but
this<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.300> believe<00:02:49.780> was<00:02:49.930> actually<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.560> problem

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
this I believe was actually the problem

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.449 
this I believe was actually the problem
the<00:02:51.580> pedal<00:02:51.880> wasn't<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:53.110> board<00:02:53.800> wasn't<00:02:54.190> making

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
the pedal wasn't the board wasn't making

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.670 
the pedal wasn't the board wasn't making
good<00:02:54.640> connections<00:02:54.940> but<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.660> think<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.380> was<00:02:56.500> that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
good connections but I think it was that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.350 
good connections but I think it was that
and<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.519> there's<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> some<00:02:58.150> kind<00:02:58.330> of

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and then I think there's a some kind of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.970 
and then I think there's a some kind of
switch<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.780> here<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.320> might<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.620> gone<00:02:59.739> bad

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
switch in here that might have gone bad

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.410 
switch in here that might have gone bad
so<00:03:00.220> I<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.489> went<00:03:00.640> ahead<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.850> did<00:03:00.970> both<00:03:01.209> of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
so I just went ahead and did both of

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420 
so I just went ahead and did both of
them<00:03:01.540> really<00:03:02.290> complicated<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.920> test<00:03:03.250> this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
them really complicated to test this

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.130 
them really complicated to test this
board<00:03:03.760> because<00:03:04.360> it's<00:03:04.510> all<00:03:04.630> enclosed<00:03:04.930> in

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
board because it's all enclosed in

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.750 
board because it's all enclosed in
silicone<00:03:05.760> but<00:03:06.760> uh<00:03:06.810> anyways<00:03:07.810> that's<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:08.950> hope

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
silicone but uh anyways that's it hope

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.680 
silicone but uh anyways that's it hope
