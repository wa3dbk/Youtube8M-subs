00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.100
 now we are going to study more independence if we start with 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.719
 independence with the first rhythm after we live a little bit of ugly 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.299
 but not only in dependence because you have to see 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.070
 another completely different system 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.980
 a system that needs is more than a new graphic a graphic that is divided 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.789
 now in twelve parts 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 twelve parts that we continue counting in the same way 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.470
 4 but now every three notes every time I count about 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.730
 let's now play three times in the area 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.000
 to those three times of we call pÃ©rez and I 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.170
 one two three one two three one two three one two three 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.240
 on the chart when we go well 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.280
 two 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 and 4 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.840
 yes in this system we are also going to move the left leg to keep 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 our mechanism 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.679
 and the drummer 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.920
 again it's going to be in 2004 and if we play the bass drum in the wrist 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.729
 communisms in the most basic rhythm we learned the beginning of all this 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.560
 course 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 we would get a rhythm that sounds like this 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 two 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.260
 efe 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
 fatah 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 every time he plays the drum I gave three notes here 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.570
 and then in the raal ante 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.990
 again in the hype 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.550
 steering wheel 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.550
 to achieve my 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.530
 Now it is very important that you realize that this new system is good 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.910
 different from the other 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.620
 and sometimes they can not be mixed, they are still very good 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.300
 if they mix obviously in some kind of music especially music 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.499
 Latin is used a lot is the two against three that refers to just that 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.729
 to the chart that we had before it will be divided into two bodies that 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 we said jun 2 3 4 we played humanity 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.259
 in puno 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.829
 and two notes are now we are playing three notes between decided to divide mosley 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.609
 the graph in twelve parts again 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.579
 now we did play one after the other to play my first beat the most 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.990
 basic of all and now this that the two have a hype in one and the three 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.499
 both have rolling in 2004 but they have totally different beech 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.019
 they urged to feel differently better touched it so they realize 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.630
 one after the other 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.630
 and earn the difference 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.139
 yes 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.849
 if they realize in detail in good they think as if they were trying to 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.689
 to dance what I just played is like starting in some kind of modality and 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.480
 after jumping to another as they do not mix with each other 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.950
 are going to find today in the san temple where everything is mixed is possible in the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.660
 music but in general it is not done or if it is done soon it is some kind of 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.200
 percussion that makes it against but its deepest of being music 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.260
 latina that you can see it in thousands of specialized videos here we are 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.379
 seeing is the basics to be able to later 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.079
 we face different types of music 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.259
 but as you can suspect if this is a study in independence and 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.699
 they followed well how the whole course works 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.990
 let's do it again 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.440
 a system of this kind of rhythm this kind of rhythm with each other I 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.310
 i go again parade the hype of the equation and touch it as a system 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:53.689
 again in the couple in the twelve notes about 12 garages of the graph and now the 

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.109
 left foot doing the same role in 2004 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.219
 i'm going to play two hype notes 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:05.259
 in the first note in the first chart box and now in the second 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.910
 We were going to touch it all running one after the other I'm going to touch the example 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.019
 full 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.470
 an example after another 4k the first example the first measure and then the 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.690
 next compared to touch the second example but remember you have 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.450
 what to practice 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.409
 each one of them and they know they have it well dominates 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.560
 here the example to have it as a reference chan 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.719
 3 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:29.489
 4 i
