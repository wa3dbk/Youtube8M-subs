a<00:00:33.890> little<00:00:34.890> slack<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.969> would<00:00:36.360> say<00:00:36.630> very<00:00:37.380> worn<00:00:37.739> out

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
a little slack I would say very worn out

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
a little slack I would say very worn out
I<00:00:39.320> did<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.350> order<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.430> new<00:00:42.149> sprocket<00:00:43.050> yet<00:00:43.469> but

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I did not order a new sprocket yet but

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.119 
I did not order a new sprocket yet but
it<00:00:44.640> looks<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.390> worn<00:00:45.930> if<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it looks like it's pretty worn if you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
it looks like it's pretty worn if you
can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> there<00:00:50.000> as<00:00:51.000> far<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
can see it in there as far as I know the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
can see it in there as far as I know the
water<00:00:52.140> pump<00:00:52.469> works<00:00:52.710> everything's<00:00:53.280> good

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
water pump works everything's good

radiators<00:00:54.329> cool<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> shocks<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.829> need<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.309> be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
radiators cool the shocks do need to be

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.330 
radiators cool the shocks do need to be
adjusted<00:00:59.660> with<00:01:00.660> heavier<00:01:01.109> weight<00:01:01.350> oil<00:01:01.620> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
adjusted with heavier weight oil because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219 
adjusted with heavier weight oil because
I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> seals<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.210> bad<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.140> they

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I think the seals are bad and they

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.440 
I think the seals are bad and they
probably<00:01:04.439> leaked<00:01:04.680> out<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> oil<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.610> see

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
probably leaked out all the oil see see

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.429 
probably leaked out all the oil see see
how<00:01:06.540> soft<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.049> shocks<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.869> bikes<00:01:10.080> moving

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
how soft the shocks are the bikes moving

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.810 
how soft the shocks are the bikes moving
a<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.710> amount<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> I'm<00:01:11.280> barely<00:01:11.460> playing<00:01:11.760> an

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
a good amount and I'm barely playing an

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
a good amount and I'm barely playing an
eight<00:01:11.909> force<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.970> seems<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> rear

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
eight force on that so it seems the rear

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.080 
eight force on that so it seems the rear
but<00:01:15.869> these<00:01:16.740> bikes<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.250> come<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.610> adjustable

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
but these bikes do come with adjustable

but these bikes do come with adjustable
rear<00:01:18.540> suspension<00:01:20.330> we<00:01:21.330> changed<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
rear suspension we changed all of the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.370 
rear suspension we changed all of the
you<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.150> better<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.229> here

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you see if I get better you over here

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.270 
you see if I get better you over here
alright<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:27.030> raining<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.479> by<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.990> so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.609 

we<00:01:32.280> did<00:01:32.460> change<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.820> oils<00:01:33.240> including<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
we did change all oils including the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.910 
we did change all oils including the
brake<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.369> brake<00:01:36.240> fluid<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.290> transmission

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
brake the brake fluid the transmission

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.149 
brake the brake fluid the transmission
oil<00:01:38.150> we're<00:01:39.150> yet<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.540> change<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.200> radiator

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
oil we're yet to change the radiator

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.889 
oil we're yet to change the radiator
fluid<00:01:41.869> but<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.890> will<00:01:44.130> probably<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.899> doing

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
fluid but you will probably get doing

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.469 
fluid but you will probably get doing
that<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:47.130> soon<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.610> possible

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that as soon as possible

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
that as soon as possible
I<00:01:48.509> bought<00:01:48.899> some<00:01:49.140> coolant<00:01:49.740> all<00:01:50.280> new<00:01:50.970> oils<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I bought some coolant all new oils and

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.590 
I bought some coolant all new oils and
crap<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.430> I'm<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.610> waiting<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.210> parts

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
crap and I'm just waiting on these parts

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.109 
crap and I'm just waiting on these parts
to<00:01:54.780> come<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.490> ride<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
to come so I could actually ride it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.709 
to come so I could actually ride it
without<00:01:57.799> without<00:01:58.799> its<00:01:59.009> stalling<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.729> bogging

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
without without its stalling or bogging

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
without without its stalling or bogging
out<00:02:00.869> after<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> few<00:02:01.350> feet<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.100> can't

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
out after a few feet because we can't

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.210 
out after a few feet because we can't
hold<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.759> any<00:02:02.850> whew

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
hold it any whew

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.720 
hold it any whew
it<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:05.170> I<00:02:05.650> do<00:02:05.860> not<00:02:06.100> have<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.400> in<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.610> garage

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
it but I do not have it in the garage

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.700 
it but I do not have it in the garage
because<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.810> some<00:02:07.990> reason<00:02:08.020> it<00:02:08.350> smells<00:02:08.590> like

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
because for some reason it smells like

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.660 
because for some reason it smells like
gas<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.340> reeks<00:02:09.700> it's<00:02:10.420> not<00:02:10.600> leaking<00:02:10.899> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
gas and it reeks it's not leaking I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.040 
gas and it reeks it's not leaking I
don't<00:02:12.670> know<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.820> think<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.840> clean

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
don't know I think I just have to clean

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.810 
don't know I think I just have to clean
it<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.350> probably<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.800> some<00:02:14.980> fuel<00:02:15.310> around

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
it it's probably like some fuel around

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.360 
it it's probably like some fuel around
the<00:02:16.030> motor<00:02:16.240> or<00:02:16.450> something<00:02:16.830> only<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.980> few<00:02:18.220> drops

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the motor or something only a few drops

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.400 
the motor or something only a few drops
it's<00:02:19.270> all<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.570> takes<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.920> uh<00:02:21.570> yeah<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.810> brakes

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's all it takes but uh yeah the brakes

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.280 
it's all it takes but uh yeah the brakes
are<00:02:23.680> very<00:02:24.580> good<00:02:24.850> actually<00:02:25.240> their<00:02:25.780> hydraulic
