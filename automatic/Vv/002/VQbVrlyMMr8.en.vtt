00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.889
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.040
 hello and welcome from 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.029
 I have a dog and blinds 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.680
 cats fright brought this part 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 green somehow fits the garden yes there 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 you can hide a bit 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.710
 and that has a motion detector 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.890
 built in there is an ultrasound 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.470
 speaker and a light emitting diode there 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 you can always see if it is active like that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.070
 now it is not and so soon move 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.649
 since it starts again 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 it changes the frequencies between 18 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.239
 and 25 kilohertz that means we as 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.360
 Munich can not hear that but it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 is quite loud dogs and cats running 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 away from it also mice and it goes 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
 you could be expelled with it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.949
 not yet watch but in dogs 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 react to it very extreme 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.930
 so that you can determine what that is 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.449
 is there a test function here ? 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 built that one what it gets 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.610
 radiates to a lower one for us 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.350
 audible frequency now has them 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.090
 So listen to what I hear right away 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 Normally that's the way it is now 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 So you hear the frequency is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.380
 changed that is no uniform 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.509
 volume 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.580
 this is very important for many animals and 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 say as well as there is nothing happening 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 but if that changes then the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.659
 always dangerous for us humans too 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 if you have to do it evenly 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 monotonous then it is usually not so 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 dangerous as something like that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.729
 what I change constantly 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.369
 Sun looks at times that one again 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 This device is operated inaudibly 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.450
 About a power supply that comes in handy 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.880
 but also included 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.640
 but by the way is very small fat 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 Networks seems to be starting now so listen 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.750
 great and a hood a weatherproof me 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.000
 Can this hood just now here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.890
 push over it so if they are there and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 I can still do that for myself 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.989
 fix it somewhere on the garden fence or 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.330
 at the post or at the wall or something and so 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.100
 then this device sits on the wall 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.260
 one should 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.850
 mount so low that there are also dogs 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.890
 and cats can see in two meters height 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.150
 it does not help and then they protect 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.700
 maybe your fish too 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.560
 garden pond when neighbors come to me 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.030
 and the sounds that they say here I go 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
 rather in and high level at that one 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.220
 So eat a nice device for lunch 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.860
 I hope it has his garden again 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.220
 Have fun and wish you a nice day and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220
 bye
