put some tape cover it up and slightly
pushed<00:01:46.219> it<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.609> I'm<00:01:46.850> not<00:01:46.999> sure<00:01:47.149> if<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.299> seen<00:01:48.460> so

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
pushed it in I'm not sure if you seen so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.620 
pushed it in I'm not sure if you seen so
I<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.700> start<00:01:49.880> tracing<00:01:50.179> it<00:01:50.450> with<00:01:50.539> my<00:01:50.659> pin<00:01:52.630> that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
I can start tracing it with my pin that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.020 
I can start tracing it with my pin that
way<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.840> gives<00:01:53.990> me<00:01:54.200> an<00:01:54.469> outline<00:01:55.069> once<00:01:55.939> I

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
way it gives me an outline once I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.959 
way it gives me an outline once I
transfer<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.509> over<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.049> sheet<00:01:57.380> metal

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
transfer this over to the sheet metal

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.679 
transfer this over to the sheet metal
what<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:58.999> need<00:01:59.209> to<00:01:59.270> cut<00:01:59.450> out<00:02:01.329> tape<00:02:02.329> is<00:02:02.509> very

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
what I need to cut out tape is very

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.580 
what I need to cut out tape is very
inexpensive<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:03.439> very<00:02:03.590> easy<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.299> know<00:02:05.590> any

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
inexpensive it's very easy you know any

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.989 
inexpensive it's very easy you know any
regular<00:02:07.009> pen<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.369> write<00:02:07.490> on<00:02:07.579> tape<00:02:07.759> pretty

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
regular pen can write on tape pretty

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.229 
regular pen can write on tape pretty
much<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.560> so<00:02:09.729> here's<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.910> plate

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
much so that's it so here's the plate

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.470 
much so that's it so here's the plate
already<00:02:13.349> cut<00:02:14.349> out<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.760> use<00:02:15.909> the<00:02:16.030> template<00:02:16.389> we

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
already cut out we use the template we

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.569 
already cut out we use the template we
made<00:02:16.629> earlier<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:18.430> trace<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> sheet<00:02:18.999> metal

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
made earlier to trace the sheet metal

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.170 
made earlier to trace the sheet metal
and<00:02:21.579> that'll<00:02:22.090> work<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.849> hundred

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
and that'll work it's not a hundred

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.520 
and that'll work it's not a hundred
percent<00:02:25.560> perfect<00:02:26.560> fit<00:02:27.689> but<00:02:28.689> it's<00:02:29.049> very<00:02:29.230> close

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
percent perfect fit but it's very close

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.559 
percent perfect fit but it's very close
you<00:02:30.010> know<00:02:30.129> I'm<00:02:30.700> gonna<00:02:30.790> take<00:02:30.969> my<00:02:31.120> time<00:02:31.299> well

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
you know I'm gonna take my time well

you know I'm gonna take my time well
then<00:02:31.719> it's<00:02:31.840> slowly

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
then it's slowly

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.640 
then it's slowly
we're<00:02:32.409> already<00:02:32.560> grinded<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.129> you<00:02:33.219> can<00:02:33.340> see

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
we're already grinded as you can see

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.629 
we're already grinded as you can see
when<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.709> had<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:35.889> put<00:02:36.040> my<00:02:36.099> protection<00:02:36.549> around

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
when I had to put my protection around

little fiberglass cloth on top I should

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.360 
little fiberglass cloth on top I should
do<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.769> just<00:02:45.010> fine<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.829> all<00:02:47.889> saw<00:02:48.040> earlier

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370

do the just fine as you all saw earlier
I<00:02:48.430> already<00:02:48.639> have<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.879> template<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.389> it<00:02:49.530> for

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
I already have the template for it for

the hole for the actual brake light but
for<00:02:54.519> these<00:02:54.639> small<00:02:54.879> holes<00:02:55.769> now<00:02:56.769> we're<00:02:56.919> holding

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
for these small holes now we're holding

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.509 
for these small holes now we're holding
the<00:02:57.310> bolts<00:02:57.669> and<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.150> screws<00:02:58.449> I<00:02:58.689> should<00:02:58.870> say<00:02:59.519> so

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
the bolts and the screws I should say so

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.000 
the bolts and the screws I should say so
the<00:03:00.639> third<00:03:00.819> brake<00:03:01.060> light<00:03:01.090> I'm<00:03:01.389> gonna<00:03:01.510> use

these<00:03:03.010> type<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> pliers<00:03:03.669> here<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> gold

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
these type of pliers here have a gold

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.069 
these type of pliers here have a gold
plate<00:03:06.000> excuse<00:03:07.000> me<00:03:07.150> as<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.299> copper<00:03:07.599> plate<00:03:07.719> on<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
plate excuse me as a copper plate on the

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.039 
plate excuse me as a copper plate on the
back<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> weld<00:03:09.669> won't<00:03:09.849> stick<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.389> makes

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
back so the weld won't stick to it makes

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.300 
back so the weld won't stick to it makes
it<00:03:11.199> pretty<00:03:11.319> easy<00:03:12.150> instead<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.269> having<00:03:13.449> to<00:03:14.310> cut

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
it pretty easy instead of having to cut

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.740 
it pretty easy instead of having to cut
something<00:03:15.579> for<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:18.209> set<00:03:19.209> on<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.419> back<00:03:21.629> hold<00:03:22.629> it

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
something for it set on the back hold it

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.559 
something for it set on the back hold it
down<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.169> so<00:03:23.729> and<00:03:24.729> you<00:03:24.819> can<00:03:24.939> weld<00:03:25.150> straight

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
down like so and you can weld straight

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.119 
down like so and you can weld straight
to<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.079> won't<00:03:26.169> stick<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.680> copper

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
to it and it won't stick to that copper

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.300 
to it and it won't stick to that copper
plate<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.549> back<00:03:27.780> weld<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.989> grind<00:03:29.859> it

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.020 

you<00:03:32.850> know<00:03:33.110> those<00:03:34.110> pliers<00:03:34.350> work<00:03:34.620> great<00:03:35.030> these

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you know those pliers work great these

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.680 
you know those pliers work great these
small<00:03:36.270> holes

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.260 

we're<00:03:39.230> really<00:03:39.530> good<00:03:39.770> now<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.160> time<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.090> start

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
we're really good now it's time to start

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.230 
we're really good now it's time to start
welding<00:03:41.450> up<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.720> big<00:03:41.900> plane<00:03:42.730> we're<00:03:43.730> about<00:03:43.850> 80%

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
welding up the big plane we're about 80%

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.820 
welding up the big plane we're about 80%
done<00:03:44.750> right<00:03:45.020> now<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:48.350> can<00:03:48.500> see<00:03:48.530> some<00:03:48.800> of

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
done right now so you can see some of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.580 
done right now so you can see some of
the<00:03:48.980> welding<00:03:49.340> grinding<00:03:50.260> grinding<00:03:51.260> done

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the welding grinding grinding done

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.850 
the welding grinding grinding done
already<00:03:51.910> so<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:52.970> looks<00:03:53.120> good<00:03:53.300> it's<00:03:53.510> on<00:03:53.570> its<00:03:53.750> way

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
already so it looks good it's on its way

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.310 
already so it looks good it's on its way
but<00:03:54.860> I<00:03:54.890> did<00:03:55.100> take<00:03:55.220> my<00:03:55.370> time<00:03:56.050> like<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.110> said<00:03:57.290> I

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
but I did take my time like I said I

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.830 
but I did take my time like I said I
didn't<00:03:57.560> want<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.740> warp<00:03:57.950> anything<00:03:58.720> they<00:03:59.720> don't

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
didn't want to warp anything they don't

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.110 
didn't want to warp anything they don't
want<00:03:59.960> to<00:04:00.020> create<00:04:00.200> too<00:04:00.320> much<00:04:00.440> heat<00:04:00.910> if<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.000> look

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
want to create too much heat if you look

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.940 
want to create too much heat if you look
along<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.390> side<00:04:02.750> here<00:04:03.080> it<00:04:03.380> looks<00:04:03.560> fairly

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
along the side here it looks fairly

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.620 
along the side here it looks fairly
straight<00:04:04.460> at<00:04:05.090> this<00:04:05.330> warp<00:04:05.630> nothing's<00:04:06.110> bad

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
straight at this warp nothing's bad

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.400 
straight at this warp nothing's bad
everything<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.660> looking<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:09.020> way<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.140> should

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
everything is looking the way it should

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.810 
everything is looking the way it should
be

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
be

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.740 
be
so<00:04:10.820> pretty<00:04:11.000> much<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.300> could<00:04:11.420> probably<00:04:11.510> wrap

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
so pretty much we could probably wrap

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.660 
so pretty much we could probably wrap
this<00:04:11.960> thing<00:04:12.020> up<00:04:12.170> by<00:04:12.380> tomorrow<00:04:12.740> and<00:04:12.950> start<00:04:13.550> I'm

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
this thing up by tomorrow and start I'm

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:24.600 
this thing up by tomorrow and start I'm
doing<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.000> bodywork<00:04:14.270> on<00:04:14.450> it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610
