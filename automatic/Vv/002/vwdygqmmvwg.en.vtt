300 our 2013 model had it a few weeks
and<00:00:09.360> I've<00:00:09.510> stuck<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> few<00:00:10.139> mods<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.490> I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
and I've stuck a few mods on it that I

and I've stuck a few mods on it that I
want<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> show<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:13.580> I've<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.820> put<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.150> a

want to show you I've actually put on a
trans<00:00:15.540> logic<00:00:16.080> quick<00:00:16.710> shifter<00:00:17.250> had<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> look

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
trans logic quick shifter had a look

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.320 
trans logic quick shifter had a look
around<00:00:18.830> for<00:00:19.830> stuff<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> Internet<00:00:21.060> at<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
around for stuff on the Internet at a

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.200 
around for stuff on the Internet at a
good<00:00:22.220> good<00:00:23.220> survey<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.730> what's<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.150> there

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
good good survey of what's out there

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
good good survey of what's out there
this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:24.930> chosen<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.560> it's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this is what I've chosen because it's

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.580 
this is what I've chosen because it's
the<00:00:26.730> most<00:00:26.880> reliable<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.170> looks<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the most reliable I think it looks the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.849 
the most reliable I think it looks the
best<00:00:28.820> good<00:00:29.820> quality<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.990> sensor<00:00:31.710> in

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
best good quality that's the sensor in

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
best good quality that's the sensor in
there<00:00:32.070> works<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> up<00:00:33.510> shift<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> Bligh

there works on the up shift of the Bligh

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.049 
there works on the up shift of the Bligh
bike<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.070> don't<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.820> clutch

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059

a mechanic but this only took about an
hour<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:46.129> there's<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.280> ECU<00:00:47.610> under<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> back

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
hour and there's an ECU under the back

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
hour and there's an ECU under the back
seat<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.110> run<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> cables<00:00:49.890> under<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> seat

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

and down onto the top of the coils which

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.720 
and down onto the top of the coils which
is<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.140> plug<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> play<00:00:56.270> very<00:00:57.270> easy<00:00:57.530> no

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
is just plug and play very easy no

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
is just plug and play very easy no
experience<00:00:59.730> needed<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.949> and<00:01:01.949> we'll

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
experience needed for that and we'll

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
experience needed for that and we'll
show<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.030> works<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> minute<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
show you how that works in a minute the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
other thing I've done this is what I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
other thing I've done this is what I
really<00:01:05.489> wanted<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> trans<00:01:06.390> logic<00:01:06.840> Micra

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
really wanted was the trans logic Micra

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.429 
really wanted was the trans logic Micra
-<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> MD<00:01:09.240> 3<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> latest

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
- so this is the MD 3 it's the latest

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
- so this is the MD 3 it's the latest
version<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> micro<00:01:11.490> -<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:12.750> switch<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
version of the micro - just switch it on

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.249 
version of the micro - just switch it on
there<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> does<00:01:14.790> fear<00:01:15.299> it's
