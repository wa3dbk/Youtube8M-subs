00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.930 

pretty<00:00:15.450> much<00:00:15.570> flip<00:00:15.870> x1<00:00:16.260> hand<00:00:16.529> there's<00:00:16.740> uh

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
pretty much flip x1 hand there's uh

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.130 
pretty much flip x1 hand there's uh
there's<00:00:17.940> no<00:00:18.060> real<00:00:18.270> surprises<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:18.960> what

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
there's no real surprises you know what

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.689 
there's no real surprises you know what
I<00:00:19.170> mean<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.529> pretty<00:00:19.650> much<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.980> same<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.400> flip

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
I mean it's pretty much the same to flip

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.070 
I mean it's pretty much the same to flip
X<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.029> you've<00:00:21.180> got<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.420> get<00:00:21.510> your<00:00:21.630> knees<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.960> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
X up you've got to get your knees out of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.109 
X up you've got to get your knees out of
the<00:00:22.140> way<00:00:22.230> pretty<00:00:23.189> much<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.029> is

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
the way pretty much but this one is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.040 
the way pretty much but this one is
taking<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> hand<00:00:24.600> off<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.960> process<00:00:30.050> pretty

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
taking a hand off in the process pretty

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.209 
taking a hand off in the process pretty
much<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.980> little

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
much you're gonna go in this a little

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.650 
much you're gonna go in this a little
bit<00:00:32.430> more<00:00:32.579> speed<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> flip<00:00:33.300> side<00:00:33.329> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
bit more speed with the flip side a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.959 
bit more speed with the flip side a
little<00:00:33.780> bit<00:00:33.960> higher<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.130> make

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
little bit higher and then you know make

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
little bit higher and then you know make
sure<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.239> get<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> distance<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> flip

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
sure you get that distance to the flip

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.990 
sure you get that distance to the flip
between<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> landing<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:38.760> bit

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
between you and the landing a little bit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.430 
between you and the landing a little bit
higher<00:00:39.180> before<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.570> start<00:00:39.809> doing<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.320> know

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
higher before you start doing you know

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.389 
higher before you start doing you know
index<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:40.980> hander<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:47.160> then

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
index like one hander in this and then

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
index like one hander in this and then
pretty<00:00:47.820> much<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.180> come<00:00:48.450> into<00:00:48.629> after

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
pretty much you're gonna come into after

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
pretty much you're gonna come into after
you<00:00:49.050> sorted<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> clip<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.579> pretty<00:00:50.969> much

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you sorted out the clip and pretty much

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
you sorted out the clip and pretty much
got<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> speed<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.840> everything<00:00:52.170> right<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
got the speed and everything right and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.299 
got the speed and everything right and
the<00:00:52.559> landing<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:52.949> good<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.280> feel

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the landing is good and you feel

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.270 
the landing is good and you feel
comfortable<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.360> could<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.629> advised<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
comfortable you could be advised to do a

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.500 
comfortable you could be advised to do a
flip<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.430> up<00:00:56.610> first<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.329> but

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
flip back up first if you want but

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
flip back up first if you want but
pretty<00:00:57.989> much<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> different<00:00:58.739> situation

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
pretty much it's a different situation

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
pretty much it's a different situation
doing<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.640> flip<00:00:59.850> backs<00:01:00.030> one<00:01:00.180> hander<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.660> take

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
doing the flip backs one hander so take

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
doing the flip backs one hander so take
off<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> flip<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.280> want<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> push<00:01:02.670> a

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
off on the flip then you want to push a

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.280 
off on the flip then you want to push a
black<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.510> forward<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
black a little bit forward so you can

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
black a little bit forward so you can
pretty<00:01:04.559> much<00:01:04.650> pinch<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> sequence<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.519> need

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
pretty much pinch the sequence you need

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
pretty much pinch the sequence you need
just<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:07.020> security<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
just for a little bit more security you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.929 
just for a little bit more security you
know<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> main<00:01:07.920> kids<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> over<00:01:08.460> known<00:01:08.640> seat

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
know the main kids the over known seat

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.480 
know the main kids the over known seat
as<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> both<00:01:10.439> ways<00:01:10.650> but

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
as well so you can do it both ways but

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.770 
as well so you can do it both ways but
my<00:01:11.640> waves<00:01:11.850> prefer<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> push<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> bike<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
my waves prefer to push the bike a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.969 
my waves prefer to push the bike a
little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.200> forward<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.710> you're<00:01:13.860> doing

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
little bit forward and as you're doing

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
little bit forward and as you're doing
it<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.760> want<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> cross<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> bar<00:01:15.509> out

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it you just want to cross the bar out

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.210 
it you just want to cross the bar out
whichever<00:01:16.049> whichever<00:01:16.470> hand<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:17.040> doing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
whichever whichever hand you're doing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740 
whichever whichever hand you're doing
exit<00:01:17.520> one<00:01:17.640> hand<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.000> normally<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
exit one hand and normally with on the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
exit one hand and normally with on the
ground<00:01:18.930> straight<00:01:19.290> me<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.369> hand<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
ground straight me it's a right hand so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
ground straight me it's a right hand so
pretty<00:01:21.240> much<00:01:21.390> I'll<00:01:22.020> turn<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> bottom<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
pretty much I'll turn the bottom to the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
pretty much I'll turn the bottom to the
left<00:01:23.610> hand<00:01:23.759> side<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.270> we'll<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.990> how<00:01:25.110> far

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
left hand side and we'll see how far

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.350 
left hand side and we'll see how far
they<00:01:25.500> go<00:01:25.650> around<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.610> make<00:01:26.790> sure<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.240> I'm

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
they go around just make sure when I'm

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.910 
they go around just make sure when I'm
doing<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> flip<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.770> really

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
doing the flip that I'm not really

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.350 
doing the flip that I'm not really
looking<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.579> looking<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> flip<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.240> not

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
looking over looking to flip I'm not

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.550 
looking over looking to flip I'm not
worried<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.930> flip<00:01:31.170> that's<00:01:31.380> pretty

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
worried about the flip that's pretty

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.170 
worried about the flip that's pretty
much<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.860> worried<00:01:32.070> about<00:01:32.100> xi1<00:01:32.700> hander<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
much just worried about xi1 hander and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.370 
much just worried about xi1 hander and
worried<00:01:33.390> about<00:01:33.450> when<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.869> hand<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.320> to
