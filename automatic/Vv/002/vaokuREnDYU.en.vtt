buildable items in Treyarch zombies

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.910 
buildable items in Treyarch zombies

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
compared to advanced warfare now beans

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.220 
compared to advanced warfare now beans
warfare<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.760> far<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> one<00:03:10.420> round<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:11.050> they

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
warfare so far the one round that they

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.130 
warfare so far the one round that they
showed<00:03:11.560> has<00:03:12.040> nothing<00:03:12.820> nothing<00:03:13.510> special<00:03:13.870> going

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.770 
showed has nothing nothing special going
on<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.890> can<00:03:15.100> build<00:03:15.400> no<00:03:15.940> box<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.600> get

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
on that you can build no box to get

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.230 
on that you can build no box to get
special<00:03:17.260> items<00:03:17.680> nothing<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.030> so

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
special items nothing like that and so

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.060

advanced<00:03:26.260> warfare<00:03:26.770> zombies<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:28.180> don't

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
advanced warfare zombies and I don't

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.900 
advanced warfare zombies and I don't
think<00:03:28.960> they<00:03:29.410> really<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:29.920> you<00:03:30.640> know<00:03:30.760> that's

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
too much copying Treyarch zombies but I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.450 
too much copying Treyarch zombies but I
definitely<00:03:34.690> think<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.380> Treyarch<00:03:35.980> zombies

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
definitely think that Treyarch zombies

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.070 
definitely think that Treyarch zombies
that's<00:03:36.730> something<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.240> made<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.720> extremely

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
a way is just like getting jug which I

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.249 
a way is just like getting jug which I

think the upgrading everything you know
feature<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:33.039> really<00:04:33.460> awesome<00:04:33.780> Benway<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.810> think

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
feature is really awesome Benway I think

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.890 
feature is really awesome Benway I think
it<00:04:35.740> kind<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.220> sucks<00:04:36.849> at<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.300> same<00:04:37.539> time

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
it kind of sucks at the same time

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.640 
it kind of sucks at the same time
because<00:04:38.349> in<00:04:38.860> its<00:04:39.160> EXO<00:04:39.819> survival<00:04:40.150> once<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.319> get

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
survival here not so much down ds2 but

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.499 
survival here not so much down ds2 but
I'm<00:04:53.139> thinking<00:04:53.680> about<00:04:54.009> in<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.550> future<00:04:54.820> you

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
I'm thinking about in the future you

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.650 
I'm thinking about in the future you
know<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.259> do<00:04:56.500> go<00:04:56.710> past<00:04:57.070> round<00:04:57.639> 11<00:04:58.360> for

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
know if you do go past round 11 for

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.930 
know if you do go past round 11 for
zombies<00:04:59.259> you<00:04:59.889> know<00:05:00.039> does<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.669> make

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
zombies you know does that make

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.510 
zombies you know does that make
everything<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.539> little<00:05:02.039> overpowered<00:05:03.039> heaven

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
everything a little overpowered heaven

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.600 
everything a little overpowered heaven
your<00:05:03.849> max<00:05:04.210> weapon<00:05:04.630> efficiency<00:05:05.199> max<00:05:05.680> armor<00:05:06.310> so

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
your max weapon efficiency max armor so

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.270 
your max weapon efficiency max armor so
I<00:05:06.639> think<00:05:07.060> it's<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.419> real<00:05:07.690> cool<00:05:07.960> feature<00:05:08.320> but<00:05:08.979> yet

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
I think it's a real cool feature but yet

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.180 
I think it's a real cool feature but yet
if<00:05:09.520> they<00:05:09.699> continue<00:05:10.419> that<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.050> think<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:11.770> makes

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
if they continue that I think it makes

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.850 
if they continue that I think it makes
you<00:05:12.669> too<00:05:13.000> strong<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.810> know<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.320> do<00:05:14.380> like<00:05:14.830> a

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
you too strong you know and I do like a

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.399 
you too strong you know and I do like a
challenge<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.699> like<00:05:15.940> the<00:05:16.180> higher<00:05:16.449> round<00:05:16.870> you<00:05:17.169> go

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
challenge I like the higher round you go

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.460 
challenge I like the higher round you go
to<00:05:17.470> make<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.310> it'd<00:05:18.550> be<00:05:18.820> harder<00:05:19.419> and<00:05:19.599> I<00:05:20.199> think

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
to make it it'd be harder and I think

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.680 
to make it it'd be harder and I think
that's<00:05:20.680> something<00:05:20.949> if<00:05:21.490> they<00:05:21.789> are<00:05:21.970> going<00:05:22.210> to<00:05:22.270> go

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
that's something if they are going to go

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.260 
that's something if they are going to go
with<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.080> bent<00:05:23.319> zombies<00:05:23.949> as<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> game<00:05:24.669> mode<00:05:24.940> as

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
with the bent zombies as a game mode as

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.170 
with the bent zombies as a game mode as
you<00:05:25.780> know<00:05:25.930> future<00:05:26.259> DLC<00:05:27.009> they<00:05:27.280> need<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.699> really

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
you know future DLC they need to really

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.719 
you know future DLC they need to really
put<00:05:28.599> that<00:05:28.810> in<00:05:28.960> mind<00:05:29.289> and<00:05:29.680> also<00:05:29.949> make<00:05:30.699> the

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
put that in mind and also make the

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.909 
put that in mind and also make the
levels<00:05:31.419> harder<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.289> know<00:05:32.440> just<00:05:32.710> like<00:05:32.860> in

you get to the tougher the zombies are

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.439 
you get to the tougher the zombies are
the<00:05:38.320> longer<00:05:38.800> their<00:05:39.099> health<00:05:39.370> is<00:05:39.699> you<00:05:40.180> need<00:05:40.419> to

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
the longer their health is you need to

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.899 
the longer their health is you need to

zombies<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.509> much<00:06:01.780> more<00:06:02.050> enjoyable<00:06:02.469> but<00:06:03.219> I

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
zombies that much more enjoyable but I

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.830
