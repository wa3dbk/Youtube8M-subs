00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and yeah so a little bit about coloring

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
and yeah so a little bit about coloring
rainbow<00:00:59.820> liner<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.129> sometimes<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.520> I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
rainbow liner is that sometimes when I

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.270 
rainbow liner is that sometimes when I
do<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:05.930> have<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.200> inner<00:01:07.470> struggle<00:01:08.070> where

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
do it I I have this inner struggle where

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.280 
do it I I have this inner struggle where
I<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.360> want<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.630> leave<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> cult

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I don't know if I want to leave the cult

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
I don't know if I want to leave the cult
of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.799> picture<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.580> liner<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.630> it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
of the picture as a liner because it's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.230 
of the picture as a liner because it's
pretty<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.530> its<00:01:13.710> own<00:01:13.950> or<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.700> want<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> color

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
pretty on its own or if I want to color

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.649 
pretty on its own or if I want to color
it<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.810> sometimes<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.950> color<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
it because sometimes when you color it

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
it because sometimes when you color it
parts<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> picture<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:20.009> kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.580> lose

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
parts of the picture you kind of lose

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
parts of the picture you kind of lose
that<00:01:21.509> rainbow<00:01:21.869> line<00:01:22.380> art<00:01:22.650> effect<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
that rainbow line art effect because the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.380 
that rainbow line art effect because the
colors<00:01:23.909> around<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.430> it's<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.360> little

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
colors around it so it's it's a little

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
colors around it so it's it's a little
bit<00:01:27.710> disheartening<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:29.909> get

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
bit disheartening but you can also get

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
bit disheartening but you can also get
really<00:01:30.420> cool<00:01:30.720> effects<00:01:31.140> by<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.619> using<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
really cool effects by just using the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
really cool effects by just using the
rainbow<00:01:32.549> line<00:01:32.759> art<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.119> coloring<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
rainbow line art with coloring so that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
rainbow line art with coloring so that
would<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.009> different<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.000> its<00:01:36.180> own<00:01:36.450> from

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
would make it different on its own from

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.999 
would make it different on its own from
like<00:01:37.259> let's<00:01:37.590> say<00:01:37.770> I'm<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> black<00:01:38.579> line<00:01:38.970> art

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
like let's say I'm just a black line art

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.380 
like let's say I'm just a black line art
but<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.490> need<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> kind<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> weigh

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
but you really need to kind of weigh

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.690 
but you really need to kind of weigh
whether<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.170> want<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> picture<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.579> be

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
whether you want the picture just to be

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.020 
whether you want the picture just to be
line<00:01:44.880> art<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.450> if<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> be<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.579> line

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
line art or if you want it to be a line

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.109 
line art or if you want it to be a line
art<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> coloring<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.159> then<00:01:50.310> lose<00:01:50.670> some

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
art with the coloring and then lose some

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.020 
art with the coloring and then lose some
of<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.329> pretty<00:01:52.020> liner<00:01:52.439> along<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> way<00:01:53.399> but

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
of that pretty liner along the way but

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.240 
of that pretty liner along the way but

in<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.959> picture<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.740> unless<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.820> get<00:02:45.910> some

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120

but then with the lights and the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.890 
but then with the lights and the
background<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.940> was<00:02:52.090> kind<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.390> like<00:02:52.510> well<00:02:52.750> there

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
background I was kind of like well there

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.960

wouldn't really be any dirt Dirk's over

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.750 
wouldn't really be any dirt Dirk's over
here<00:02:55.270> for<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.720> sign<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:57.400> was<00:02:57.550> just

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
here for the sign and it was just

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.410 
here for the sign and it was just
complicated<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.380> we<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:00.370> got<00:03:00.580> something<00:03:01.000> I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
complicated so we just got something I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.630 
complicated so we just got something I
don't<00:03:01.630> even<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.990> what<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> is<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.280> hope

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
don't even know what it is and I hope

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.860
