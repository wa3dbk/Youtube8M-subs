00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.700
 sascha for mobile giggs we are on the 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.560
 droidcon 2013 in berlin and i have 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.150
 here that a controller I therefore do 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.730
 not so mobile anymore but you can 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.609
 See this clearly 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.560
 is new controller that is the 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.179
 controller for the developers out 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.460
 That's why it was sent 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.109
 completely transparent which scary to me 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.869
 I like it here on the coast 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.239
 how balanced one is yes the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.000
 batteries which is characterized weight has 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.250
 forward so that he did here in palms 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 and you can remember everything very well 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.930
 me a bit the sidewinder 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.400
 gamepads of the 90s so we have here 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.680
 two analog sticks then here is the d 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.690
 pad and then you still have it 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.750
 because the four or buttons and in the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.930
 center button again had the old menu 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.880
 man back we have these 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.430
 time buttons each r1 and r2 and l1 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.780
 and l2 and that was basically taken 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.920
 But we do not just have that 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.979
 controller here 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.689
 we also have the complete yes 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.039
 here at the start because you see the thing to 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.259
 First time could be above all things now 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.490
 let's see how small that is 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.729
 this one has no dice 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.499
 So let's just do it all around 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.240
 see here is only times of incoming and 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.960
 switch off then we have the brand new one 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.289
 boards connection power supply 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.229
 micro-usb connector is usb connector 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.130
 the 2 0 is even 3 0 connection and here 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.319
 a hdmi exit and there was the board 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.869
 that is a tegra 3, that is 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.229
 a quadcore has a knowledge even 5 kg 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.819
 Apple already installed gigabyte ram and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.530
 I believe eight gigabytes of internal 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.030
 memory and now we'll throw the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 all you crate here with our 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.119
 sensational time but we have none 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.369
 So we have two 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.420
 tables are pushed together and have theirs 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.950
 projects are running 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 throw to the pit 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.689
 so 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.390
 boston also directly from and would have to stay 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.130
 the little figure will come then we know 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:13.940
 all that he thinks we are already 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.190
 is the boot logo and then it comes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.080
 quickly the name and then 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.850
 we are there In so doing, and we can 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.569
 a little look at the box itself 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.770
 or 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.880
 I can get a little something for the menu 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.650
 of course, no sound is showing here now 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.620
 and there we are there sees everything 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.530
 this simple and timeless play 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.519
 discover made play what is that exactly 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.530
 there was accordingly all the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.739
 pre-installed or the player on it 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.739
 or apps on it then locally on the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.420
 have a clock then we have the cover 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.620
 this affects me now to the app store 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.880
 over it shoots problem is we have it 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.459
 right now not on the internet in 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.989
 bayer let that is then for developers 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.550
 you can look at latest picture 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.760
 what have injured on your then 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.920
 bought a console and could not do so 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.019
 see what software is currently starting up 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.420
 is and the latest news for developers 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.530
 and last but not least managed that 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.989
 taken behind the ground 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.489
 Setting second controller 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.530
 can build a wifi connection 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.110
 you can have your account in there and then 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.060
 The system will then be there accordingly 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.519
 could see it or mac addresses and stuff 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.950
 continue and see what kind of 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.370
 variant that is picture numbers and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.989
 software version so relatively simple 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.079
 kept the whole story itself 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.989
 explain that I like very well the 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.070
 It is not overloaded that it will work 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.600
 also again quickly 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.870
 small spielchen then anschmeiÃŸen 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.329
 take that ice race a fun 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.190
 hockey game you ask determines can 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.260
 not quite normal on google places 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.510
 proceed and then install 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.670
 they must have been for spring 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.129
 be certified so I have me first 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.790
 produced 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.790
 Italy is listed 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 sorry and look what player can 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.910
 Nothing tells you so fast 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.780
 that's what makes it terrible 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:18.190
 Do not enjoy the thing as you can 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.620
 not quite the google places 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.590
 play your friend but you have to 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.740
 already be certified for the user resp 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.390
 be adapted in the moment that is about 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.410
 120 titles but we know it will be 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.780
 every day more 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.030
 Now the question is what can it do 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.770
 what am I going to do with it if 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:41.350
 her an extremely inexpensive mobile 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 gaming is not an extreme 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.000
 cost-effective console then want to 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.920
 you should definitely time the clock 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.410
 look here this starts at 99 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.610
 dollar that the entry price thereby 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.650
 comes then also correspondingly expensive 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.570
 bluetooth controller and has 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.510
 actually all about the latest 3d 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.190
 Collect the games for Android 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.670
 There is a whole lot we will 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.320
 imported via the system or if you 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.530
 want to watch any videos that 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.110
 will also come in the future 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.740
 For $ 99 you can do relatively little 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.120
 make wrong 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.680
 I'm assuming that in Germany 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.600
 with his new and so cost a time 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.440
 how fairy tale can be controlled and how 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.090
 it's all so hot performance technically 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.770
 with the topic 3 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.180
 that is completely enough for even 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.370
 This year he even says he has to 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.340
 absolutely a cortex from 52 integra 4 1 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.350
 So it will be determined but then 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.760
 come in the future 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.040
 I only ordered a console but 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.750
 one of this limited edition for 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.520
 it still takes some 300 hours to force it 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.500
 a bit with timer is sent 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.380
 but so far at least that 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.370
 get a first glimpse of the 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.430
 oja console 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.580
 I am very happy with kiki on android 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.090
 2013 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.890
 that's the jadoc tv then comes all 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.890
 Thank you for seeing more information
