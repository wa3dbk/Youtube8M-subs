00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and looking at some crazy new display

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.160 
and looking at some crazy new display
technologies<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:18.000> future<00:00:18.420> smartphones<00:00:18.570> or

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
technologies for future smartphones or

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.990 
technologies for future smartphones or
something<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.859> would<00:00:20.010> use<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.490> maybe

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
something that you would use in maybe

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.689 
something that you would use in maybe
next<00:00:21.210> year<00:00:21.390> over<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.010> knees<00:00:23.220> 3m

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
next year over here we have the knees 3m

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.750 
next year over here we have the knees 3m
ears<00:00:23.970> are<00:00:24.180> display<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.800> see<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
ears are display and as you can see this

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
ears are display and as you can see this
is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> conventional<00:00:27.930> display<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.800> that's<00:00:28.949> like

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is a conventional display so that's like

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.810 
is a conventional display so that's like
a<00:00:29.250> 4.3<00:00:30.090> inch<00:00:30.300> smartphone<00:00:30.779> over<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.820> if

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
a 4.3 inch smartphone over here and if

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020 
a 4.3 inch smartphone over here and if
we<00:00:33.000> compare<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.200> brightness<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.030> both

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
we compare the brightness of both

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.180 
we compare the brightness of both
displays<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> see<00:00:37.710> they're<00:00:37.860> running<00:00:38.100> at

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
displays you can see they're running at

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
displays you can see they're running at
the<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.460> brightness<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.570> they're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the same brightness but they're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
the same brightness but they're
consuming<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:41.040> know<00:00:41.190> different<00:00:41.640> amount<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
consuming you know different amount of

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
consuming you know different amount of
power<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.950> consuming<00:00:44.640> thirty

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
power so this one is consuming thirty

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
power so this one is consuming thirty
percent<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.539> power<00:00:45.870> than<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.039> with<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
percent more power than the one with the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
percent more power than the one with the
three<00:00:47.670> eminence<00:00:48.090> our<00:00:48.270> display<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
three eminence our display and if I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
three eminence our display and if I
would<00:00:49.860> change<00:00:50.100> as<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.520> first<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.210> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
would change as well first of all and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.700 
would change as well first of all and
we're<00:00:51.480> looking<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> user<00:00:52.199> Schmo<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we're looking at the user Schmo and the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.110 
we're looking at the user Schmo and the
battery<00:00:52.949> life<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> huge<00:00:53.879> difference

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
battery life that's a huge difference

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600 
battery life that's a huge difference
while<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> display<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.399> running

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
while just on display on that's running

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
while just on display on that's running
at<00:00:56.789> six<00:00:56.940> hours<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.620> 3m

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
at six hours and the one with the 3m

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
at six hours and the one with the 3m
display<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.640> running<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.000> 9.1<00:01:00.719> hours<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.680> let's

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
display is running on 9.1 hours so let's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.130 
display is running on 9.1 hours so let's
change<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.879> brightness<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> hundred

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
change the brightness to a hundred

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
change the brightness to a hundred
percent<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> huge

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
percent and you can see the huge

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.179 
percent and you can see the huge
difference<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> terms<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.320> brightness<00:01:07.860> well

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
difference in terms of brightness well

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.679 
difference in terms of brightness well
hopefully<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.850> see<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> video

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hopefully you can see this on the video

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
hopefully you can see this on the video
but<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> definitely<00:01:10.500> tell<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
but it can definitely tell you that's a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
but it can definitely tell you that's a
that's<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.210> difference<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.780> some<00:01:13.110> thirty

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
that's a difference of some thirty

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
that's a difference of some thirty
percent<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.490> let's<00:01:14.670> walk<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
percent but let's walk over here and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.590 
percent but let's walk over here and
then<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.310> conventional<00:01:18.150> display

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then we also have a conventional display

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.070 
then we also have a conventional display
and<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.710> 3m<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and the 3m one and you can see that this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.859 
and the 3m one and you can see that this
gives<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.000> 30-percent<00:01:24.000> brightness<00:01:24.509> booze

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
gives you a 30-percent brightness booze

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
gives you a 30-percent brightness booze
so<00:01:25.860> whether<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.790> save<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.030> battery

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
so whether you want to save some battery

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.630 
so whether you want to save some battery
life<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.049> whether<00:01:28.530> manufacturers<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
life or whether manufacturers are just

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
life or whether manufacturers are just
getting<00:01:29.820> smaller<00:01:30.180> batteries<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.960> their

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
getting smaller batteries in their

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
getting smaller batteries in their
smartphones<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.670> means<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.150> will<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
smartphones that means you will have

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.830 
smartphones that means you will have
lighter<00:01:33.689> smartphones<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.479> maybe<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.780> little

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
lighter smartphones and maybe a little

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.749 
lighter smartphones and maybe a little
bit<00:01:37.229> cheaper<00:01:37.590> walls<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.579> use

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bit cheaper walls because you can use

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.940 
bit cheaper walls because you can use
