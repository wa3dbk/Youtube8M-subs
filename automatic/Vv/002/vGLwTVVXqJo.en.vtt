know very narrow quick bike and you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.830 
know very narrow quick bike and you
first<00:03:22.040> look<00:03:22.280> at<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.490> you<00:03:22.790> might<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.510> might<00:03:23.540> not

recognize it as a soft tail you've got
an<00:03:25.700> interesting<00:03:25.940> design<00:03:26.270> back<00:03:26.630> there<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.960> I

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
an interesting design back there and I

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.480 
an interesting design back there and I
understand<00:03:27.380> this<00:03:27.470> is<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.650> first<00:03:27.860> prototype<00:03:28.160> of

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
understand this is a first prototype of

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.570 
understand this is a first prototype of
this<00:03:28.580> frame<00:03:29.740> how<00:03:30.740> long<00:03:30.920> did<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.100> take<00:03:31.190> for<00:03:31.310> you

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
this frame how long did it take for you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.090 
this frame how long did it take for you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.880 
to pull this idea together and get it
into<00:03:34.220> production<00:03:34.750> as<00:03:35.750> far<00:03:35.960> as<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.170> frame<00:03:36.470> I've

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
into production as far as the frame I've

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.440 
into production as far as the frame I've
always<00:03:37.100> been<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.400> rigid<00:03:37.820> guy<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.240> I'm<00:03:38.330> always

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
always been a rigid guy so I'm always

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.910 
always been a rigid guy so I'm always
trying<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.870> find<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.320> Softail<00:03:39.860> frame

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
trying to find it like a Softail frame

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.630 
trying to find it like a Softail frame
that<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> would<00:03:41.240> really<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.900> do<00:03:42.080> and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
that that I would really like to do and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.160 
that that I would really like to do and
we<00:03:43.640> kind<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.850> drew<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.180> up<00:03:44.330> on<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.540> napkin<00:03:44.840> and

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
we kind of drew this up on a napkin and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.800 
we kind of drew this up on a napkin and
you<00:03:45.560> know<00:03:45.680> after<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:47.150> modification

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
you know after a little modification

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.120 
you know after a little modification
here<00:03:47.960> and<00:03:48.140> there<00:03:48.260> we<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.560> beat<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:48.920> what

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
here and there we can beat this is what

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
here and there we can beat this is what
we<00:03:49.250> came<00:03:49.280> up<00:03:49.460> with<00:03:50.560> that's<00:03:51.560> me<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.970> thing

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
we came up with that's me the thing

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.700 
we came up with that's me the thing
about<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.420> lot<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.720> soft<00:03:53.990> tails<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.470> they<00:03:54.560> try

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
about a lot of soft tails is they try

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.170 
about a lot of soft tails is they try
and<00:03:54.890> hide<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.130> fact<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.400> his<00:03:55.550> soft<00:03:55.850> hell<00:03:56.030> I

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and hide the fact that his soft hell I

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.790 
and hide the fact that his soft hell I
didn't<00:03:56.390> really<00:03:56.510> want<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.960> I<00:03:57.020> wanted<00:03:57.320> it<00:03:57.440> you

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
didn't really want that I wanted it you

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800 
didn't really want that I wanted it you
know<00:03:57.890> to<00:03:58.430> look<00:03:58.550> like<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:58.880> was<00:03:58.940> a<00:03:59.000> swing<00:03:59.300> arm<00:03:59.540> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
know to look like it was a swing arm and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.350 
know to look like it was a swing arm and
a<00:03:59.900> separate<00:04:00.740> frame<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.370> at<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.090> same<00:04:02.300> time

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
a separate frame and at the same time

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.230 
a separate frame and at the same time
it's<00:04:02.960> it's<00:04:03.260> hard<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.740> keep<00:04:04.430> things<00:04:04.700> very<00:04:04.790> tight

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
it's it's hard to keep things very tight

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.510 
it's it's hard to keep things very tight
when<00:04:05.420> you're<00:04:05.540> not<00:04:05.660> running<00:04:05.870> us<00:04:06.080> but<00:04:06.920> again<00:04:07.310> if

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
when you're not running us but again if

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.150 
when you're not running us but again if
you<00:04:07.640> if<00:04:07.880> you<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.930> things<00:04:09.170> out<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:09.920> try

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
you if you think things out and you try

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.290 
you if you think things out and you try
and<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.370> know<00:04:10.460> make<00:04:10.760> sure<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.120> all<00:04:11.270> your

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
and you know make sure you have all your

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.450 
and you know make sure you have all your
clearances<00:04:11.870> right<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.920> works<00:04:13.100> out<00:04:13.280> pretty

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
clearances right it works out pretty

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.540 
clearances right it works out pretty
well

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
well

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.190 
well
now<00:04:15.550> since<00:04:15.880> this<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.180> custom<00:04:16.630> bike<00:04:16.660> most

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
now since this is a custom bike most

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.110 
now since this is a custom bike most
people<00:04:17.650> want<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:17.980> have<00:04:18.130> some<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.610> some<00:04:19.090> of

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
people want to have some of some of

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.260 
people want to have some of some of

their own taste some of their own ideas
in<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.740> bike<00:04:23.920> itself<00:04:24.100> how<00:04:24.820> did<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:25.540> owner<00:04:25.750> of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
in the bike itself how did the owner of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.640 
in the bike itself how did the owner of
this<00:04:26.050> bike<00:04:27.330> put<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.360> little<00:04:28.540> herself<00:04:29.290> into<00:04:29.530> it

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
this bike put a little herself into it

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.290 
this bike put a little herself into it
into<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.160> oh<00:04:30.930> well<00:04:31.930> she<00:04:32.380> basically<00:04:33.300> didn't

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
into it oh well she basically didn't

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.760 
into it oh well she basically didn't
really<00:04:34.450> give<00:04:34.570> me<00:04:34.690> too<00:04:34.840> much<00:04:34.990> direction<00:04:35.410> if<00:04:35.620> she

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
really give me too much direction if she
