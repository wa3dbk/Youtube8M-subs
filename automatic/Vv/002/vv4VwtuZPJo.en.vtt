00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
clean shots here and they're all right

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
clean shots here and they're all right
um<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.659> was<00:01:09.810> similar<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
um so you know it was it was similar I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
um so you know it was it was similar I
supposed<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.340> real<00:01:12.409> Alvarado<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.650> terms<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
supposed to a real Alvarado in terms of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
supposed to a real Alvarado in terms of
the<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> looked<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.630> think<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the way it looked but I just think the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
the way it looked but I just think the
quality<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.380> punches<00:01:17.009> was<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.369> much<00:01:17.580> better

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
quality of punches was so much better

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.060 
quality of punches was so much better
and<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.659> defenses<00:01:19.259> were<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.619> better<00:01:19.890> as

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and the defenses were a little better as

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.270 
and the defenses were a little better as
well<00:01:20.310> deal<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.990> by<00:01:22.229> far<00:01:22.259> too<00:01:22.770> quick<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> fire

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
well deal was by far too quick a fire

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.270 
well deal was by far too quick a fire
with<00:01:23.909> his<00:01:24.030> hands<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.390> his<00:01:24.479> feet<00:01:24.720> on

with his hands and his feet on
blistering<00:01:26.280> hand<00:01:26.490> speed<00:01:27.799> very<00:01:28.799> good<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> an

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
blistering hand speed very good in an

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.640 
blistering hand speed very good in an
hour<00:01:29.579> movement<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> way<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> bark<00:01:32.729> are

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
negated that speed disadvantage is just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.429 
negated that speed disadvantage is just

goal was just to win a world title so I

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:34.920 
goal was just to win a world title so I
don't<00:06:33.880> know<00:06:34.060> it<00:06:34.150> depends<00:06:34.390> how<00:06:34.480> much<00:06:34.660> money

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
don't know it depends how much money

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.390

he's<00:06:35.080> made<00:06:35.260> out<00:06:35.380> of<00:06:35.590> sport<00:06:35.830> depends<00:06:36.160> if<00:06:36.310> he's

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
he's made out of sport depends if he's

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.340 
he's made out of sport depends if he's
got<00:06:36.520> anything<00:06:36.760> else<00:06:37.060> outside<00:06:37.419> a<00:06:37.720> box<00:06:38.050> and<00:06:38.290> I

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.270 
think it's perfectly noble to do so
he<00:06:40.780> doesn't<00:06:41.080> have<00:06:41.200> to<00:06:41.410> go<00:06:41.530> in<00:06:41.710> there<00:06:41.890> and<00:06:42.040> you
