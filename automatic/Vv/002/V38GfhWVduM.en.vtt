00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 good kids we are here one more day 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.460
 well to do the little good he will say 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.550
 in the title of the video a small review 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.240
 about something that I liked a lot 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.180
 about an application that is how you see it 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 what they write about galaxy s 4 with its 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.850
 be able to add widgets and with the whole roll 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 this since by default in the galaxy s3 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 mini does not come the application is the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.180
 next, let's go to Christ to my 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.180
 applications is worth my applications 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.379
 and here the package 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.379
 it's called you'll see it 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.470
 I do not know if it works for all of the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:54.090
 galaxy device lock screen 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.160
 so good is very good, let's see 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.830
 the parameters they have to edit 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:04.050
 things are worth then to see how you see 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.050
 has advertising we give to the X and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.090
 good has effect of screen or effect 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.940
 light or butterfly effect is to say the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.770
 water the light theme we can choose 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.780
 blue rings rd red or light and lightning 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 After we can customize the text m 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.149
 of free compassion we can put another 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.990
 thing is worth the source of light the source of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.520
 text the size of if we want to choose it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.300
 in the right to the left in the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 center the help text and the type of 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.869
 letter that has the help text 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.120
 we can also put shortcuts 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.770
 but this means that 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.770
 what will he really be 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.900
 the time of the widgets and the whole roll 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.140
 then the sound of when the blocks 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.010
 that sound in all the roll that without 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.440
 created to the piston 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.410
 after notification then when we 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.360
 someone calls because the call appears 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.470
 lost of fill the east the hour of 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.990
 state is not that they work 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 good if we can hide the bar 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.370
 been to make it bigger and we can 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.819
 be better 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.610
 in the other option I do not know which one is 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.770
 option 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.520
 let's give it here and good 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.720
 will register more we can security 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.910
 clock if we can put a pin or a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.850
 pattern disable lock screen 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.950
 By default, lock with the key 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.950
 home that is putting 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.700
 if with the start key it is valid for 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.230
 to place it colate the blessing for 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.530
 me the truth that I do not like and this already 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.140
 it's advertising then it's good what 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.060
 I like this application is what 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.099
 next you are here on the screen 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.140
 lock then to go to the camera 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.799
 you do like this and you go directly to the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.510
 camera is worth this way because I'm already 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.510
 in the normal then we give it back 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.830
 let's block it again then I 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.050
 like that and also at the time to see 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.700
 on the lock screen because by 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.500
 defect is only this can be done in 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.710
 4.2 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.620
 and instead I have 4.1.2 and we can put 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.270
 any kind of widget as is the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.170
 twitter as is the whatsapp as is the 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:43.100
 youtube how is the sub jets as is the 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.600
 Hesperia clock and many types though 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.080
 some have to be in four by 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.750
 two or something like that because if it does not give error or 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.420
 we here for example let's put 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 active relationships good yes the truth is 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.590
 what 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.810
 and to eliminate it I do not know how to do it 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.360
 thus being a displacement for 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.160
 down after we can add any 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.710
 kind of widget and I'll tell you the 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.860
 calendar we are going to put the contacts 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.860
 do not 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.690
 for example, what is going to be done with 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.670
 the calendar to see how this looks 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 it's a bit personalized now 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.350
 good as you see the calendar is 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.430
 customize it you like this 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.580
 because as you can tell in 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.500
 stock can not play music 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.970
 that is to say good you can reproduce the 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.000
 music what happens is that the screen of 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.740
 lock does not appear to pause like or the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.770
 roll then thanks to this we can 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.930
 put here on widget and have it for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:51.320
 to spend the night 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.660
 well then I'm not going to teach that 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.560
 I have 4.1 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.020
 the stock version is worth 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.080
 about 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.430
 of a device and as you can see I have 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.430
 4.1.2 and with widgets on screen what 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.090
 these are improvements and what to me 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.419
 like more and nothing more 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.630
 and well this video up to here is worth 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.449
 you want more videos so like it's worth 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.389
 that is for a little the rom and development 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.370
 of those of the three mini then good 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:26.270
 let's see what happens if they update it in 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.040
 June 4.4 or what do they do or do they stop 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.490
 side or I am what they will do with 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.490
 this device 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.629
 as you can see it has a soniquete this and 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.120
