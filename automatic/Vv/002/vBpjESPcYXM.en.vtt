basically I have these devices arranged
by<00:00:18.070> keyboard<00:00:18.310> type<00:00:18.730> so<00:00:18.940> we<00:00:19.060> start<00:00:19.360> with<00:00:19.539> the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
by keyboard type so we start with the

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.540 
by keyboard type so we start with the
devices<00:00:20.140> with<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.440> slide<00:00:20.920> out<00:00:20.950> keyboards

like the touch pro and the Titan 2 and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.930 
like the touch pro and the Titan 2 and
then<00:00:23.710> going<00:00:23.890> down<00:00:24.100> the<00:00:24.220> line<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:24.580> have<00:00:24.760> the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
then going down the line we have the

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.730 
then going down the line we have the
devices<00:00:25.270> with<00:00:25.600> on-screen<00:00:26.020> keyboards<00:00:26.620> and

bit smaller and to have this kind of

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.430 
bit smaller and to have this kind of
horizontal<00:04:24.450> layout<00:04:25.450> instead<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:25.990> the<00:04:26.140> curved

we<00:04:44.580> have<00:04:44.699> the<00:04:44.729> blackjack<00:04:45.059> two<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.689> this<00:04:45.749> is<00:04:45.900> an

we have the blackjack two and this is an

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.959 
we have the blackjack two and this is an
important<00:04:46.469> test<00:04:47.069> because<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.729> same

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
important test because this same

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.429 
important test because this same
keyboard<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.509> going<00:04:48.659> to<00:04:48.719> be<00:04:48.809> used<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.319> the

keyboard is going to be used on the

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.709 
keyboard is going to be used on the
upcoming<00:04:49.770> samsung<00:04:50.430> epix<00:04:50.849> which<00:04:51.360> some<00:04:51.599> people

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:51.719 
upcoming samsung epix which some people

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:52.850 
upcoming samsung epix which some people
thought<00:04:51.960> was<00:04:52.110> going<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.259> be<00:04:52.319> the<00:04:52.409> blackjack

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
thought was going to be the blackjack

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.469 
thought was going to be the blackjack
three<00:04:53.159> but<00:04:53.339> it's<00:04:53.520> really<00:04:53.939> not<00:04:54.150> going<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.389> be

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
three but it's really not going to be

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.779 
three but it's really not going to be
called<00:04:54.719> that<00:04:54.809> so<00:04:55.379> let's<00:04:55.710> see<00:04:55.889> how<00:04:56.159> this

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
called that so let's see how this

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:11.740 
called that so let's see how this
keyboard<00:04:57.330> does<00:05:00.319> set<00:05:01.319> go

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.660 

that<00:05:12.350> was<00:05:14.170> that<00:05:15.170> was<00:05:15.260> 11<00:05:15.620> seconds<00:05:16.040> what<00:05:16.430> I<00:05:16.460> like

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
that was that was 11 seconds what I like

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.070 
that was that was 11 seconds what I like
about<00:05:16.700> this<00:05:17.060> keyboard<00:05:17.420> is<00:05:17.540> that<00:05:17.690> it's<00:05:17.810> spaced

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
about this keyboard is that it's spaced

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.570 
about this keyboard is that it's spaced
out<00:05:18.230> quite<00:05:18.530> nicely<00:05:18.560> but<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.100> problem<00:05:19.430> with<00:05:19.520> it

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
out quite nicely but the problem with it

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.190 
out quite nicely but the problem with it
is<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.000> keys<00:05:20.210> are<00:05:20.240> kind<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.840> hard<00:05:21.110> to

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
is that the keys are kind of hard to

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.740 
is that the keys are kind of hard to
press<00:05:21.470> compared<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.250> like<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.640> q9h<00:05:23.030> where

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
press compared to like the q9h where

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.670 
press compared to like the q9h where
they<00:05:24.290> have<00:05:24.920> just<00:05:25.280> enough<00:05:25.700> feedback<00:05:26.530> so<00:05:27.530> in

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
they have just enough feedback so in

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.530 
they have just enough feedback so in
conclusion<00:05:27.710> of<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.460> devices<00:05:28.730> that<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.090> tested

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
conclusion of the devices that we tested

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.380 
conclusion of the devices that we tested
the<00:05:29.630> motorola<00:05:30.380> q9<00:05:30.710> each<00:05:30.890> came<00:05:31.250> on<00:05:31.520> top<00:05:31.910> here<00:05:32.240> I

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
the motorola q9 each came on top here I

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.300 
the motorola q9 each came on top here I
just<00:05:32.930> wish<00:05:33.050> Motorola<00:05:33.560> would<00:05:33.740> continue<00:05:34.130> using

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
just wish Motorola would continue using

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.060 
just wish Motorola would continue using
this<00:05:34.550> keyboard<00:05:35.000> but<00:05:35.210> with<00:05:35.540> a<00:05:35.570> touchscreen

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
this keyboard but with a touchscreen

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.660 
this keyboard but with a touchscreen
configuration<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.160> think<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.370> lot<00:05:37.400> of<00:05:37.550> people

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
configuration I think a lot of people

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.020 
configuration I think a lot of people
would<00:05:37.970> agree<00:05:38.060> with<00:05:38.360> me<00:05:38.510> on<00:05:38.540> that<00:05:38.740> in<00:05:40.030> second

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
would agree with me on that in second

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.760 
would agree with me on that in second
place<00:05:41.180> we<00:05:41.390> have<00:05:41.420> both<00:05:41.780> of<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.050> trio's<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:42.650> I'm

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
place we have both of the trio's and I'm

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.110 
place we have both of the trio's and I'm
actually<00:05:42.950> a<00:05:43.160> little<00:05:43.220> bit<00:05:43.430> surprised<00:05:43.850> that<00:05:44.030> the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
actually a little bit surprised that the

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.760 
actually a little bit surprised that the
treo<00:05:44.390> pro<00:05:44.480> is<00:05:44.870> able<00:05:45.140> to<00:05:45.200> keep<00:05:45.320> up<00:05:45.470> with<00:05:45.650> the

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
treo pro is able to keep up with the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.540 
treo pro is able to keep up with the
bigger<00:05:45.980> keyboard<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.940> treo<00:05:47.770> 700w<00:05:48.770> but<00:05:49.520> I

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
bigger keyboard of the treo 700w but I

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.159 
bigger keyboard of the treo 700w but I
think<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.150> really<00:05:50.270> helps<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.690> treo<00:05:50.900> pro<00:05:50.960> is

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
think what really helps the treo pro is

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.990 
think what really helps the treo pro is
the<00:05:51.290> fact<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.560> the<00:05:51.710> keys<00:05:51.919> are<00:05:51.950> so<00:05:52.520> close

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
the fact that the keys are so close

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.460 
the fact that the keys are so close
together<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.510> you<00:05:53.750> hardly<00:05:54.050> have<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.290> move

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
together that you hardly have to move

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.200 
together that you hardly have to move
your<00:05:54.650> fingers<00:05:55.010> when<00:05:55.520> you're<00:05:55.640> your<00:05:56.000> thumbs

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
your fingers when you're your thumbs

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.750 
your fingers when you're your thumbs
when<00:05:56.390> you're<00:05:56.510> trying<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.840> type<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.110> message<00:05:57.230> and

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
when you're trying to type a message and

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
when you're trying to type a message and
of<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:58.880> devices<00:05:59.120> with<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.390> on-screen

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
of the devices with the on-screen

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.110 
of the devices with the on-screen

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
the verizon XV 6900 came in last place

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.880 
the verizon XV 6900 came in last place
I've<00:06:05.600> always<00:06:05.870> found<00:06:06.110> it<00:06:06.290> very<00:06:06.380> difficult<00:06:06.500> to

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
I've always found it very difficult to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.010 
I've always found it very difficult to
type<00:06:07.070> on<00:06:07.250> this<00:06:07.400> device<00:06:07.669> perhaps<00:06:08.450> it's<00:06:08.810> just

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
type on this device perhaps it's just

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.480 
type on this device perhaps it's just
how<00:06:09.230> small<00:06:09.290> the<00:06:09.770> devices<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.430> the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
how small the devices and the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.040 
how small the devices and the
responsiveness<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.360> touchscreen<00:06:11.840> and

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
responsiveness of the touchscreen and

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.630 
responsiveness of the touchscreen and
finally<00:06:12.590> if<00:06:12.620> we<00:06:12.770> look<00:06:12.919> at<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.070> devices<00:06:13.520> that

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
finally if we look at the devices that

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.180 
finally if we look at the devices that
have<00:06:13.790> the<00:06:13.970> slide<00:06:14.240> out<00:06:14.500> keyboards<00:06:15.500> touch<00:06:15.919> pro

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
have the slide out keyboards touch pro

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.159 
have the slide out keyboards touch pro
and<00:06:16.400> the<00:06:16.490> 18t<00:06:17.000> tilt<00:06:17.270> we<00:06:17.570> find<00:06:17.780> that<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.990> touch

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
and the 18t tilt we find that the touch

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.960 
and the 18t tilt we find that the touch
pro<00:06:18.350> is<00:06:18.500> a<00:06:18.560> slightly<00:06:18.919> better<00:06:19.370> keyboard<00:06:19.700> in

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
pro is a slightly better keyboard in

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.880 
pro is a slightly better keyboard in
terms<00:06:20.180> of<00:06:20.330> being<00:06:20.960> able<00:06:21.050> to<00:06:21.200> type<00:06:21.440> fast<00:06:21.710> and<00:06:21.860> I

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
terms of being able to type fast and I

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.350 
terms of being able to type fast and I
think<00:06:22.100> that's<00:06:22.250> because<00:06:22.340> although<00:06:22.940> the

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
think that's because although the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.850 
think that's because although the
letters<00:06:23.570> are<00:06:23.690> smaller<00:06:24.050> the<00:06:24.290> keys<00:06:24.470> are<00:06:24.620> smaller

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
letters are smaller the keys are smaller

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.530 
letters are smaller the keys are smaller
they're<00:06:25.100> spaced<00:06:25.370> closer<00:06:25.669> together<00:06:25.910> and<00:06:26.270> as<00:06:26.390> we

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
they're spaced closer together and as we

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.719 
they're spaced closer together and as we
saw<00:06:26.690> with<00:06:26.840> the<00:06:26.960> treo<00:06:27.169> pro<00:06:27.490> closer<00:06:28.490> together

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
saw with the treo pro closer together

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.790 
saw with the treo pro closer together
often<00:06:29.540> means<00:06:29.780> less<00:06:30.050> finger<00:06:30.350> travel<00:06:30.680> which

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
often means less finger travel which

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.290 
often means less finger travel which
means<00:06:30.979> you<00:06:31.070> can<00:06:31.190> type<00:06:31.370> faster<00:06:31.820> for<00:06:32.060> people

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
means you can type faster for people

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.850 
means you can type faster for people
that<00:06:32.419> have<00:06:32.450> large<00:06:32.810> sized<00:06:33.140> hands<00:06:33.500> this<00:06:33.650> may<00:06:33.800> be

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
that have large sized hands this may be

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.500 
that have large sized hands this may be
a<00:06:33.979> problem<00:06:34.220> but<00:06:34.580> for<00:06:35.090> the<00:06:35.150> person<00:06:35.390> with<00:06:35.479> the

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:35.510 
a problem but for the person with the

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.070 
a problem but for the person with the
average-sized<00:06:35.960> hand<00:06:36.290> or<00:06:36.530> small<00:06:36.800> size<00:06:37.070> 10

smaller<00:06:39.080> keyboards<00:06:39.560> actually<00:06:39.950> seem<00:06:40.160> to<00:06:40.430> to<00:06:40.880> be

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
smaller keyboards actually seem to to be

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.050 
smaller keyboards actually seem to to be
conducive<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.050> faster<00:06:42.470> typing<00:06:42.800> so<00:06:43.729> that's<00:06:43.910> it

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
conducive to faster typing so that's it
