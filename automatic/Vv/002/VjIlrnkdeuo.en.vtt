honest<00:00:14.140> I<00:00:14.290> think<00:00:14.350> we<00:00:15.130> were<00:00:15.250> the<00:00:15.400> better<00:00:15.520> team

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
honest I think we were the better team

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.029 
honest I think we were the better team
over<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.480> game<00:00:16.689> and<00:00:17.019> we<00:00:17.619> had<00:00:17.769> the<00:00:17.859> most

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
over the game and we had the most

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.700 
over the game and we had the most
chances<00:00:18.460> but<00:00:19.210> it<00:00:19.359> was<00:00:19.480> always<00:00:19.810> tough<00:00:19.990> against

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
chances but it was always tough against

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.380 
chances but it was always tough against
a<00:00:20.769> team<00:00:20.949> like<00:00:20.980> my<00:00:21.220> city<00:00:21.460> when<00:00:21.789> when<00:00:22.150> you<00:00:22.240> know<00:00:22.359> a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
seen his better days when he was at

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.089 
seen his better days when he was at
Everton<00:02:07.509> but<00:02:08.140> he<00:02:08.229> had<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> really<00:02:08.679> good<00:02:08.890> season

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.100 
Everton but he had a really good season
longer<00:02:09.489> it's<00:02:09.640> got<00:02:09.789> on<00:02:09.910> gone<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.509> he's<00:02:10.660> improved

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
longer it's got on gone on he's improved

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.839

but<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:11.739> must<00:02:12.099> admit<00:02:12.250> I<00:02:12.459> think<00:02:12.519> it<00:02:12.670> would<00:02:12.760> have

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
but I must admit I think it would have

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.520 
but I must admit I think it would have
been<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.970> travesty<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:13.420> fast<00:02:13.629> one<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> one

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
been a travesty a fast one the one

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.720 
been a travesty a fast one the one
I<00:02:14.560> thought<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.040> was<00:02:15.160> different<00:02:15.250> class<00:02:15.580> they

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
I thought it was different class they

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.730 
I thought it was different class they
wanted<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.180> more<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.870> was<00:02:16.960> no<00:02:17.170> no

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
wanted it more there was no no

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.230 
wanted it more there was no no
competition<00:02:18.220> around<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.730> pitch<00:02:18.940> they<00:02:19.120> won

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
competition around the pitch they won

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.030 
competition around the pitch they won
every<00:02:19.450> second<00:02:19.870> ball<00:02:20.020> every<00:02:20.260> single<00:02:20.560> battle<00:02:20.740> in

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
every second ball every single battle in

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
every second ball every single battle in
there<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.490> game<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.570> thought<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:22.840> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
there in the game and I thought what a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.030 
there in the game and I thought what a
better<00:02:23.020> side<00:02:23.230> simple<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.680> that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
better side simple as that

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.220 
better side simple as that
looked<00:02:24.280> like<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.460> was<00:02:24.610> gonna<00:02:24.670> come<00:02:24.910> though

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
looked like it was gonna come though

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.940 
looked like it was gonna come though
yeah<00:02:26.230> they've<00:02:26.410> had<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.560> couple<00:02:26.770> chances

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
yeah they've had a couple chances

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.590 
yeah they've had a couple chances
obviously<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:27.970> cleared<00:02:28.210> their<00:02:28.330> own<00:02:28.420> one

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
obviously the they cleared their own one

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.120 
obviously the they cleared their own one
off<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.870> line<00:02:28.990> and<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.320> forest<00:02:29.620> half<00:02:29.800> and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
table at all I thought I thought they'd

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.890

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.270 
started okay second half they had a 15
20<00:03:26.019> minute<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.350> thought<00:03:26.769> this<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.010> gonna<00:03:27.130> be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
20 minute I thought this is gonna be

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.979 
20 minute I thought this is gonna be
better<00:03:27.370> now<00:03:27.580> they<00:03:27.700> need<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> goal<00:03:28.120> but<00:03:28.720> then<00:03:28.900> I

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
better now they need a goal but then I

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.650 
better now they need a goal but then I
stock<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:29.590> it's<00:03:30.250> difficult<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.910> had<00:03:31.630> a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
stock up and so it's difficult you had a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.850 
stock up and so it's difficult you had a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
think that in the end that could be

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.140 
think that in the end that could be
