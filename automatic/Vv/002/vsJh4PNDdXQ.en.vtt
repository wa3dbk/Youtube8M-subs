00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.450
 it's not from the hip to the ring and 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.000
 there I have finished the skirt 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.430
 finished what I'm going to do forward and 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.800
 back exactly the same and then if 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.519
 a cantilever I cut a skirt 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.099
 55 centimeters long and one goded that 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.750
 It has 6 or 7 centimeters has six 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.089
 centimeters notice that it is finished 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.749
 directly with overlock of course 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:34.540
 this comes comes as termination is not 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.070
 true in sight is being used or if not 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.780
 you can finish it with a curl t is 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.180
 saying this can not end with a 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.390
 common hem not true then 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.270
 look to make that flown I'm going 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.690
 to cut and what I'm going to do I'm going to 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.030
 carve many times this I'm going to do 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 this 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 well up near the edge is always 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 near the edge so that it opens and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.800
 with this quarter of skirt with this 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.750
 fourth of skirt I'm going to open 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.030
 up to form 90 degrees like that 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.380
 sorry 180 degrees 180 degrees because 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 has one has a bell dish on 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.450
 front and a bell dish has the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.780
 back is this of course I'll 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.899
 they do well well well they carry it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.850
 and they will have a mold cited and notice 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.440
 are going to have this mold cited because what 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.630
 that I want to teach them now is how 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.300
 cut this garment how to pass it to the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.569
 This fabric and to pass it to the fabric 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.850
 the important thing is that we see well the 10 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.009
 because good a way to pass a mold 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 to biés that is directly as they do 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.310
 the dressmakers fold the fabric in 45 degrees 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.440
 and thus accommodate the skirt can be made 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.810
 that's valid but they're going to have a 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.670
 terrible fabric waste because of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 the other way as cutters do 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.060
 in the garment factories one puts 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.090
 the thread 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.220
 in the mold and that way you will be able to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.189
 accommodating the fabric will be able to accommodate 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.049
 molds in another way 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.590
 look, I have here the forward 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.140
 the butt I have the 2 voladitos look 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 that I made a cantilever that they are is a 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.970
 bell dish for the front that goes to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.970
 stay like this and a dish bell for the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.790
 back i mean I took this cut it and 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.840
 arm a bell dish and what I'm going to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.870
 do remember that to draw the 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 10 I have to have first 90 degrees 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.600
 and divide it and make 45 this one remember 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.360
 to explain them to you when we did the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.390
 tie because our squad has 30 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.440
 60 and 90 degrees I have no angle 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.260
 45 then look for me to support the thread 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.260
 Normal of the fabric is over 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.590
 cortez 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.459
 we continue and you are going to share the second 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 block with logic 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.900
 graciela with the work so 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.859
 I'm going to have to respect that that is 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:24.769
 that's how it is to me sometimes I like to draw it 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.590
 so and draw it like that is to say because as 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.470
 I 'm saying that the fabric for 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.109
 cut to good does not have difference between 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.450
 the plot and the thread is to say the plot and 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.669
 the weave let's say is to say sometimes I 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.739
 I can place this this piece I can 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.510
 place like this or I can place it like this 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.159
 because it is not a fabric that has a 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.319
 color difference or tone difference 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.239
 so I always think that for 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.189
 ticket can not be a fabric with 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.430
 hair can not be velvet can not 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.919
 be lean so always knit flax fabric 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.110
 for example that kind of type of 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.840
 linen fabrics are the ideal 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.460
 or for example he believes it also serves but 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.900
 some for example some fabrics that 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.000
 are using this year that are like a 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.700
 little bamboo are not good for 10 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.770
 because the understood garment collapses 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.090
 then look at me I do the 2 and the 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.209
 crossed 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.919
 and how am I going to locate this mold if I 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.340
 I can put for example what can I put 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:23.580
 well and I can put it this way this mobile 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.650
 I already have this scale and have 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.180
 just in scale for a fabric of 90 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 I'm thinking that I'm using a cloth 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.460
 about 50 but what I want them 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.050
 teaching is stop I always thought about it 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.479
 I put it this way and I'm not 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.430
 putting on the beat is correct if I 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.010
 I have the thread marked what I have to 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.919
 do is locate it in such a way that 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.050
 from a tip of the thread for example I 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.810
 until the side of the cloth I have 17 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.669
 centimeters and notice that this tip 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.070
 I have 16 I have to run a 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.120
 little bit is I have to look for the 10 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.810
 exact 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.070
 because then this garment is going to rain 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.400
 right in the center of the garment 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.070
 took 17 here 17 here the same thing I do with the 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.990
 another little piece I always take from here to 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.419
 there from here to there 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.060
 If I serve myself, maybe I can put it 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.380
 in this way crossed we are 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.930
 talking about a fabric that is not going to have 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.400
 color change is but in this case to 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.620
 it suits me to put it this way 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.710
 then in the two bits that I 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.669
 the toys are going to come out of the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:31.300
 front and rear and finally yes 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:34.180
 the views that are also located to the be 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.610
 it's an avenue and an avenue here 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.229
 cord cited is also cut the good is 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.850
 say that all this garment is cut the 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.630
 10 and a secret that I tell you how to 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:45.039
 weapon shrapnel is at 10 that sense 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.990
 they remove the two threads of the machine the 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:51.789
 two threads the one above and the one with the coil 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:54.070
 they put it inside the fabric they stick the 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.520
 needle make a windpipe and come 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.289
 sewing with the two little threads inside 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.350
 they come to know about it with the little threads 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.330
 inside and with those same crimes 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.699
 helping with the scissors they put in and go out 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.340
 and they turn around and you have this type of 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:12.520
 However, I believe that María 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.340
 laura teaches but good 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:21.490
 all this skirt is cut all and already 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:22.610
 that leaving surely I will think 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.470
 one for you 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.870
 good girls we said goodbye but we did not 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.200
 He said goodbye was said goodbye Mr. 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.200
 a tongue twister 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.190
 work with the girls now because 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.190
 we have a lot
