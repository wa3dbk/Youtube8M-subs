so<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> role<00:03:02.400> I'll<00:03:02.610> play<00:03:02.790> just<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.120> few<00:03:03.299> seconds

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
so the role I'll play just a few seconds

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.259 
so the role I'll play just a few seconds
ago<00:03:03.750> was<00:03:04.079> five<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:08.549> I<00:03:08.640> don't<00:03:08.700> want<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.120> too

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
ago was five and I don't want to get too

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.300 
ago was five and I don't want to get too

eighth notes and sixteenths and dotted
notes<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.410> these<00:03:13.590> musical<00:03:14.040> terms<00:03:14.280> let's<00:03:14.880> just

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
notes all these musical terms let's just

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.600 
notes all these musical terms let's just
focus<00:03:15.269> on<00:03:15.600> what<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> roll<00:03:16.170> looks<00:03:16.530> feels<00:03:17.310> and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
focus on what a roll looks feels and

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.069 
focus on what a roll looks feels and
sounds<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.769> next<00:03:19.880> five<00:03:20.880> three<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.480> would

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
sounds like so next five three one would

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.160 
sounds like so next five three one would
be<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.680> example<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.299> forward<00:03:24.720> roll

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.540 

if<00:03:31.170> I<00:03:31.350> wanted<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.710> try<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.070> different

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
if I wanted to try a different

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.160 
if I wanted to try a different
combination<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:33.210> three<00:03:33.480> nuts<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.870> would<00:03:34.020> be

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
combination of three nuts it would be

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.470 
combination of three nuts it would be
three<00:03:34.500> strings<00:03:34.860> covered<00:03:35.580> with<00:03:35.730> three<00:03:36.030> fingers

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
three strings covered with three fingers

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.960 
three strings covered with three fingers
in<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.840> row<00:03:36.990> powder<00:03:37.320> I<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:38.040> also<00:03:38.220> play<00:03:38.580> three

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
in a row powder I can also play three

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.309 
in a row powder I can also play three
two<00:03:39.240> one

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.890 

now<00:03:47.319> another<00:03:47.909> foundational<00:03:48.909> role<00:03:49.209> that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
now another foundational role that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780 
now another foundational role that
you'll<00:03:50.139> hear<00:03:50.319> named<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.920> bluegrass<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.519> called

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you'll hear named in bluegrass is called

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.550 
you'll hear named in bluegrass is called
a<00:03:51.879> backwards<00:03:52.359> roll<00:03:52.540> that<00:03:52.810> would<00:03:52.959> be<00:03:53.079> the<00:03:53.230> exact

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
a backwards roll that would be the exact

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.679 
a backwards roll that would be the exact
notes<00:03:53.889> I<00:03:54.040> just<00:03:54.280> played<00:03:54.549> but<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.329> notes<00:03:55.540> would

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
notes I just played but the notes would

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:58.979 
notes I just played but the notes would
be<00:03:55.870> traveling<00:03:56.409> this<00:03:56.859> way<00:03:57.129> up<00:03:57.400> toward<00:03:57.879> the<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
be traveling this way up toward the the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.259 
be traveling this way up toward the the
smaller<00:03:59.530> string<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.549> if<00:04:00.639> I<00:04:00.730> wanted<00:04:00.999> to<00:04:01.060> play

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
smaller string so if I wanted to play

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.770 
smaller string so if I wanted to play
one<00:04:01.959> three<00:04:02.409> five<00:04:03.000> instead<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.060> five<00:04:04.329> three<00:04:04.659> one

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
one three five instead of five three one

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.080 
one three five instead of five three one
that<00:04:05.680> would<00:04:05.859> just<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.219> the<00:04:06.370> opposite<00:04:06.879> of<00:04:06.969> a

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that would just be the opposite of a

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.759 
that would just be the opposite of a
forward<00:04:07.420> roll<00:04:07.599> we<00:04:07.780> call<00:04:07.989> that<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.200> backwards

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
forward roll we call that a backwards

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.760 
forward roll we call that a backwards
roll

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.810 

I<00:04:15.310> could<00:04:16.060> play<00:04:16.180> instead<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:17.080> three<00:04:17.350> to<00:04:17.620> one

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
I could play instead of three to one

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.470 
I could play instead of three to one
which<00:04:18.820> is<00:04:19.000> forward

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
which is forward

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.420 
which is forward

of the more complex roles that beginners

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:28.820 
of the more complex roles that beginners
start<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:23.540> three<00:05:24.590> to<00:05:26.510> one<00:05:27.510> and<00:05:27.870> then

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
start with three to one and then

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.020 
start with three to one and then
alternate<00:05:29.450> for<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.540> thumb<00:05:30.810> to<00:05:31.080> play<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.410> four
