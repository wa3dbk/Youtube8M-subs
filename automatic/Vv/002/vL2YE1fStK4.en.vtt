00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
way ahead of you on the Left you'll have

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.970 
way ahead of you on the Left you'll have
to<00:02:17.270> bridge<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.690> walk<00:02:17.870> okay<00:02:18.230> okay<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.830> got<00:02:18.920> a

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to bridge the walk okay okay so we got a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.910 
to bridge the walk okay okay so we got a
breach<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:20.050> okay<00:02:21.050> usually<00:02:21.440> want<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.680> scope

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
breach here okay usually want to scope

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.850 
breach here okay usually want to scope
in<00:02:22.130> after<00:02:22.880> breach<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.290> lot<00:02:24.440> easier<00:02:24.470> and

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
in after breach it's a lot easier and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.850 
in after breach it's a lot easier and
and<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.610> find<00:02:26.060> sometimes<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.780> i<00:02:27.020> guess<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.800> was

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
and I find sometimes I i guess it was

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.040 
and I find sometimes I i guess it was
more<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.160> when<00:02:28.490> we<00:02:28.580> were<00:02:28.610> playing<00:02:28.850> special<00:02:29.780> ops

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
more so when we were playing special ops

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.940 
more so when we were playing special ops
in<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.800> area<00:02:32.200> enough<00:02:33.200> is<00:02:33.350> this<00:02:33.530> one<00:02:33.680> or<00:02:33.830> not

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
in this area enough is this one or not

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.080 
in this area enough is this one or not
where<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.030> had<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.240> breach<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.690> wall<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:37.090> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
where we had to breach the wall and it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.960 
where we had to breach the wall and it
varies<00:02:38.630> how<00:02:38.870> long<00:02:39.310> you're<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.520> slow<00:02:40.940> motion

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
varies how long you're in a slow motion
