think if this is true we'll be seeing
them<00:03:59.319> in<00:03:59.469> there<00:03:59.680> plainly<00:04:00.310> i<00:04:00.489> think<00:04:00.790> we'll<00:04:00.909> be

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
them in there plainly i think we'll be

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.729 
them in there plainly i think we'll be
seeing<00:04:01.209> them<00:04:01.419> in<00:04:01.540> there<00:04:01.750> because<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.259> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
seeing them in there because in the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.949 
seeing them in there because in the
original<00:04:02.859> call<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.639> duty<00:04:03.969> black<00:04:04.299> ops<00:04:04.449> and

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
original call of duty black ops and

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.719 
original call of duty black ops and
world<00:04:05.139> at<00:04:05.259> war<00:04:05.439> and<00:04:05.650> zombie<00:04:06.219> modes<00:04:06.400> for<00:04:06.609> them

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
world at war and zombie modes for them

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.309 
world at war and zombie modes for them
with<00:04:06.909> their<00:04:07.120> actually<00:04:07.509> hit<00:04:07.689> an<00:04:07.840> East<00:04:08.049> drugs

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
with their actually hit an East drugs

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.929 
with their actually hit an East drugs
beyond<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.009> it<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.370> hidden<00:04:09.639> easter

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
beyond that and it was a hidden easter

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.759 
beyond that and it was a hidden easter
egg<00:04:10.209> story<00:04:10.599> and<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.930> became<00:04:11.169> such<00:04:11.439> a<00:04:11.469> big

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
egg story and that became such a big

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.499 
egg story and that became such a big
deal<00:04:11.979> and<00:04:12.340> we<00:04:12.459> actually<00:04:12.579> loved<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.209> head<00:04:13.359> and

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:13.509 
deal and we actually loved that head and

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.969 
deal and we actually loved that head and
story<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:13.959> now<00:04:14.139> i<00:04:14.169> think<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.739> putting

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
story so now i think that the putting

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.099 
story so now i think that the putting
these<00:04:15.069> coats<00:04:15.340> into<00:04:16.030> their<00:04:16.180> own<00:04:16.299> campaign<00:04:16.870> and

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
these coats into their own campaign and

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.509 
these coats into their own campaign and
he<00:04:17.380> also<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.919> we'll<00:04:18.039> be<00:04:18.070> seeing<00:04:18.340> these

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
he also think we'll be seeing these

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.370 
he also think we'll be seeing these
characters<00:04:19.000> within<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.389> player<00:04:19.810> mode<00:04:20.049> as<00:04:20.229> well

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
characters within a player mode as well

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.719 
characters within a player mode as well
because<00:04:20.620> we've<00:04:20.739> already<00:04:20.919> seen<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.340> new<00:04:21.489> four

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
because we've already seen the new four

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.430 
because we've already seen the new four
characters<00:04:22.210> but<00:04:22.690> we've<00:04:22.840> got<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.199> another

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
characters but we've got to have another

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.719 
characters but we've got to have another
fork<00:04:23.740> out<00:04:23.919> just<00:04:24.159> to<00:04:24.250> make<00:04:24.400> up<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.639> eighth

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
fork out just to make up the eighth

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.100 
fork out just to make up the eighth
player<00:04:24.969> mode<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:25.360> i<00:04:25.389> think<00:04:25.510> for<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> eight

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
player mode so i think for the eight

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.510 
player mode so i think for the eight
players<00:04:26.380> will<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:26.919> having<00:04:27.130> these<00:04:27.250> old

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
players will be having these old

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.920 
players will be having these old
characters<00:04:27.969> and<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.360> have<00:04:28.449> within<00:04:28.659> the<00:04:28.779> new

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
characters and we have within the new

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.480 
characters and we have within the new
characters<00:04:29.380> combined

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
characters combined

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.189 
characters combined
so<00:04:30.910> that's<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.210> for<00:04:31.389> this<00:04:31.449> video<00:04:31.599> guys<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:32.110> do

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
so that's it for this video guys to do

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.510 
so that's it for this video guys to do
