00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
hello guys today I'm going to tell you

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.590 
hello guys today I'm going to tell you
what<00:00:04.709> gem<00:00:05.009> effect<00:00:05.339> is<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.759> how<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.089> can<00:00:06.270> get

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
what gem effect is and how you can get

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.230 
what gem effect is and how you can get
it<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.990> yourself

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.780 

so<00:00:17.240> what<00:00:17.510> is<00:00:17.810> Gemma<00:00:18.230> fax<00:00:18.560> so<00:00:19.040> basically<00:00:19.490> it

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
so what is Gemma fax so basically it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.000 
so what is Gemma fax so basically it

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
what the settings do the best thing yet

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.119 
what the settings do the best thing yet
is<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:50.989> can<00:00:51.110> actually<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.440> used<00:00:51.800> with

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
is that it can actually be used with

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.130 
is that it can actually be used with
many<00:00:52.280> different<00:00:52.550> games<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.420> not<00:00:53.570> just<00:00:53.780> online
