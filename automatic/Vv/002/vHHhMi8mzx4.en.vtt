00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.990
 everything looks only fbia 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 It was gabi and we 're here. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.849
 covering the first glass gringos the canopy 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.660
 gringos is a soccer cup 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:26.070
 alternative for foreigners who 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:27.689
 live in São Paulo and told how 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.480
 it was this idea to organize this cup 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.369
 I'm gringo myself I'm gringo already I am 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 French is then a championship that I 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.989
 I would dream of playing represent my country 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960
 a city like são paulo that has much 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.350
 Foreigner I thought it was a thing 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.210
 possible when I had the idea then but 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.680
 idea is not easier more complicated 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.840
 more complicated was to join these 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 foreigners all right because after all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.320
 were 24 countries 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.000
 How did you do to call everything? 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.710
 world my first partner was the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.660
 Consulate of France in São Paulo 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.539
 that makes me the contact of others 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.899
 consulates so we started well but 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.510
 we had to open to many fronts 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.950
 chambers of commerce facebook network of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 friends 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.159
 We even forced it one by one until it was 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 close those styles and not how many 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.540
 people participated and how many 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.100
 nationalities frank 30 nationality 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.409
 because you have teams that are mixed 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 in which the case of the team waiting and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 alpine 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.920
 there are 30 nationalities and 360 players 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 Bolivian who already train you will join 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.030
 just for this cup how cnec works 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.390
 São Paulo is kind of everything we have 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.180
 team and has a Haitian one 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.450
 another little better if the team did there 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 but we do not train, it's better to say 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.890
 that it was here with all this everything and how 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.890

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.020
 and turkey in traditional football was here 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:04.170

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.170
 the heroes of the economy enough and hood 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.149
 O 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:34.920
 what is this character he devil is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.210
 The devil is originally from bolivia. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.570
 our culture 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.240
 he besides the games that is lucky 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.820
 for bolivia this I just have a few accounts of 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.880
 Bolivian selection now we are 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.200
 supporting our culture with our team 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.000
 What is live volleyball? 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.980
 so you were there at the chile game 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.910
 I saw that it was near there that I was 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.650
 making 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.470
 Actually, I'm the old one. 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.740
 coordinator is the very beginning of a group 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.060
 small solo career as we talk 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.730
 accompanying these boys sidwell 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.120
 regulating the heart to race hyper 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.640
 embezzled where with broken dengue fell 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.580
 What matters is never giving up is always 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:30.240
 Is the emotion of itaí facebook there? 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:34.590
 representing your country on behalf of 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.890
 miguel godoy the Chilean saw here 30 in the 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.140
 Brazil and pioneer hour cabin in 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.220
 Brazil but it was beautiful because playing in 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.680
 third plane 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:04:08.390
 You followed the cup from here to the maximum. 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:04:13.320
 This achievement and now it's going to end 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:15.390
 I think the prawns have already tasted their 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:20.430
 ability in this championship 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.630
 and so far the cabin I can say 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.010
 which is always 100% of the time 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.950
 You already had this team already you 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.790
 They played you joined that cup. 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.430
 How did it go? 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:37.350
 we do not already have a team that trains 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.870
 every Saturday the fact of wolf and was 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.710
 an opportunity that you were 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.260
 optimistic play with this coalition all 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.660
 who played the series whose this is a reflection 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.460
 of your community here is very 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.830
 people here from shrimp as they reside 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.470
 Everyone together with everyone has a lot of 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.620
 people I think in the end you good to see 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.290
 much more because all the knights 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:10.110
 will come out until all the holes are 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:14.400
 Please leave a will in I'm here 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.740
 In Brazil the base rate is a very 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.020
 charming and has received many people 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.600
 as an example when you talk about the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.150
 the amaral abedi however open to all 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.380
 world will watch in the world cup in 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.290

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.500
 talk about my country, I do 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.810
 said aquino almost even this shirt is 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.270
 pacha of cement downloaded corinthians 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.950
 the current year today this semifinal of 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.140
 turkey and bolivia was the one that 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.419
 struggle of the two largest communities 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.669
 have here first the Bolivian 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.180
 always comes a lot of weight china also 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.580
 with a lot of people but I think the 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.650
 Bolivia is now going to be in the final 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.870
 It will take a lot of people to the community. 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.240
 which has more weight here also then it is 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.680
 normal how the championship is made possible 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.510
 because you obviously need to pay this 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.479
 space, how 's it going? 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:07.650
 We have a paying sponsor. We have two 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:09.390
 partners who give us prizes or the 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.789
 from the Pullman hotel of the accor group for 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.560
 have two parties there and the teams have 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.070
 pay an application fee to pay 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.870
 that 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.940
 this is what enables the organization to 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.820
 viability is made through the 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.500
 subscription 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.170
 we hope the next one is more 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.590
 sponsorship to help make this happen 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.840
 all around the end of next week the radius 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.450
 will give the trophy right and will deliver the 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.090
 awards there in the hotel and in the end will be a 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:38.480
 animation stage that has a field there is 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.760
 of 11 which is very cool and will be a 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.250
 beautiful party will have a big grandstand 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.080
 You can call it even more twisted and 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.600
 park a very beautiful place so I guess 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.300

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.590
