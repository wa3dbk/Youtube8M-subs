got<00:03:00.109> wives<00:03:00.349> stashed<00:03:00.890> someplace<00:03:01.430> we<00:03:01.910> just

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
got wives stashed someplace we just

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.589 
got wives stashed someplace we just
ain't<00:03:02.329> found<00:03:02.660> him<00:03:02.870> yet<00:03:03.700> all<00:03:04.700> right<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:05.269> they

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
ain't found him yet all right and they

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.650 
ain't found him yet all right and they
probably<00:03:05.870> all<00:03:06.170> got<00:03:06.730> Mormon<00:03:07.730> names<00:03:08.030> too<00:03:10.660> you

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
probably all got Mormon names too you

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
probably all got Mormon names too you
know<00:03:11.750> out<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.890> book<00:03:13.879> more<00:03:14.209> more<00:03:15.340> more<00:03:16.340> men
