 person of my favorites as you see 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.280
 I'm just doing an extension to 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.340
 the nail is very small, not you because it 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 it makes me that is one is an expense of the cjex 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.399
 because only a little bit to me 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.080

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.110
 I did my nails to my sister and to her 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.980
 he likes very short then 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.210
 they make me 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.100
 that last nothing look more natural and 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 for a nail so short for me 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 preference I prefer to use form because 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.810
 elche I'm going to cut almost all the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 chip just use a bit then 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.740
 is the way it looks use the machine 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.470
 polisher to seal the cuticle and already 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.690
 with the limescale science what else and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.890
 link the nail very quickly and how they were 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.720
 so curtains dusted and sprayed him 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.910
 little alcohol I have a little bottle 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.180
 where do I have alcohol 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.210
 de rossi these are stones number 9 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.940
 these are stones number 5 here I have 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.120
 this pebble that is like a diamond shape 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.550
 it's swarovski crystal and this is a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.490
 chain and the gel that I always use if 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 you like to know what to use and how I put it 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.330
 I have a video especially where 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.730
 I show all the gels that I use 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 brands and where I buy them and cough 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.770
 If you like to see there, you can find it 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.140
 between my videos I'm measuring the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.940
 short chain and how I put the gel 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.500
 down we have time to move him and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.060
 accommodate it 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.370
 and the medieval because the chain was 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.850
 very short then grabbed the balines 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.460
 and I roy at them in about 23 breaths 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.240
 I know what problems and now I'm using 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.840
 swarovski number 9 I will use 5 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.739
 swarovskis on each side 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.970
 and then I'm going to use 2 swarovskis number 5 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:22.540
 up and down there for the down 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.030
 there already having to put it but there 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.650
 there it is and above it looks more aesthetic like this 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.860
 if we put those two measures very 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.900
 pretty you see is that as you see is the only 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.080
 almost all the nails are simple but 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.160
 If I was going to be able to decorate a finger, I would 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.840
 be all full so that it stands out here is 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.340
 where I have alcohol in this little bottle 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.530
 who can buy it in the store of 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.780
 cheap dollar wherever 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.430
 roseo because I went to the for after 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.890
 put the crystals I put it in the for 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.620
 look at what beautiful shines lamp method 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.060
 and if a sticky gel cap remains 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.010
 so you have to clean it with alcohol 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.530
 here I put plugin go in the area of 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.540
 cuticle and now I put my psuv and saint 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.950
 You can also buy it in my store 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.200
 it shines beautifully and does not dim here 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 I'm sealing the crystals so that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.780
 last longer and so that you do not get stuck in 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.209
 hair 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.680
 ok without touching the crystals and if you get to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.009
 touch the crystals above 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.199
 although you a cotton cited with alcohol 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.870
 and clean up I hope you have them 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.880

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.680

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.220
 cuticle of the enter brand and that has 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.080
