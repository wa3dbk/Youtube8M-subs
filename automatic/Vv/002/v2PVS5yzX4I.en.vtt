it is a keyboard that has been designed

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.140 
it is a keyboard that has been designed
specifically<00:00:08.220> with<00:00:08.340> gaming<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.760> mind<00:00:08.940> and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
specifically with gaming in mind and

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.390 
specifically with gaming in mind and
that<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.420> especially<00:00:10.110> noticeable<00:00:10.530> with<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
that is especially noticeable with the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.490 
that is especially noticeable with the
six<00:00:11.759> programmable<00:00:12.330> macro<00:00:12.599> buttons<00:00:12.870> down<00:00:13.139> left

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
hand side the multiple banks key banks

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070 
hand side the multiple banks key banks
which<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.890> used<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.310> switch<00:00:20.840> during<00:00:21.840> games

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
which can be used to switch during games

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.800 
which can be used to switch during games
or<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.859> different<00:00:23.160> programs<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:24.240> also<00:00:24.449> has

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
or for different programs it also has

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
or for different programs it also has
another<00:00:25.170> three<00:00:25.949> different<00:00:26.220> banks<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.640> also

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
another three different banks and also

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.140 
another three different banks and also
has<00:00:27.119> an<00:00:27.240> autonomous<00:00:27.810> mode<00:00:28.050> which<00:00:28.800> will

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
has an autonomous mode which will

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.049 
has an autonomous mode which will
automatically<00:00:30.150> select<00:00:31.250> different<00:00:32.250> key<00:00:32.730> banks

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
automatically select different key banks

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.319 
automatically select different key banks
based<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.290> application<00:00:35.070> that's<00:00:35.219> running

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
based on the application that's running

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.400 
based on the application that's running
it<00:00:36.329> also<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:39.300> ability<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.719> record<00:00:39.930> macros

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it also has the ability to record macros

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
it also has the ability to record macros
on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.890> fly<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:44.129> haven't<00:00:44.910> really

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
on the fly which is I haven't really

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
on the fly which is I haven't really
used<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.989> guess<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> useful<00:00:47.010> for

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
used it but I guess will be useful for

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.380 
used it but I guess will be useful for
some<00:00:47.280> people<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:50.070> really<00:00:50.640> cool<00:00:50.850> thing

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
some people and a really cool thing

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
some people and a really cool thing
not<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.289> design<00:00:52.649> today<00:00:52.920> aren't<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
not so much design today aren't you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150 
not so much design today aren't you
gaming<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.020> looks<00:00:55.260> cool<00:00:55.530> it's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
gaming but it just looks cool it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.099 
gaming but it just looks cool it's
backlighting<00:00:56.879> close<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:58.109> curtains<00:00:59.809> so<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> has

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
backlighting close my curtains so it has

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560 
backlighting close my curtains so it has
red<00:01:01.410> backlighting<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.820> pretty<00:01:03.239> cool

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
red backlighting which is pretty cool

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.270 
red backlighting which is pretty cool
it's<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> brightest<00:01:04.379> backlighting<00:01:04.949> when

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's not the brightest backlighting when

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's not the brightest backlighting when
compared<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> stuff<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:07.049> psychic

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
compared to stuff like the psychic

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.240 
compared to stuff like the psychic
cyborg<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.310> whatever<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:10.680> looks<00:01:10.890> really

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
cyborg and whatever that looks really

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.230 
cyborg and whatever that looks really
elegant<00:01:11.360> nice<00:01:12.950> whatever<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.150> has

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
elegant nice whatever it has so it has

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.550 
elegant nice whatever it has so it has
three<00:01:15.479> levels<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> backlighting<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.409> that's

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
three levels of backlighting so that's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.969 
three levels of backlighting so that's
its<00:01:17.040> brightest<00:01:17.430> setting<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.500> that's<00:01:19.500> one

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
its brightest setting and that's one

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
its brightest setting and that's one
step<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.580> another<00:01:21.030> step<00:01:21.780> dimmer<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.439> off

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
step then another step dimmer and off

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.340 
step then another step dimmer and off
I'm<00:01:23.909> not<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:24.990> steps

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
I'm not sure if you can see those steps

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.550 
I'm not sure if you can see those steps
very<00:01:25.500> clearly<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> camera<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:28.229> tells<00:01:28.439> her

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
very clearly on camera but it tells her

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.140 
very clearly on camera but it tells her
three<00:01:28.740> steps<00:01:31.909> another<00:01:32.909> feature<00:01:33.150> includes<00:01:33.900> is

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
three steps another feature includes is

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
three steps another feature includes is
the<00:01:36.470> anti-ghosting<00:01:37.470> capability<00:01:38.130> which

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the anti-ghosting capability which

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
the anti-ghosting capability which
allows<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.750> press<00:01:39.960> keeps<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> keys<00:01:40.470> at

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
allows you to press keeps the keys at

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
allows you to press keeps the keys at
the<00:01:40.680> same<00:01:40.740> time<00:01:41.130> without<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.299> computer

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the same time without you computer

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
the same time without you computer
missing<00:01:43.079> strokes<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.740> whatever<00:01:45.530> I'm<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:47.250> sure

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
missing strokes or whatever I'm not sure

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.050 
missing strokes or whatever I'm not sure
if<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> works<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.180> can't<00:01:48.420> prove<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> works<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
if it works I can't prove if it works I

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.030 
if it works I can't prove if it works I
can<00:01:51.060> yeah<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.590> says<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> can

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
can yeah I don't know it says it can

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.190 
can yeah I don't know it says it can
take<00:01:53.100> up<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.430> 26<00:01:53.970> keys<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.420> time<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> haven't

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
take up to 26 keys at one time I haven't

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.859 
take up to 26 keys at one time I haven't
tested<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.710> I'm<00:01:56.009> guessing<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.700> can't<00:01:56.969> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
tested that I'm guessing it can't but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.709 
tested that I'm guessing it can't but
for<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.560> four<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:58.860> five<00:01:59.009> keys<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.520> I've

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
for the four or five keys that I've

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.240 
for the four or five keys that I've
probably<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.079> most<00:02:01.229> pressed<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.979> worked

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
probably at the most pressed it's worked

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
probably at the most pressed it's worked
fine<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> haven't<00:02:03.000> run<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.240> any<00:02:03.390> issues<00:02:03.659> it's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
fine I haven't run into any issues it's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.469 
fine I haven't run into any issues it's
registered<00:02:04.530> all<00:02:04.680> my<00:02:04.829> key<00:02:05.009> presses<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.270> that's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
registered all my key presses so that's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.460

the<00:03:15.860> table<00:03:16.269> unnecessarily<00:03:18.880> but<00:03:19.880> that's<00:03:20.090> not

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
the table unnecessarily but that's not

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.210 
the table unnecessarily but that's not

removable also it has a glossy finish
which<00:03:22.940> well<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.260> does<00:03:24.470> look<00:03:24.709> nice<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:25.690> maybe

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
which well it does look nice is maybe

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.050 
which well it does look nice is maybe
not<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.290> best<00:03:28.160> thing<00:03:28.340> for<00:03:28.400> finger<00:03:28.730> prints

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
not the best thing for finger prints

not the best thing for finger prints
doesn't<00:03:30.019> feel<00:03:30.170> too<00:03:30.230> badly<00:03:30.560> though<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.130> can

doesn't feel too badly though you can

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.410 
doesn't feel too badly though you can
see<00:03:31.400> that's<00:03:31.610> probably<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.320> worst<00:03:33.320> part<00:03:33.650> for

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
see that's probably the worst part for

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.790 
see that's probably the worst part for
finger<00:03:35.420> prints<00:03:35.660> this<00:03:35.840> low<00:03:35.989> area<00:03:36.320> even<00:03:36.680> though

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
finger prints this low area even though

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.840 
finger prints this low area even though
I<00:03:36.830> hardly<00:03:37.160> use<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:38.720> very<00:03:38.780> okay<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:43.459> terms

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
I hardly use it it's very okay in terms

Windows key for standard typing it's

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.629 
Windows key for standard typing it's
okay<00:04:55.500> it's<00:04:55.680> not<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.830> best<00:04:56.100> keyboard<00:04:56.310> for

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
okay it's not the best keyboard for

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.610 
okay it's not the best keyboard for
standard<00:04:57.000> typing<00:04:57.389> I<00:04:57.570> find<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> keys<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.229> little

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
standard typing I find the keys a little

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.469 
standard typing I find the keys a little
bit<00:04:58.740> too<00:04:58.889> deep<00:04:59.070> for<00:04:59.130> me<00:04:59.340> but<00:04:59.760> that<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.180> only

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
bit too deep for me but that is only

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.029 
bit too deep for me but that is only
because<00:05:00.630> I've<00:05:01.050> gotten<00:05:01.350> really<00:05:01.590> used<00:05:01.889> to

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
because I've gotten really used to

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.409 
because I've gotten really used to
laptop<00:05:02.490> keyboards<00:05:02.940> which<00:05:03.120> are<00:05:03.270> really

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
laptop keyboards which are really

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.210 
laptop keyboards which are really
shallow<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.840> again<00:05:07.350> there<00:05:07.530> is<00:05:07.560> good<00:05:07.830> tactile

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
shallow but again there is good tactile

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.890 
shallow but again there is good tactile
feedback<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:08.940> know<00:05:09.120> when<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.389> pressed<00:05:09.660> it

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
feedback to you know when you pressed it

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.960 
feedback to you know when you pressed it
and<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.440> keys<00:05:10.620> are<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:11.370> light<00:05:11.760> and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
and the keys are just light and

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.379 
and the keys are just light and
contoured<00:05:12.419> so<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.850> find<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.000> contour

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
contoured so that I find the contour

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.110 
contoured so that I find the contour
really<00:05:15.539> helps<00:05:15.960> it<00:05:16.199> just<00:05:16.620> makes<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:17.039> so<00:05:17.789> you<00:05:17.850> do

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
really really nice software it's really

really really nice software it's really
not<00:05:55.830> intrusive<00:05:56.220> which<00:05:56.520> is<00:05:56.669> nice<00:05:56.849> just<00:05:57.570> open

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930
