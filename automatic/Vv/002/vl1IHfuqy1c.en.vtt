00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.230 

so<00:00:01.079> if<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.970> consider<00:00:04.009> Infinite<00:00:05.009> Monkey

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
so if you consider Infinite Monkey

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.910 
so if you consider Infinite Monkey
theorem<00:00:06.410> then<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:08.069> would<00:00:08.280> understand<00:00:08.910> that

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
theorem then you would understand that

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.110 
theorem then you would understand that
someday<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.870> seriously<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.309> inevitable<00:00:14.309> that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
someday it seriously is inevitable that

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.210 
someday it seriously is inevitable that
we<00:00:15.570> will<00:00:16.109> see<00:00:17.010> not<00:00:17.850> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:18.750> Rex<00:00:19.220> next

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
we will see not Tyrannosaurus Rex next

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
we will see not Tyrannosaurus Rex next
to<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.150> Brachiosaurus<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.410> perhaps

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
to the Brachiosaurus and perhaps

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.009 
to the Brachiosaurus and perhaps
interacting<00:00:23.460> with<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.730> okay<00:00:24.150> fine<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> they

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
interacting with that okay fine and they

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.290 
interacting with that okay fine and they
will<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:26.160> interacting<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.090> go<00:00:27.269> even

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
will be interacting if we go even

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.660 
will be interacting if we go even
further<00:00:27.810> into<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.560> concept<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> into<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
further into the concept and into the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.240 
further into the concept and into the
theory<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.199> them<00:00:31.410> together<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
theory we will see them together in a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.350 
theory we will see them together in a
drastic<00:00:32.640> park<00:00:33.600> universe<00:00:34.469> Phil<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
drastic park universe Phil if you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.430 
drastic park universe Phil if you
consider<00:00:36.750> Infinite<00:00:37.200> Monkey<00:00:37.230> theorem<00:00:38.329> however

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
consider Infinite Monkey theorem however

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.290 
consider Infinite Monkey theorem however
that<00:00:40.440> could<00:00:40.800> mean<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.969> may<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:43.079> possibly<00:00:43.230> be

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
that could mean it may very possibly be

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.139 
that could mean it may very possibly be
hundreds<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.539> millions<00:00:46.350> perhaps<00:00:46.820> billions<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
hundreds of millions perhaps billions of

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.569 
hundreds of millions perhaps billions of
years<00:00:48.570> before<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> incident<00:00:50.640> occurs<00:00:51.480> which

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
years before this incident occurs which

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
years before this incident occurs which
hmm<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.420> now<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.770> wait

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
hmm we don't have time now do we to wait

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.270 
hmm we don't have time now do we to wait
on<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
on that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420 
on that
but<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.390> could<00:00:57.600> hope<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.649> two<00:00:58.980> figures

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
but one could hope and these two figures

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
but one could hope and these two figures
look<00:00:59.820> fantastic<00:01:00.300> next<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.590> another<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
look fantastic next to one another the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.640 
look fantastic next to one another the
only<00:01:02.070> quarrel<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> concept<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
only quarrel I have with the concept is

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.280 
only quarrel I have with the concept is
how<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.400> aren't<00:01:05.700> entirely<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.420> scale<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
how they aren't entirely in scale so you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.530 
how they aren't entirely in scale so you
might<00:01:07.710> want<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> perhaps<00:01:08.850> consider<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
might want to perhaps consider this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.670 
might want to perhaps consider this
Brachiosaurus<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.299> juvenile<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.680> believe

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
Brachiosaurus to be a juvenile I believe

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.420 
Brachiosaurus to be a juvenile I believe
well<00:01:14.250> say<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> t-rex<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> 140<00:01:17.100> scale

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
well say if the t-rex was on a 140 scale

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.370 
well say if the t-rex was on a 140 scale
then<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> Brachiosaurus<00:01:23.570> see<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> t-rex<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
then the Brachiosaurus see the t-rex is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
then the Brachiosaurus see the t-rex is
a<00:01:25.409> bit<00:01:25.830> large<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.729> be<00:01:26.850> next<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.270> this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
a bit large to be next to this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.910 
a bit large to be next to this
Brachiosaurus<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.680> are<00:01:28.740> both

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
Brachiosaurus if they are both

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.569 
Brachiosaurus if they are both
full-grown<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> detail<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> such<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
full-grown but the detail and such is

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.069 
full-grown but the detail and such is
astronomically<00:01:32.579> impressive<00:01:33.390> considering

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
astronomically impressive considering

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.990 
astronomically impressive considering
the<00:01:34.350> price<00:01:34.590> range<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> these<00:01:35.460> products<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the price range that these products are

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
the price range that these products are
in<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.720> want

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
in now I want

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.130 
in now I want
Papo<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> make<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> another<00:01:39.150> sauropod<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
Papo to make a another sauropod or a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.260 
Papo to make a another sauropod or a
Brachiosaurus<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.460> doesn't<00:01:41.729> scale<00:01:42.030> with

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
Brachiosaurus that doesn't scale with

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.179 
Brachiosaurus that doesn't scale with
the<00:01:42.329> t-rex<00:01:42.509> entirely<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.920> rather

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the t-rex entirely or I would rather

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
the t-rex entirely or I would rather
have<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> soar<00:01:45.390> Poseidon<00:01:46.170> imagine

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
have them make a soar Poseidon imagine

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.020 
have them make a soar Poseidon imagine
that<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.220> looks<00:01:47.399> very<00:01:47.610> similar<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that because it looks very similar to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.630 
that because it looks very similar to
Brachiosaurus<00:01:48.780> only<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.590> maybe<00:01:50.130> 20

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
Brachiosaurus only it's about maybe 20

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.670 
Brachiosaurus only it's about maybe 20
to<00:01:50.759> 30<00:01:50.970> percent<00:01:51.390> larger<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.380> they're<00:01:52.560> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to 30 percent larger so if they're to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.789 
to 30 percent larger so if they're to
make<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.399> scale<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> t-rex<00:01:54.659> oh<00:01:55.020> my

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
make that in scale with the t-rex oh my

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
make that in scale with the t-rex oh my
god<00:01:56.100> yeah<00:01:56.640> whatever<00:01:56.939> guys<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.750> charge

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
god yeah whatever guys have them charge

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.200 
god yeah whatever guys have them charge
100<00:01:58.500> bucks<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.950> don't<00:01:59.130> care<00:01:59.369> I'll<00:01:59.820> pay<00:02:00.030> 100

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
100 bucks I don't care I'll pay 100

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
100 bucks I don't care I'll pay 100
bucks<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.780> fact<00:02:00.990> perhaps<00:02:01.469> I'll<00:02:01.770> buy<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> fan<00:02:02.460> or

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
bucks in fact perhaps I'll buy a fan or

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
bucks in fact perhaps I'll buy a fan or
two<00:02:02.820> one<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.450> things<00:02:03.719> as<00:02:03.869> well<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.700> no

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
two one of those things as well but no

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.749 
two one of those things as well but no
promises<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.190> full

comments guys what do you think is

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
comments guys what do you think is
the<00:02:13.590> better<00:02:13.770> t-rex<00:02:14.340> from<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> Popple<00:02:15.270> series

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the better t-rex from the Popple series

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.930 
the better t-rex from the Popple series
and<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.319> sort<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> sauropod<00:02:17.160> would<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.730> like
