I<00:00:45.270> don't<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.680> make<00:00:47.039> any<00:00:47.280> agree<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.539> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
I don't really make any agree here I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.119 
I don't really make any agree here I
guess<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> probably<00:00:49.170> should<00:00:49.620> that's<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.980> good

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
usually as something I'd do is like

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
usually as something I'd do is like
drinking<00:00:55.140> less<00:00:55.440> soda<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.399> eating<00:00:56.699> less<00:00:56.910> fast

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
for every day you should killer one but

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.660 
for every day you should killer one but
what<00:01:25.500> would<00:01:25.619> be<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> hardest<00:01:26.189> thing<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> live

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
what would be the hardest thing to live

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.149 
what would be the hardest thing to live
without<00:01:26.820> cell<00:01:27.450> phone<00:01:27.659> internet<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.530> GPS

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
without cell phone internet or GPS

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.289 
without cell phone internet or GPS
I<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.970> Internet<00:01:31.100> out<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.369> those<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I think Internet out of all those like

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.420 
I think Internet out of all those like
you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.930> still<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.350> maps<00:01:34.680> right<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.310> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you can still have maps right so that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.850 
you can still have maps right so that
covers<00:01:35.549> GPS<00:01:36.119> cell<00:01:36.869> phone<00:01:37.110> there's<00:01:37.380> payphones

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
covers GPS cell phone there's payphones

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800 
covers GPS cell phone there's payphones
and<00:01:38.070> stuff<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.570> spend

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and stuff like that but really you spend

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960 
and stuff like that but really you spend
most<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.040> phone<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
most of your time on your phone on the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
most of your time on your phone on the
internet<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> had<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.350> internet

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
internet so if you had the internet

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.940 
internet so if you had the internet
still<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> library<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:46.350> on

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
still you go to the library you get on

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
still you go to the library you get on
other<00:01:47.100> computers<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> could<00:01:48.030> still<00:01:48.240> do

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
crazy now there's like no question of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
crazy now there's like no question of
anything<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> learn

anything like if you want to learn

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.720 
anything like if you want to learn
something<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
something you just

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.640 
something you just
right<00:02:03.060> away<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.480> there's<00:02:03.690> benefits<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
but I think there's negatives to

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.840 
but I think there's negatives to
imagination<00:02:06.960> for<00:02:07.230> accuracy<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:08.070> when<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.790> was

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
imagination for accuracy like when I was

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.430 
imagination for accuracy like when I was
a<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:09.150> I<00:02:09.240> had<00:02:09.480> a<00:02:09.510> great<00:02:09.690> imagination<00:02:09.870> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
a little I had a great imagination and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.870 
a little I had a great imagination and
now<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.650> find<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.070> like<00:02:11.310> immediately<00:02:11.790> if
