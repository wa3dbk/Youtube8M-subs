and Legendre for our listener are mostly
but<00:00:12.420> we<00:00:12.540> figured<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:12.929> out<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.769> forge<00:00:14.490> how<00:00:15.030> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
but we figured it out in in forge how to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.120 
but we figured it out in in forge how to
make<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.360> actual<00:00:15.690> button<00:00:15.900> activated<00:00:16.379> door<00:00:16.650> I'm

important<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:37.980> can't<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.309> anything

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
important it can't really be anything

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
important it can't really be anything
this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:38.940> acting<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.540> my<00:00:39.600> face<00:00:39.809> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
this is just acting it's my face this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.130 
this is just acting it's my face this
kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> starting<00:00:41.219> point<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.140> you're

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
kind of starting point here and you're

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.569 
kind of starting point here and you're
gonna<00:00:43.260> need<00:00:43.410> these<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.800> create<00:00:44.040> packing

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
gonna need these to create packing

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.799 
gonna need these to create packing
smalls<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.210> these<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.510> what's<00:00:45.660> gonna

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
smalls now these are what's gonna

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.110 
smalls now these are what's gonna
actually<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.440> doors<00:00:46.770> these<00:00:47.520> these

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
actually be your doors these these

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.180 
actually be your doors these these
crates<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> may<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.200> seen<00:00:49.410> similar<00:00:49.860> designs

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
crates you may have seen similar designs

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
crates you may have seen similar designs
this<00:00:50.399> back<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> reach<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.539> didn't<00:00:51.780> have

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
this back and reach but they didn't have

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
this back and reach but they didn't have
buttons<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> buttons<00:00:52.649> are<00:00:52.770> cooler<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> also

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
buttons and buttons are cooler and also

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
buttons and buttons are cooler and also
you<00:00:54.059> can't<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> landmine<00:00:54.870> trick<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you can't do the landmine trick with the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
you can't do the landmine trick with the
buttons<00:00:56.010> anymore<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> figured<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.300> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
buttons anymore so I figured that this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.569 
buttons anymore so I figured that this
is<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.320> even<00:00:58.949> an<00:00:59.129> even<00:00:59.399> better

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
is kind of even an even better

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.130 
is kind of even an even better
equivalent<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.840> there's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
equivalent and I think because there's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.080 
equivalent and I think because there's
no<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:02.100> know<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.489> there's<00:01:02.670> there's<00:01:02.910> an

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
no you know well there's there's an

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.539 
no you know well there's there's an
explosion<00:01:03.570> chain<00:01:04.140> reaction<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:05.100> like

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
explosion chain reaction but not like

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
explosion chain reaction but not like
right<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:05.970> face<00:01:06.150> you'll<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.900> see<00:01:07.049> it

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
right in your face you'll just see it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.899 
right in your face you'll just see it
later<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.310> line<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.790> up

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
later so I have this line up there up

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.130 
later so I have this line up there up
for<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> month<00:01:09.210> fixed<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.689> now<00:01:09.780> because

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
very important you see fusion coils is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.149 
very important you see fusion coils is
what's<00:01:21.900> gonna<00:01:22.020> be<00:01:22.170> holding<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.799> crates

otherwise<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.280> might<00:01:32.369> tilt<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:32.909> side<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
otherwise it might tilt one side and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.149 
otherwise it might tilt one side and
then<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.600> won't<00:01:33.750> fall<00:01:33.990> properly<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then they won't fall properly so you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.109 
then they won't fall properly so you
want<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> want<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.200 
middle of the crowd of the packing crate
you<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.490> probably<00:01:41.610> use<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.060> other

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you could probably use as with other

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.090 
you could probably use as with other
crates<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.720> other<00:01:42.840> things<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.619> movable

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
crates and other things that are movable

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.200 
crates and other things that are movable
but<00:01:44.280> that's<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> main<00:01:44.610> things<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> has<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
but that's the main things that has to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
but that's the main things that has to
be<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> movable<00:01:45.810> object<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.860> aren't

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
be a movable object and there aren't

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
be a movable object and there aren't
many<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.570> for<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> walls<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.020> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
many of those for the walls you can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.569 
many of those for the walls you can
really<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.470> anything<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:50.009> usually<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> use

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
really do anything I usually like to use

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.969 
really do anything I usually like to use
these<00:01:51.180> pieces<00:01:51.450> though<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.799> all

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
these pieces though because they can all

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
these pieces though because they can all
they<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.460> cover<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.329> they<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.689> also<00:01:54.869> hold

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
they can cover and they can also hold

they can cover and they can also hold
the<00:01:56.240> packing<00:01:57.240> crates<00:01:57.479> you'll<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.020> when

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the packing crates you'll see that when

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
the packing crates you'll see that when
I<00:01:58.200> actually<00:01:58.530> activate<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.159> underneath

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
it has a little ledge that will actually

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.399 
it has a little ledge that will actually
hold<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.799> your<00:02:02.490> crates<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.240> place<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.810> now

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
hold it in your crates in place and now

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
hold it in your crates in place and now
it'll<00:02:04.850> hold<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> doors<00:02:06.210> open<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.719> you

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
can walk over top of them it's kind of
an<00:02:08.610> interesting<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.080> good<00:02:10.200> piece

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
now I think right now looking for

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.240 
now I think right now looking for
shields<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:56.879> I<00:02:57.030> could<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.299> get<00:02:57.450> gadgets<00:02:58.250> come

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
shields if I could we get gadgets come

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
shields if I could we get gadgets come
on<00:02:59.400> big<00:02:59.819> shields<00:03:00.150> yeah<00:03:00.299> there<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.599> go<00:03:00.629> okay<00:03:01.260> so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
on big shields yeah there we go okay so

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.589 
on big shields yeah there we go okay so
this<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.189> very<00:03:02.459> important<00:03:03.150> part<00:03:03.359> not<00:03:03.569> a

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
this is a very important part not a

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.149 
this is a very important part not a
one-way<00:03:03.959> shield<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.560> which<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.829> would<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:04.950> bad

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
one-way shield one which it would be bad

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.640 
one-way shield one which it would be bad
but<00:03:06.060> I've<00:03:06.180> shield<00:03:06.750> or<00:03:06.930> medium<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.470> what<00:03:07.500> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
but I've shield or medium is what I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.470 
but I've shield or medium is what I
usually<00:03:07.859> use<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.579> could<00:03:08.700> probably<00:03:08.879> use<00:03:09.150> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
usually use you could probably use to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.970 
usually use you could probably use to
the<00:03:09.629> other<00:03:09.750> shield<00:03:09.989> doors<00:03:10.109> but<00:03:10.530> usually<00:03:10.950> just

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
the other shield doors but usually just

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.580 
the other shield doors but usually just
use<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.430> medium<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.900> yeah<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.170> want<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.409> place

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
use one medium so yeah you want to place

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.520 
use one medium so yeah you want to place
it<00:03:13.799> right<00:03:14.639> against<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.629> bottom<00:03:16.139> of<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.319> crate

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
it right against the bottom of the crate

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.069 
it right against the bottom of the crate
that<00:03:16.739> way<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.519> explosives<00:03:18.120> don't<00:03:18.269> transfer

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
that way the explosives don't transfer

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.059 
that way the explosives don't transfer
through<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:21.060> shield<00:03:21.299> door<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.859> think

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
through the the shield door and I think

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.110 
through the the shield door and I think
I<00:03:23.160> actually<00:03:23.250> messed<00:03:23.519> up<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.760> too<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> think

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
I actually messed up this too I think

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.780 
I actually messed up this too I think
goes<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.419> little<00:03:24.569> bit<00:03:24.780> too<00:03:25.049> far<00:03:25.440> away<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:26.250> little

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
goes a little bit too far away a little

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.659 
goes a little bit too far away a little
bit<00:03:26.879> too<00:03:27.030> close<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.690> fusion<00:03:28.349> coils<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
bit too close to the fusion coils and I

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:30.710 
bit too close to the fusion coils and I
think<00:03:29.849> that's<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.120> made<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.569> way<00:03:30.659> you

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
think that's what made it that way you

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.539 
think that's what made it that way you
take<00:03:30.959> damage<00:03:31.109> you'll<00:03:31.620> see<00:03:31.799> I'll<00:03:32.220> explain<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
take damage you'll see I'll explain a

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.629 
take damage you'll see I'll explain a
little<00:03:32.639> bit<00:03:32.819> later<00:03:32.879> on<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:34.019> uh<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> yeah<00:03:35.489> I'm

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
little bit later on but uh so yeah I'm

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.009 
little bit later on but uh so yeah I'm
just<00:03:35.790> checking<00:03:35.849> everything<00:03:36.299> over<00:03:36.540> right<00:03:36.690> now

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
just checking everything over right now

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.199 
just checking everything over right now
switching<00:03:37.409> these<00:03:37.530> back<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.829> normal<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.669> now

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
switching these back to normal so now

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.149 
switching these back to normal so now
they're<00:03:39.419> all<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.989> place<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.590> they're<00:03:41.040> all

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
they're all in place and they're all

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.649 
they're all in place and they're all
good<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.609> hopefully<00:03:42.209> I'm<00:03:42.329> not<00:03:42.419> gonna<00:03:42.569> be

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
good and hopefully I'm not gonna be

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.500 
good and hopefully I'm not gonna be
going<00:03:42.900> anywhere<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.729> so<00:03:44.729> now<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:44.909> next<00:03:45.299> part

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
going anywhere and so now that next part

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.089 
going anywhere and so now that next part
is<00:03:45.659> really<00:03:45.930> important<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.590> next<00:03:46.709> part<00:03:46.979> is

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
is really important the next part is

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.559 
is really important the next part is
actually<00:03:47.280> your<00:03:47.609> button<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:48.180> people<00:03:48.449> don't

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
actually your button now people don't

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.210 
actually your button now people don't
really<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.169> well<00:03:49.620> they<00:03:49.799> do<00:03:49.859> know<00:03:50.099> this

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
really know this well they do know this

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.080 
really know this well they do know this
but<00:03:50.370> they<00:03:50.430> haven't<00:03:50.639> really<00:03:50.669> thought<00:03:51.030> about

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
but they haven't really thought about

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.849 
but they haven't really thought about
too<00:03:51.510> much<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.049> is<00:03:52.169> the<00:03:52.440> extraction

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
too much and that is the extraction

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:53.330 
too much and that is the extraction
traits

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
traits

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.399 
traits
now<00:03:53.729> extraction<00:03:54.299> crates<00:03:54.540> are<00:03:54.870> a<00:03:54.930> piece<00:03:55.379> that

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
now extraction crates are a piece that

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.559 
now extraction crates are a piece that
once<00:03:55.919> you<00:03:56.069> hit<00:03:56.280> them<00:03:56.519> they<00:03:56.549> break<00:03:57.060> which<00:03:57.419> is

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
once you hit them they break which is

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.869 
once you hit them they break which is
very<00:03:58.079> interesting<00:03:58.409> so<00:03:58.919> you<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.579> actually<00:03:59.790> use

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
very interesting so you can actually use

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.789 
very interesting so you can actually use
these<00:03:59.970> part<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.329> number<00:04:01.079> different<00:04:01.409> uses

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
these part of the number different uses

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.219 
these part of the number different uses
and<00:04:02.060> what<00:04:03.060> leftover<00:04:03.479> are<00:04:03.629> figured<00:04:03.959> out<00:04:04.079> when

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:04.229 
and what leftover are figured out when

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.080 
and what leftover are figured out when
we<00:04:04.290> were<00:04:04.409> building<00:04:04.650> one<00:04:04.709> of<00:04:04.769> our<00:04:04.949> maps<00:04:05.129> is<00:04:05.400> that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
we were building one of our maps is that

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.909 
we were building one of our maps is that
we<00:04:06.269> can<00:04:06.389> actually<00:04:06.510> use<00:04:06.840> this<00:04:07.109> as<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.440> way<00:04:07.859> to

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
we can actually use this as a way to

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.550 
we can actually use this as a way to
drop<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.549> fusion<00:04:09.090> coil<00:04:09.329> onto<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.720> landmine<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
drop a fusion coil onto a landmine and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.770 
drop a fusion coil onto a landmine and
from<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.579> actually<00:04:11.729> sparked<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.479> chain

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
from that we actually sparked the chain

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.449 
from that we actually sparked the chain
reaction<00:04:13.199> I<00:04:13.349> usually<00:04:13.919> make<00:04:13.979> the<00:04:14.099> attraction

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
reaction I usually make the attraction

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.979 
reaction I usually make the attraction
quite<00:04:14.639> red<00:04:14.819> because<00:04:15.239> who<00:04:15.629> doesn't<00:04:15.780> wanna

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
quite red because who doesn't wanna

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.500 
quite red because who doesn't wanna
press<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.229> big<00:04:16.320> red<00:04:16.380> button<00:04:16.560> like<00:04:17.159> hello<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:18.239> a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
press the big red button like hello so a

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.860 
press the big red button like hello so a
big<00:04:18.810> red<00:04:19.019> button<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.739> blood<00:04:20.549> on<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.729> door<00:04:20.880> the

big red button to blood on the door the
next<00:04:22.049> thing<00:04:22.139> I<00:04:22.169> wanna<00:04:22.349> do<00:04:22.469> is<00:04:22.590> go<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.740> gadgets

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:23.159 
next thing I wanna do is go to gadgets

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.469 
next thing I wanna do is go to gadgets
you<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.340> monitor<00:04:23.490> your<00:04:23.700> explosives<00:04:24.150> new

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
you go monitor your explosives new

a<00:04:27.510> fusion<00:04:27.960> cause<00:04:28.200> we<00:04:28.410> said<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.620> fix<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:28.980> is

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
a fusion cause we said to fix this is

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.440 
a fusion cause we said to fix this is
the<00:04:29.190> only<00:04:29.340> one<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:29.730> should<00:04:29.820> not<00:04:30.060> be<00:04:30.090> set<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
the only one that should not be set to

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.450 
the only one that should not be set to
fixed<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.530> wanna<00:04:31.740> put<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.860> on<00:04:31.980> top<00:04:32.370> of

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
fixed so you wanna put that on top of

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.280 
fixed so you wanna put that on top of
the<00:04:32.550> fusion<00:04:32.760> on<00:04:33.240> top<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.660> extraction

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
the fusion on top of the extraction

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.890 
the fusion on top of the extraction
crate<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.370> after<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.580> got<00:04:35.730> that<00:04:35.940> then<00:04:36.150> okay

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
crate so after you got that then okay

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.000 
crate so after you got that then okay
don't<00:04:37.050> do<00:04:37.140> what<00:04:37.230> I<00:04:37.260> did<00:04:37.380> here<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.740> don't<00:04:37.920> need

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
don't do what I did here you don't need

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.430 
don't do what I did here you don't need
if<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.160> don't<00:04:38.430> need<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.570> need<00:04:39.780> next<00:04:40.230> you

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
if you don't need that you need next you

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.170 
if you don't need that you need next you
need<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.620> get<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.740> landmine<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.970> you<00:04:42.030> get<00:04:42.150> a

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
need to get a landmine so you get a

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.300 
need to get a landmine so you get a
landmine<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:42.840> you<00:04:43.500> want<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:43.710> line<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:43.890> up<00:04:44.100> as

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
landmine and you want to line it up as

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.620 
landmine and you want to line it up as
close<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.640> as<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.820> can<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.330> fusion

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
close to you as you can to that fusion

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.180 
close to you as you can to that fusion
coil<00:04:45.960> without<00:04:46.140> making<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.470> off<00:04:46.710> obviously

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
coil without making it off obviously

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.280 
coil without making it off obviously
then<00:04:47.700> you<00:04:47.730> want<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.000> lower<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.300> so<00:04:49.050> once<00:04:49.230> you

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
then you want to lower it so once you

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.860 
then you want to lower it so once you
lower<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.560> to<00:04:49.830> about<00:04:50.300> no<00:04:51.300> no<00:04:51.540> it's<00:04:51.690> gonna<00:04:51.780> be

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
lower it to about no no it's gonna be

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.260 
lower it to about no no it's gonna be
lower<00:04:52.020> okay<00:04:52.950> about<00:04:53.160> there<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:53.730> should<00:04:53.940> be<00:04:54.120> good

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
lower okay about there I should be good

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.220 
lower okay about there I should be good
set<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.290> fixed<00:04:55.470> obviously<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.880> now<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:58.110> I<00:04:58.200> got

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
set to fixed obviously and now all I got

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.200 
set to fixed obviously and now all I got
to<00:04:58.440> do<00:04:58.500> is<00:04:58.620> create<00:04:58.860> detain<00:04:59.190> reaction<00:04:59.610> now<00:05:00.060> this

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
to do is create detain reaction now this

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.160 
to do is create detain reaction now this
part<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.450> little<00:05:00.510> bit<00:05:00.630> more<00:05:00.780> difficult<00:05:01.050> than

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
part a little bit more difficult than

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.730 
part a little bit more difficult than
you<00:05:01.260> would<00:05:01.350> think

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
you would think

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.650 
you would think
sure<00:05:02.370> you've<00:05:02.580> got<00:05:02.760> crazy<00:05:03.000> chain<00:05:03.270> but<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.540> got

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
sure you've got crazy chain but you got

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.270 
sure you've got crazy chain but you got
to<00:05:03.750> make<00:05:03.810> sure<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.080> explosive<00:05:04.650> comes<00:05:04.920> up<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
to make sure the explosive comes up the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.890 
to make sure the explosive comes up the
middle<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.790> fusion<00:05:06.150> coils<00:05:06.480> otherwise

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
middle of the fusion coils otherwise

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.920 
middle of the fusion coils otherwise
when<00:05:07.500> it<00:05:07.590> activates<00:05:08.100> then<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:09.480> first<00:05:09.750> side

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
when it activates then the first side

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.600 
when it activates then the first side
will<00:05:10.050> blow<00:05:10.260> up<00:05:10.410> first<00:05:10.710> which<00:05:11.070> will<00:05:11.250> make

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
will blow up first which will make

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.880 
will blow up first which will make
everything<00:05:11.880> kind<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.240> go<00:05:12.540> off<00:05:12.720> and<00:05:13.080> wonky<00:05:13.710> and

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
everything kind of go off and wonky and

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.680 
everything kind of go off and wonky and
not<00:05:14.070> work<00:05:14.310> properly<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.000> you<00:05:15.390> want<00:05:15.540> to<00:05:15.600> make

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
not work properly so you want to make

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.210 
not work properly so you want to make
sure<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:15.930> your<00:05:16.080> explosives<00:05:16.740> are<00:05:16.890> set<00:05:16.920> off

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
sure that your explosives are set off

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.860 
sure that your explosives are set off
right<00:05:17.430> in<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.000> middle<00:05:18.210> as<00:05:18.450> you<00:05:18.540> can<00:05:18.630> see<00:05:18.750> I'm

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
right in the middle as you can see I'm

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.060 
right in the middle as you can see I'm
putting<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.170> right<00:05:19.260> in<00:05:19.470> between<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.040> two

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
putting it right in between the two

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.890 
putting it right in between the two
fusion<00:05:20.580> coils<00:05:20.820> that's<00:05:20.970> very<00:05:21.270> important

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
fusion coils that's very important

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.770 
fusion coils that's very important
otherwise<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.770> will<00:05:22.830> not<00:05:22.890> work<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.540> once<00:05:24.690> you

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
otherwise it will not work so once you

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.270 
otherwise it will not work so once you
have<00:05:24.840> those<00:05:25.020> there<00:05:25.260> then<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.830> designs

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
have those there then this designs

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.150 
have those there then this designs
pretty<00:05:26.760> much<00:05:26.940> done<00:05:27.290> it's<00:05:28.290> you<00:05:28.740> know<00:05:28.860> seven

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
pretty much done it's you know seven

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.230 
pretty much done it's you know seven
hundred<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:29.460> thirty-five<00:05:29.730> bucks<00:05:29.940> just<00:05:30.150> for

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
hundred and thirty-five bucks just for

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.060 
hundred and thirty-five bucks just for
the<00:05:30.330> door<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.780> is<00:05:30.900> rather<00:05:31.050> expensive<00:05:31.440> but

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
the door so it is rather expensive but

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.680 
the door so it is rather expensive but
the<00:05:32.580> end<00:05:32.700> result<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.090> think<00:05:33.240> is<00:05:33.300> pretty<00:05:33.450> cool

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
the end result I think is pretty cool

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.510 
the end result I think is pretty cool
like<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:34.470> said<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.860> can<00:05:34.950> modify<00:05:35.130> their<00:05:35.310> shield

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
like I said you can modify their shield

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.760 
like I said you can modify their shield
door<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:36.090> not<00:05:36.240> take<00:05:36.450> damage<00:05:36.600> see<00:05:37.500> when<00:05:37.650> the

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
door to not take damage see when the

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.140 
door to not take damage see when the
extraction<00:05:38.430> crate

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
extraction crate

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.840 
extraction crate
you<00:05:39.690> know<00:05:40.100> disappears<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.400> fusion<00:05:41.580> coil

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
you know disappears and the fusion coil

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.540 
you know disappears and the fusion coil
will<00:05:42.090> fall<00:05:42.750> down<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.950> will<00:05:44.100> set<00:05:44.430> off<00:05:44.460> the

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
will fall down and it will set off the

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.580 
will fall down and it will set off the
chain<00:05:44.790> reaction<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.510> it<00:05:46.020> will<00:05:46.170> allow<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.410> to

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
chain reaction and it will allow you to

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.000 
chain reaction and it will allow you to
walks<00:05:47.310> at<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.580> door<00:05:47.730> seamlessly<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.620> yeah

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
walks at the door seamlessly so yeah

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.290 
walks at the door seamlessly so yeah
that's<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.340> story<00:05:50.640> I<00:05:50.670> hope<00:05:51.060> you<00:05:51.150> guys<00:05:51.240> really
