ah

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.240 

there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.930> palette<00:01:10.140> dial<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> needs<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> go

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
there's a palette dial that needs to go

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640 
there's a palette dial that needs to go
on<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.000> indicate<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> minis<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.230> help

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
on there to indicate the minis to help

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.390 
on there to indicate the minis to help
you<00:01:13.800> setting<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:15.590> if<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.190> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
you setting the time if we look to the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
you setting the time if we look to the
back<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.760> the<00:01:17.880> clock<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:19.260> can<00:01:19.440> see<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
back of the clock you can see the back

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.250 
back of the clock you can see the back
clock<00:01:20.190> by<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> pendulum<00:01:21.210> hangs<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.870> the

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
clock by the pendulum hangs and the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.620 
clock by the pendulum hangs and the
crotch<00:01:22.550> pushes<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.670> pendulum<00:01:24.650> also<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
crotch pushes the pendulum also the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
crotch pushes the pendulum also the
motion<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.170> take<00:01:28.470> off<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.550> comes

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
motion will take off this is what comes

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
motion will take off this is what comes
through<00:01:30.180> usually<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.050> through<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> wall<00:01:31.560> to
