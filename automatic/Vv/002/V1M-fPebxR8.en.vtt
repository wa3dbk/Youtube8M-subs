of the most fascinating aspects of of my

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.650 
of the most fascinating aspects of of my
paths<00:02:00.340> how<00:02:01.440> he<00:02:02.440> could<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:04.210> his<00:02:04.330> comeback

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
paths how he could have his comeback

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.420 
paths how he could have his comeback
after<00:02:04.930> four<00:02:05.170> weeks<00:02:05.380> after<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.950> terrible

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
after four weeks after a terrible

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.880 
after four weeks after a terrible
accident

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
accident

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.030 
accident
and<00:02:08.890> be<00:02:09.670> fourth<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.390> Monza<00:02:11.080> first<00:02:11.770> race<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and be fourth in Monza first race I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.180 
and be fourth in Monza first race I
think<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> biggest<00:02:15.370> challenge<00:02:15.910> really<00:02:16.540> is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
think the biggest challenge really is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.210 
think the biggest challenge really is
trying<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:19.260> recreate<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.680> reasonable

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
trying to recreate on a reasonable

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.700 
trying to recreate on a reasonable
budget<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.940> global<00:02:22.360> nature<00:02:22.540> of<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.350> sport

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
budget the global nature of the sport

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.020 
budget the global nature of the sport
and<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> intensity<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:26.760> we've<00:02:27.760> done<00:02:27.790> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
and the intensity of it we've done is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.240 
and the intensity of it we've done is
realistic<00:02:28.510> as<00:02:28.600> possible<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.170> any<00:02:29.680> maneuvers

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
realistic as possible so any maneuvers

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.010 
realistic as possible so any maneuvers
that<00:02:30.400> look<00:02:30.580> hairy<00:02:30.850> or<00:02:31.060> close<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.630> actually

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
that look hairy or close is actually

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.810 
that look hairy or close is actually
precision<00:02:32.440> driving<00:02:32.680> that's<00:02:32.980> basically<00:02:33.580> what

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
precision driving that's basically what

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.550 
precision driving that's basically what
we<00:02:33.910> do<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:37.510> make<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.930> look<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.260> real<00:02:38.440> as

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
we do we make it look as real as

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.780 
we do we make it look as real as
possible<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.130> only<00:02:39.190> way<00:02:39.460> you<00:02:39.520> can<00:02:39.640> do

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
possible and the only way you can do

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.220 
possible and the only way you can do
that<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.210> get<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.630> close<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.080> have

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that is to get really close and have

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.900 
that is to get really close and have
hair-raising<00:02:41.800> moments<00:02:41.830> otherwise<00:02:42.730> your

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
hair-raising moments otherwise your

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.880 
hair-raising moments otherwise your
audience<00:02:43.180> isn't<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.960> believe<00:02:44.200> how

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
audience isn't going to believe how

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:57.010 
audience isn't going to believe how
exciting<00:02:45.430> for<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.880> was<00:02:46.120> there

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.940 

the<00:02:58.020> hardest<00:02:58.290> thing<00:02:58.350> with<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> swim<00:02:58.740> there's

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the hardest thing with the swim there's
