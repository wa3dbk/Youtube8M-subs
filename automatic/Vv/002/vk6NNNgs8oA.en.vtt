00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.930
 for example, the eight-year-old sebastian 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.670
 from marburg would like to know how 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.689
 High the numbers on the back 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.580
 actually be 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 even the wildest stories 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.779
 given sebastian for example andi 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.330
 gÃ¶rlitz in the season 2006/2007 has times 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 Fighting weight has been his body weight since 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 In 2011, however, the whole thing is limited 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 from number 40 is no longer the next 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590

 he is already very important 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.359
 For one, you have to get away from the max 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.250
 But field players also distinguish from 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.409
 the assistant and the referee 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 This is especially important in terms of color 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.010
 made a clear distinction 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.729

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.920

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.979

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.560
 the stemkeeper and for the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.119

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.470
