00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
on the sparker high-intensity cree

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690 
on the sparker high-intensity cree
flashlight<00:00:10.200> now<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.980> flashlight<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
definitely the brightest that we've ever

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400 
definitely the brightest that we've ever
carried<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.920> 600<00:00:14.910> lumens<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.630> by<00:00:15.870> far<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
carried in 600 lumens so it's by far the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.640 
carried in 600 lumens so it's by far the
brightest<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> quality<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:18.359> is

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
brightest and the quality on here is

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.779 
brightest and the quality on here is
unbelievable<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.070> actually<00:00:20.250> made<00:00:20.580> out<00:00:20.670> of

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
unbelievable it's actually made out of

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
unbelievable it's actually made out of
an<00:00:20.910> aluminum<00:00:21.510> alloy<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.170> makes<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.560> shock

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
an aluminum alloy which makes it shock

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.769 
an aluminum alloy which makes it shock
resistant<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.699> weather<00:00:23.970> resistant<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.660> this

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
resistant and weather resistant so this

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.480 
resistant and weather resistant so this
can<00:00:25.019> get<00:00:25.230> wet<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.529> don't<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> submerge

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
can get wet you don't want to submerge

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
can get wet you don't want to submerge
it<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.269> wet<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.720> function<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
it but a can get wet and function just

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.310 
it but a can get wet and function just
fine<00:00:29.150> and<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.269> tweak<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> flashlight<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.050> to
