grind<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.970> pretty<00:02:41.970> much<00:02:42.180> just<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.540> right

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
grind out pretty much just like right

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.260 
grind out pretty much just like right
here<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.920> pass<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.459> okay<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.000> jump

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
here if they pass it's okay just jump

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.740 
here if they pass it's okay just jump
back<00:02:45.300> going<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.640> again<00:02:48.150> all<00:02:48.510> this

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
back going and you just again all this

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.090 
back going and you just again all this
it's<00:02:49.050> just<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.290> gotta<00:02:49.440> keep<00:02:49.620> killing<00:02:49.950> guys

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
it's just you gotta keep killing guys

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100 
it's just you gotta keep killing guys
gotta<00:02:50.400> keep<00:02:50.610> form<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.180> keep<00:02:51.420> grinding<00:02:51.959> out

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
gotta keep form and keep grinding out

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.050 
gotta keep form and keep grinding out
and<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.590> eventually<00:02:53.010> you're<00:02:53.700> going<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.910> be

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and then eventually you're going to be

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.520 
and then eventually you're going to be
getting<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.390> gram<00:02:54.630> drops<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.200> everything

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
getting in gram drops and everything

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.370 
getting in gram drops and everything
again<00:02:56.160> engrams<00:02:56.640> are<00:02:56.850> random<00:02:57.360> generated<00:02:57.930> drops

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
again engrams are random generated drops

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.990 
again engrams are random generated drops
a<00:02:58.530> lot<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.770> people<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.520> set<00:02:59.850> on<00:02:59.880> a

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
a lot of people think it's set on a

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.570 
a lot of people think it's set on a
timer<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.690> how<00:03:01.050> many<00:03:01.140> kills<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.680> get<00:03:01.860> its

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
timer so how many kills you get its

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.000 
timer so how many kills you get its
again<00:03:03.060> Bungie<00:03:03.660> sits<00:03:03.930> there<00:03:04.110> they<00:03:04.680> said<00:03:04.860> at

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
again Bungie sits there they said at

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
again Bungie sits there they said at
multiple<00:03:05.430> times<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:06.989> random

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
multiple times it's just random

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.990 
multiple times it's just random
generated<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.610> sit<00:03:08.730> there<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.910> play

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
generated you can sit there and play

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.580 
generated you can sit there and play
with<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> newbie<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> he<00:03:10.230> gets<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.560> there
