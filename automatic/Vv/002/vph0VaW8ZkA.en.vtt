Colleen he's got a bit of a different
mind<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:51.010> think<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.640> also<00:02:51.849> mature<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.480> I've<00:02:52.629> got

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
mind I think it also mature but I've got

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.390 
mind I think it also mature but I've got
a<00:02:52.840> feeling<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.500> again<00:02:53.709> this<00:02:53.830> is<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.099> fact

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
a feeling and again this is not fact

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580 
a feeling and again this is not fact
unquote<00:02:54.819> me<00:02:55.000> but<00:02:55.180> just<00:02:55.780> from<00:02:55.959> looking<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.349> at

unquote me but just from looking at at

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.229 
unquote me but just from looking at at

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
line conditions and how they typically

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.960 
line conditions and how they typically
develop<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.500> map<00:02:59.650> offers<00:02:59.980> probably

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
but very slight so I would definitely

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.800 
but very slight so I would definitely

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
now he only quite similar they've also

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.559 
now he only quite similar they've also
got<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.260> similar<00:03:38.650> mine<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> car<00:03:40.359> just

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
got a similar mine in this car just

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.159 
got a similar mine in this car just
ignoring<00:03:40.930> us<00:03:41.250> flat<00:03:42.510> giving<00:03:43.510> us<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> back<00:03:43.930> end

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169

ignoring us flat giving us the back end
view<00:03:44.380> there<00:03:45.220> could<00:03:45.400> very<00:03:45.609> similar<00:03:45.940> mine

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150

developments<00:03:46.840> are<00:03:46.989> partly<00:03:47.919> genetic<00:03:48.430> to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
developments are partly genetic to

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.580 
developments are partly genetic to
answer<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> question<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.169> also<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.530> think

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
answer the question but also I think

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.780 
answer the question but also I think
they're<00:03:50.919> a<00:03:50.950> bit<00:03:51.069> younger<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.549> there<00:03:51.669> would

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
they're a bit younger so there would

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.520 
they're a bit younger so there would
have<00:03:51.819> been<00:03:51.940> cousins<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.569> these<00:03:52.720> three<00:03:53.019> they

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
have been cousins to these three they

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.690 
have been cousins to these three they
would've<00:03:53.709> grown<00:03:53.889> up<00:03:54.130> together<00:03:54.280> they<00:03:54.609> would

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
would've grown up together they would

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.650 
would've grown up together they would
have<00:03:54.760> been<00:03:54.910> kicked<00:03:55.120> out<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.299> the<00:03:55.419> prior

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
have been kicked out of the prior

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.300 
have been kicked out of the prior
together<00:03:56.049> at<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.319> roughly<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.739> age<00:03:56.889> of<00:03:57.040> two

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
together at the roughly the age of two

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.710 
together at the roughly the age of two

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
giving long-winded answers to life but

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.400 
giving long-winded answers to life but
I'm<00:04:19.250> sure<00:04:19.400> they<00:04:19.549> like<00:04:19.730> they<00:04:20.600> trying<00:04:21.139> to<00:04:21.260> better

give<00:04:21.680> you<00:04:21.769> sort<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.100> broad<00:04:22.340> view<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.669> how

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
give you sort of a broad view of how

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.050 
give you sort of a broad view of how
these<00:04:23.090> things<00:04:23.150> work<00:04:23.570> with<00:04:23.780> him<00:04:24.760> those<00:04:25.760> Minds

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
these things work with him those Minds

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.670 
these things work with him those Minds
will<00:04:26.360> thicken<00:04:26.600> up<00:04:26.810> they<00:04:27.260> will<00:04:27.410> still<00:04:27.590> get

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
will thicken up they will still get

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.800 
will thicken up they will still get
thicker<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.160> lusha<00:04:28.370> as<00:04:28.580> they<00:04:28.700> get<00:04:28.820> older<00:04:29.150> but

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
thicker and lusha as they get older but

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.480 
thicker and lusha as they get older but
I<00:04:29.840> do<00:04:29.930> think<00:04:30.260> there's<00:04:30.500> also<00:04:30.710> some<00:04:31.010> genetic

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
I do think there's also some genetic

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.750 
I do think there's also some genetic
link<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.479> that<00:04:32.630> slightly<00:04:32.979> comical<00:04:33.979> mohawk

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
link to that slightly comical mohawk

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.790 
link to that slightly comical mohawk
that<00:04:35.000> they<00:04:35.120> carry<00:04:35.389> but<00:04:35.660> who<00:04:36.080> knows<00:04:36.260> maybe<00:04:36.350> a

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
that they carry but who knows maybe a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.310 
that they carry but who knows maybe a
couple<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.490> generations<00:04:37.850> from<00:04:38.150> now<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:39.080> see<00:04:39.290> a

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
couple of generations from now we see a

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.840 
couple of generations from now we see a
lot<00:04:39.590> of<00:04:39.680> other<00:04:39.860> lines<00:04:40.130> running<00:04:40.400> around<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.790> the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
lot of other lines running around in the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.330 
lot of other lines running around in the
same<00:04:41.060> way<00:04:41.210> I<00:04:41.240> do<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.389> it's<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:42.979> bit<00:04:43.220> of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
same way I do and it's is a bit of

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.889 
same way I do and it's is a bit of
genetic<00:04:44.030> history<00:04:44.389> behind<00:04:44.540> it<00:04:45.550> yeah<00:04:47.889> Coleen
