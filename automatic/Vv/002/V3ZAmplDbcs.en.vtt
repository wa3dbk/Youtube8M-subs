00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have the the on/off switch bypass for

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.300 
have the the on/off switch bypass for
this<00:01:47.540> but<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:48.659> got<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.560> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this but I've got one you can have it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.810 
this but I've got one you can have it's
just<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.450> would<00:01:51.630> attach<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> as

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
just it would attach right there so as

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.200 
just it would attach right there so as
soon<00:01:53.939> as<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.149> plug<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.509> its<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:56.210> on/off

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
soon as you plug it in its on on/off

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.270 
soon as you plug it in its on on/off
switch<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.840> useless<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.469> because

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
switch is kind of useless really because

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
switch is kind of useless really because
most<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> time<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:00.719> soon<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.110> you

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
most of the time you just as soon as you

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.240 
most of the time you just as soon as you
plug<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:02.189> want<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.549> anyway

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.170 

you<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.460> off<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.760> ground<00:02:11.820> yeah<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:12.880> works

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you just off the ground yeah it works

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.610 
you just off the ground yeah it works
fine<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.660> only<00:02:16.720> complaint<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.530> even

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
fine about the only complaint I can even

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.740 
fine about the only complaint I can even
think<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.460> you're<00:02:19.240> driving<00:02:19.540> down<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
think of is that you're driving down the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.900 
think of is that you're driving down the
road<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.260> steering<00:02:20.590> may<00:02:21.550> or<00:02:21.700> may<00:02:21.880> not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
road and the steering may or may not

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.350 
road and the steering may or may not
exactly<00:02:22.600> Center<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.070> trim<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.330> uh

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
exactly Center which you can trim but uh

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.290
