haha
but<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.410> like<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> teacher<00:02:09.280> that<00:02:09.490> may<00:02:09.820> have

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
but so like the teacher that may have

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.640 
but so like the teacher that may have
been<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.330> little<00:02:10.570> bit<00:02:10.780> hard<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.020> deal<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:11.470> was

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
been a little bit hard to deal with was

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.140 
been a little bit hard to deal with was
a<00:02:11.680> little<00:02:11.980> bit<00:02:12.100> nicer<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.790> think<00:02:15.850> there<00:02:16.090> were

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
a little bit nicer so I think there were

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.750 
a little bit nicer so I think there were
some<00:02:16.270> advantages<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.320> kids<00:02:17.500> took<00:02:17.650> during<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
some advantages the kids took during the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820 
some advantages the kids took during the
week<00:02:18.910> but<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.270> was<00:02:19.570> they<00:02:19.959> just<00:02:20.200> had<00:02:20.320> smiles<00:02:20.620> on

week but it was they just had smiles on

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.650 
week but it was they just had smiles on
their<00:02:20.920> faces<00:02:21.130> where<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.360> was<00:02:22.480> one

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660
