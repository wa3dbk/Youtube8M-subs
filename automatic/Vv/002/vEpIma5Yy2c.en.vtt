00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
get your level up to five you got to

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.660 
get your level up to five you got to
spend<00:02:24.350> more<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.710> more<00:02:24.860> speech<00:02:25.220> points<00:02:25.550> in

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
spend more and more speech points in

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
spend more and more speech points in
between<00:02:25.760> each<00:02:26.120> level<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.380> get<00:02:27.560> speed

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
between each level and to get speed

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.960 
between each level and to get speed
points<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:28.400> that's<00:02:28.550> pretty<00:02:28.700> much<00:02:28.820> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
points but that's pretty much the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.500 
points but that's pretty much the
currency<00:02:29.570> used<00:02:29.900> within<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.530> game<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.580> get

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
performance as well now to get speed

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.690 
performance as well now to get speed
points<00:02:39.110> pretty<00:02:39.350> much<00:02:39.530> play<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.190> game<00:02:40.430> to

speed points and you can get more and
more<00:02:45.680> speed<00:02:46.010> points<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.550> more<00:02:46.580> insane<00:02:47.270> crazy

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
more speed points the more insane crazy

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.050 
more speed points the more insane crazy
stuff<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.290> get<00:02:48.470> into<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.580> get<00:02:49.760> into<00:02:49.910> a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
stuff you get into so if you get into a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.110 
stuff you get into so if you get into a
really<00:02:50.330> really<00:02:50.540> high<00:02:50.840> sort<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.380> heat<00:02:52.100> chase<00:02:52.400> by

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
really really high sort of heat chase by

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.450 
really really high sort of heat chase by
the<00:02:53.180> cops<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.560> sort<00:02:54.740> of<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.920> heat<00:02:55.130> level

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
the cops that is sort of the heat level

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.710 
the cops that is sort of the heat level
which<00:02:55.550> I'll<00:02:55.700> explain<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> further

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
which I'll explain and the further

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.000 
which I'll explain and the further
videos<00:02:56.990> coming<00:02:57.500> up<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:59.090> get<00:02:59.500> x<00:03:00.500> multiplied

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
videos coming up you get x multiplied

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.340 
videos coming up you get x multiplied
increases<00:03:01.580> basically<00:03:02.360> meaning<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.020> get<00:03:03.170> more

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
increases basically meaning you get more

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.950 
increases basically meaning you get more
and<00:03:03.410> more<00:03:03.560> speed<00:03:04.070> points<00:03:04.490> as<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.060> do<00:03:05.270> more

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
and more speed points as you do more

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.630 
and more speed points as you do more
intense<00:03:06.320> stuff<00:03:06.590> where<00:03:06.860> you're<00:03:06.980> vulnerable<00:03:07.130> to

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
intense stuff where you're vulnerable to

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.160 
intense stuff where you're vulnerable to
getting<00:03:07.670> busted<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.660> if<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> do<00:03:08.960> end<00:03:09.110> up

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
getting busted and if you do end up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.630 
getting busted and if you do end up
getting<00:03:09.440> busted<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:09.890> lose<00:03:10.100> only<00:03:10.400> speed

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
getting busted you lose only speed

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.570 
getting busted you lose only speed
points<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:11.210> be<00:03:11.780> careful<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.400> hey

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
points so be careful of that but hey

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.580 
points so be careful of that but hey
speed<00:03:14.330> points<00:03:14.720> are<00:03:14.840> pretty<00:03:14.990> much<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.410> main

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
speed points are pretty much the main

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.740 
speed points are pretty much the main
target<00:03:16.070> here<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.370> multiplayer<00:03:16.850> which<00:03:17.600> you

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
target here on multiplayer which you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.420 
target here on multiplayer which you
would<00:03:17.870> get<00:03:18.020> from<00:03:18.200> doing<00:03:18.320> anything<00:03:18.890> really<00:03:19.220> as

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
would get from doing anything really as

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000 
would get from doing anything really as
I've<00:03:19.580> said<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.170> you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.380> use<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.800> to

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
I've said and then you can use that to

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.430 
I've said and then you can use that to
upgrade<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.000> parts<00:03:23.270> of<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.450> car<00:03:23.630> now<00:03:23.810> for<00:03:24.050> if

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
a multiplier for Speed points so the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.520 
a multiplier for Speed points so the
