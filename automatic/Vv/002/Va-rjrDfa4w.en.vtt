00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.429
 to my channel today i 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 share a recipe for cooking pancakes 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.550
 on milk 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.120
 my mother always cooked such pancakes 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.640
 very tasty thin pancakes always 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.539
 I get them done with different fillings 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.439
 and now tell you how I prepare the dough 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.740
 half a liter of milk 2 eggs salt sugar flour 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 vanilla sugar or vanilla to 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 baking powder or soda 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 but it is not necessary to proceed 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.430
 cooking dough first break 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430
 two eggs 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.540
 add there 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.810
 bags 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.150
 Today I will have pancakes sweet then 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.570
 have my family always love very much 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.530
 sweet pancakes usually go two or three 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 spoons of sugar 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:08.700
 in the distance of the war to the feet the speaker is mixing now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.330
 add vanilla sugar 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:17.140
 if you have unsweetened pancakes and ordinary 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.600
 for fillings like cabbage meat mushrooms 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.750
 and torso bury not of course add 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.360
 unnecessary and a little bit of baking powder 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.009
 I usually do not always add it but advice 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.500
 Now you are advised to add 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.770
 now i'll start adding flour need flour 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.660
 so much so that the dough was as thicker 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 of milk 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.130
 so far i have taken 200 grams of flour 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.250
 my flour is surely sifted 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.090
 first i stir the flour and make the dough 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.630
 thick and then I will dilute it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.630
 granddaughter 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 so I took another 200 grams sifted 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.370
 flour will quietly add 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.940
 but 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.530
 he and Malakut 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.520
 the dough should be well stirred so as not to 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:29.180
 there were no lumps in there yet 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:32.210
 add 4 spoons of sunflower oil on 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.840
 half a liter of milk I took flour 300 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.720
 tap about now the dough need 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.390
 leave for half an hour to stand 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.670
 and as they say to all 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.220
 the ingredients we mix here 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.380
 make friends with each other and make pancakes 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.380
 turned out to be cool places 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.830
 half an hour has passed dough for pancakes 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.460
 stood here like that 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.740
 top condition response to such droplets 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.740
 sunflower oil it will give 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.660
 the pan is set on fire 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.530
 Here is such a pancake and it should be good 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:25.350
 heat it with a little grease 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:27.530
 sunny oil pouring incomplete disgrace 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:39.590
 Nicky so the pancake was thin 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:56.460
 distribute it fried first side 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:59.040
 pancake is fried very quickly when frying 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.640
 the following pancakes with sunflower oil 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.640
 can not add 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:17.589
 and on top fried pancakes need 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:20.699
 a piece of butter then they will 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.699
 much tastier 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.300
 but 

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:50.789
 pancakes are sweet for sweet fillings 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:55.469
 from this amount of dough I have 

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:58.099
 it turned out 15 pieces they turn out here 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:58.099
 such here 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:04.969
 Have a nice tea party for now 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.149
