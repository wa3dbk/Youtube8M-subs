00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
there's actually a lot of like tire
pressure<00:01:35.189> changing<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:36.060> diff<00:01:36.540> changing<00:01:36.840> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
pressure changing your diff changing to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
pressure changing your diff changing to
Canberra<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> wheels<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.820> you're<00:01:38.939> doing

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
Canberra the wheels so when you're doing

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.940 
Canberra the wheels so when you're doing
that<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> sort<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> changes<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that it can that sort of changes the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859 
that it can that sort of changes the
overall<00:01:40.979> thing<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.549> well<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
overall thing as well as but if you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.179 
overall thing as well as but if you
don't<00:01:43.049> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.070> on

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
don't want to do that you can just go on

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.350 
don't want to do that you can just go on
top<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> somebody<00:01:45.270> who

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
top and I actually think I somebody who

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.789 
top and I actually think I somebody who
like<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.689> play<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> breath<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> Isle<00:01:46.680> of

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
like I play the breath of the Isle of

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.170 
like I play the breath of the Isle of
burnout<00:01:47.100> paradise<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:47.850> play

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
burnout paradise but then they also play

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240 
burnout paradise but then they also play
games<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.930> know<00:01:49.079> project<00:01:49.829> cars<00:01:50.009> I

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
games like you know project cars I

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.620 
games like you know project cars I
actually<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.240> neat<00:01:51.450> system

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
actually think it's a pretty neat system

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
actually think it's a pretty neat system
like<00:01:51.869> how<00:01:52.049> much<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.619> actually<00:01:52.740> affects<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
like how much it actually affects the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.480 
like how much it actually affects the
grip<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.720> rip<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.310> questionable<00:01:56.310> and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
grip and rip is questionable and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.069 
grip and rip is questionable and
actually<00:01:56.790> play<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.210> game<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.810> tell

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
actually play this game so I can tell

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
actually play this game so I can tell
how<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.320> feels<00:01:58.530> but<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> thought<00:01:59.280> from<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.700> purely

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
how it feels but I thought from a purely

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.780 
how it feels but I thought from a purely
trying<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.979> game<00:02:02.189> good<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.670> people

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
trying to make this game good for people

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.490 
trying to make this game good for people
who<00:02:03.000> want<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.360> tweak<00:02:03.570> everything<00:02:04.049> down<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
who want to tweak everything down to the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
who want to tweak everything down to the
factory<00:02:04.680> like<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.399> like<00:02:05.520> change<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
factory like you can like change the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
factory like you can like change the
rear<00:02:06.659> rims<00:02:06.869> against<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.649> front<00:02:07.860> rims<00:02:08.160> which

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
rear rims against the front rims which

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
rear rims against the front rims which
apparently<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.879> new<00:02:09.300> fad<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.840> happening

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
apparently is a new fad that's happening

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.320 
apparently is a new fad that's happening
right<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.560> car<00:02:10.860> customization<00:02:11.580> at<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
right now in car customization at you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.470 
right now in car customization at you
can<00:02:12.480> also<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.900> go

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
can also just go

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.729 
can also just go
whatever<00:02:13.659> I'll<00:02:13.959> just<00:02:14.019> want<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.440> drift

whatever I'll just want like a drift

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.250 
whatever I'll just want like a drift
machine<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.819> it's<00:02:15.940> red<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:16.989> pretty<00:02:17.080> cool

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
machine and it's red so it's pretty cool

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.289

scalable I heard you talking about the

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.030 
scalable I heard you talking about the
game's<00:02:19.450> icons<00:02:19.959> i<00:02:20.170> take<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:20.709> look

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
game's icons i take it that they look

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.490 
game's icons i take it that they look
really<00:02:21.190> nice<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.819> very<00:02:21.970> pretty<00:02:22.269> no<00:02:22.989> I've

really nice now and very pretty no I've
decided<00:02:23.830> at<00:02:24.010> them<00:02:24.099> he's<00:02:24.250> like<00:02:24.400> check<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
decided at them he's like check out the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.059 
decided at them he's like check out the
icons<00:02:25.750> somewhere<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.319> yeah<00:02:26.500> it's<00:02:26.650> a<00:02:26.709> menu

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
icons somewhere like yeah it's a menu

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.220 
icons somewhere like yeah it's a menu
for<00:02:27.310> racing<00:02:27.819> day<00:02:27.940> what<00:02:28.780> what's<00:02:28.989> going<00:02:29.170> on

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
for racing day what what's going on

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.140 
for racing day what what's going on
behind<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.099> television<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.120> a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
behind the television there was like a

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.110 
behind the television there was like a
fixture<00:02:31.390> ken<00:02:31.660> block<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.140> some<00:02:32.560> other

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
fixture ken block and some other

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.990 
fixture ken block and some other
gentleman<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.510> iconic<00:02:35.049> people<00:02:35.560> within<00:02:36.000> racing

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
gentleman so iconic people within racing

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.210 
gentleman so iconic people within racing
so<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.750> guess<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.140> game<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.560> split<00:02:38.950> into

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
so I guess the game is like split into

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.759 
so I guess the game is like split into
different<00:02:39.250> tiers<00:02:40.209> of<00:02:40.360> racing<00:02:41.079> from<00:02:41.319> like<00:02:41.560> you

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
different tiers of racing from like you

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.160 
different tiers of racing from like you
know<00:02:42.060> drifting<00:02:43.060> with<00:02:43.239> like<00:02:43.390> ken<00:02:43.599> Block<00:02:43.900> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
know drifting with like ken Block to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.080 
know drifting with like ken Block to
like<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.769> know<00:02:44.799> really<00:02:45.099> tuning<00:02:45.640> your<00:02:45.730> car<00:02:46.060> a

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
like you know really tuning your car a

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.910 
like you know really tuning your car a
lot<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.750> mission<00:02:46.959> structure<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.680> done

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
lot and the mission structure is done

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.009 
lot and the mission structure is done
that<00:02:48.190> way<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.760> you'll<00:02:48.849> get<00:02:48.940> phone<00:02:49.180> calls<00:02:49.209> while

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
that way so you'll get phone calls while

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.270 
that way so you'll get phone calls while
you're<00:02:50.140> driving<00:02:50.470> around<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:50.950> random

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
missions you guys like random drivers

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.780 
missions you guys like random drivers
coming<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.799> like<00:02:54.010> trying<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.340> chase<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.760> and

every time you go into one of those your

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.170 
every time you go into one of those your
