00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.349
 what's up people are going to teach what is my 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.959
 favorite trick in the subject I like 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.260
 I hope to do it can be extended 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:20.660
 you want and have some reactions 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.660
 tremendous we have here is 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.360
 whale has letters inside but of 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.300
 moment we leave 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.280
 You are going to tell me a letter that you 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 want 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.750
 let's say the 3 of diamonds 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.400
 and if I tell you that the 3 of diamonds 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 is here turned around because I 've 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.750
 I read the mind before and I knew I was going to 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 choose that let's see what diamond 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.620
 to remove them 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.340
 three diamond diamonds 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.940
 and we have the 3 diamond well 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.430
 you do not know this deck or if you do not know 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.740
 the trick 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.740
 the trick is called the invisible deck 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 because as more he does in public and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.170
 answering is obviously 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.350
 I take this I stay for me as it is 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.920
 with the cards in the deck and them 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.040
 I give you this deck 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.040
 it's not a game 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.439
 and they are doing what you say 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.789
 says come shuffle the cards if you want 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.770
 Choose a letter to the letter that you most 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:56.390
 like to turn it around and tell me wallet and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.370
 if I tell you that that letter is there 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 turned around then and goes through the 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:09.140
 for the cards and this is the turn 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.050
 as it is done with the deck that comes what 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.210
 I have here 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.410
 how it looks 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.550
 and tone 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.830
 instructions when throwing 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.090
 of how to use it but the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.760
 the letter are stuck from behind or either 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.970
 have a 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.569
 a special thing from a spray of some 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.260
 I do not remember that guy was 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.670
 but while if you pass slightly by 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.999
 here 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.700
 you do not notice that there are two letters but if 

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:49.550
 you squeeze a little 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.650
 Well yes it shows 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.730
 and the way to know where each is 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.960
 letter well then I always have the 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.560
 energy letter so let's go on this side 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.470
 all pairs are valid and in others 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.270
 sides so odd and I always have 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.270
 the pairs towards this side 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:21.740
 you have to 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.860
 that your subtract the number that you have 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.100
 said of 13 for example 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.140
 He said 3 to 3 of diamonds as 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.590
 three minus 13 are 10 so I've 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:38.790
 had to look here for the 10 of clubs 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.599
 and I look for them separated there and I have the 3 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.299
 how it goes against the sticks, look like 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.879
 the hearts looks a bit like the 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:53.120
 picas because heart is always stuck with 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:58.549
 picas vale and those that remain then the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.549
 Shamrocks are stuck with diamond vale 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.200
 the letter 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:12.170
 is the lackey j and the k 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:15.650
 the j is 11 the vat of 12 and the cause 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.079
 the king is worth 13 salt the kings always 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.739
 they are glued to each other by it 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.739
 add up 13 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.840
 in the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.390
 the queens are glued with the gases 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.090
 how is one worth and the jack goes to employees 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.990
 with the twelve 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.320
 with 0-3 and then the others and 10 goes 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:42.500
 with 3 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:46.160
 in the 4 of the pib clover stuck with the 9 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:52.540
 of diamonds the 8 diamond is stuck 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.540
 with the 5 of clubs and so on 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.840
 a super simple trick to do the only thing 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:06.330
 you need this deck but it's very 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.330
 cheap to buy osa osa 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.300
 whatever my name is in the united states and 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.330
 I was worth every one I bought and more 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.820
 valuable 6 dollars or 2 has been a thing 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.409
 for five euros 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.589
 I'll leave a link 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:26.289
 of a page I do not know if you will know it 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:29.739
 called amazon and there I will be able to 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.529
 find a multitude of things not only from 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:36.399
 letters but of the entire book movies 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:39.210
 music small appliances mp3 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:44.270
 ipod wishes 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:47.310
 and nothing tell me what you thought if 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.150
 have you seen any physical store in 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.380
 madrid where 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.300
 where they sell it tell me and that I 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.140
 I would also like to take a look at 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.190
