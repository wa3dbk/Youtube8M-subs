00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello, I am Alla Martyanova and closing 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.110
 we have only an hour left from the club 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.660
 today's training I want to devote 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.789
 everyone who has absolutely no time 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.550
 what to train as well as all those who 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.860
 considers the absence of time to be respectful 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.290
 reasons for shirking training 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.930
 how much time do we still need 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.260
 in order to work on yourself for 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.780
 order to kill all your quality 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.890
 muscle groups 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.050
 should we spend an hour in the hall 23 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.960
 many think someone thinks they need 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.420
 generally settle here without leaving at all 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 and the more and longer we train in order 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.590
 better result is this why am I 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.350
 decided to talk on this topic is not easy 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.200
 so I personally went through it all to me 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.210
 of course lucky a little more I was 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.140
 office workers where I worked in the hall 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.770
 and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.600
 my working day lasted 13 hours me too 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.670
 I was tired too, were serious 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.559
 emotional stress but then 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.630
 finishing work yes I have left as 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.270
 once again about 40 minutes to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.250
 be able to work on yourself in order 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.549
 to have time to practice it 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.740
 did today i won't take you away 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.750
 a lot of time therefore I propose immediately 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.549
 get down to business at this training session we 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 we will try the highest quality 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.409
 work chest shoulders 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.790
 as in many exercises on the chest 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.010
 we use 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.930
 deltoids and also particularly 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.020
 front bundle until the summer of prominent muscles then 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.670
 we will not be long enough 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.960
 amount of time to spend on yourself 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.760
 training in order to maximize 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.560
 tire our muscle groups 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.930
 but in any case we will not regret 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 this time to warm up on cardio 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.540
 warm up 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.570
 five minutes will be quite ordinary 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.450
 warm up on a sticker and since today 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.840
 we work the upper body and I 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.840
 take in hand 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.649
 everything 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.110
 today we will begin our workout with the bench 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.970
 rods lying but we will not just squeeze 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.290
 we will do this exercise in 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 superset with the thrust rod to the chin 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.300
 will kill and chest will kill and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.850
 shoulders so like the front beams bench press 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.360
 the delta is also very actively tense 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 they already have to be loaded and the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.830
 most we will achieve them precisely the rod 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.610
 chin, we warmed up and proceed to 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.310
 We 'll do the main work with a bench press. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.070
 weight 30 kilogram 10 12 reps and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.660
 then immediately proceed to the barbell to 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.230
 chin also do the same amount 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.230
 repetitions 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.510
 during the approaches we try not to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.490
 rest as we have no time 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.770
 maxim that we can afford it 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.200
 look at whether time is closing 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.200
 still a club or have time to go for some water 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.500
 fine i already feel pectoral 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.200
 already feel the shoulders have passed just 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.010
 fifteen minutes I want to say a 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.930
 less dangles 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.790
 probably train more intensively in 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.710
 this whole table to not stand on one 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.200
 workouts try to work everything out 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.800
 right away we're not trying yes there 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.780
 let's sit down at lunch and immediately all 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.730
 the reserves for the week are probably the same 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.760
 concerns and trainings worth sharing 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.430
 muscle groups to train no more 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 two muscle groups on the same day and order 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.840
 most will seek maximum 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.560
 results so training after 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.960
 so serious before work day after 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.120
 such emotional stress is she like 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.310
 since it allows us to produce 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.200
 endorphins after this i'm coming back 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.480
 always returned home happy and 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.970
 happy and cheerful even no longer remembered 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.420
 tom what opportunity stress i experienced 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.230
 at work the next set will be several 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.430
 unusual we begin we smear dumbbells sitting on 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:19.650
 bench will gradually be the slope of the bench 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:20.780
 lower but i'm not to blame this bench for 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.890
 what are we doing this 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.500
 initially up to work 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.080
 as much as possible shoulders exactly 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.630
 deltoid muscles then turn on work 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.390
 upper chest and shift the focus on the chest 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:40.440
 entirely and doing the first approach 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:44.310
 approximately 12 14 times we do next 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.590
 lower the bench 45 degrees right away 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.860
 without rest we carry out the following approach 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.870
 we immediately lower the same scales 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.050
 the bench is completely horizontal 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.240
 and also continue to do 12 14 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.740
 just like at the beginning of the workout we are not 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.840
 sorry for the warm-up 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.270
 I also recommend not regretting it at the end. 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.770
 workouts to stretch our 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.810
 already removed muscles 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:15.500
 I like to stretch in the upper 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:17.449
 block we put weight or slightly less than its 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.879
 own or equal 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:25.610
 own excellent someone already 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:28.150
 prepared we take a narrow grip just 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.150
 hang 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.830
 if after watching this video you 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.979
 still can not find his tight 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.320
 schedule a little time for training then 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.660
 I recommend starting now 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.789
 to study time management like this 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.860
 there are a couple of great books contact me 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.840
 VKontakte on the advice and completion of want 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.699
 say plan your day not 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.710
 forget to include it not training 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.820
 waste time subscribe to ours 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.620
 channel put likes 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.570
 videos on fitness and comes out every 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.660
 monday and thursday all great 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.660
 moods 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:11.470
 of course more girls were engaged 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.660
 sport and this stereotype is already 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.570
 like sti so that it quits because it 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.620
 all that's not true, I for his example 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.900
 even I know I'll look mean moving 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.820
 yourself much more feminine than 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.210
 formerly first self confidence 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.210
 to manifest
