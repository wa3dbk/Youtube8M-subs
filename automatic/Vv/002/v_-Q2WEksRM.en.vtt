pallets<00:00:20.340> are<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.640> commonly<00:00:21.119> obtained<00:00:21.600> at

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
pallets are very commonly obtained at

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.040 
pallets are very commonly obtained at
log<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.439> garden<00:00:22.859> centers<00:00:23.340> or<00:00:24.050> hardware

perhaps if you have obtained large items

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.000 
perhaps if you have obtained large items
they<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.059> come<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> pallet<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.559> pallets

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
they have come on a pallet so pallets

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
they have come on a pallet so pallets
are<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.309> easy<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.910> obtain<00:00:41.690> it's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> very

what<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.190> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.489> do<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.120> sure<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
what you want to do is make sure all of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.350 
what you want to do is make sure all of
the<00:00:48.840> nails<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.530> pallet<00:00:50.039> run<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> back<00:00:50.760> are

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the nails on the pallet run it back are

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
the nails on the pallet run it back are
security<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.350> hammer<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.800> into<00:00:52.949> place<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
security just hammer them into place and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.979 
security just hammer them into place and
then<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.270> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.780> sandpaper<00:00:56.989> smooth

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
then you want to take sandpaper smooth

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.770 
then you want to take sandpaper smooth

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
it out particularly the section between

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.939 
it out particularly the section between
having<00:01:03.780> done<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> front<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.920> the

having done that on the front in the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.070 
having done that on the front in the
back<00:01:05.159> now<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> were<00:01:05.850> ready<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> enclose<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
back now you were ready to enclose the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.700 
back now you were ready to enclose the
pallet<00:01:07.470> now<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> pallet<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.229> one<00:01:10.229> by<00:01:10.380> fours

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
pallet now the pallet has one by fours

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.179 
pallet now the pallet has one by fours
on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.729> front<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> back

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
on the front and on the back

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
on the front and on the back
generally<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> pallet<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.810> backside<00:01:16.290> as

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
generally a pallet on the backside as

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.450 
generally a pallet on the backside as
fewer<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:18.000> by<00:01:18.150> fours<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.290> has<00:01:19.500> four<00:01:20.310> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
fewer one by fours this one has four of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.510 
fewer one by fours this one has four of
them<00:01:20.670> with<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.540> an<00:01:21.840> 8<00:01:22.140> inch<00:01:22.409> gap<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.070> between

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
them with about an 8 inch gap in between

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
them with about an 8 inch gap in between
so<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.850> need<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.180> close<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> gap<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.229> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so we need to close up the gap and in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
so we need to close up the gap and in
doing<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.210> what<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.360> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> obtain<00:01:27.840> is

the<00:01:54.780> landscape<00:01:55.229> fabric<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:56.159> place<00:01:56.579> I've<00:01:57.119> also

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the landscape fabric in place I've also

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.319 
the landscape fabric in place I've also
attached<00:01:57.960> chicken<00:01:58.890> wire<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.430> I've<00:01:59.939> done<00:02:00.180> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
attached chicken wire and I've done that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.139 
attached chicken wire and I've done that
using<00:02:00.840> poultry<00:02:01.770> staples<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.610> are<00:02:02.759> larger

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
using poultry staples which are larger

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.780 
using poultry staples which are larger
staples<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.049> basically<00:02:04.490> nail<00:02:05.490> these

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
staples so you just basically nail these

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.880 
staples so you just basically nail these
into<00:02:06.270> place

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
into place

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.029

plant it can either be planted in a
vertical<00:02:13.170> fashion<00:02:13.700> let's<00:02:14.700> say<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> lean<00:02:15.240> up

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
vertical fashion let's say to lean up

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
vertical fashion let's say to lean up
