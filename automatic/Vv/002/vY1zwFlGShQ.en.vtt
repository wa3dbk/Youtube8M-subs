hello<00:00:01.079> everyone<00:00:01.380> today's<00:00:01.680> question<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.129> on

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hello everyone today's question I'm on

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.420 
hello everyone today's question I'm on
the<00:00:02.310> answer<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:03.049> why<00:00:04.049> do<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.740> need<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> calorie

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the answer is why do we need a calorie

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.430 
the answer is why do we need a calorie
surplus<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:06.089> order<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> gain<00:00:06.540> muscle<00:00:06.810> isn't

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
surplus in order to gain muscle isn't

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.520 
surplus in order to gain muscle isn't
eating<00:00:08.069> enough<00:00:08.280> protein<00:00:08.599> enough<00:00:09.599> because

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
eating enough protein enough because

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.499 
eating enough protein enough because
protein<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.670> building<00:00:11.759> block<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
protein is the building block for a

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.060 
protein is the building block for a
muscle<00:00:12.900> from<00:00:13.139> which<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.710> know<00:00:13.830> new

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
muscle from which you know new

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.980 
muscle from which you know new
sarcomeres<00:00:14.639> new<00:00:14.910> contractile<00:00:15.450> units<00:00:15.870> are

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
sarcomeres new contractile units are

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.019 
sarcomeres new contractile units are
built<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> isn't<00:00:16.920> just<00:00:17.130> eating<00:00:17.820> enough

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
built so this isn't just eating enough

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.450 
built so this isn't just eating enough
protein<00:00:18.140> enough<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.529> let's<00:00:19.740> say<00:00:19.859> everyday<00:00:20.340> I'm

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
protein enough so let's say everyday I'm

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.359 
protein enough so let's say everyday I'm
gonna<00:00:20.609> eat<00:00:20.900> 150<00:00:21.900> grams<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.350> 160<00:00:23.010> grams<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
gonna eat 150 grams or 160 grams of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.009 
gonna eat 150 grams or 160 grams of
protein<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.240> be<00:00:24.390> enough<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.779> gain

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
protein would that be enough to gain

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.070 
protein would that be enough to gain
muscle<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:26.449> why<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.900> need<00:00:28.019> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
muscle or why is it that I need a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.070 
muscle or why is it that I need a
calorie<00:00:28.769> surplus<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.429> that's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> very<00:00:30.449> deep

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
calorie surplus well that's a very deep

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.420 
calorie surplus well that's a very deep
question<00:00:31.320> if<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.859> want<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> go<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
question if we want to go on the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
question if we want to go on the
molecular<00:00:32.669> level<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:34.260> I'll<00:00:34.410> try<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> give<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
molecular level but I'll try to give you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.020 
molecular level but I'll try to give you
an<00:00:35.309> overview<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.820> this<00:00:36.059> question<00:00:36.719> my

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
an overview of this question my

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.510 
an overview of this question my
professor<00:00:39.030> Brian<00:00:39.329> Phillips<00:00:40.280> from<00:00:41.280> online

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
professor Brian Phillips from online

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.280 
professor Brian Phillips from online
that<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> met<00:00:42.300> helped<00:00:42.840> me<00:00:42.930> out<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.230> one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
that I met helped me out with this one

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.080 
that I met helped me out with this one
so<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> comes<00:00:45.059> our<00:00:45.480> body<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> huge

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
so here it comes our body is a huge

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.930 
so here it comes our body is a huge
machine<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.899> huge<00:00:49.200> machine<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
machine it's a huge machine and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.430 
machine it's a huge machine and
everything<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> body<00:00:51.390> body<00:00:51.930> requires

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
everything in that body body requires

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.340 
everything in that body body requires
energy<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.579> energy<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.149> sugar<00:00:54.539> glucose<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
energy that energy is sugar glucose and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.160 
energy that energy is sugar glucose and
any<00:00:55.590> kind<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> want<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.280> call<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
any kind you want to call it and in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
any kind you want to call it and in
order<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.890> our<00:00:58.920> body<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.489> work<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.940> function

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
order for our body to work and function

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
order for our body to work and function
every<00:01:00.570> day<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> baseball<00:01:01.230> basal

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
every day we have a baseball basal

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.229 
every day we have a baseball basal
metabolic<00:01:02.100> rate<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.820> that's<00:01:03.000> how<00:01:03.090> much

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
metabolic rate so that's how much

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.050 
metabolic rate so that's how much
calories<00:01:03.570> our<00:01:03.899> body<00:01:04.080> uses<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.680> digest<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
calories our body uses to digest to to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
calories our body uses to digest to to
you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> breathe<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.920> transport<00:01:08.700> blood

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
you know to breathe to transport blood

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
you know to breathe to transport blood
all<00:01:09.299> over<00:01:09.330> our<00:01:09.630> body<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.590> everything<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
all over our body to do everything to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030 
all over our body to do everything to
move<00:01:11.490> around<00:01:11.689> every<00:01:12.689> single<00:01:13.080> gram<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.530> muscle

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
move around every single gram of muscle

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
move around every single gram of muscle
on<00:01:14.549> our<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.119> our<00:01:15.150> body<00:01:15.509> every<00:01:15.810> single<00:01:15.990> unit<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
on our on our body every single unit of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
on our on our body every single unit of
muscle<00:01:17.369> every<00:01:17.610> single<00:01:17.970> cell<00:01:18.299> requires<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
muscle every single cell requires a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.280 
muscle every single cell requires a
certain<00:01:19.500> amount<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.920> calories<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.850> exist

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
certain amount of calories just to exist

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
certain amount of calories just to exist
all<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> exist<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.299> those

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
all right just to exist and then those

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.539 
all right just to exist and then those
calories<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.990> converted<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:25.680> ATP<00:01:25.979> energy

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
calories are converted into ATP energy

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
calories are converted into ATP energy
and<00:01:27.030> whatever<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.930> needed

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and whatever is needed

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.609 
and whatever is needed
therefore<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.640> feed<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:29.970> brain<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:31.049> our

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
therefore to feed our brain to think our

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
therefore to feed our brain to think our
brain<00:01:31.920> eats<00:01:32.630> 20%<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> calories<00:01:34.409> we

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
brain eats 20% of all the calories we

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
brain eats 20% of all the calories we
consume<00:01:34.770> because<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.610> requires<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.119> much<00:01:36.540> in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
consume because it requires so much in

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.539 
consume because it requires so much in
order<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> function<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.860> all<00:01:38.040> these<00:01:38.250> things

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
order to function so all these things

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.840 
order to function so all these things
are<00:01:38.820> working<00:01:39.000> together<00:01:39.740> now<00:01:40.740> let's<00:01:41.700> say<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
are working together now let's say I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
are working together now let's say I
went<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.299> worked<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> get

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
went and I worked out now I want to get

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
went and I worked out now I want to get
my<00:01:43.710> muscles<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.430> bigger<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
my muscles to get bigger so what do I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
my muscles to get bigger so what do I
need<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.259> need<00:01:46.649> energy<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.700> order<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.570> build

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
need I need energy in order to build

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
need I need energy in order to build
that<00:01:48.960> muscle<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.310> got<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> building

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that muscle so now I got the building

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
that muscle so now I got the building
blocks<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.600> protein<00:01:52.170> coming<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:53.369> the
