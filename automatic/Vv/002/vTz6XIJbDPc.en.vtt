00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
raided because it was a factions plug-in

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
raided because it was a factions plug-in
glitch<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:04.200> actually<00:02:05.070> made<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
glitch that actually made it so that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.859 
glitch that actually made it so that
they<00:02:05.759> could<00:02:05.909> actually<00:02:06.060> get<00:02:06.329> through<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:06.719> so

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.350 
happening right now but if you guys can
see<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.709> stuff<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.280> basically<00:02:18.940> just<00:02:18.970> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
see all this stuff is basically just a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.509 
see all this stuff is basically just a
it<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:20.080> over<00:02:20.470> claimed<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
it was over claimed because of the

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.430 
it was over claimed because of the
faction<00:02:22.000> glitch<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.629> like<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.049> faction

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
faction glitch so like the faction

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.520 
faction glitch so like the faction
plugin<00:02:23.830> glitch<00:02:24.129> and<00:02:25.110> obviously<00:02:26.110> they<00:02:26.470> were

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
plugin glitch and obviously they were

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.140 
plugin glitch and obviously they were
able<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:26.860> get<00:02:27.069> in<00:02:27.250> and<00:02:27.370> take<00:02:27.610> all<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.790> our<00:02:27.940> stuff

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
able to get in and take all of our stuff

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.520 
able to get in and take all of our stuff

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.319 
blue to like the only only reason why
they<00:03:16.209> got<00:03:16.540> raided<00:03:16.750> was<00:03:17.019> because<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:18.329> because

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
they got raided was because of because

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.990 
they got raided was because of because
of<00:03:19.510> all<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.280> faction<00:03:21.280> plugin<00:03:21.669> bugs<00:03:21.880> that

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
of all of the faction plugin bugs that

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.400 
of all of the faction plugin bugs that
have<00:03:22.090> been<00:03:22.329> happening<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.750> past<00:03:22.840> two<00:03:23.230> weeks

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
have been happening the past two weeks

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.409 
have been happening the past two weeks
so<00:03:23.950> I<00:03:23.980> mean<00:03:24.310> yeah<00:03:24.549> we<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:24.849> raided<00:03:25.120> but

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
so I mean yeah we got raided but

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.150 
so I mean yeah we got raided but
technically<00:03:26.079> not<00:03:26.410> really<00:03:26.769> i<00:03:26.799> don't<00:03:27.040> i

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
technically not really i don't i

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.589 
technically not really i don't i
wouldn't<00:03:27.430> even<00:03:27.609> consider<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:28.120> being<00:03:28.269> rated

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
wouldn't even consider this being rated

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.020 
wouldn't even consider this being rated
but<00:03:29.290> what<00:03:29.919> episode<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.639> i<00:03:30.730> think<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:30.970> is

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
but what episode is this i think this is

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.020 
but what episode is this i think this is
episode<00:03:31.769> 114<00:03:32.769> so<00:03:33.459> we<00:03:33.669> got<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.940> episode<00:03:34.620> 114<00:03:35.620> and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
episode 114 so we got to episode 114 and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.430 
episode 114 so we got to episode 114 and
we<00:03:37.030> started<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.540> think<00:03:37.810> we've<00:03:37.930> started<00:03:38.230> this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
we started I think we've started this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.619 
we started I think we've started this
sanctum<00:03:38.889> ville<00:03:39.040> i<00:03:39.069> think<00:03:39.340> around<00:03:39.430> episode<00:03:39.819> 50

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
sanctum ville i think around episode 50

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.470 
sanctum ville i think around episode 50
or<00:03:40.810> 60<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.739> we<00:03:41.919> went<00:03:42.040> through<00:03:42.280> an<00:03:42.370> entire<00:03:42.699> 60

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
or 60 so we went through an entire 60

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.770 
or 60 so we went through an entire 60
like<00:03:44.019> 50<00:03:44.410> 60<00:03:44.799> 70<00:03:45.190> episodes<00:03:45.819> in<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.359> home
