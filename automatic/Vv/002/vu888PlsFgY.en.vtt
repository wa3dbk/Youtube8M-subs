 we continue further to describe the plot so as not to ruin a more intense dipole 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.890
 of the last years 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.510

 game have worked hard to refine the mechanics of 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.229
 fighting triplets and the narrative style of the new product 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.749
 instead of a system file based on timing and morra structure 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.039
 Chinese with the possibility to enter into tactical pause and manage 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:21.149

 Polish graphic designers have in fact tried to render the prof 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.099
 interface through the minimalist style I declare - 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.540
 skill restructuring school through the 4-point star staff 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.709

 finally, by pressing the z key the medallion will be activated 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.739
 a sort of scanner that will mark all the elements that can be manipulated on the scenario 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.599
 in this way they facilitate the finding of chemical ingredients of 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.599
 sources of power and so on 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:41.529
 the prologue of the witcher 2 the first chapters contain a high 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.869
 quantity of the last films all beautifully dubbed in English

 events spit out some magic trick or just our life hurts me 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.900
 the choices made in front of us can in fact have repercussions 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.789
 long if on short term 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.579
 what most emphasizes this succession of events that 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.029
 the exceptional characterization of the characters presented thousands of sentences in 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.680
 credible adult design that life of excesses of gold necklaces earrings if me 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.549
 break from the last typing production 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.030
 every character molise - as accessories - the defects of the skin on the face of

 character once snap into the required position the beginning of I love you 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:39.440
 these defects can easily be set for a non-cleaning job 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.650
 cultivated 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.550
 in any case, the technical fronts of the breathtaking rear-view mirrors disappear 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.539

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.539

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:10.079
 firmly on the narrative qualities of the development team I suggest 

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.659
 characters its costs 

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.699

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:18.909
 that Polish kids snack to improve the most interesting shot of the 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:19.300
 RPG
