00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.740 
battery the plant is constructed out of
styrofoam<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.160> not<00:02:49.670> plastic<00:02:50.269> for<00:02:50.450> anybody

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
styrofoam and not plastic for anybody

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.629 
styrofoam and not plastic for anybody
that's<00:02:50.989> won<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.290> ring<00:02:51.579> kind<00:02:52.579> of

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
that's won the ring kind of

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.160 
that's won the ring kind of
disappointing<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.420> don't<00:02:53.780> know<00:02:53.870> what<00:02:54.079> the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
disappointing I don't know what the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.990 
disappointing I don't know what the
black<00:02:54.350> ops<00:02:54.590> 2<00:02:54.739> quadrotor<00:02:55.220> was<00:02:55.459> made<00:02:55.639> out<00:02:55.819> of

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
black ops 2 quadrotor was made out of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.620 
black ops 2 quadrotor was made out of
but<00:02:56.209> yeah<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.019> styrofoam<00:02:57.410> constructed

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630

inbox<00:03:24.530> contents<00:03:25.070> I<00:03:25.190> will<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.460> assembling<00:03:25.850> the

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
inbox contents I will be assembling the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.570 
inbox contents I will be assembling the
plane<00:03:26.210> now<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.770> is<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.100> plane<00:03:28.310> fully

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
plane now so here is the plane fully

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.710 
plane now so here is the plane fully
constructed<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.330> was<00:03:29.360> fairly

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
constructed it was fairly

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.150 
constructed it was fairly
straightforward<00:03:29.870> all<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.950> really

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
straightforward all that it really

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.340 
straightforward all that it really
required<00:03:31.550> was<00:03:31.790> removing<00:03:32.300> some<00:03:32.540> double-sided

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
required was removing some double-sided

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.040 
required was removing some double-sided
tape<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:34.000> attaching<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.150> wing<00:03:35.330> extensions

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
tape and attaching the wing extensions

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.280 
tape and attaching the wing extensions
and<00:03:36.320> attaching<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> tail<00:03:37.310> but<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.570> am<00:03:38.750> again

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
and attaching the tail but I am again

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.350 
and attaching the tail but I am again
disappointed<00:03:40.070> that<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.340> was<00:03:40.520> styrofoam

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
disappointed that it was styrofoam

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.990 
disappointed that it was styrofoam
construction<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.560> didn't<00:03:43.489> know<00:03:43.580> what<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:43.790> was

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
construction I didn't know what I was

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.840 
construction I didn't know what I was
expecting<00:03:44.120> I've<00:03:44.780> never<00:03:45.020> owned<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.560> RSD<00:03:46.550> plane

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
expecting I've never owned a RSD plane

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
expecting I've never owned a RSD plane
before<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:49.370> game<00:03:50.000> actually<00:03:50.300> comes<00:03:50.750> with

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
before and the game actually comes with

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.490 
before and the game actually comes with
a<00:03:51.170> total<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.709> three<00:03:52.070> disks<00:03:52.489> if<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.760> get<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.150> on

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
a total of three disks if you get it on

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.100 
a total of three disks if you get it on
DVD<00:03:54.730> also<00:03:55.730> takes<00:03:55.970> a<00:03:56.090> while<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.300> install<00:03:56.959> it's

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
DVD also takes a while to install it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.470 
DVD also takes a while to install it's
prompting<00:03:57.530> me<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.950> disc<00:03:58.160> two<00:03:58.520> and<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:59.330> also

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
prompting me for disc two and it also

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.840 
prompting me for disc two and it also
goes<00:03:59.780> through<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.290> play<00:04:00.530> apparently<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:01.340> it

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
goes through you play apparently so it

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.720 
goes through you play apparently so it
won't<00:04:02.090> activate<00:04:02.390> on<00:04:02.720> Steam<00:04:03.080> but<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:04.070> got<00:04:04.459> what<00:04:04.700> I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
won't activate on Steam but I got what I

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:05.380 
won't activate on Steam but I got what I
paid<00:04:05.060> for

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
paid for

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.300 
paid for
so<00:04:05.690> once<00:04:05.989> I'm<00:04:06.200> more<00:04:06.410> familiar<00:04:06.560> with<00:04:06.980> flying

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
so once I'm more familiar with flying

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.370 
so once I'm more familiar with flying
the<00:04:07.459> plane<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.700> will<00:04:08.090> demonstrate<00:04:08.390> flying

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
the plane I will demonstrate flying

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.410 
the plane I will demonstrate flying
techniques<00:04:09.980> but<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.489> battery<00:04:10.820> takes<00:04:11.060> two<00:04:11.269> and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
techniques but the battery takes two and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.660 
techniques but the battery takes two and
a<00:04:11.450> half<00:04:11.630> hours<00:04:11.989> for<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.380> initial<00:04:12.739> charge<00:04:13.010> so

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
a half hours for the initial charge so

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.130 
a half hours for the initial charge so
that's<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:14.120> for<00:04:14.269> now<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.450> hope<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.900> enjoyed

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
that's it for now I hope you enjoyed

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's it for now I hope you enjoyed
this<00:04:15.260> video<00:04:15.440> thanks<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.980> lot<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.280> watching
