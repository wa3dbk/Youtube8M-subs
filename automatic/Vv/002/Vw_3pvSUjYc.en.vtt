leave my accents a little hard to
understand<00:02:20.989> sometimes<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.739> know<00:02:21.829> we<00:02:21.950> don't

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
understand sometimes you know we don't

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.610 
understand sometimes you know we don't
actually<00:02:22.280> ever<00:02:22.700> say<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.810> got<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:23.989> go<00:02:24.170> pack<00:02:24.379> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
car so I don't know if like the Boston

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.440 
car so I don't know if like the Boston
dialect<00:02:27.379> works<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.980> was<00:02:28.250> really<00:02:28.549> surprised<00:02:29.269> at

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
dialect works I was really surprised at

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
dialect works I was really surprised at
how<00:02:29.569> well<00:02:29.599> recognized<00:02:30.290> everything<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.860> I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
how well recognized everything that I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.339 
how well recognized everything that I
said<00:02:30.980> I'm<00:02:31.670> really<00:02:32.239> proud<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> effort<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
said I'm really proud of the effort and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.199 
said I'm really proud of the effort and
the<00:02:33.410> work<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.190> team<00:02:34.400> did<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:35.060> support

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the work that the team did to support

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.360 
the work that the team did to support
Kinect<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.170> think<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.590> implementation

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
Kinect and I think the implementation

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.400 
Kinect and I think the implementation
they<00:02:37.489> pulled<00:02:37.760> off<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.180> really<00:02:38.720> cool<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
they pulled off is really cool and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.930 
they pulled off is really cool and
hopefully<00:02:39.739> everybody<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.400> gets<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.640> try<00:02:40.879> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
hopefully everybody that gets to try it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.180 
hopefully everybody that gets to try it
agrees<00:02:41.540> using<00:02:42.319> a<00:02:42.350> voice<00:02:42.530> command<00:02:42.739> is<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.069> lot

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
agrees using a voice command is a lot

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.400
