00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.469
 we all grow up again I will tell you about 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 Korean Moscow is ready infotag me 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.890
 the mask is purely Korean therefore 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 info through is not written anywhere 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.859
 different buttons poked these buttons 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.220
 marks dorint revision grinding mode 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:30.869
 I will say that is not very convenient during 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.570
 welding in cramped conditions I have 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 several times for pressed that is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.270
 Lari Shah Slave Sweet pouring butter 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.460
 something where you gave splashed 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.910
 touched pieces of iron and pity but 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 you can disable it all 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.870
 plugged into the same frame 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.710
 normal can pull out 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.210
 mask 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.480
 looks pretty cumbersome on in 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.480
 Basically comfortable as he understands 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.890
 so stop loss told about glass 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.470
 such glasses you can not buy 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 buy polycarbonate and cut into males 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:27.460
 will be much cheaper further now 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.020
 I'll tell you a little more he criminals on 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.020
 hungry matchless 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.210
 regulated closer-on 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:53.229
 I can say that the head of this very 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:56.080
 convenient don't like what we have here 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.740
 all taffeta let's interest so batteries 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.479
 here is in the pond rubber I and 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.299
 I will not get something to beat but 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.659
 you can see the lid then remove the rubber tank 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.720
 blonde decides to change this thing 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.269
 simply removed 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.989
 track man turns off she herself through 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:25.390
 20 simple faces can also be distinguished 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:29.350
 clicking they turn on what's here 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.020
 It means weld welding somehow sharply plasma 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.400
 on drink ground ie sweep xmod 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.709
 it turns out 5 to 7 here is 5 to 4 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.980
 front panel sensor 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:45.520
 correlation on the battle 5 summer resident sensor 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 electromagnetic then 7 can be used 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.880
 for example during a very bright sun 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.830
 looking at the sun there is a light filter 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.739
 only work on the electromagnetic 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.560
 radiation any more light on what is not 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:08.800
 triggered switches it all one 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:13.060
 button so minutes as the verse could grind it 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:22.750
 there are five further means darkening 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:32.650
 when welding blackout we have from 9 to 13 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:36.489
 with sharp from here 5 5 to 9 stripping all 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.540
 time fourth position x-mode too 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:47.140
 welding 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:50.739
 up to 13 so will switch to welding while 9 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.329
 schools put on blackout blackout 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.530
 regulated here 10 we can do 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:02.069
 so that 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:05.550
 if you add a little bit to the sensor 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.720
 put here a ten torus 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.640
 foursome here put on desyatochku 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.970
 since childhood, a mask of court years only then 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.010
 when the slag cools off so that it 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.079
 clung pretty quickly leave 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.889
 alone 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:28.030
 If the sensor translates 10 position in 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:32.110
 dungeon constantly this mode 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.210
 used in the cold that because 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.870
 in the cold, the crystal freezes a little and 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.220
 the mask starts to blunt 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.790
 may not work well during 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:48.460
 ignition fire catch a bunny also 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:53.760
 used glad when cutting sensor 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:56.650
 figured out the mask means this info so 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.780
 here is the button information and what have 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.370
 we have 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.479
 arc time is welding time i.e. 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.990
 multiple mask is disabled 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.690
 and how much exactly does the arc burn 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:16.780
 here is not one but everything is reset 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:20.430
 it's pretty simple everything is written like a clock 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:27.340
 there are 12 24 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:30.580
 can put the 12-hour 24 also have 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.660
 Celsius Fahrenheit temperature 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.270
 that is, the temperature is changing fahrenheit 79 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.330
 from 726 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:46.060
 new fixes exit at a cold 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:49.570
 clock temperature and alarm clock 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:54.540
 need not to miss the object bear 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:58.410
 also useful here 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:02.360
 all buttons here plus minus everywhere that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:08.660
 where to press that you will suffer dixit press 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:11.130
 but the actual grade is 11 12 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.200
 optical class you can read in 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:22.650
 online what is it in principle 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:26.760
 the mask is not bad sold only 1 seemed 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:30.320
 and someone forgot to write ask on 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.320
 this all goodbye
