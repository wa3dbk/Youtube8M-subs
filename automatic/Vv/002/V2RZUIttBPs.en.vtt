 Armor through beads to people 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:19.870
 This time while winding the thread around the hair rubber 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:24.360
 Introducing the weave knit through the beads 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.360
 Let's take a look at the actual work 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 The city from the bottom now and fold in half 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.000
 We pull up with the door guard and pull the tension 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.540
 Divide the two threads left and right 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.050
 me 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:52.660
 We will wound the rubber in the order of the thread right of the thread of the left 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.920
 First is the left thread 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.460
 Hmm 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.460
 In this way on the side of the rubber 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 Pull from below the rubber through the thread 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.330
 It tightens the thread 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:17.270
 Hmm 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.270
 Next is the right thread and make this way to the right of the rubber 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.540
 Take a thread from under the rubber and tighten it 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.750
 Boo Woo d 6 f 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.050
 next 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.050
 Let's look at knitting work through the beads only on yarn since 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.900
 Wrap through the beads on the surprising person 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.830
 Hmm

 me 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:10.160
 Booby Here's the point If you let the beads go 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.300
 In this way the tension through the thread again because the cheek is easy to loose 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.300
 Let's fix the thread 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.560
 Crawling 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.890

 Hoodie 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.910
 Next is winding the right thread as it is but it is the point there 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:50.430
 Such a crisis if through the large beads the right of the thread because one interval will vacant 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:59.630
 You can beat it several times and fill your senses 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:59.630
 Let's adjust the number of times of attraction to equalize human sense through the thread again 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.770
 Walk way woo

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.710
 As you pass through the beads like this on the left 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.319
 The order of the second thread right 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.249
 If you put a thread on com 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:33.010
 Such a cute hair rubber was finished 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:37.770
 If you remember how to wind the yarn 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.810
 Even the right person can arrange through water 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.810
