00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.580
 Welcome to your old castle channel 1 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.009
 we will teach how to decorate a chest of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.579
 wood which we can do to 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.579
 give or sell 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.539
 For this we need the following 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.419
 materials a chest in wood 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.140
 that we get it anywhere in 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.140
 handicrafts 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.910
 consecutive pearls 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.910
 imitation stones gems 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.530
 in any color and ornaments that we 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.900
 happen that we can use buttons 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.650
 flowers leaves anything serves as a 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.000
 ornament 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.930
 we need instant silicone adhesive 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 vinyl of any color 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.750
 a thick brush 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.460
 and we proceed to paint the chest both for 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.519
 inside as well as outside 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.180
 If the paint is very thick we can 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.010
 dissolve with a little water so that 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.010
 let it slide more easily 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.730
 we started painting inside covering 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.540
 each of its edges so that it does not 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.540
 will harm us 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.869
 we also do with the lid 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.400
 if we need one or two hands the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.370
 we can give 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 let it dry and proceed to paint it 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.780
 out of the same way 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560
 we try to be uniform in the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.780
 brochazos we are taking to avoid 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.780
 there will be excesses 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.970
 we also give the hands that are 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.970
 necessary for us to stay very even 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.349
 after we have it already dry 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.550
 we proceed to apply a coat of lacan 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:23.580
 spray is either glossy or matt according to 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:28.010
 the taste of each one 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.010
 we must also let it dry 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.370
 if we want we can also 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.310
 apply inside 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.170
 already having it ready we are going to place him 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.200
 the decorations we chose 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.110
 with the help of hot silicone 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.110
 we apply a point on the edge where 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.390
 let's start the decoration 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.120
 these consecutive pearls will be left 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.510
 maneuver very well since they are not going away 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.510
 to untie 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.220
 we put points followed by silicone and 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.760
 we are doing small pressures to 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.760
 that dries well 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.090
 we cut it to the exact size for 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.090
 give us all the edge 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.879
 these adornments we put them on a whim 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.609
 no exact place to do it 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.939
 I decided to put one in the part of 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.230
 below and another on the edge of the lid the 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.230
 we place in the same way 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.840
 it's up to hold it a little bit so that while 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.840
 dry this is something very quick to do 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.390
 we have it ready with the two edges 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.920
 milestones 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:12.680
 and the box is taking shape 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.680
 As I told you the ornaments are going to caprice 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.829
 it looks very nice, however, to me 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.610
 taste you need in the top to put 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.860
 more adornitos he put them the go 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.220
 distributing to see how they are going to 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.220
 stay 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.800
 I'll focus on them, I'll place them in the 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.500
 site that I want 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.169
 In this case I chose to decorate it 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.979
 red color and that will simulate a bit the 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:48.389
 Christmas because I like to make gifts in 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.129
 any time of year but 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.989
 mainly in this 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:57.520
 after I have them well 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:05:00.960
 distributed I will take one by one and with 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:04.050
 help of an instant stick 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.900
 I'm taking them 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.169
 I applied the glue and I return them to 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.659
 locate where I got it from 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.560
 I press him for a few seconds to 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.560
 that is fixed well 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.610
 each of these adornitos I'm going 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.610
 doing the same way 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:41.190
 we are going to place the last 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.300
 and as you can see, it was very 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.370
 whim I did 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.400
 and we make sure they look good 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.960
 glued to this we lift the lid and 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.280
 as you can see none is loose 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:02.040
 if we want we can leave it like this 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:05.840
 It looks pretty nice but I'm still there 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.240
 placing a touch 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.970
 and caprice and elegance I'm going to 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.389
 customize for the person to whom you 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.020
 I think I give it away in this case I'm going 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:20.840
 to give to olga therefore very 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.720
 gently marked the name of that 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.780
 person 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.020
 and later with the help of ink 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.509
 golden and a thin brush 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.870
 I'm going to keep it so that it highlights a 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.870
 little bit 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.419
 we come back to border with this ink 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.340
 and if we need spaces we can 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.340
 check a little 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:06.220
 we do not need special templates 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.330
 for the letter because everyone can 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.330
 write your way 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.270
 if we need them we go back to review 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.540
 after having the name he placed 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:26.180
 the ends other ornaments so that at 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.480
 lift the lid of the chest also 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:34.930
 see well decorated if you wish you can 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.930
 put velvet to the bottom or satin 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:44.700
 our custom chest is now 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:46.910
 which we can give to sell 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.530
 and learn to do crafts 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:52.410
 demonstrating all our ingenuity and 

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.380
 creativity as they could see no 

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:58.840
 we need to be experts in decoration 

00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:01.870
 to make these beautiful crafts 

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:05.730
