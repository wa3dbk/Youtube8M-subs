00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
which you can put anything in doesn't

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.759

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
got the same value on this game which I

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.770 
got the same value on this game which I
really<00:04:05.099> don't<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.879> also<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.720> hoping

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
really don't like and also I'm hoping

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.539 
really don't like and also I'm hoping
than<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.739> it's<00:04:08.040> very<00:04:08.220> poor

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
than that I know it's very poor

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.640 
than that I know it's very poor
animations<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:09.389> on<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.019> other<00:04:10.109> hand<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.590> is

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
animations but on the other hand it is

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.420 
animations but on the other hand it is
an<00:04:10.949> alpha<00:04:11.540> but<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.169> another<00:04:14.129> thing<00:04:14.220> that

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
an alpha but you know another thing that

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.279 
an alpha but you know another thing that
really<00:04:14.549> concerns<00:04:14.639> me<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.359> cash<00:04:15.780> system

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
really concerns me is the cash system

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.520 
really concerns me is the cash system
which<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.620> hate<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.489> games<00:04:17.900> they<00:04:18.900> said<00:04:19.139> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
which I hate is in games they said the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.190 
which I hate is in games they said the
cash<00:04:19.769> system<00:04:20.280> is<00:04:20.489> ninety<00:04:21.209> percent<00:04:21.329> aesthetics

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
cash system is ninety percent aesthetics

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.170 
cash system is ninety percent aesthetics
of<00:04:22.349> your<00:04:22.530> character<00:04:23.039> okay

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
of your character okay

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.910 
of your character okay
but<00:04:26.180> then<00:04:26.300> they<00:04:26.480> say<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:27.290> ten<00:04:27.470> percent<00:04:27.830> you

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
but then they say it's ten percent you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.350 
but then they say it's ten percent you
can<00:04:28.040> actually<00:04:28.160> buy<00:04:28.400> stuff<00:04:28.670> which<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.940> knew<00:04:29.120> this

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
can actually buy stuff which I knew this

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.240 
can actually buy stuff which I knew this
which<00:04:29.570> can<00:04:29.810> buy<00:04:29.990> it's<00:04:30.230> like<00:04:30.380> barricades<00:04:31.010> and

which can buy it's like barricades and
stuff<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:32.180> biggest<00:04:32.390> concern<00:04:32.810> i<00:04:32.840> can<00:04:33.110> buy

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
stuff and the biggest concern i can buy

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
spoils it like straight away the value

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.110 
spoils it like straight away the value
on<00:04:38.480> that<00:04:38.630> item<00:04:39.020> just<00:04:39.710> drops<00:04:40.100> completely<00:04:40.910> but

stuff I that you know it can't be good
more<00:05:23.480> glitch<00:05:23.750> than<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.200> dayz<00:05:24.470> mod<00:05:25.000> but<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
more glitch than the dayz mod but the

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.450 
more glitch than the dayz mod but the
concept<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:26.930> game<00:05:27.140> isn't<00:05:27.410> kind<00:05:28.400> of

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
concept of the game isn't kind of

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.190 
concept of the game isn't kind of
worries<00:05:28.730> me<00:05:28.760> another<00:05:29.540> thing<00:05:29.840> which<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.140> know

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
worries me another thing which I know

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.010 
worries me another thing which I know
this<00:05:30.620> is<00:05:30.770> this<00:05:30.890> is<00:05:31.010> back<00:05:31.160> two<00:05:31.280> negatives

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
this is this is back two negatives

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
graphics I like left for that too a bit

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.820 
graphics I like left for that too a bit
it<00:05:41.360> feels<00:05:41.420> a<00:05:41.750> bit<00:05:41.780> like<00:05:41.960> left<00:05:42.260> with<00:05:42.470> two<00:05:42.680> you

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
it feels a bit like left with two you

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.620 
it feels a bit like left with two you
know<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.100> highlights<00:05:43.520> on<00:05:43.730> the<00:05:43.760> items<00:05:44.300> since

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
know the highlights on the items since

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.180 
know the highlights on the items since
you<00:05:44.750> can<00:05:44.900> like<00:05:45.080> now<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.650> can<00:05:45.740> see<00:05:45.890> that<00:05:45.920> is

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
you can like now you can see that is

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.940 
you can like now you can see that is
from<00:05:46.370> far<00:05:46.580> away<00:05:46.610> on<00:05:47.000> Daisy<00:05:47.530> you<00:05:48.530> have<00:05:48.680> to<00:05:48.830> look

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
from far away on Daisy you have to look

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.530 
from far away on Daisy you have to look
for<00:05:49.220> them<00:05:49.250> carefully<00:05:49.880> in<00:05:50.090> case<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.510> missed

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
for them carefully in case you missed

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.480 
for them carefully in case you missed
them<00:05:50.990> which<00:05:51.290> you<00:05:51.470> know<00:05:51.650> makes<00:05:51.890> that<00:05:52.040> realism

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
them which you know makes that realism

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.970 
them which you know makes that realism
and<00:05:52.970> i<00:05:53.330> think<00:05:53.540> was<00:05:53.780> he<00:05:54.050> loses<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.560> lot<00:05:54.710> of<00:05:54.800> that

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
and i think was he loses a lot of that

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.730 
and i think was he loses a lot of that
realism<00:05:55.370> but<00:05:55.520> again<00:05:55.910> it<00:05:56.690> can't<00:05:57.080> be<00:05:57.200> as<00:05:57.350> glitchy

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
realism but again it can't be as glitchy

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.340 
realism but again it can't be as glitchy
as<00:05:57.980> Daisy<00:05:58.310> was<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.930> cool<00:06:00.140> thing<00:06:00.170> is

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
as Daisy was and the cool thing is

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.110 
as Daisy was and the cool thing is
zombies<00:06:01.010> are<00:06:01.100> not<00:06:01.250> gonna<00:06:01.370> go<00:06:01.580> through<00:06:01.760> walls

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
zombies are not gonna go through walls

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.900 
zombies are not gonna go through walls
into<00:06:02.510> doors<00:06:02.840> like<00:06:03.110> I'm<00:06:03.260> Daisy<00:06:03.910> personally

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
into doors like I'm Daisy personally

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.850 
into doors like I'm Daisy personally
they<00:06:05.150> look<00:06:05.360> less<00:06:05.630> fret<00:06:05.900> alright<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.410> think<00:06:06.560> I'll

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
they look less fret alright I think I'll

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.150 
they look less fret alright I think I'll
improve<00:06:07.220> on<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.630> so<00:06:08.630> yeah<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:09.230> think<00:06:09.860> that's

improve on that so yeah I think that's

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.680 
improve on that so yeah I think that's
about<00:06:10.280> that's<00:06:10.580> about<00:06:10.880> what<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:11.450> about

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.200 
about that's about what I think about
