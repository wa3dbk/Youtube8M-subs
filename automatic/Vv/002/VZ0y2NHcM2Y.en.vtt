00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
house you're going to find the spot and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.479 
house you're going to find the spot and
usually<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> set<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.010> before<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> bring

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

usually you set this up before you bring
it<00:00:44.789> home<00:00:44.910> find<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.870> spot<00:00:46.170> where<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.620> going

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it home find the spot where it's going

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.729 
it home find the spot where it's going
to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> easiest<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.850> clean<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.270> messes

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
to be the easiest to clean up messes

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.310 
to be the easiest to clean up messes
because<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.920> will<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.539> usually

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
because there will be some so usually

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220 
because there will be some so usually
that's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.710> kitchen<00:00:53.250> area<00:00:53.719> because<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.960> floor

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that's a kitchen area because the floor

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.979 
that's a kitchen area because the floor
is<00:00:55.260> something<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.190> either<00:00:57.000> linoleum<00:00:57.840> or

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
is something that's either linoleum or

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.069 
is something that's either linoleum or
tile<00:00:58.609> even<00:00:59.609> hardwood<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> fairly<00:01:00.449> easy<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
tile even hardwood is fairly easy to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.560 
tile even hardwood is fairly easy to
take<00:01:01.260> care<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.370> you're<00:01:02.789> going<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.539> a
