00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
probably 50 guys you know so we probably

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.430 
probably 50 guys you know so we probably
still<00:04:15.890> have<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.910> good<00:04:17.600> seven<00:04:17.989> or<00:04:18.079> eight<00:04:18.229> yet

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
still have a good seven or eight yet

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.229 
still have a good seven or eight yet
that<00:04:18.890> will<00:04:19.039> look<00:04:19.220> at<00:04:19.400> it<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.700> certainly<00:04:19.940> we've

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
that will look at it and certainly we've

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:20.710 
that will look at it and certainly we've
got<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.479> try

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
got to try

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.070 
got to try
coming<00:04:21.019> up<00:04:21.110> on<00:04:21.230> July<00:04:21.530> no<00:04:22.330> I'm<00:04:23.330> still<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:23.780> on

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.130 
coming up on July no I'm still going on
so<00:04:24.470> I'm<00:04:24.950> guessing<00:04:25.250> that<00:04:25.370> final<00:04:25.820> 55<00:04:26.390> tally

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
so I'm guessing that final 55 tally

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.990 
so I'm guessing that final 55 tally
number<00:04:27.530> plus<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.950> know<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.280> 65<00:04:28.760> are<00:04:28.910> you

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
