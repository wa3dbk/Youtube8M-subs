little bit of that shape there watch

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.030 
little bit of that shape there watch
what<00:01:09.210> happens<00:01:09.570> when<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> move<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.590> even

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what happens when we move to an even
