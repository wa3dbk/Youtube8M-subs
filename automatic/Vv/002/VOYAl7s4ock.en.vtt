from<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.150> general<00:00:15.630> user<00:00:15.929> experience<00:00:16.680> point<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
from my general user experience point of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.060 
from my general user experience point of
view<00:00:17.660> so<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.050> workstation<00:00:19.650> Dell

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
view so this is the workstation Dell

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.010 
view so this is the workstation Dell
claims<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.850> world's<00:00:21.779> most

keyboard keys are pretty firm and

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.469 
keyboard keys are pretty firm and
they're<00:04:11.530> pretty<00:04:11.739> good<00:04:13.829> on<00:04:14.879> file<00:04:15.879> off<00:04:16.090> into<00:04:16.389> the

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
they're pretty good on file off into the

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.369 
they're pretty good on file off into the
machine

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:21.379 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.390 

and<00:04:22.379> yeah<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:23.789> I<00:04:24.259> found<00:04:25.259> the<00:04:25.440> screen<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.280> the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
and yeah so I found the screen of the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.860 
and yeah so I found the screen of the
machine<00:04:27.020> is<00:04:28.020> probably<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:29.659> it's<00:04:30.659> not

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
machine is probably you know it's not

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.170 
machine is probably you know it's not
having<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.379> higher<00:04:31.830> sort<00:04:32.159> of<00:04:32.250> spike<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:33.000> you

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
having a higher sort of spike if you

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.749 
having a higher sort of spike if you
compare<00:04:33.569> to<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:33.750> other<00:04:34.370> hardware<00:04:35.370> spec<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
compare to the other hardware spec of

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.689 
compare to the other hardware spec of
the<00:04:35.879> machine<00:04:36.180> but<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:36.870> guess<00:04:37.169> this<00:04:38.129> is<00:04:38.310> not

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
the machine but I guess this is not

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:45.909 
the machine but I guess this is not
intended<00:04:39.419> for<00:04:41.629> digital<00:04:42.629> sort<00:04:42.960> of<00:04:43.050> video<00:04:44.840> users

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
intended for digital sort of video users

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.100 
intended for digital sort of video users
who<00:04:46.919> does<00:04:47.490> lot<00:04:47.729> of<00:04:47.849> video<00:04:48.210> editing<00:04:48.240> kind<00:04:48.960> of

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
who does lot of video editing kind of

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.170 
who does lot of video editing kind of
work<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:51.389> again<00:04:51.810> this<00:04:52.169> is<00:04:53.150> intended<00:04:54.150> for

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
work but again this is intended for

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.450 
work but again this is intended for
engineers<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.960> professionals<00:04:55.250> who<00:04:56.250> don't

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
engineers and professionals who don't

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.490 
engineers and professionals who don't
fancy<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:58.009> brilliant<00:04:59.009> screen<00:04:59.460> as<00:04:59.639> such

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
fancy to have brilliant screen as such

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.120 
fancy to have brilliant screen as such
so<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.740> it<00:05:01.860> really<00:05:02.190> I<00:05:02.220> mean<00:05:02.490> I've<00:05:03.449> been

so this is it really I mean I've been

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.600 
so this is it really I mean I've been
using<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.430> for<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.639> while<00:05:05.819> I<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.389> have<00:05:10.130> run<00:05:11.130> it<00:05:11.340> and

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
using it for a while I I have run it and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.649 
using it for a while I I have run it and
then<00:05:12.139> I've<00:05:13.139> been<00:05:13.409> using<00:05:13.949> few<00:05:14.340> programs<00:05:14.789> at<00:05:15.630> a

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
then I've been using few programs at a

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.709 
then I've been using few programs at a
time<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.409> performance<00:05:17.009> of<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.539> machine

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719
