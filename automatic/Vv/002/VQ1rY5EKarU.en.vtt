Brown not too pink in vanilla sky' I

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
would call a nude for a lighter skin

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.450 
would call a nude for a lighter skin
tone<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.450> myself<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:28.979> right

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.300 
and and yet you know it's like I don't I
don't<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> number<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.829> front<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.130> me<00:02:05.219> but

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
don't have the number in front of me but

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.540 
don't have the number in front of me but
I<00:02:05.399> want<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.640> say<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:05.850> 17<00:02:06.420> dollars<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
I want to say it's like 17 dollars and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
I want to say it's like 17 dollars and
you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.759> these<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.119> $4.99<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.110> often

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you can get these for $4.99 and often

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
you can get these for $4.99 and often
they're<00:02:10.709> buy<00:02:11.009> one<00:02:11.190> get<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.370> half

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
they're buy one get one half

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.150 
they're buy one get one half
so<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.690> no-brainer<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:13.470> at<00:02:13.740> least<00:02:13.920> as

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
so that's a no-brainer there at least as

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.710 
so that's a no-brainer there at least as
good<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.430> quality<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.120> slightly<00:02:15.300> better

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
good of quality if not slightly better

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.800 
good of quality if not slightly better
and<00:02:16.050> they<00:02:16.170> last<00:02:16.410> longer<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.630> another<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and they last longer so another the

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.150 
and they last longer so another the
planner<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.770> is<00:02:19.920> worth

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
planner I do like and is worth

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.070 
planner I do like and is worth
mentioning<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.300> seduce<00:02:21.720> from

covergirl<00:02:22.950> LipPerfection

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.350 
covergirl LipPerfection
it<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.870> also<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> nude<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.670> probably<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
it is also a nude it is probably the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.540 
it is also a nude it is probably the
lightest<00:02:27.750> noon<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.770> it's<00:02:29.190> quite<00:02:29.430> nice

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
lightest noon I have and it's quite nice

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.020 
lightest noon I have and it's quite nice
so<00:02:29.910> that's<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.330> good<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.600> too<00:02:30.810> but<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:32.030> don't

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so that's a good one too but I don't

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.510 
so that's a good one too but I don't
like<00:02:33.270> retractable<00:02:34.200> eyeliners<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.370> some

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
like retractable eyeliners for some

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.070 
like retractable eyeliners for some
reason<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.970> don't<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> hang-up<00:02:36.900> I've

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
reason I don't know is a hang-up I've

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.010 
reason I don't know is a hang-up I've
got<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.100> love<00:02:38.400> retractable<00:02:39.120> lip<00:02:39.300> liners<00:02:39.720> to

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
got but I love retractable lip liners to

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.210 
got but I love retractable lip liners to
me<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.800> best<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:42.710> the<00:02:43.710> best<00:02:43.920> kind

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
me that's the best way to the best kind

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.600 
me that's the best way to the best kind
to<00:02:44.460> purchase<00:02:44.850> so<00:02:45.950> that's<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.220> preference

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
to purchase so that's just my preference

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.640 
to purchase so that's just my preference
but<00:02:48.240> there's<00:02:48.390> no<00:02:48.510> reason<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:49.320> just<00:02:49.380> what<00:02:49.620> I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
but there's no reason it's just what I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.570 
but there's no reason it's just what I
seem<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.250> reach<00:02:50.550> for<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.000> most

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
seem to reach for the most

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.090 
seem to reach for the most
these<00:02:53.580> are<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.180> good<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.920> I'm<00:02:55.920> not

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
these are really really good and I'm not

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
these are really really good and I'm not
always<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.730> who<00:02:56.940> wears<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.330> lip<00:02:57.540> liner<00:02:57.780> but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
always one who wears a lip liner but

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.410 
always one who wears a lip liner but
I've<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.370> been<00:02:59.490> gravitating<00:03:00.000> toward<00:03:00.240> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
I've really been gravitating toward this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.810
