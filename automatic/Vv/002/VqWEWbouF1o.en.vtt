got here okay so when you're talking
about<00:00:35.250> doubling<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.790> lasting<00:00:36.120> sort<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
about doubling and lasting sort what the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.500 
about doubling and lasting sort what the
main<00:00:37.050> benefits<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> main<00:00:38.910> benefit<00:00:39.300> really

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
main benefits in the main benefit really

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
main benefits in the main benefit really
is<00:00:39.719> how<00:00:39.870> soft<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> strike<00:00:40.860> basically

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
is how soft is on the strike basically

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.569 
is how soft is on the strike basically
get<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.780> strength<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.860> basically<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
get the strength is basically what it is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
get the strength is basically what it is
on<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.210> packet<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:46.079> using<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.500> sixth<00:00:46.800> Waggett

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
on the packet if using a sixth Waggett

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.160 
on the packet if using a sixth Waggett
is<00:00:47.250> six<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> eight<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> strike<00:00:48.270> because

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
is six to eight on the strike because

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.720 
is six to eight on the strike because
it's<00:00:49.289> doubled<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.770> soon<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.399> starts<00:00:50.640> to

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's doubled up soon that starts to

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's doubled up soon that starts to
stretch<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.750> pair<00:00:51.960> comes<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
stretch the pair comes in and then it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
stretch the pair comes in and then it
becomes<00:00:53.430> what<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.180> double

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
becomes what it is it actually double

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.479 
becomes what it is it actually double
elastic<00:00:55.110> until<00:00:55.590> six<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:55.980> become<00:00:56.190> more<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
elastic until six will become more like

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.939 
elastic until six will become more like
twelve<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.170> bunk<00:00:58.500> less<00:00:58.680> fish

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
twelve so you can get to bunk less fish

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
twelve so you can get to bunk less fish
we<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.309> still<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.730> carp<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.239> double<00:01:00.449> clicked

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we can still on carp and double clicked

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
we can still on carp and double clicked
on<00:01:00.780> okay<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.710> you've<00:01:01.949> got<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.579> here

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on okay so you've got a top get here

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
on okay so you've got a top get here
threaded<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.510> all<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:03.989> through

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
threaded up with it all the way through

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.509 
threaded up with it all the way through
to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> other<00:01:04.710> end<00:01:04.920> where<00:01:05.189> you've<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to the other end where you've got a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.670 
to the other end where you've got a
puller<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.780> perfect<00:01:06.990> sail<00:01:07.409> maybe

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
puller so this is the perfect sail maybe

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
puller so this is the perfect sail maybe
for<00:01:08.010> sort<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> today's<00:01:08.700> commercials<00:01:09.270> that's

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
for sort of today's commercials that's

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.929 
for sort of today's commercials that's
that's<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.990> perfect<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.920> mean<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> puller<00:01:11.729> bond

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
that's it perfect I mean the puller bond

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's it perfect I mean the puller bond
if<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.869> get<00:01:13.020> anything<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.680> pushing

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
if you do get anything that is pushing

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.020 
if you do get anything that is pushing
double<00:01:14.520> figures

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
double figures

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
double figures
then<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> can<00:01:15.630> land<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> quite<00:01:16.140> easily<00:01:16.430> okay

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
then you can land it quite easily okay

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
then you can land it quite easily okay
so<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.729> benefits<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.570> double<00:01:18.990> elastic<00:01:19.409> over

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
so the benefits of a double elastic over

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.789 
so the benefits of a double elastic over
a<00:01:19.740> single<00:01:20.130> or<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> hollow<00:01:21.259> smoothness<00:01:22.259> you've

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a single or a hollow smoothness you've

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.109 
a single or a hollow smoothness you've
got<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> rich<00:01:23.340> sort<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> reserve<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.090> power

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
got that rich sort of reserve of power

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539 
got that rich sort of reserve of power
there<00:01:24.600> that's<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.619> mean<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.070> soft<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
there that's it I mean it's soft on the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.520 
there that's it I mean it's soft on the
strike<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.479> you're<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:27.869> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> bump<00:01:28.229> fish

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
strike so you're not going to bump fish

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
strike so you're not going to bump fish
and<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.729> do<00:01:29.880> hook<00:01:30.090> something<00:01:30.329> bigger<00:01:30.750> you

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and if you do hook something bigger you

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
and if you do hook something bigger you
can<00:01:31.110> land<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.500> whereas<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.490> girl

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
can land it whereas if you if just girl

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700 
can land it whereas if you if just girl
just<00:01:33.540> target<00:01:33.869> bigger<00:01:34.020> fish<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.439> might<00:01:34.560> have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
just target bigger fish you might have

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.200 
just target bigger fish you might have
like<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> sixteen<00:01:35.369> lasting<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:35.939> anything

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
like a sixteen lasting for anything

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
like a sixteen lasting for anything
smaller<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> boom<00:01:36.990> by<00:01:37.770> using<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.220> double

elastic<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.540> cool<00:01:39.810> wider<00:01:40.380> range<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
elastic you can just cool wider range of

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.980 
elastic you can just cool wider range of
species<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.909> maybe<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.329> fish<00:01:42.659> sort<00:01:42.899> of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
species and maybe even fish sort of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
lower diameter mainline hook lengths

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.039 
lower diameter mainline hook lengths
ultimately<00:01:45.119> getting<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.570> bite<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.750> that's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
ultimately getting more bite and that's

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
ultimately getting more bite and that's
right<00:01:46.290> yeah<00:01:46.470> okay<00:01:47.250> well<00:01:47.399> I've<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.640> used

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
right yeah okay well I've actually used

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
right yeah okay well I've actually used
this<00:01:48.060> elastic<00:01:48.450> myself<00:01:48.810> over<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> years<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this elastic myself over the years and I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.929 
this elastic myself over the years and I
must<00:01:49.799> say<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:49.979> I've<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.610> well<00:01:50.759> with

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
must say that I've got on very well with

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
must say that I've got on very well with
it<00:01:51.090> there's<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> top<00:01:52.229> guides<00:01:52.500> also<00:01:52.829> uses

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it there's a lot of top guides also uses

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
it there's a lot of top guides also uses
so<00:01:53.939> how<00:01:54.390> about<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> join<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.200> give<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so how about you join them and give it a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.960 
so how about you join them and give it a
