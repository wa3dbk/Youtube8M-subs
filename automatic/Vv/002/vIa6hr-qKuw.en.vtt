going<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.340> bring<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.849> to<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.239> bar<00:02:04.629> guardian

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
going to bring it to the bar guardian

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.510 
going to bring it to the bar guardian
and<00:02:05.259> then<00:02:05.349> I'm<00:02:05.440> going<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.800> crimp<00:02:06.069> using<00:02:06.399> my

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
and then I'm going to crimp using my

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.660 
and then I'm going to crimp using my
magical<00:02:06.910> crimp<00:02:07.179> forming<00:02:07.509> tool<00:02:08.459> again<00:02:09.459> you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
magical crimp forming tool again you

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.809 
magical crimp forming tool again you
just<00:02:10.379> crimp<00:02:11.379> it<00:02:11.500> once<00:02:11.830> till<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.489> get<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
just crimp it once till you get the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.110 
just crimp it once till you get the
little<00:02:13.030> four<00:02:13.239> corners<00:02:13.629> pressed<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.849> then<00:02:15.970> you

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
little four corners pressed and then you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.030 
little four corners pressed and then you
put<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.540> again<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.410> rotate<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
put it in again and you just rotate it

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.000 
put it in again and you just rotate it
until<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.730> creates

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
until it creates

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.720 
until it creates
the<00:02:20.310> crimp<00:02:20.580> bead<00:02:22.040> or<00:02:23.040> makes<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> crimp<00:02:23.670> bead

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the crimp bead or makes the crimp bead

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.350 
the crimp bead or makes the crimp bead
look<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.269> two<00:02:24.569> millimeter<00:02:24.870> feet<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:26.360> then

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
look like a two millimeter feet and then

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.640 
look like a two millimeter feet and then
we'll<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.599> ready<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> string<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.290> our<00:02:28.440> seat
