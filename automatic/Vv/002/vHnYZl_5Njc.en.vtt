00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello everyone welcome to the channel 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.270
 our China today our review of this 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.670
 4 channel helicopter in lts in 911 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.040
 classic fly sick 4 channel scheme 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.610
 that is, the helicopter flies back and forth 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.670
 up down rotates around its axis a 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.060
 also roll left-right that's what we have 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.100
 four channels 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.080
 the device goes with it 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.400
 expensive mod 2 hardware here I have 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.560
 worth and that is the left stick gas and 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.390
 turns left-right right stick it 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.220
 pitch and cohen also trimming is all 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.200
 like a standard date button 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.710
 drawn but this button is responsible 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.820
 responsible for expenses 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.739
 powered by a six finger remote 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.829
 battery and there is such a connector 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.820
 so that you can field a helicopter 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:11.870
 recharge so it charges from everywhere 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.620
 I already said that there are no problems with spare parts 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.549
 that is, I broke the fly, and not bo in a month 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.890
 even smaller 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.260
 I came a new year very replaced 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.360
 now you can fly again 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.670
 modelka quite common also 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.979
 Weakly together, I ordered batteries 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.650
 Increased capacity that is this here 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.610
 Standard battery is enhanced 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:38.390
 Capacity standard 130 milliampere hours 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.600
 in this 200 with the standard it flies 7 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.790
 minutes somewhere with this about 10 minute 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.900
 Charging accordingly is 40 for this 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.000
 somewhere an hour but it flies a little 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.580
 differently due to the fact that the battery 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.610
 he weighs more too a little more and 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.310
 so the helicopter is a little hard with it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.869
 flying is not gothic if you are not 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.640
 tried to fly with a little 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.159
 battery it does not feel but 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.799
 that's it when it flew a with this, 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.390
 two batteries you skate put 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.459
 you understand that for 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.980
 this ice is flying more hard and again I 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.720
 the center of gravity of the screw is set exactly 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.690
 center, that is, if you take it like this 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.930
 over screw this years hangs horizontally out 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.820
 the fact that the battery is longer 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.240
 that is, the center of gravity goes a little 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.970
 backwards 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.300
 the helicopter accordingly also leans 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.980
 back and you need to train it well 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 that's when you battery again with 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.380
 small to big goes that is 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.580
 there is no problem but just need not 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:46.160
 forget about it like this 4 channel 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.459
 allow except as a foot whether it is not 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 can absolutely fly a lot 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.980
 It gives pleasure but first 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.410
 queue when flying in the room that is 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.019
 the apartment in the hall is generally excellent on it 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.530
 fly on the street I tried to fly 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.180
 raised it to 30 meters but fly it 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.810
 only stands in complete calm 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.680
 since it has wind resistance 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.269
 quite weak in the apartment very well 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.140
 himself showed so the street records 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.239
 there is no flight only in the room here 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.160
 I hope you enjoy it so put 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.420
 likes subscribe to the channel 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.420
 watch how it flies
