00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.660
 there will be an unusual test drive today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.010
 the test subject is not 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.549
 car and tires new winter tires 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.090
 cordiant snow cross in iceland speak 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.699
 if you don't like the weather wait 5 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.590
 minutes will be even worse most 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 winter accidents occur at the very 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.490
 normal braking somewhere almost 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.890
 had enough longitudinal clutch it 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.950
 cross and the car goes out from under 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
 control ice comes to the rescue 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 icecool technology 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.040
 compared to the Finnish counterpart 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.010
 stopping distance shines technology a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.219
 escort is shorter by two meters 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 how this was achieved by 16 rows of thorns 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.059
 arranged in such a way that 10 spikes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.770
 is in the contact patch 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.020
 it keeps the tire from slipping in 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.050
 any directions in the center of each spike 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.489
 there is a core of carbide 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.989
 material break it ice edge 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.570
 the behavior of the pad come out but the blood 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 worthy of special praise besides thorns 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.640
 aggressive tread pattern allows 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.350
 very precise control of the car soft 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.450
 the top layer of rubber is resistant to low 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.729
 temperature contributions are the inner layer 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 much tougher it doesn't allow spikes 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.500
 get loose and squeeze inside the tire 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.040
 anchoring keeps spikes from 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.920
 fallout 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 planted z-shaped slats 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 form sharp edges increasing 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.750
 the amount of coupling edges and the tires 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.700
 closed 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.770
 central rib provides accuracy 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.049
 driving around gardens and drivers 3 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.920
 and helps the car to keep the course 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 sustainability 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.810
 now take the snowy roads spikes here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.539
 no longer play a decisive role to the rescue 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.729
 comes the technology of central snowku 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.990
 rib tire surely cuts snow 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.640
 cover and takes the snow through 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.740
 drop to the edges of the groove 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 at the same time the network of small lamels deletes 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.149
 the remaining water film releasing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.939
 contact spot flags strongly shows 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.140
 perfect grip healthy 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 radiating from the center of the tire 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.310
 grooves middle ribs allow 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.470
 tread self-cleaning and discharging 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.110
 under the wheels of your snow water to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.540
 there is another very useful 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.980
 technology on the winter road is new 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 green mix core fix 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150
 with increased silica content 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.610
 allows you to save all the properties of the tire 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.709
 at extremely low temperatures and 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.170
 increase wet grip and 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.510
 boots extreme conditions for rubber 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.360
 it's not only -50 degrees or below 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.670
 broken road is worst when 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.239
 coverage is constantly changing and in these 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.160
 conditions 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.310
 snow cross showed great 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.540
 stability and reliability if not 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.420
 open areas of ice 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.510
 nothing interferes with a given course already 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.739
 This winter, drivers will appreciate 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.350
 predictable and balanced 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.329
 car's behavior again cross 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.049
 confidently cope with emergency 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.790
 braking 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.030
 out of the way 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.920
 obstacles no complaints of comfort of 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.920
 just enjoy driving
