 [Three-dimensional liedar] 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100
 [Spilk to the smart technical solutions] 

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:15.466
 There is now a kind of self-functioning domestication robot in the house. 

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:19.566
 Where they have to face obstacles 

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.033
 And realizing where you are. 

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:27.000
 Thanks to the three-dimensional Leidar, canopy robots can draw an internal map of the house accurately, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.933
 And to recognize the reservoir of obstacles without the need to impact them. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
 [LIDAR = light + radar] 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 Leidar is a camera or device that allows measuring distances. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 It emits a laser beam that hits something across that distance 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.566
 The sensors then pick up the pulse of the reference laser beam. 

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.967
 This process is called (flight period). 

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:58.733
 So we know with finite precision the light it takes to go from point A to point B, 

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:04.366
 Our cameras measure that round back and forth in order to design a precise distance 

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:09.500
 And resend that information to the computer. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.466
 A three-dimensional Lidar device will also be able to see the scene at different times, 

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:20.200
 Detect changes, and make sure if something moves from providing accurate information about the distance they have traveled 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.733
 And to update its own software system in order to avoid impacting those things. 

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.166
 Our robotics technology now offers the opportunity to see a three-dimensional system. 

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:33.366
 These robots will become able to think for themselves, 

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:38.634
 Making decisions on the ocean and positively influencing that ocean. 

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:44.533
 Is a quantum leap in comparison to the two-dimensional system or the current situation in which everything is programmed 

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.134
 Within the fixed perimeter of the robot. 

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.300
 This technique is emerging. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.700
 We have just begun to realize the ways and means of using them. 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.533
 Self-driving cars are one of the many uses of a three-dimensional liedar. 

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.633
 You can collect cars together. 

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:04.234
 Which means you can move many cars across a certain area much faster, 

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:08.466
 Since cars have the ability to communicate with each other, they can move as one car. 

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.233
 You have a long queue of cars that move across a certain area 

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:15.733
 No one knows what the car in front will do. 

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:20.400
 We are currently working to integrate this technology into many fields and applications 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.900
 Which will improve the lives of everyone on our planet to a better level.
