00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
in front of me you know I really kind of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.550 
in front of me you know I really kind of
like<00:01:49.780> intimidated<00:01:50.780> him<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.020> stole<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.410> whole

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
like intimidated him and stole the whole

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.990 
like intimidated him and stole the whole
scene<00:01:51.800> from<00:01:52.010> him<00:01:52.160> yeah<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.400> guess<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.880> would

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
scene from him yeah I guess I would

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.510 
scene from him yeah I guess I would
employ<00:01:53.590> straight<00:01:54.590> kick<00:01:54.890> right<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.250> knee

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
employ straight kick right to the knee

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.090 
employ straight kick right to the knee
cap<00:01:55.730> trust<00:01:56.660> straighten<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.080> his<00:01:57.200> leg<00:01:57.440> because

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
cap trust straighten out his leg because

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.680 
cap trust straighten out his leg because
maybe<00:01:58.370> if<00:01:58.580> his<00:01:58.700> leg<00:01:58.910> got<00:01:59.120> straight<00:01:59.450> like<00:01:59.660> that

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
maybe if his leg got straight like that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.930 
maybe if his leg got straight like that
he<00:02:00.140> wouldn't<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.590> able<00:02:00.620> to<00:02:00.800> maybe<00:02:01.580> like<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
he wouldn't be able to maybe like the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.430 
he wouldn't be able to maybe like the
joint<00:02:02.270> would<00:02:02.480> lock<00:02:02.690> or<00:02:02.960> something<00:02:03.290> I<00:02:03.410> guess

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
joint would lock or something I guess

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.109 
joint would lock or something I guess
that<00:02:03.800> would<00:02:03.890> be<00:02:03.920> your<00:02:04.100> vessel<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:05.000> would

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
that would be your vessel what would

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.359 
that would be your vessel what would
your<00:02:05.210> strategy<00:02:05.300> be<00:02:05.740> kick<00:02:06.740> him<00:02:06.890> in<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.010> natick
