00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.119
 Thank you for Nikkei research 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.530

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.229
 Yes friend to friend 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.109
 I saw the trend of the catcher boat 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.009
 It's just a little 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.259
 Yeah 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.579
 It was not enough 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.239
 Hey 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.239
 Even though the screen is out 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.620
 The present person enters at the court 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.580
 Since then 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.580
 Let's wrap it in the same size from now on 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.690
 Actually 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.040
 Be upset 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 When matcha is originally dark and human beings are dark 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.160
 Because the place where it sets to the circle to the last is different 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.690
 is not it 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 Do the tightening again 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.970

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.920
 Ace 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.970
 I'm connecting to a TV 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.280
 That's fine 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.910
 Up to Duke 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.550
 First is the display 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 It is a person of Kameda family 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.530
 Nasdaq will be strong on the same day 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.420
 this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.910
 in addition 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.800
 The setting during this time is 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.300
 Own 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.520
 Set at a local outlet and hold at the outlet 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.170
 So you came out 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.250
 A cat was out 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.170
 3g annual average 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.779

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.419
 Quality power 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.519
 That voice output 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.909
 There is a setting called 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.649
 In the case of Germany 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.069
 In my spare time 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.599
 In the setting screen 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.599
 Quality power 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 I think I can do it well 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.829
 Quality power 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.009
 I feel the sound output 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.659
 This bird 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.659
 It's like a usb cable 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:54.399
 That voice output 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.839
 There is a certain thing 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:59.449
 In the case of the game, it has set 4th and coming late 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.059
