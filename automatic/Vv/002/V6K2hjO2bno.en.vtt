00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
due to play yeah but I feel like they

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
due to play yeah but I feel like they
exploited<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.829> range<00:00:50.039> disadvantage<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.940> TL

game<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.780> things<00:02:51.959> didn't<00:02:52.260> go<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.379> way<00:02:52.620> but

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
game and things didn't go that way but

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.349 
game and things didn't go that way but
hopefully<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.549> can<00:02:53.609> work<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.940> time<00:02:54.150> yeah

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
hopefully that can work this time yeah

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
Dom at the beginning of the game I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.500 
Dom at the beginning of the game I
thought<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.609> wasn't<00:02:59.819> gonna<00:02:59.939> go<00:03:00.120> too<00:03:00.180> well<00:03:00.450> for

him because cloud nine actually banded

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
him because cloud nine actually banded
together<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> team<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:03.750> stop<00:03:04.230> his<00:03:04.439> jungle

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.800 
together as a team to stop his jungle
route<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.129> they<00:03:05.459> ended<00:03:05.639> up<00:03:05.730> denying<00:03:06.389> him<00:03:06.659> that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
route and they ended up denying him that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.539 
route and they ended up denying him that
red<00:03:06.989> buff<00:03:07.139> early<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.650> put<00:03:07.829> him<00:03:07.980> behind<00:03:08.129> and

Diana feel like locking in the diana
that<00:03:28.049> early<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:29.069> allows<00:03:29.579> them<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.879> pick

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that early on just allows them to pick

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.490 
that early on just allows them to pick
whatever<00:03:30.209> they<00:03:30.419> want<00:03:30.599> into<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.019> they<00:03:31.169> realize

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
whatever they want into it they realize

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.020 
whatever they want into it they realize
you're<00:03:31.650> gonna<00:03:31.739> have<00:03:31.980> global<00:03:32.760> pressure

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you're gonna have global pressure

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.420 
you're gonna have global pressure
possibly<00:03:33.900> double<00:03:34.199> global<00:03:34.530> will<00:03:35.099> be<00:03:35.190> double

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
possibly double global will be double

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.559 
possibly double global will be double
global<00:03:35.699> but<00:03:35.819> then<00:03:35.909> if<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.090> have<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> shin<00:03:36.480> on

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
global but then if you have a shin on

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.180 
global but then if you have a shin on
top<00:03:36.599> of<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.139> guess<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.709> much<00:03:37.919> easier<00:03:37.949> to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
top of it I guess it's much easier to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.500 
top of it I guess it's much easier to
get<00:03:38.310> down<00:03:38.459> there<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:38.730> still<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.389> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
get down there but still then you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.849 
get down there but still then you
realize<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.959> name<00:03:40.109> of<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.290> game<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> realize

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
realize the name of the game you realize

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.559 
realize the name of the game you realize
the<00:03:40.949> name<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.190> game<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.430> okay<00:03:41.909> bottom<00:03:42.359> mid

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
the name of the game is okay bottom mid

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.539 
the name of the game is okay bottom mid
pressure<00:03:42.919> jump<00:03:43.919> around<00:03:43.979> those<00:03:44.220> two<00:03:44.370> areas

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
pressure jump around those two areas

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.580 
pressure jump around those two areas
that's<00:03:45.239> going<00:03:45.479> to<00:03:45.540> be<00:03:45.629> easy<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.989> pull<00:03:46.199> off<00:03:46.229> I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
that's going to be easy to pull off I

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.559 
that's going to be easy to pull off I
feel<00:03:47.340> like<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.639> wait<00:03:47.849> on<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.090> Diana<00:03:48.389> pick

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
feel like you wait on the Diana pick

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.640 
feel like you wait on the Diana pick
they<00:03:48.690> could<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:48.959> locked<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.260> their<00:03:49.290> jungler

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
they could have locked in their jungler

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.080 
they could have locked in their jungler
there<00:03:49.859> they<00:03:50.010> had<00:03:50.129> already<00:03:50.370> seen<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.760> jungle

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
there they had already seen the jungle

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.909 
there they had already seen the jungle
on<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.359> side<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.569> Team<00:03:51.870> Liquid<00:03:52.019> locking<00:03:52.799> the

elise their weight on your Diana pixie

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.509 
elise their weight on your Diana pixie
what<00:03:55.109> they<00:03:55.260> bring<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.799> then<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.129> pivot<00:03:56.430> on

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
what they bring in and then you pivot on

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.979 
what they bring in and then you pivot on
your<00:03:56.669> strategy<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> felt<00:03:57.419> like<00:03:57.479> they<00:03:57.599> gave<00:03:57.750> too

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
your strategy I felt like they gave too

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.869 
your strategy I felt like they gave too
many<00:03:58.109> cards<00:03:58.530> over<00:03:58.829> and<00:03:59.010> that's<00:03:59.430> going<00:03:59.699> to<00:03:59.760> be<00:03:59.849> a

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
many cards over and that's going to be a

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.430 
many cards over and that's going to be a
lane<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.120> you're<00:04:00.389> not<00:04:00.659> exactly<00:04:01.109> winning

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
lane that you're not exactly winning

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.930 
lane that you're not exactly winning
