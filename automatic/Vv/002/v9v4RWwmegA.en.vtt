ton of damage I'm using this method for

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670 
ton of damage I'm using this method for
future<00:01:45.299> strikes<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> probably<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
future strikes you can probably get a

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.590 
future strikes you can probably get a
bunch<00:01:47.039> of<00:01:47.250> kills<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.820> solo<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.479> the

nightfall<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.469> really<00:01:49.799> easy<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.729> once

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
nightfall really really easy so once

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
nightfall really really easy so once
again<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.539> need<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.109> waste<00:01:52.439> all

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
again all you need to do is waste all

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
again all you need to do is waste all
the<00:01:52.799> ammo<00:01:52.950> or<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.609> all<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.789> ammo<00:01:53.969> in<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
the ammo or use up all the ammo in the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
the ammo or use up all the ammo in the
special<00:01:54.630> weapon<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.469> switch<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.189> ice

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
special weapon you want switch the ice

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
special weapon you want switch the ice
breaker<00:01:56.789> let<00:01:57.240> regenerate<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> few<00:01:57.990> bullets<00:01:58.289> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
breaker let regenerate a few bullets I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.840 
breaker let regenerate a few bullets I
think<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> minimum<00:01:59.100> amount<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.340> bullets<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
think the minimum amount of bullets you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.219 
think the minimum amount of bullets you
have<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.179> regenerate<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> ice<00:02:00.929> breaker

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
have to regenerate with the ice breaker

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
have to regenerate with the ice breaker
is<00:02:01.469> actually<00:02:01.920> four<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.060> five<00:02:03.359> bullets<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
is actually four or five bullets it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
is actually four or five bullets it
really<00:02:04.109> depends<00:02:04.590> board<00:02:05.130> should<00:02:05.340> regenerate

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
really depends board should regenerate

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.459 
really depends board should regenerate
about<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> much<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.020> switch<00:02:07.200> back

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
about that much you can just switch back

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.170 
about that much you can just switch back
to<00:02:07.500> your<00:02:07.859> other<00:02:08.009> special<00:02:08.580> weapon<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.090> you

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
to your other special weapon and you

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.970 
to your other special weapon and you
will<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.450> full<00:02:09.750> ammo<00:02:10.110> or<00:02:10.260> however<00:02:10.620> many

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
will have full ammo or however many

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.040 
will have full ammo or however many
bullets<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:12.150> waited<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.810> to
