00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.930 

hi<00:00:00.510> I'm<00:00:00.719> Alicia<00:00:00.989> Molik

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.750 

I<00:00:17.030> think<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.200> matchup<00:00:18.590> between<00:00:18.680> Stephens<00:00:19.430> and

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
I think the matchup between Stephens and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.910 
I think the matchup between Stephens and
as<00:00:20.120> a<00:00:20.180> renter<00:00:20.690> will<00:00:20.900> be<00:00:21.050> an<00:00:21.140> interesting<00:00:21.740> one<00:00:21.860> I

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
as a renter will be an interesting one I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.880 
as a renter will be an interesting one I
think<00:00:22.100> typically<00:00:22.730> our<00:00:23.000> rancor<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.410> stronger

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
think typically our rancor is a stronger

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.160 
think typically our rancor is a stronger
background<00:00:25.130> fire<00:00:25.670> there's<00:00:26.600> a<00:00:26.690> poster<00:00:27.050> that

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
background fire there's a poster that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.080 
background fire there's a poster that
Sloane<00:00:27.500> Stephens<00:00:27.830> I<00:00:28.130> know<00:00:28.250> she<00:00:28.310> loves<00:00:28.730> and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
Sloane Stephens I know she loves and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.120 
Sloane Stephens I know she loves and
enjoys<00:00:29.210> running<00:00:29.750> around<00:00:30.020> and<00:00:30.380> losing<00:00:30.590> her<00:00:30.860> for

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
enjoys running around and losing her for

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.640 
enjoys running around and losing her for
her<00:00:31.310> I<00:00:31.640> think<00:00:32.090> what<00:00:32.419> plays<00:00:32.690> into<00:00:33.320> Sloane

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
her I think what plays into Sloane

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.410 
her I think what plays into Sloane
Stephens<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.309> man<00:00:34.520> just<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.850> fact<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:35.180> she

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
Stephens is man just the fact that she

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420 
Stephens is man just the fact that she
really<00:00:35.690> uses<00:00:35.870> her<00:00:36.170> shape<00:00:36.500> extremely<00:00:37.220> well

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
really uses her shape extremely well

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.270 
really uses her shape extremely well
because<00:00:38.360> she<00:00:38.930> can<00:00:39.080> handle<00:00:39.230> both<00:00:39.590> balls<00:00:39.920> but<00:00:40.220> I

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
because she can handle both balls but I

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.920 
because she can handle both balls but I
think<00:00:40.520> that<00:00:40.820> will<00:00:41.030> make<00:00:41.210> us<00:00:41.420> struggle<00:00:41.840> a

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
think that will make us struggle a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.960 
think that will make us struggle a
little<00:00:42.050> bit<00:00:42.200> more<00:00:42.530> Sloane<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.250> a<00:00:43.370> lot<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.760> pop

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
little bit more Sloane it's a lot of pop

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.330 
little bit more Sloane it's a lot of pop
spin<00:00:44.300> she<00:00:44.900> can<00:00:45.050> really<00:00:45.260> work<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.890> ball<00:00:46.070> high

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
spin she can really work the ball high

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.190 
spin she can really work the ball high
and<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.820> will<00:00:46.970> really<00:00:47.270> push<00:00:47.540> beat<00:00:47.840> get<00:00:48.020> back

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
and that will really push beat get back

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.920 
and that will really push beat get back
in<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.470> court<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:49.010> slow<00:00:49.699> man<00:00:49.970> has<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.449> talent

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
in the court a slow man has the talent

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.079 
in the court a slow man has the talent
and<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.110> ability<00:00:51.170> I<00:00:51.620> think<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:52.070> step<00:00:52.370> up<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:52.820> I

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
and the ability I think to step up but I

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.790 
and the ability I think to step up but I
think<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.720> other<00:00:53.809> factor<00:00:54.199> is<00:00:54.230> Sloane<00:00:54.620> will

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
think the other factor is Sloane will

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.710 
think the other factor is Sloane will
want<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.220> bit<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.550> revenge<00:00:55.879> from<00:00:56.120> last<00:00:56.360> year

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.950 

I<00:01:03.340> think<00:01:04.340> the<00:01:04.460> crowd<00:01:04.730> here<00:01:05.450> in<00:01:05.540> Australia

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
I think the crowd here in Australia

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.050 
I think the crowd here in Australia
typically<00:01:06.380> I<00:01:06.410> go<00:01:06.950> for<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.220> underdog<00:01:07.670> so

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
typically I go for the underdog so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.260 
typically I go for the underdog so
despite<00:01:09.250> vika<00:01:10.250> winning<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.610> number<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.970> times

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
despite vika winning a number of times

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.270 
despite vika winning a number of times
here<00:01:11.690> in<00:01:11.840> Australia<00:01:12.380> I<00:01:12.410> think<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.830> crowd<00:01:13.070> will

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
here in Australia I think the crowd will

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.180 
here in Australia I think the crowd will
really<00:01:13.550> enjoy<00:01:13.930> watching<00:01:14.930> one<00:01:15.800> of<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:15.980> newer

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
really enjoy watching one of the newer

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.250 
really enjoy watching one of the newer
players<00:01:16.550> on<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.970> scene<00:01:17.210> now<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.420> know<00:01:17.600> Sloane

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
players on the scene now I know Sloane

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.080 
players on the scene now I know Sloane
is<00:01:18.440> already<00:01:18.710> well<00:01:19.040> established<00:01:19.190> inside<00:01:19.940> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
is already well established inside the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.750 
is already well established inside the
top<00:01:20.270> 20<00:01:20.450> top<00:01:20.810> 10<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.980> underdog<00:01:22.400> here<00:01:22.640> in

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
top 20 top 10 but the underdog here in

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.940 
top 20 top 10 but the underdog here in
Australia<00:01:23.240> is<00:01:23.330> no<00:01:23.570> better<00:01:23.780> favorite<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:24.650> I've

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
Australia is no better favorite so I've

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.040 
Australia is no better favorite so I've
no<00:01:25.160> doubt<00:01:25.430> that<00:01:25.700> it'll<00:01:26.210> be<00:01:26.300> very<00:01:26.510> fair<00:01:27.020> and

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
no doubt that it'll be very fair and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.260 
no doubt that it'll be very fair and
then<00:01:27.410> maybe<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.800> few<00:01:27.890> critical<00:01:28.310> times<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
then maybe a few critical times the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.959 
then maybe a few critical times the
crowd<00:01:29.540> may<00:01:29.780> just<00:01:30.080> sway<00:01:31.040> towards

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.880 

I<00:01:35.999> think<00:01:36.689> meat<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.380> best<00:01:37.560> ways<00:01:37.740> in

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
I think meat was one of the best ways in

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.959 
I think meat was one of the best ways in
the<00:01:37.950> world<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.369> she<00:01:38.490> doesn't<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
the world because she doesn't have a

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.270 
the world because she doesn't have a
weakness<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.619> makes<00:01:40.950> her<00:01:41.249> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
weakness and that's what makes her so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
weakness and that's what makes her so
good<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.659> can't<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.990> passive<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.829> win

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
good so you can't be passive to win

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
good so you can't be passive to win
against<00:01:44.250> her<00:01:44.490> can't<00:01:45.420> second-guess<00:01:45.899> yourself

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
against her can't second-guess yourself

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
against her can't second-guess yourself
all<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> players<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.280> managed<00:01:47.969> to<00:01:48.060> get

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
all the players that managed to get

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.749 
all the players that managed to get
Windsor<00:01:48.719> Azarenka<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:50.069> the<00:01:50.189> ones<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.670> are

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
Windsor Azarenka are the ones that are

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.399 
Windsor Azarenka are the ones that are
preferred<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> step<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.749> the<00:01:51.840> plate<00:01:52.109> keep

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
preferred to step up to the plate keep

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319 
preferred to step up to the plate keep
the<00:01:52.530> points<00:01:52.859> short<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.549> longer<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.969> rallies

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the points short the longer the rallies

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.779 
the points short the longer the rallies
go<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.380> longer<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> engage<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.490> rallies

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
go and the longer you engage in rallies

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.459 
go and the longer you engage in rallies
I<00:01:56.939> think<00:01:57.179> it<00:01:57.329> always<00:01:57.479> favors<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.140> throw

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
I think it always favors the throw

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.599 
I think it always favors the throw
Azarenka<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.020> beeper<00:02:01.439> keep<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> points

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
Azarenka so the beeper keep the points

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.929 
Azarenka so the beeper keep the points
short<00:02:02.789> execute<00:02:03.479> well<00:02:03.750> hit<00:02:04.709> hard<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.340> early<00:02:05.819> in

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
short execute well hit hard and early in

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.990 
short execute well hit hard and early in
the<00:02:06.060> rally<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.750> likes<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.200> Maria<00:02:08.000> Serena

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the rally the likes of Maria Serena

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.999 
the rally the likes of Maria Serena
Williams<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.170> big<00:02:10.349> leaders<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.979> have

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
Williams all the big leaders we have

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.600 
Williams all the big leaders we have
over<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> place<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:14.989> think<00:02:15.989> he<00:02:16.799> has<00:02:17.519> an

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
over the place I think he has an

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.280 
over the place I think he has an
opportunity<00:02:18.150> maybe<00:02:18.329> to<00:02:18.540> step<00:02:18.959> into<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
opportunity maybe to step into the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.559 
opportunity maybe to step into the
second<00:02:19.650> service<00:02:20.040> line<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.670> by<00:02:20.910> no<00:02:21.090> means<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
second service line and by no means is

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.839 
second service line and by no means is
it<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.780> weakness<00:02:21.989> but<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.980> definitely<00:02:23.160> comes<00:02:23.579> in

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
it a weakness but it definitely comes in

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.809 
it a weakness but it definitely comes in
a<00:02:23.910> lesser<00:02:24.180> place<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.930> think<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.220> forehead<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
a lesser place I think the forehead of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.660 
a lesser place I think the forehead of
Sloane<00:02:27.060> Stephens<00:02:27.329> we're<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:28.049> worried<00:02:28.670> as

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
Sloane Stephens we're really worried as

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.160 
Sloane Stephens we're really worried as
a<00:02:29.700> reckless<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.269> think<00:02:30.540> people<00:02:30.870> will<00:02:30.989> look<00:02:31.109> to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
a reckless I think people will look to

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.110 
a reckless I think people will look to
play<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> back<00:02:31.859> end<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.340> I've<00:02:32.430> more<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.819> slowly

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
play the back end so I've more of slowly

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.780 
play the back end so I've more of slowly
keep<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.660> away<00:02:33.750> from<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.290> forehead<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:35.250> empty
