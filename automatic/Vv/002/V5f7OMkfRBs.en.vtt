project today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:12.630> started<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.259> scale<00:00:13.559> tool<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
to get started with a scale tool and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.220 
to get started with a scale tool and
open<00:00:14.219> set<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:15.210> scale<00:00:15.450> tool<00:00:15.660> allows<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:15.990> to

open set the scale tool allows you to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.019 
open set the scale tool allows you to
change<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.710> size<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.160> mass<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.550> model<00:00:17.850> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
change the size and mass of the model so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.370

preview static pose this is a very
important<00:02:33.370> step<00:02:33.550> when<00:02:33.730> using<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.120> scale<00:02:34.360> tool

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
important step when using the scale tool

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.180 
important step when using the scale tool
because<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.020> will<00:02:35.170> allow<00:02:35.260> us<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.740> visualize

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
because it will allow us to visualize

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.710 
because it will allow us to visualize
our<00:02:36.340> results<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.210> we<00:02:37.390> can<00:02:37.540> make<00:02:37.690> sure

we've<00:02:38.020> accurately<00:02:38.620> scaled<00:02:38.830> our<00:02:39.040> model<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.550> to
