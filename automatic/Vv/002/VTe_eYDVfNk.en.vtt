00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 which shows you 1000 minutes of waiting 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.329

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.960
 Hello 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.070
 having said that today I am here to redo the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 once in my back 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
 I promised you and above all did not 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.289
 I was looking forward to talking about my death 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.210
 what's in my bag then 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 My favorite bag is precisely this 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.119
 it was Michael Kors and I took it for two years 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.770
 does to the fidenza village that that in 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.540
 that classroom and we say with all the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.390
 best brands in which I go many 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.729
 times 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.850
 in emilia romagna therefore precisely this 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.620
 here was michael kors is brown is indeed 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.180
 the shoulder strap that can be removed in 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.460
 this way so now I take it off for 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.530
 community takes off so it's usually me 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.590
 if I don't put it the port is there I put it 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.390
 at least there was always in the bag 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.470
 behind they are ruining a lot of 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.659
 handles because he really had 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.820
 a lot and looks like a favorite bag 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.610
 I would like to use only this one but seen 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.650
 that other bubbles if I do a little change e 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.570
 nothing more I state that I have not changed 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.450
 what fits us in the sense that we do not 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.280
 I put and added reduce them I have not 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.160
 removed the things that were inside then 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.100
 I'll show you how inside it is 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.429
 made like that to two trannies here for the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.560
 cell phone for things you will see here at one 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.830
 pocket with a zipper and two others 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.240
 pockets similar to those next to the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.530
 first thing we find in my bag 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.210
 it's a bottle of water 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.670
 I always carry a bottle of water in 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.790
 ride in the summer especially because col 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.820
 hot need to drink and the wallet 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.610
 obviously this is carpisa piquet e 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:27.770
 it has only a hinge with peoples i 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.930
 compartments of is empty I don't have big money 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.210
 which sees therefore this is more 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.620
 very simple white a little dirty because 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.060
 I use it a lot but it is with the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.530
 sunglasses case in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.720
 this case there are in fact of 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.340
 actions alone but usually when me 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 I bet the glasses in the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.240
 custody and me alone in the face 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.160
 because it can never be missing in any 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.070
 abortion is the cigarette butts are not 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.420
 can never be missing in my bag and 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.150
 this because it costs almost ending 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.550
 in fact, however, anxiety is rising 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.980
 various neighbors because they are purchased 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.320
 of loading sediments give pharmacists 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:09.860
 may have happy in the bag and or 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.050
 these are various types of medicine 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.180
 for a stomachache this for the ache 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.910
 by car and this is for headaches 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.260
 therefore they cannot have medicine and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.150
 my bag 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.450
 I usually keep them in this pocket 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.080
 here I do not know for now to be and headphones for 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.580
 the music a good cardboard but sile fq 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.220
 that for music there are always in the 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.350
 my bag obviously and above all in 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.970
 winter are in the folder and remain 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.860
 permanently in the folder 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.600
 they come but take them away because if I do 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.210
 in the morning he doesn't listen to music before 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.490
 the school has a lip balm if true 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.530
 in short childbirth medicines lip balm the 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.270
 I always carry it behind when my lips 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.950
 chapped and in this period 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.170
 especially in the season change me 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.850
 they say and chapped lips night says 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.940
 toothpick eyes various things 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.450
 in the skins and see if there is something 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.450
 a penny 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.820
 nothing indeed there is something to this here 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.510
 it is practically that little diamond that it is 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.520
 puts in the headphone case here 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.650
 in the headphone jack that 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.750
 so Sunday and cover it from the dust 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.519
 I have one here is one should be 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.830
 on the desk they took off first 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.450
 anyway I have a lot of them around 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.150
 because I like to keep the glitter 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.130
 even in light the lips will give us this 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.350
 ber always in my bag he takes mind 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.110
 because precisely if there is an opportunity 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.930
 particular and ninth behind the tricks 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.390
 telecenter at least a little difficult lips 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.250
 makes the mirror the case and can never 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.290
 obviously missing the bag I am leaving 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.290
 always a mirror behind in this 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:58.310
 then in the paul pocket from that zipper 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.310
 there are a range of sanitary napkins 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.760
 expect to account for the series that no 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.600
 you do n't have the anxiety of having recycling 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:14.340
 there are only being 25 st ranges 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 cotton day night medium panty liner ie 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.320
 there is everything in the world of sanitary napkins 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.030
 these networks in absorbed sinni 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.430
 ask me the usual there is also the 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.710
 ventolin that would be that ferrazzi but 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.220
 because he suffers from asthma but now he is not there 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.140
 I know where pieces die for boys 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.160
 then for the next video I had 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.840
 going to make a team 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.760
 you should subscribe to comments or even 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.530
 on instagram then he will publish a question 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.360
 or in private or wherever you want 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.940
 enough on facebook because not 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.940
 I use it more a question that begins 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.950
 with the star the first time the first 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.110
 once you've done this the first thing 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.030
 Once you've done this, you have to 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.070
 come up with these rather strange questions 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.310
 also that they do not exist however that against 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.680
 the same then hashtag the first time 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.040
 what a question and I will answer in the next 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.570

 so let me know if I like it and maybe 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.510
 I could continue these types of 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.060
 article because my ideas are a lot 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.010
 very sick that we could do it 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.440
 so many articles of that kind power 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.510
 enclose them in a book 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.920
