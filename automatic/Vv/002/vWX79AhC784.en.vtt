00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.419
 hello to judas how are you already know that I 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.490
 I am helping you your best option in 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.470
 technology and good thing that I bring you 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.530
 a very, very fast video because it's just 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.940
 leave the new v6 and on twitter I 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.430
 they were sending many questions 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.190
 on how to update this new version 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:25.330
 what is ios 6 so let's see how 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:26.470
 do this well first of all what 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.840
 first you have to know is that 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.369
 obviously v6 is only available for 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.240
 the devices that appear in 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.319
 screen 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.859
 if you have add to these devices 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:39.129
 then we can start in this case 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.109
 example we have an ipad 3 and an iphone 4s 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.670
 so we 're going to see how it's updated 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.859
 something very important that needs to be done 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.659
 before updating is to be sure of 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.179
 that we are already connected to a Wi-Fi network 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.309
 there are two methods to install v6 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.260
 we are going to see the easiest and to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.350
 this has to have installed the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.690
 ios5 any version of ios 5 for 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.519
 can install this version of ios 6 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.859
 then well if they comply with the 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.700
 requirements let's start we have to 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 go to be 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.010
 to you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 check that they are on a Wi-Fi network 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.000
 I told them and then they're going to go to general or 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
 general 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.110
 and from there they will click where it says 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.350
 software update or update of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.369
 system seems to me that is click 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.780
 and there they will appear 6 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.299
 they are simply going to click down what 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.490
 in the state not here they explain the 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.350
 characteristics that brings but the only 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.110
 what they have to do is 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.810
 do not go in this that means download 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.030
 and install if you want they can read everything 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.140
 this 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 I do not think they want and then accept the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.010
 terms and conditions well when 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 let's start to download we are going to 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.170
 ask that please bold character 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.580
 estruch iphone or ipad to the current 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.200
 frequent this is only done through 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.940
 of wifi not for all the amount of data 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.050
 that you have to download but how do you 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.680
 he said you have to connect it to the current 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.680
 for 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.470
 to save battery and not go to 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.780
 failing this facility and we will 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.819
 replicate ok what you are going to do first is 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.920
 that will start to download the software and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.650
 later I start to install 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.870
 then we are already downloading ios 6 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.569
 there he will tell us how long it takes and 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.580
 already returned for the installation of this 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.870
 right that access and back for the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 configuration fine when it has 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.489
 finished downloading this new ios 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.240
 alone is going to restart our 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.390
 device approximately took about 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.160
 15 minutes 20 in install and download 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.200
 until this process that you are seeing 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.750
 so far forward a little to do 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.890
 faster the video since the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.080
 go ahead so they have passed 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.750
 approximately another 10 minutes in what 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.340
 that this new aigÃ¼es was installed and then 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.060
 we will see the screen that already 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.620
 we can use nothing else let me connect to 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.240
 me to my account 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.370
 why 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.370
 accept the terms to accept 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.700
 is updating icloud a role that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.820
 let's configure two sides things and we already 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.110
 we can apply starting ipad start at 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.400
 use the ipad and there it is is aigÃ¼es 6 already 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.400
 we have it installed 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.200
 there you can see that I no longer have the maps 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.780
 from google to see are the maps the ios and 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.490
 that the youtube application is no longer 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.380
 among other things 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.450
 the second way to install it is 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.670
 connect it to itunes and click on 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.950
 update as long as we have the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.280
