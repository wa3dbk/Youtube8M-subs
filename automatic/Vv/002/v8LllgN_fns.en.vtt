00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
when applying my foundations I put them

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.730

get like a foundation solid thing

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.620 
get like a foundation solid thing
because<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.610> messes<00:03:07.030> up<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.270> morning

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and I feel in some cases he gets into

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.870 
and I feel in some cases he gets into
the<00:03:10.480> skin<00:03:11.460> so<00:03:13.560> that's<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.070> rich<00:03:15.640> liquid

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
the skin so that's the rich liquid
