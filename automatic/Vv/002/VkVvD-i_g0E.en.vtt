00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 originally the Latvian stage of the world series 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.480
 this year they planned to spend in riga 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.490
 everything went to that but achieving the goal 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.200
 prevented bad weather throughout 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.570
 several days the capital of Latvia walked 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.969
 torrential rains which led the track into 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.529
 terrible condition the organizers did 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.660
 all possible to competition 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.850
 Still held in Riga but on Saturday 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 August 16, the jury decided 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.439
 move stage in Daugavpils reason 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.699
 technical nature unfortunately 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.369
 storm sewer 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.570
 but it is by primary estimates let's say 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.890
 could not resist these five days of rain and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.460
 one turn swam in spite of everything 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.559
 diligence 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.629
 last days have been taken 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 heroically there let's say efforts against 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.809
 manually practically tomilino coating on 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 one turn 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.860
 but no less in the morning sir on floated everything 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.350
 equal groundwater somehow 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 got the race had to bring 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 Daugavpils did seemingly impossible 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 less than a day coordinated 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 collective stadium locomotive and society 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 speedway gram at of latvia succeeded all 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 organize top in history 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.270
 already had a similar case then the stage 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
 World Series from Germany transferred to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 poland but would you count one week on 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.790
 Daugavpils training was less 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.030
 the day we are ready always here them 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.420
 racing but more difficult of course the grand prix but 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.240
 anyway everyone knows what he wants 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.220
 do no less as saying more 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.659
 do think there would be less time 20 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 despite changing venue 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.930
 competition many fans in the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.060
 including foreign ones 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.890
 come in debt tales pay 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 attention of those fans who have acquired 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.439
 tickets to the league stage but did not come to ours 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 city from 18 to 22 august you can 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.850
 hand over tickets at the place of purchase 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.530
 either in the stadium locomotive office or in 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.960
 ticket office whites service and return 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 funds spent by another 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.850
 unexpected event will be remembered this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.450
 Speedway Grand Prix 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.189
 about an hour before 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 competition in the closed park was 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.600
 conducted a test for alcohol among drivers 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 and the only one who did not pass was 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 young australian athlete darsi 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.569
 word and basically costs him 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.640
 say thanks so much as in his place 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.580
 eventually drove our first spare key as 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.290
 the spudgy cop 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 it was he who pleased the Latvian 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.820
 fans stage world series in our 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.800
 the city was held 6 times during this time 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.940
 only two riders were able to get into 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.730
 eight of the strongest 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.860
 he is the Lebedev and Grigory of the Lagoon Akio 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.070
 Stas managed to enter the top five 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.960
 sunday he scored 10 points in order 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.600
 to reach the final of the Latvian stage 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.090
 he lacked quite a bit of spare 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.760
 be not very I think not everyone 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.540
 like to be sitting waiting for your chance and 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.410
 when will you get it when i found out 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.970
 I will go with the grid of course delighted 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.360
 tuned rode like in training not all 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.910
 it turned out of course well, basically satisfied 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.800
 but the 7th race was just ahead of the extravaganza 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.040
 some paterson beat martin 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.020
 Smolensk 3 his opponent and if 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.630
 on the first bend, this position lost something 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:11.220
 somehow briskly able to return leading 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.880
 positions managed to take a good start 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.580
 good to accelerate on the first corner 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.980
 broke away from rivals won the race 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:26.860
 There was a lot of broths and what was not enough 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.010
 semi final I don't know just had to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.870
 weaker anyway tried fought did 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.580
 all I could 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.900
 I lost a little bit I think nothing 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.560
 terrible there is still something to suffer whether 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 them and then 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.010
 Anji Lebedev wild card holder 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.200
 this time was unable to 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.019
 compete with the world's elite 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.320

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.730
 he took only 16th place driver is not true 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.080
 very upset the most important 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.209
 competition ahead of him 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.970
