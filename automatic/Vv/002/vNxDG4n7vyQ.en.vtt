00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.700
 you were you this summer I'm gone 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.559
 of Thailand plan after all this 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.059
 work anyway I needed to 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.710
 rest a little bit this work we 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.089
 present you tonight thank you very much 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.630
 to be with us on France 2 for 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.820
 square root that comes out tomorrow it's 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.560
 your second album what I hope 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.210
 although there will be a third then 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.859
 three years ago you propose us to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.250
 to dance then we dance everyone 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.929
 remember it's pretty rare 2-2 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.340
 single from the album coming out tomorrow they 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.170
 have already come out who are already 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.610
 tubes we do not know anything else about this 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.410
 album we'll know in a few hours 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.379
 now it's quite rare to practice 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.150
 like that not well after I think he 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.829
 must not follow the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.149
 already pre- established shackles and I think that 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.329
 that's my way of working in the 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.089
 music also the styles and the and and then 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.129
 the categories is good for for 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.260
 target to understand and then after I 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.730
 believe that it is necessary especially not to 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.039
 do not stop at those married the agreement 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.149
 you just have to move forward 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.440
 just create his little way if we 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.179
 gets there and who does what it is not bad 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.530
 of way so far small 

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:07.390
 cheese anyway your first album 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.490
 three years ago we will come back on your 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.899
 course with nicolas the sailor and 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
 jean francois monier in particular on 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.619
 on your debut and we will have maybe 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.789
 discover for some that finally 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.090
 you have propelled himself 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.090
 watch 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.049
 it's a summer tube that does not look like 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.119
 to no other 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.979
 the realistic lyrics that tells the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.350
 difficult absence of a father on a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.520
 almost happy dancing rhythm where is your 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.369
 dad kill me your dad without even having to 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.130
 talk to him he knows what's wrong i 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.609
 you will not dredge the singer is 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.469
 stromae 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.759
 a young Belgian of 28 years 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:54.709
 musical critics have quickly made 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.709
 compare to jacques brel same gesture 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.420
 same accent same writing style even 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.250
 theme loneliness upset loves 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.810
 there is a side which Belgian in that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.640
 obviously we think of brel when we 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.110
 hear the voice of stromae especially on 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 wonderful pieces that are 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.099
 really very brazilian but if it was 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.989
 what if it was just pastiche 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.610
 would not have success he mostly 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.680
 to the very young public 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.810
 the young audience loves this singer who him 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.220
 looks like people his age there 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.950
 walks his instruments in his 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.190
 computer keyboard binder a note of madness 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.569
 anywhere he composes 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.980
 if success allows him to work 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.130
 with the greatest musicians 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.389
 he will never let go of his keyboard I 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.910
 think I can not betray my 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:42.239
 nation the nation of electronics that's 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.780
 difficult it's my way of 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.209
 Express myself 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 three years ago bold go-to-all 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.060
 simple radio assistant he puts his 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.200
 compositions on the antenna with the base he 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 come see and listen tell me what 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.690
 you think 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.340
 and on entering the room I heard 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.730
 the notes to seven at the time so we 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.660
 dance the same evening hurts to pass 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.170
 and we saw 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.170
 perfect
