00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.150
 you people said to john doe one 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.129
 is found for a short video on 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.990
 destiny's by a train for you that's 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.820
 is fine for nothing all that goes nickel 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.949
 g1 potatoes and we left today 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.480
 for a little video about styles there 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.490
 in black this week for a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.670
 new series yes guys to a 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.800
 new series v nor black solo but this 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.260
 once in speed run here you have been 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.449
 Many ask me to redo 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.190
 solo blacks it's very nice but I 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.359
 have already done everything and in video so I 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.679
 think it would have been fortunately 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.929
 redo them so I will exchange 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.699
 concept i'm having fun every week at 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.339
 do live so had during my stream 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.409
 it's small black in speed run on 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.389
 starts with tannic it starts with 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.850
 the last one is good for a 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:54.469
 small 5 minutes and 49 seconds 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.239
 I mean in his precise game that 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.159
 I could have frankly already 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.729
 improved I would have done more honestly 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.809
 below but I just 5049 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.319
 and I will explain a little bit 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.440
 thereafter 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.870
 so here is already firstly I'm going 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.000
 tell you one thing I could have done the 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.500
 first phase of run with the midd a and 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.760
 you will see that I will be cash at 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.450
 the mower is once again I you 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.120
 explain why 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.070
 because in fact not this speed run the 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.290
 time I win with the mid to run 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.310
 the faster I lose it after changing 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.730
 monster ch and put it back in the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.730
 reaper 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.170
 so leave me to waste my time 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.340
 that I stay with the mower as 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.140
 I do not waste time on mobs 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.370
 live I chained them the soonest 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 possible and it saves me a time 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.470
 crazy here first and I would like to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.760
 power is precisely this 5000 49 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.370
 why I could have improved it 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.710
 I did 5040 knowing that I was leaving 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.940
 in bloom this trail 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.520
 I had made a first try actually if 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.900
 you want in stream Tuesday night I had 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 does seven minutes 36 first ride 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980
 first dark night I did 7036 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.870
 and then happened the next day I'm told 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.530
 ah I can do a lot better 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.240
 sure and certain 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 so I relaunched those who challenge 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.400
 at the end of between eight and twelve tests I 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.600
 believe I released this five minutes 49 and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 I tell you at times you 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.480
 see that I could have won by 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.850
 example in this room where I am in 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.350
 evolving there I could have won 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.700
 between 3 and 5 seconds then you have 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 to tell you it's nothing at all but it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.460
 could have won them 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 you will see it some times I 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.580
 you explained then I exhausted I you 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.450
 explain some things also by the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 following that I will not speak that of the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 gameplay 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.290
 So here I am, I had a lot of luck 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.240
 actually on its resources while 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 the mobs in fact it's dark on me at 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.930
 instead of going somewhere else but there you 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.000
 see that I got a bug and that's 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.320
 what made me lose time is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.300
 that at some point I think it's 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.680
 there I'm going to shoot their yellow bus and 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.750
 Look, I'm in the middle of it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.209
 every time I stay not one I am 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.700
 on it and it does not take any damage then 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.470
 I do not know why maybe jealous 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.410
 I still among ladle after mounting 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.520
 after rec rec in short i have something that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.020
 I do not think so I think rather than 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.970
 saab purpose that 's good for 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.830
 change and loose so I lost 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.510
 of time watching again I 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.640
 shoot right in the boss's head he does not 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.019
 takes the view I take nothing 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.060
 in his head again just the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.350
 boom it takes nothing here you've seen 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.040
 the number of balls he has for him 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.739
 was not taken 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.940
 it was completely gay I had 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.110
 do that while the servers is in 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.980
 maintenance I still had access to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.910
 games I do not know why but 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 it was there are a lot of people who 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.640
 did not have that at the moment 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.350
 there I think she is good big 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.670
 problem that we will say that the vision 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.160
 nothing at the level of the first room 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.320
 I lost between 5 and 10 seconds even 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.920
 a crappy ccf what I lost as 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.080
 time just because of bugs and for the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.340
 remains in fact I have not really lost any of 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.350
 time overall for their sg tg 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.640
 it's not bad the only place where 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.150
 I could have saved time on the 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.180
 darkeners I could have won between 10 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.230
 and 15 seconds easily yeah we're gonna 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.940
 say that between 10 and 15 seconds 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.600
 because you are going to see bluntly 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.610
 given I had when you play is at 3 I 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.290
 are going to be two three balls from the EU's 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.190
 kill him and actually I was attacked 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.650
 by the words that I have to slow down 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.730
 lose 5 10 seconds of clean and him 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.519
 to fart a dough into three balls 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.630
 to kill him so basically it's still 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.650
 10 15 seconds lost but in all 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.569
 I'm at 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.099
 basically that's what I lost we're going 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.489
 say between we'll say twenty or so 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.930
 seconds 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.310
 if you want to have the thing so 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.269
 I could have improved by 20 seconds 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.439
 but knowing that I was doing in stream 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.290
 between eight and twelve tries 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.879
 time and suddenly low as I wanted 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.410
 to change a bit that with the 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.030
 players we are learning more all the 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.739
 time all night at a speedrun to 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.910
 every time we do it again even if 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.380
 I succeed I start again in a nutshell 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.440
 stop pretty redundant 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.430
 so I preferred to change and so that's it 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.500
 I'm talking to you a little bit 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.289
 precisely of this this series which 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.479
 arrive every week i'm going to do the 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.910
 Tuesday night or Wednesday night it depends 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.100
 Availabilities 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.300
 I 'll do the black of the week in 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.289
 stream and in speed run so I'm going 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.430
 tell you right now this mine 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.220
 ch warlock doing you 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.930
 to go super simple I do not think they 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.220
 have simpler in black at speed run I 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.250
 think she's really done for that 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.539
 that black night and then so here 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.370
 every week I'll make you this little 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.979
 speed run live on twitter 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.240
 and so afterwards I'll make you 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.590
 again like the chanterelle or 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.570
 do the video just for those 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.830
 who did not follow him on twitter and 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.789
 who still want to see that again so I 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.810
 think it's a good idea to hunt 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.320
 to the judges because a lot of people 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.120
 asked me 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.099
 fed gold and the solo mood be done and 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.169
 redone the solo numbers it will have been 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.310
 very redundant to redo the blacks 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.289
 solution I already made you a series 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.690
 tips and tricks i already made you 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.639
 a solo black series and so on 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.650
 so there I think that speed run is not 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.090
 wrong and at the same time I will try to 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.639
 you claude it every week on tuesday 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.960
 on wednesday by which on thursday like that 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.159
 where it would rain all the rest of the 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.849
 week if you want to try to me 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.229
 beat it can be nice 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.120
 if you have the gameplay at hand 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.159
 even better so kind if you the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.870
 do on ps4 or xbox match and that 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.880
 you can directly but from your 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.789
 gameplay on youtube so if you are 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.120
 beat it for nothing was to be 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.380
 come and put me some style stuff 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.389
 once we did three minutes orks and 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.850
 mythos yes me I if you put a 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.410
 figure I will not give importance if 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.810
 you put a figure for example and 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.610
 in the comment you put yourself 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.690
 put a number on your time and on 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.970
 your channel you put your video 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.199
 especially did not put the link in 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.699
 the comment otherwise you will you 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.960
 make your comment is going to be 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.229
 listed in spam and it will be 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.020
 not seen so put if you put your 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.340
 time and you put aside for example 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.600
 of your frozen weather on my channel and this 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.500
 moment I will see more I will make a 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:23.930
 turn to see knowing that here I am 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.060
 do my speed run without 1 me 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.919
 spoil life by spending three days 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.199
 to really have a second 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.910
 to scrounge I do as soon as I do a 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.110
 good time and I'm not winged what 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.300
 was on me with me on twitter you 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.580
 you certify it as soon as I did 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.900
 my first but my first thing at 5.49 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.330
 and I did not even try to beat myself 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.789
 I said go it's good it's folded 5049 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.800
 we send it's done, I'm done 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:46.520
 story I could have said very well 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.500
 and I can do better 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.660
 jean sleeve and go there to do 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.400
 five minutes twenty five minutes 25 years 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.070
 in something like that I would have 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.900
 but I do not want to ruin the 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.430
 life if I do that it's really for 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.770
 for that anyway there are people who 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.690
 can limit me to beat take advantage of it 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.669
 because this week's one of speed 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.169
 run this black night is pretty simple that 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.610
 will not always be like that if there are 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.250
 blacks that are much more complicated 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:11.930
 so here you go 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.729
 so that's it so I hope waiting for that 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.610
 this little this little concept is you going 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.050
 like 5039 I'm still not bad 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.419
 proud of that time because I would have 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.440
 could do I could have done I could have done 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.870
 to know because I have done well 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.160
 worse and yes yes as I forgot 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.729
 to clarify it's really a matter 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.900
 from stock 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:27.979
 frankly if you do not have the stuff 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.150
 to make it's speed run lodges in 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:30.349
 lost it 's not the increase free said 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.180
 I do not think I did that time 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.860
 this is really the coffee lake snipe 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.210
 coffee everything change what in the night 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.260
 black I would not have had that style 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.690
 I would never have done a time like that 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.430
 so here I hope that concept you 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.360
 like this video you liked and me for 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.770
 my part I simply tell you the 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.820
 next time for a next video 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.820
 go ciao bye
