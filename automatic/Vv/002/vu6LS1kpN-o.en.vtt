00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.820
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.469
 nonsense shock but she today I 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.900
 offers you a tomato pie 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.330
 cherries and goats super colorful 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.570
 scented with a short pastry with herbs 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.950
 home a real treat it's gone then 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.750
 we will start by preparing the dough 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.399
 broken super simple house you take 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.950
 a big bowl you put the flour 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.440
 you do a little and then we add the 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.480
 soft butter and water is then you 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.340
 go mix starting with the 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.840
 center and bring back the flour as you go 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.040
 and here is so you can 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.899
 work with a spatula if you want 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.670
 at the beginning or by hand as you want 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.410
 once you get your dough 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.480
 you can add oregano 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.969
 herbs of provence or other herbs 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.859
 no matter how much you change a little 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.149
 little bit of everything and so here is the dough 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.699
 you use it right away either you 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.469
 place it in the fridge until then 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.929
 we will take care of the tomatoes so you 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.579
 wash them well leave you at home and you 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.170
 just go cut them all 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.239
 so I made a mix of 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.530
 yellow and red cherry tomatoes 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.810
 wallasch rex bring a touch 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.340
 nice enough color then we resume 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.540
 the broken dough I had put it to 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.189
 fresh time to cut tomatoes 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.619
 cherries you flour and the plan of 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.810
 work and you go the state them with 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.490
 your hands so for to start and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 then you will display it with a 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.810
 rolling pin so think of well 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.820
 flour and regularly for not that she 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.860
 glue too much here you spread it yourself 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.689
 make a big circle measure yourself the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.490
 size of your dish to be sure that 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.560
 it goes in and then to take 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.570
 the dough you're going rolled up as you go 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.430
 measure on your roll for comes the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 gently place in your dish 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 pie 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.560
 so with the help of a knife you go 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.939
 coming months remove excess dough 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.619
 managed to form a ball I spread it to 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.030
 new and in fact I did not want to lose 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.530
 So what was left I took a little 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 take it out there I think it was 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.329
 radeef form if I'm not mistaken and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.240
 here I made many small shapes 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.320
 for well decorated in fact all around 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.119
 so now you are going to take 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 your pretty little shapes and you're going 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.380
 just come and drop them all around 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.909
 pressing a little bit in the squeeze 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.679
 good for it to be well paste 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.229
 eventually you can add a 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.330
 little bit of milk for the gilding 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.430
 it does not spoil an egg yolk me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.410
 I like to use while milk then 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.319
 will take care of the rest of the pie so 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 you and go in the background 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.499
 the strong mustard you can also 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.579
 use of mustard that 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.829
 is very good with 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.139
 then we will add the small ones 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.090
 slices of chefs including goat cheese 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.920
 pitfalls is simply so you 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.510
 wallpaper the bottom and after you go 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 come add the cherry tomatoes in 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.739
 alternation yellow red starting with 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.879
 outside to come to the center 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.280
 once you're done with the tomatoes 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.030
 cherries we will add a little salt from 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.099
 pepper 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.810
 and we finish with some more 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.359
 small and so I added some 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.120
 the oregano so we put it all in the oven at 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.750
 mid-height at 190 Â° for about 35 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.389
 minutes 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.760
 in fact your broken dough all around 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.669
 must be browning the cherry tomatoes 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.579
 should be stewed and slightly 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:05.949
 melting and there these loans to them again 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.829
 we ate it with green salad 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:11.769
 for the evening it's very good it's not 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.859
 too heavy it's super good and mixing 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.389
 sweet tomatoes with melting goat cheese 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.469
 and the touch of mustard 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.340
 below it's just too good in 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.229

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.209
