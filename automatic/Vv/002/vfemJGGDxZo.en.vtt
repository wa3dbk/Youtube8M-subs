00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.870
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.520
 tutorial on how to download a samper 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.259
 or three weeks 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.240
 well let's start the first thing that we have to 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.739
 to do is to download the one to be left 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.739
 in the description of the video 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.710
 you need to underestimate others for 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 look but it goes wrong and you will be wrong 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 It helps us to be singing what you feel 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
 and they will talk about other things they will do rap 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.010
 truth or sound and others I what 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 I discard because I lose against one 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 I do not rule out 306 and I give strong to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 bid and you give it strong and try 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.489
 me me me is well aware 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 every toy here or more here envy is 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.690
 what leads to criticize what I do 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.000
 but because he insists so much if you think 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.039
 shit every thing I sing and you do not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 like my audience because it pays attention 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.380
 to what I say listen to my muscles after 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.000
 a hole will leave a file with its 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.000
 internal 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.230
 take children out like 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.480
 now we look for the folder of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.050
 salad in my case I have it in the 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.050
 desk 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.100
 we give it install and we hope that if 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 like 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.970
 to the doors 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.210
 I do not do it 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.920
 send the letter 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.170
 more they want to divert and provoke 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.580
 tension to tighten and dismantle 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.580
 they are very crappy with him 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.080
 the requirement of a tutorial on how to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.080
 use and all that I like do not forget
