about<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.039> change<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.119> could<00:00:21.300> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.380

so<00:02:23.440> on<00:02:23.560> paper<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:24.370> new<00:02:24.580> car<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.000> half<00:02:25.270> a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
so on paper this new car is half a

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.120 
so on paper this new car is half a
second<00:02:25.720> quicker<00:02:25.810> than<00:02:26.350> they<00:02:26.440> all<00:02:26.590> came<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.860> s

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
second quicker than they all came and s

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.230 
second quicker than they all came and s
but<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.400> doesn't<00:02:27.700> tell<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.060> whole<00:02:28.090> story

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
but that doesn't tell the whole story

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.830 
but that doesn't tell the whole story
because<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> road<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:31.180> feels<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:31.810> much

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
because on the road it feels so much

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.990 
because on the road it feels so much
quicker<00:02:32.260> much<00:02:32.620> more<00:02:33.400> punchy<00:02:33.760> through<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
quicker much more punchy through the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.030 
quicker much more punchy through the
mid-range<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.720> cleaner<00:02:35.320> response<00:02:35.770> on<00:02:35.890> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
mid-range a cleaner response on the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.560 
mid-range a cleaner response on the
throttle<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.580> from<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.820> direct<00:02:37.060> injection

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
throttle with from the direct injection

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:46.290 
throttle with from the direct injection
and<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.780> soundtrack<00:02:38.110> is<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:38.770> much<00:02:39.010> throatier

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.760 

now<00:02:47.300> if<00:02:47.360> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.540> bind<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.750> new<00:02:47.930> engine<00:02:48.350> with

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
now if you can bind the new engine with

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220 
now if you can bind the new engine with

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
the PDK gearbox you get the option of

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.330 
the PDK gearbox you get the option of
launch<00:02:51.470> control<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:52.970> works

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
launch control this is how it works

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.570 
launch control this is how it works
