here in math question what potassium is
larger<00:01:57.240> than<00:01:57.420> sodium<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.530> reason<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.009> that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
larger than sodium the reason for that

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.179 
larger than sodium the reason for that
is<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.909> radius<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.659> potassium<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.590> bigger

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
is the radius of the potassium is bigger

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.630 
is the radius of the potassium is bigger
than<00:02:02.399> sodium<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.689> while<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.649> radius<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.490> be

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
than sodium but while the radius will be

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.999

about the bond created by the potassium
through<00:03:09.510> election<00:03:10.110> activity<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.890> can<00:03:11.040> easily

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
through election activity we can easily

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.280 
through election activity we can easily
know<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.700> without<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.480> bound<00:03:12.720> which<00:03:13.110> is

know that without the bound which is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.200 
know that without the bound which is
very<00:03:13.530> stable<00:03:13.770> with<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.640> character<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> the

performance<00:06:53.099> of<00:06:53.339> its<00:06:53.519> products<00:06:54.089> so<00:06:54.749> it<00:06:55.079> is

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:55.349 
performance of its products so it is

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.169 
performance of its products so it is
